            <li>It&#x27;s like a hot orange/red and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>As with most Vinylux colors I&#x27;ve tried, it stays put and stands up to just about everything!</li>
            <li>Beautiful color, goes on really smooth</li>

            <li>I love this brand of nail polish.</li>
            <li>I love this product and this color is just like OPI Cajun shrimp</li>
            <li>so if you love that color you will love this one.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of nail polish.</li>
            <li>No ultra violet light required or a tip!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite colors to wear.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say, I like the Vinylux line way better than the gel.</li>
            <li>Love the color and love the polish.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff...stays on without chipping just as promised.  </li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>I have more of a fall/winter coloring</li>
            <li>The color was fantastic though!</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>this is a very stunning coral color (although I thought I was purchasing a bright red).  </li>
            <li>Arrived on my doorstep very quickly</li>
            <li>It got here very fast which was nice.</li>
            <li>and then the tips start to show significant wear and tear.  </li>
            <li>It is a bright coral, not even remotely red as the picture suggests.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I do not ever get a full week of wear without chips.  </li>
            <li>I have the full CND Shellac system</li>
            <li>love this color and the CND Vinylux whole line.</li>
            <li>These polishes are very nice to apply and dry super quick</li>
            <li>FUN color, really bright, especially for toes -</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty but not what is in the picture.</li>
            <li>Love Vinylux - easy to paint on, dries quick, lasts a long time without chipping!</li>
            <li>and so I chose not to return the polish since it wasn&#x27;t worth the time/money.</li>
            <li>honestly cannot say ENOUGH PRAISE about CND!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great nail polish that lasts at least one week, but most of the time 2-3 weeks (if you&#x27;re not tough on your hands).</li>
            <li>Very happy with this; seems to wear well, and the Vinylux formula really is a little different than &amp;#34;plain polishes/enamels&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>So, so pretty.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this product</li>
            <li>Definitely use the top coat as well to seal the color in.</li>
            <li>Colors are diversifified ans pretty.</li>
            <li>people are constantly remarking about  my lovely nails.....</li>
            <li>pretty amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>only use the protective CND Vinylux top coat that  absolutely RENEWS the SHINE..</li>
            <li>Love how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>I have been using theses polishes once to twice a week for the past month or two with good results.  </li>
            <li>Applied, I don&#x27;t really see much</li>
            <li>Mine tended to look dull quickly if I skimped on the top coat.</li>
            <li>the Vinylu line, it applies easily (a tiny bit of bubbling for me with this color), dries super fast, and lasts.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, shine last and it lasts</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast drying and the colors are very clear, not muddy at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fun shade of red.</li>
            <li>I have pale skin with pink undertones, and this works well as a bright, vibratnt pinky-red shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not this stuff stays on until you want it to come off and much easier on the nails than shellac comes off wih regular nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>It lasts so much longer than regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>This polish isn&#x27;t any better than a basic polishâ€¦still chips off in a few days.</li>
            <li>CND Vinylux is the only thing to use for a professional looking manicure.</li>
            <li>I love this polish, it will last at least a week, I usually get a few days more.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t appear too pink on my toes and went with every outfit I wore for the fourth of July.  </li>

            <li> usually about 7 to 10 days.</li>
            <li> and my toes get lots of hard wear in sandals and shoes.</li>
            <li> Poor coverage, even after two coats.</li>
            <li> Afraid I&#x27;m going to give up my manicures and do it myself with this.</li>
            <li> I am frustrated because I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased the color if I had known the return/exchange process was so cumbersome and the color so unlike the website&#x27;s image.</li>

            <li> This is a coral red color.  Good for spring, summer, and fall.  It&#x27;s one of my favorite colors to wear.  These polishes are very nice to apply and dry super quick HOWEVER, I do not ever get a full week of wear without chips.  All of my Vinylux polishes last about three days without chips and then the tips start to show significant wear and tear.  I have been using theses polishes once to twice a week for the past month or two with good results.  I have the full CND Shellac system and I have to say, I like the Vinylux line way better than the gel.</li>

Very happy with this; seems to wear well, and the Vinylux formula really is a little different than &amp;#34;plain polishes/enamels&amp;#34;.  CND products generally don&#x27;t let me down.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff...stays on without chipping just as promised.  I&#x27;m hooked.  Afraid I&#x27;m going to give up my manicures and do it myself with this.</li>
            <li> Love this color. It goes on the same color shown in picture. Good coverage and mani lasts 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Poor coverage, even after two coats.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was concerned that I wouldn&#x27;t like this color.  I have more of a fall/winter coloring so I was worried about the &amp;#34;pinkish&amp;#34; comments I read.  When I received the bottle it looks perfectly &amp;#34;Lobster Roll&amp;#34;.  I too, thought it was going to be too pinky.  After I applied it, I couldn&#x27;t take my eyes off from it.  So, so pretty.  It really doesn&#x27;t appear too pink on my toes and went with every outfit I wore for the fourth of July.  Lots of red, white and blue clothes.  Applied, I don&#x27;t really see much pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very nice polish.  I&#x27;ve never had staying power like this, but I did purchase the sticky base and the top coat as well.  Its been over a week and my toes still look as those I just let the manicurist.  This is my first time trying this product and frankly I don&#x27;t feel I need to find another brand.  This Vinylux polish is dreamy.</li>
            <li> This polish isn&#x27;t any better than a basic polishâ€¦still chips off in a few days. The color was fantastic though!</li>
            <li> This color is nothing like the image on the site. It is a bright coral, not even remotely red as the picture suggests. Return shipping and a re-stocking fee are covered by the buyer and so I chose not to return the polish since it wasn&#x27;t worth the time/money. I am frustrated because I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased the color if I had known the return/exchange process was so cumbersome and the color so unlike the website&#x27;s image.</li>
            <li> This polish definitely lasts longer than traditional polish but not as long as advertised. The color is great though! Definitely use the top coat as well to seal the color in. Mine tended to look dull quickly if I skimped on the top coat.</li>
            <li> It to all! It is an excellent product  and is priced so all can afford . Colors are diversifified ans pretty.</li>
            <li> It got here very fast which was nice. The color is very pretty but not what is in the picture. It is pink not a bright red like you would think.</li>
            <li> Love Vinylux - easy to paint on, dries quick, lasts a long time without chipping!</li>
            <li> CND is THE BEST nail polish EVER...!!! I have had regular weekly  manicure for at least 35 years and NOW this non-chip polish enables me to go  only 2X a month.!!!! My nails look PERFECT!!!  (I NEVER have to touch-up  my nails in between manicures.(DOES NOT CHIP) ...only use the protective CND Vinylux top coat that  absolutely RENEWS the SHINE.. 1X... a week later....as if I had JUST HAD A MANICURE!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hands are in water, constant &amp;#34;home maintenance&amp;#34;...never wear rubber gloves, and am always fixing and repairing around my house.....they get a WORKOUT!....Since I changed to CND polish...people are constantly remarking about  my lovely nails.....pretty amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I honestly cannot say ENOUGH PRAISE about CND!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color and stays on well.  I love it.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
