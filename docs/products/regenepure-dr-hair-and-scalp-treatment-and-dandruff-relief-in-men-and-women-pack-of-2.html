            <li>if your hair starts thinning go to a doctor right away.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was hesitant because of the price at first, but with these results it has been worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It does not completely solve my scalp issue, but I&#x27;ve kept using it because it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far after trying countless others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shampoo first and let it set while I bathe and shave.</li>
            <li>then sure enough</li>
            <li>/&gt;Also, be ready to use some conditioner, this is a very drying shampoo!</li>

            <li> But I went on the hunt for a new antidandruff shampoo when my hairstylist suggested finding one without sulfates, which are especially harsh on my coarse, curly hair.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I can tell you that the active ingredient has helped get ride of the itchy scalp from all the time in hockey gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> equate brand product (less money) and my dermatologist gave me a med called spironolactone.  </li>
            <li> This is not true.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with rogain foam (1/day) and my hair loss not only stopped but grew thicker in the areas where it had begun to thin.</li>
            <li> and  anything to help slow it down or even prevent it.  </li>
            <li> No matter what shampoo I tried in the past, I could never get rid of my dandruff.</li>
            <li> It just takes a small amount about the size of a quarter.</li>
            <li> This stuff dried the heck out of my hair and if anything has hastened my hair loss!</li>
            <li> I have been using it to help slow my hair loss</li>
            <li> _may_ help slow or prevent hair loss, but I can&#x27;t swear to that.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I don&#x27;t take it for granted anymore and use it every other day.    </li>
            <li> I was having serious issues with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> So disappointed as I was looking for a larger size Nizoral, which at least guarantees 1% ketoconazole.</li>
            <li> for their hair to thin with age....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned, this is not a 16 ounce bottle but two 8 ounce bottles instead, and they will come from Amazon fulfillment sloppily packaged.</li>
            <li> I had to settle for Head &amp; Shoulders, which usually got rid of the worst of the flakes for a day or two as long as I didn&#x27;t touch or scratch my scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would feel guilty if I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars that they deserve.</li>
            <li> Her dandruff was so bad the skin hurt.  </li>

            <li> The shampoo is ok. It does not completely solve my scalp issue, but I&#x27;ve kept using it because it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far after trying countless others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, this is not a 16 ounce bottle but two 8 ounce bottles instead, and they will come from Amazon fulfillment sloppily packaged. One of mine had a cap unscrewed before they were sealed in plastic together and tossed in a mailer, so during shipping a significant amount of the product leaked out, coating both bottles and the inside of the packaging. Luckily I could smell it from about a mile away while it was still in my mailbox, so I had some idea what I was getting into and managed not to get the shampoo all over everything I own when I opened the package. So only order if you are comfortable paying this price for about 12 oz in 2 bottles instead of 16 oz in 1 bottle, and then if they somehow arrive intact then you can be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Says it contains 1% ketoconazole. This is not true. It is listed as one ingredient of many, a telltale sign of false advertising in a homeopathic product (which of course never work). Will be requesting a refund. So disappointed as I was looking for a larger size Nizoral, which at least guarantees 1% ketoconazole.</li>
            <li> Seems to stabilize hair problems. But do not neglect your diet</li>
            <li> This and the NT shampoo make a great pair to trade off day-to-day. I use this and follow it with the Nioxin system 2 conditioner to add a bit of fullness. My hair feels healthy and soft. I bought this and the NT shampoo to maybe have a shot at preventing hair loss so I can&#x27;t report on if that&#x27;s working just yet. I haven&#x27;t lost any hair since I&#x27;ve been using it so hopefully it will keep things that way. Either way, it&#x27;s pretty good shampoo.</li>
            <li> Does the job of a shampoo but better.</li>
            <li> No matter what shampoo I tried in the past, I could never get rid of my dandruff. I had to settle for Head &amp; Shoulders, which usually got rid of the worst of the flakes for a day or two as long as I didn&#x27;t touch or scratch my scalp. But I went on the hunt for a new antidandruff shampoo when my hairstylist suggested finding one without sulfates, which are especially harsh on my coarse, curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Regenepure DR has worked miracles on my scalp. It no longer feels dry and itchy, it&#x27;s completely free of dandruff, and I can go 3 to 4 days without shampooing (ideal for my hair type) without a single flake - even if I scratch my head. My scalp even smells different. For 20 years I&#x27;ve put up with a head full of flakes, and after just a few shampoos they disappeared completely. I do not exaggerate when I call this a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant because of the price at first, but with these results it has been worth every penny. I started out with the 8oz. bottle to see if it worked for me (it took 3 or 4 shampoos), and now I buy the two packs. It costs the same per ounce, but I don&#x27;t have to order it as often.</li>
            <li> This shampoo invigorates your scalp.  The peppermint makes you feel fresh and awake.  The ingredients are not harsh or harmful and leaves your hair feeling light and soft.  I have been using it to help slow my hair loss and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Ordered and paid  for the 16oz size, received the 8oz size.  $25 lost, beware.</li>
            <li> I would normally not write a review, but I am writing for two reasons. One, this product is as decent as it says(using it over a year). Two, the customer service is even better than the product itself. I had a little issue with shipping, but once I contacted, everything was taken care of within 24 hours in the best way I imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would feel guilty if I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars that they deserve.</li>
            <li> My hair is prone to getting dry anyway and has a lot of texture.  I bought this to help with hair loss but I couldn&#x27;t really say whether it helps with that or not, as I can&#x27;t continue with it.  It also smells a bit funky.  I gave away the extra bottle.</li>
            <li> I love it my hair felt thicker immediately. It felt softer and so much body. The ingredients are conditioning for my colored hair.</li>
            <li> I used combination of this shampoo and Kirkland Minoxidil topical solution. In beginning I shed hair a lot but from 2nd month, my hair become fuller and thicker. I think it really stops making DHT on hair follicles.</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s great. Considering what you get, it&#x27;s a good value. It&#x27;s packed with good stuff. My scalp feels loved whenever I use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found that stops my dandruff.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it works, for me, so I&#x27;ll keep buying it.  I tend to only use it a couple times a week, and when I do use it, I wash my hair with my normal shampoo first, then put this stuff on and let it sit and soak my scalp.  Because of the price, i would recommend trying one of the smaller bottles first since it seems from other reviewers they didn&#x27;t have any luck.  As far as the hair loss I can&#x27;t help ya, I&#x27;m 34 with a full head of hair still.</li>
            <li> I started using regenepure about a 8 moths ago. I was having serious issues with thinning hair. I just thought it was stress and couldn&#x27;t do anything about it. I started doing research and found out that I didn&#x27;t really need to start trying to regrow hair I just needed it to stop falling out. It took about a month of using it every other day and I started seeing results. It just takes a small amount about the size of a quarter. Don&#x27;t expect a lot of suds. I shampoo first and let it set while I bathe and shave. Shampoo sets for about 10 minutes then rinse. It has a tingling feeling after the rinse and a nice smell. The best thing about it is the results. I kind of took it for granted and stopped using it for a couple of weeks then sure enough I started seeing a lot more hair on the towel. Needless to say I don&#x27;t take it for granted anymore and use it every other day.    Thank you for Regenepure</li>
            <li> Some good stuff.  Really helps to regrow hair.</li>
            <li> No issues with shipping or the product itself.  100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. It made my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li> I had hoped it would be like Nizoral, since that is currently unavailable, but it&#x27;s actually a harsher product.  Frizzies!!  However, it does do well on dandruff and got rid of my kid&#x27;s scalp issues.  Her dandruff was so bad the skin hurt.  So... good enough for now.</li>
            <li> I am 43 yr old...and I dont know if stress, over processing of highlighting my hair, or pre-menopause was causing my hair to fall out.  I was besides myself.  This shampoo made my hair feel thicker and even made my head stop feeling a burning feeling I felt.  I also started using mens menoxidil I bought it from walmart.....equate brand product (less money) and my dermatologist gave me a med called spironolactone.  Guess what?  my hair stopped falling out!!!!  This shampoo really helps and if your hair starts thinning go to a doctor right away.....I have continued with the shampoo and menoxidil only took the meds for 6 months.....I started seeing results within 2-3 months......It is normal for women....for their hair to thin with age....(those darn hormones!) so we have to do everything and  anything to help slow it down or even prevent it.  Try the shampoo.</li>
            <li> He said it left his hair FLAT. and do take note, the 16oz is just 2 8oz bottles... but he says it&#x27;s pretty decent...</li>
            <li> It worked for my dandruff. It did absolutely nothing for my hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;My doctor said I can get the same thing for much cheaper and that it is</li>
            <li> This stuff dried the heck out of my hair and if anything has hastened my hair loss! Would not recommend this product.</li>

            <li> Good stuff, I don&#x27;t have dandruff but I use this to help with any hair loss. I use this in conjunction with rogain foam (1/day) and my hair loss not only stopped but grew thicker in the areas where it had begun to thin.</li>
            <li> Good anti-dandruff and itch shampoo. I play a lot of sports, and I use it for the anti-fungal and itch properties. Wearing helmets for hockey and biking a lot, my doc recommended a shampoo to help defend my skin against the crud that you&#x27;re inevitably exposed to from equipment and locker rooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE: I do not endorse this as a &amp;#34;hair loss&amp;#34; product. It _may_ help slow or prevent hair loss, but I can&#x27;t swear to that. I can tell you that the active ingredient has helped get ride of the itchy scalp from all the time in hockey gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be ready to use some conditioner, this is a very drying shampoo!</li>
