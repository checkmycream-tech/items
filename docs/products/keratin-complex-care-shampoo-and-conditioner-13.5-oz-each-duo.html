            <li>Love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner!!</li>
            <li>This product was shipped very quickly, and in good condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the shampoo kind of has a funky smell to it, but not horrible.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and my hair gets really soft and detangled.</li>
            <li>have made it so easy to maintain!</li>
            <li>One of our favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love to reorder through here</li>
            <li>I had been using the Matrix Sleek shampoo/conditioner for a while and while I love it, I wanted a change</li>
            <li>/&gt;conditioner is ok.</li>
            <li>and I love that one too</li>
            <li>I really love the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>The products prevent freeze and make my hair look healthy.</li>
            <li>Both the top of the shampoo and conditioner came sealed so no spillage would occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even in humid damp weather my hair still looks better than before.</li>
            <li>Works even better if you use it after getting a keratin treatment .</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great purchase, always love doing business here.</li>
            <li>I was fairly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>Love the ease and styling these products help with my course hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>But still works much better than CoCo products i&#x27;ve been using before</li>
            <li>MUCH better than any Paul Mitchell product.</li>
            <li>so I use it to help my hair get the most out of my treatment</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>Glad I had ordered it and came when I needed it.</li>
            <li>Ok so I have been getting keratin treatment for my hair for the longest time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, did it&#x27;s job in smoothing my hair after i used it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so soft and super shiny - smells great too!  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is pretty good</li>
            <li>There are others free sodium products that do a much better job, but it works.</li>
            <li>i purchased these two items after hearing so much about how good keratin is for your hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling like I&#x27;ve never felt it before it had a beautiful shine, body, stronger than before with no dry scalp.</li>
            <li>so in my case this product works just fine..</li>
            <li>well I was thrilled with all the positive reviews here, it may be just not for me, i had a keratin treatment at salon two months ago</li>
            <li>I even examined the bottle to determine whether it is genuine, and it appears to be.</li>
            <li>While it is sodium chloride free</li>
            <li>IT IS NOT SULPHATE FREE.</li>
            <li>The conditioner I tend to leave in for a few minutes to allow the product to work at its best (per the instructions on the bottle anway).</li>
            <li>So far, I have nothing but good things to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(since it doesnt smell good) but my keratin barely lasted 3 months!...</li>
            <li>I purchased these locally first time around, but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores when I needed more.  </li>
            <li>I was very positive!</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, manageable and clean.</li>
            <li>I had the Keratin Treatment 2 years ago and bought this shampoo/conditioner the same day and had beautiful, straight hair everytime with just air drying.</li>
            <li>I did not have the full Keratin Treatment at the salon, but my stylist encouraged me to get these</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves my hair super clean after just one application.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and fine and this stuff works great!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched back to this without getting the treatment done and it is back to being AWESOME!</li>
            <li>Love how this shampoo and conditioner work together to make my keratin treated hair so soft and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner not only smell great but leave your hair incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I had a Keratin treatment on my hair and my mother in law suggested L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free</li>
            <li>and they said the same thing, they LOVE It!</li>
            <li>That being said, my hair still feels just as soft as it does when I use some of my favorite conditioners.</li>
            <li>Hair feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Initially I was thrilled with the idea of my \\&quot;free\\&quot; high-end sulfate-free shampoo (after a year of the Organix Morroccan Argan Oil shampoo</li>
            <li>I then went to my local Ulta and was able to talk to the salon manager who had worked as an educator in that field for 15 years, and she told me that I would be better off using a completely sulfate free shampoo &amp; conditioner no matter what that company tells me.</li>
            <li>after a few days of using this shampoo/conditioner my hair is so soft and easy to straighten!the smell is pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li>I tend to have thick oily hair so having a product that works this well and smells great is quite rare!</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo and conditioner combo that keeps my hair clean and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>Shipped right on time.</li>
            <li>After spending $300 on the treatment and waiting over 3 full days to wash my hair, I wanted to make sure I did everything possible to maintain my treatment</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past with great results.  </li>
            <li>I just thought that before I bought this, I should&#x27;ve read the product and the photo first</li>
            <li>Even though it costs considerably more, I will be going back to Kerastase products.</li>
            <li>its not the first time i use shampoo with keratin...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was the first wash I did after doing the treatment</li>
            <li>One year I do keratin and first one I bought in the prestige hair saloon in nyc</li>
            <li>First of all product received is NOT product in the photo.</li>
            <li>and if it eventually \\&quot;builds-up\\&quot; so that it looks that much better by using it daily.</li>
            <li>Finally, this is a better price than in the salon.</li>
            <li>most people whose hair was treated with the Coppolla keratin, I was told sulfate-free shampoos only.</li>
            <li>This stuff does the trick smoothing my hair and making it really shiny!</li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair silky soft, shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>My hair was very manageable, soft and easy to brush after the wash.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do what a real keratin treatment does, but it does leave my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have very curly unruly hair, and I felt like it gave it a good shine after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I feel it has makes my hair more dry.</li>
            <li>She liked Wen (which I was using previous to getting the treatment).</li>
            <li>that for me, the cost and potential harm, is not at all worth the marginal increase in results from the full treatment.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I have done sooo much to my hair</li>
            <li>butthis one is really the worste shampoo and conditioner i ever use..</li>
            <li>so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>The items were packaged very well,.  </li>
            <li>because when I put this shampoo in my hand it looked very thin!!!!Anyway</li>
            <li>The shampoo seemed very watery, and both bottles had the barcode blacked out with sharpie.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair very silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>The real stuff does not do this.</li>
            <li>I am livid the picture clearly shows Copolla keratin shampoo and conditioner and when it came its some knock off brand!!!  </li>
            <li>In the minute or two it was on my hair it stripped all the natural oil right out of it.</li>
            <li>sure if i can tell the any difference between these and other drugstore brand</li>
            <li>Well, after a few months the keratin treatment had worn off and I was faced with a bit more time blowing and straightening and not quite getting that pretty sleek look that I had after the treatment.</li>
            <li>Every time I use them (I normally just use my warehouse-size Dove shampoo and am fine with that) and follow with a blowout and/or flat iron, it looks far better than with my everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li>I just tried it one time and wow!!</li>
            <li>has so far made my hair almost completely straight.</li>
            <li>I usually use Matrix Biolage Deep Smoothening shampoo and conditioner, and I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>I am someone who normally wants everything thing as pure and organic as possible, but for this, I make an exception.</li>
            <li>I am a product junkie, and was looking for a new shampoo/conditioner to switch things up a bit.</li>
            <li>It rinses cleanly and quickly, leaving behind just simply manageable, clean and shiny hair.</li>
            <li>I can only imagine how many customers&#x27; expensive treatments washed out after using this product...sending them right back to the salon for more keratin.</li>
            <li>I have naturally, very-curly hair!</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t have exactly the same effect as the treatment</li>
            <li>I think these are fake or older versions of what should be a good product.</li>
            <li>it definitely makes my hair more &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I had the keratin smoothing treatment done last year (prior to the recent controversial information that has emerged) and I purchased only the shampoo at the time.</li>
            <li>but the shampoo is too drying and harsh on my fine textured hair.</li>
            <li>So yes, the company behind our amazing salon keratin treatments also includes sulfates in its corresponding \\&quot;keratin care\\&quot; shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have natural curly, frizzy hair and these products</li>
            <li>Anyway, I am using it now and so far I have no problem with the product.</li>
            <li>They sent me one year old shampoo.</li>
            <li>LOVE KERATIN Complex.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, somewhat frizzy Italian hair and the treatment</li>
            <li>It cleans well, but my natural frizz comes through too well.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length silver/blonde hair, and a Brazilian Blowout was really the only way to have it not look like frizzy, old-lady hair...until I started using this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone requiring extra moisture in their hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I like it, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything that special about it that differentiates it from other similar brands.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I used it after doign a keratin treatment which leaves my hair so so soft but combined with this - its has the opposite affect.</li>
            <li>She suggests using only professional beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>Normally my treatement lasts almost six months which i have heard its really long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this shampoo and conditioner on several occasions, but the last time I ordered this set, something was clearly off about the product.</li>
            <li>and i wanted to keep the result as long as i could  because Keratin give me a hair that i always dreamed of shiny and soft</li>
            <li>but i m not sure if it is worth of money.</li>
            <li>The shampoo rinses clean with one wash, no matter how long or thick your hair is.</li>

            <li> I purchased these locally first time around, but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores when I needed more.  </li>
            <li> I was very positive!</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, manageable and clean.</li>
            <li> I had the Keratin Treatment 2 years ago and bought this shampoo/conditioner the same day and had beautiful, straight hair everytime with just air drying.</li>
            <li> I did not have the full Keratin Treatment at the salon, but my stylist encouraged me to get these</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair super clean after just one application.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and fine and this stuff works great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched back to this without getting the treatment done and it is back to being AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Love how this shampoo and conditioner work together to make my keratin treated hair so soft and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner not only smell great but leave your hair incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I had a Keratin treatment on my hair and my mother in law suggested L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free</li>
            <li> and they said the same thing, they LOVE It!</li>
            <li> That being said, my hair still feels just as soft as it does when I use some of my favorite conditioners.</li>
            <li> Hair feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Initially I was thrilled with the idea of my \\&quot;free\\&quot; high-end sulfate-free shampoo (after a year of the Organix Morroccan Argan Oil shampoo</li>
            <li> I then went to my local Ulta and was able to talk to the salon manager who had worked as an educator in that field for 15 years, and she told me that I would be better off using a completely sulfate free shampoo &amp; conditioner no matter what that company tells me.</li>
            <li> after a few days of using this shampoo/conditioner my hair is so soft and easy to straighten!the smell is pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li> I tend to have thick oily hair so having a product that works this well and smells great is quite rare!</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner combo that keeps my hair clean and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Shipped right on time.</li>
            <li> After spending $300 on the treatment and waiting over 3 full days to wash my hair, I wanted to make sure I did everything possible to maintain my treatment</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past with great results.  </li>
            <li> I just thought that before I bought this, I should&#x27;ve read the product and the photo first</li>
            <li> Even though it costs considerably more, I will be going back to Kerastase products.</li>
            <li> its not the first time i use shampoo with keratin...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was the first wash I did after doing the treatment</li>
            <li> One year I do keratin and first one I bought in the prestige hair saloon in nyc</li>
            <li> First of all product received is NOT product in the photo.</li>
            <li> and if it eventually \\&quot;builds-up\\&quot; so that it looks that much better by using it daily.</li>
            <li> Finally, this is a better price than in the salon.</li>
            <li> most people whose hair was treated with the Coppolla keratin, I was told sulfate-free shampoos only.</li>
            <li> This stuff does the trick smoothing my hair and making it really shiny!</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair silky soft, shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very manageable, soft and easy to brush after the wash.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what a real keratin treatment does, but it does leave my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very curly unruly hair, and I felt like it gave it a good shine after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I feel it has makes my hair more dry.</li>
            <li> She liked Wen (which I was using previous to getting the treatment).</li>
            <li> that for me, the cost and potential harm, is not at all worth the marginal increase in results from the full treatment.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I have done sooo much to my hair</li>
            <li> butthis one is really the worste shampoo and conditioner i ever use..</li>
            <li> so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> The items were packaged very well,.  </li>
            <li> because when I put this shampoo in my hand it looked very thin!!!!Anyway</li>
            <li> The shampoo seemed very watery, and both bottles had the barcode blacked out with sharpie.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair very silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> The real stuff does not do this.</li>
            <li> I am livid the picture clearly shows Copolla keratin shampoo and conditioner and when it came its some knock off brand!!!  </li>
            <li> In the minute or two it was on my hair it stripped all the natural oil right out of it.</li>
            <li> sure if i can tell the any difference between these and other drugstore brand</li>
            <li> Well, after a few months the keratin treatment had worn off and I was faced with a bit more time blowing and straightening and not quite getting that pretty sleek look that I had after the treatment.</li>
            <li> Every time I use them (I normally just use my warehouse-size Dove shampoo and am fine with that) and follow with a blowout and/or flat iron, it looks far better than with my everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li> I just tried it one time and wow!!</li>
            <li> has so far made my hair almost completely straight.</li>
            <li> I usually use Matrix Biolage Deep Smoothening shampoo and conditioner, and I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> I am someone who normally wants everything thing as pure and organic as possible, but for this, I make an exception.</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie, and was looking for a new shampoo/conditioner to switch things up a bit.</li>
            <li> It rinses cleanly and quickly, leaving behind just simply manageable, clean and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine how many customers&#x27; expensive treatments washed out after using this product...sending them right back to the salon for more keratin.</li>
            <li> I have naturally, very-curly hair!</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t have exactly the same effect as the treatment</li>
            <li> I think these are fake or older versions of what should be a good product.</li>
            <li> it definitely makes my hair more &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I had the keratin smoothing treatment done last year (prior to the recent controversial information that has emerged) and I purchased only the shampoo at the time.</li>
            <li> but the shampoo is too drying and harsh on my fine textured hair.</li>
            <li> So yes, the company behind our amazing salon keratin treatments also includes sulfates in its corresponding \\&quot;keratin care\\&quot; shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have natural curly, frizzy hair and these products</li>
            <li> Anyway, I am using it now and so far I have no problem with the product.</li>
            <li> They sent me one year old shampoo.</li>
            <li> LOVE KERATIN Complex.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, somewhat frizzy Italian hair and the treatment</li>
            <li> It cleans well, but my natural frizz comes through too well.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length silver/blonde hair, and a Brazilian Blowout was really the only way to have it not look like frizzy, old-lady hair...until I started using this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone requiring extra moisture in their hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I like it, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything that special about it that differentiates it from other similar brands.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I used it after doign a keratin treatment which leaves my hair so so soft but combined with this - its has the opposite affect.</li>
            <li> She suggests using only professional beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> Normally my treatement lasts almost six months which i have heard its really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this shampoo and conditioner on several occasions, but the last time I ordered this set, something was clearly off about the product.</li>
            <li> and i wanted to keep the result as long as i could  because Keratin give me a hair that i always dreamed of shiny and soft</li>
            <li> but i m not sure if it is worth of money.</li>
            <li> The shampoo rinses clean with one wash, no matter how long or thick your hair is.</li>
            <li> If you color or blow dry this will take out the frizz and dry look and feeling, and will keep your hair soft, managable and shiny!</li>
            <li> It can be sketchy when purchasing a salon-only product from online as there are stories about false products being inserted into a similar-container, but I saved my original with a bit of the product leftover, and from what I can tell (without a lab in my home), it is the same product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake((((( At first it was very suspicious-</li>
            <li> This time it works no better at keeping my keratin-treated hair straight than the regular Pantene I use.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells a bit better, but is not as thick and creamy as the conditioners I usually like to use.</li>
            <li> I hung up from the phone call very skeptical because I have read countless articles on how sulphates OF ANY KIND damage your hair.</li>
            <li> I blow dry it with my fingers only, no flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft feeling but already seems to be getting a slight bit of curl back</li>
            <li> I have used it 3 times and it has left my hair so dry and frizzy - in a way it never was before.</li>
            <li> I have natural black hair</li>
            <li> but it left my scalp very dry.</li>
            <li> She also told me that regardless of what any salon tells you, keratin treatments DO MINOR DAMAGE to your hair.</li>
            <li> My son has long hair and does not like to brush it as often as he should.</li>
            <li> Seemed to dry my hair after my keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but i can definitely see the difference between this product and others i used before..</li>
            <li> I then followed up by calling the keratin complex (800) number and spoke to rep who told me that this particular set (the keratin care or smoothing therapy) does have sulphates, which he said will not hurt your keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> My hair is midway down my back.  </li>
            <li> ( like it&#x27;s not real hair)))))).</li>
            <li> Few months back I had a keratin treatment done to my hair, and the stylist recommended this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Keratin is widely advertised with this type of endorsement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> and I am upset that I spent money on this big bottles which will all go to waste.</li>
            <li> but after the first use i found my hair little dry and difficult to manage not like the day before when i was used just a baby shampoo as recommended by my hair stylist, i didnt want to write a review earlier , i said i have to give it a chance</li>
            <li> Just a little conditioner goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> All other shampoos purchased from other sellers and the salon had seal under.</li>
            <li> The reason that I purchased KERATIN Care was due to my condition of &amp;#34;Thinning Hair&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It keeps his hair from tangling as easily as other products.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and doesnt get frizzy, even though its very thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set on amazon after having a coppola keratin complex smoothing treatment (3-5 month) at my local salon.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and thick.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s naturally thick, coarse, and wavy.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels healthier, but not weighed down.</li>
            <li> It also cut my drying time from 15 minutes to less than 5.</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> Their is no smell, like some other product I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> my thin wavy/curly hair was left a tangled frizzy mess).</li>
            <li> what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out (and my daughters) and faded my dye job.</li>
            <li> This is not like their other Smoothing Therapy Keratin Complex set.  </li>
            <li> so shocked at all the positive reviews this product received.</li>
            <li> People be careful!!!!</li>
            <li> I am not sure why.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is correct, but I guess I will not be ordering this from Amazon anymore.  </li>
            <li> I still have this one but not sure if I would use it by itself because of the drying condition.</li>
            <li> and im not sure if it was because i was not using this shampoo anymore</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the shampoo arrived and my reading the small print on the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have curly, hard to manage hair and have had Keratin treatments by my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> she said get Keratin Complex.</li>
            <li> others complained of feeling a dryness with the shampoo</li>
            <li> It read Keratin Complex on the label which I</li>
            <li> He uses the Keratin Complex shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but on Amazon it&#x27;s almost half price from retail stores.</li>
            <li> Anyway afraid that this shampoo can help to destroy all keratin on my hair and I will have to do it</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Seriously?!</li>
            <li> is nothing wrong with them</li>
            <li> i feel so sorry for the money i west</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I don&#x27;t think I need to spend another $300 plus on the smoothing treatment any time soon.</li>
            <li> , i feel like my keratin treatment wear off by this product, im very disappointed, may be this product just not for my hair may be it fits other hair type,</li>
            <li> Unused to get brazilian blowouts and then keratin treatments when I felt like the brazilians were too dangerous.</li>
            <li> It burned and itched so bad I had to get a prescription strength cream and pills to antihistamine to relieve it.  </li>
            <li> It burned and itched so bad I had to get a prescription strength cream and pills to antihistamine to relieve it.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a base to compare to.</li>
            <li> The reason I wanted to look is because the shampoo smelled so awful</li>
            <li> I understood it&#x27;s FAKE!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> One of our favorite shampoo. Love to reorder through here</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels healthier, but not weighed down. I did not have the full Keratin Treatment at the salon, but my stylist encouraged me to get these anyway and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner!! Worked wonders on my hair and I will be buying again! I have natural curly, frizzy hair and these products have made it so easy to maintain!</li>
            <li> I always bought the biggest bottle of the Coppola. I just wanted to try a smaller bottle this time. But to my surprise, I noticed that the bottle was not labeled as Coppola. I just thought that before I bought this, I should&#x27;ve read the product and the photo first that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t notice that the Coppola label was not indicated in the bottle. Anyway, I am using it now and so far I have no problem with the product. Next time I&#x27;ll be buying the biggest bottle again.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I had a Keratin treatment on my hair and my mother in law suggested L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free but it left my scalp very dry. My friend&#x27;s stylist suggested Coppola shampoo and conditioner so I tried it and my hair felt so AWESOME! It leaves your hair feeling like I&#x27;ve never felt it before it had a beautiful shine, body, stronger than before with no dry scalp. I&#x27;ve suggested this product to friends who have never had and don&#x27;t need a keratin treatment and they said the same thing, they LOVE It!</li>
            <li> The shampoo that I received did not match the shampoo that is in the picture. I am not sure why.</li>
            <li> I had the Keratin Treatment 2 years ago and bought this shampoo/conditioner the same day and had beautiful, straight hair everytime with just air drying. I have naturally, very-curly hair! After the treatment wore off about 8 months later I also ran out of the shampoo &amp; conditioner and switched back to my regular. My hair was frizzy and brittle-feeling in 1 day. I&#x27;ve switched back to this without getting the treatment done and it is back to being AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie, and was looking for a new shampoo/conditioner to switch things up a bit. I had been using the Matrix Sleek shampoo/conditioner for a while and while I love it, I wanted a change--I like to rotate through a couple different kinds. I have had a keratin treatment done before and it was amazing so I thought I&#x27;d try this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the shampoo kind of has a funky smell to it, but not horrible. I like the lather it creates and does a nice job cleaning my hair. The conditioner smells a bit better, but is not as thick and creamy as the conditioners I usually like to use. That being said, my hair still feels just as soft as it does when I use some of my favorite conditioners. I wouldn&#x27;t say that the product does a miraculous job of taming flyaways and frizz, but it is a good product. It doesn&#x27;t do what a real keratin treatment does, but it does leave my hair feeling soft and smooth. Overall, I like it, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything that special about it that differentiates it from other similar brands.</li>
            <li> Im so shocked at all the positive reviews this product received. I have used it 3 times and it has left my hair so dry and frizzy - in a way it never was before. I used it after doign a keratin treatment which leaves my hair so so soft but combined with this - its has the opposite affect. I will not be using it again and I am upset that I spent money on this big bottles which will all go to waste.</li>
            <li> they are rec by my hair stylist so i bought them as an after keratin treatment care product.&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo works well and it only require tiny amount of the product so i like that part.&lt;br /&gt;conditioner is ok. but not impressive.&lt;br /&gt;i m not sure if i can tell the any difference between these and other drugstore brand shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;there is nothing wrong with them but i m not sure if it is worth of money.</li>
            <li> I am livid the picture clearly shows Copolla keratin shampoo and conditioner and when it came its some knock off brand!!!  I want a full refund!!!!  I have a Copolla keratin treatment and want Copolla products not some knock off!!!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this brand and I&#x27;m very pleased! I got the keratin treatment and i had being using Morrocan oil and I love that one too but I wanted to make a change so my hair will not get use to the same. The smell is wonderful and my hair gets really soft and detangled.</li>
            <li> I got keratin treatment and therefore I use this shampoo and conditioner. I checked the stores and it would have cost me around $40 plus tax. However, it only cost me $32 at amazon. I will continue this product online.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for perfect straight hair!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner to get the most out of your Keratin treatment. I do notice that it will make my hair greasy sometimes. Just a little conditioner goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> This is A GREAT product, great for keratin treated hair. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> My bottles are also different than the ones in the picture.  It could be because they are selling expired products.  After I got in the shower and lathered up my hair I decided to look for a date on the bottle.  The reason I wanted to look is because the shampoo smelled so awful I had had to rinse it off immediately.  On the bottom of the bottle I discovered the date: AUG 2012!  They sent me one year old shampoo. In the minute or two it was on my hair it stripped all the natural oil right out of it. And now I have a headache.  I should have done my research before I placed my order, but I’ve done it now and it turns out there is formaldehyde in the Coppola products. Even though it costs considerably more, I will be going back to Kerastase products. They work and they smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> I just tried it one time and wow!! my hair feels amazing!! I have done sooo much to my hair I have natural black hair and I bleached it three times in one day and that created alot of damage my sis is a color tech so i asked her how do i heal it she said get Keratin Complex. So happy I did. :)</li>
            <li> well I was thrilled with all the positive reviews here, it may be just not for me, i had a keratin treatment at salon two months ago and i wanted to keep the result as long as i could  because Keratin give me a hair that i always dreamed of shiny and soft not frizz so i purchased this product a month ago, but after the first use i found my hair little dry and difficult to manage not like the day before when i was used just a baby shampoo as recommended by my hair stylist, i didnt want to write a review earlier , i said i have to give it a chance, i feel like my keratin treatment wear off by this product, im very disappointed, may be this product just not for my hair may be it fits other hair type,</li>
            <li> didnt work at all with my hair..its not the first time i use shampoo with keratin...butthis one is really the worste shampoo and conditioner i ever use..i feel so sorry for the money i west</li>
            <li> This is my go-to shampoo and conditioner set. LOVE KERATIN Complex. I&#x27;m a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Highly recommend to anyone requiring extra moisture in their hair.  If you color or blow dry this will take out the frizz and dry look and feeling, and will keep your hair soft, managable and shiny!</li>
            <li> The products met my needs..My hair feels softer and easier to manage, just as it does when I go to the hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I really love the shampoo and the conditioner. After I had started to use it I see the changes in my hair. It&#x27;s silky, shiny and soft. The products prevent freeze and make my hair look healthy. I wash my head almost every day but the amount of the bottle is enough for already 2 month.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and thick. It helps soften it and this is a good product to buy. Their is no smell, like some other product I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I just recently did the Brazilian Keratin treatment and was looking for a shampoo and conditioner that would help prolong the treatment as much as possible. So far, I have nothing but good things to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed the order on a Sunday and received the shipment by Thursday. Both the top of the shampoo and conditioner came sealed so no spillage would occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the first wash I did after doing the treatment so I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect. The shampoo and conditioner have a pleasant smell. My hair was very manageable, soft and easy to brush after the wash. It did not feel weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some others complained of feeling a dryness with the shampoo but I did not experience this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I found the shampoo and conditioner to be key in extending the life of my keratin treatment. good price for both of them.</li>
            <li> i purchased these two items after hearing so much about how good keratin is for your hair. The items were packaged very well,.  The conditioner is pretty good but the shampoo is too drying and harsh on my fine textured hair. I will not be purchasing these items again.</li>
            <li> People be careful!!!! It&#x27;s fake((((( At first it was very suspicious-because when I put this shampoo in my hand it looked very thin!!!!Anyway I was very positive! But yesterday I did a keratin on my hair, and when today I started to wash my hair-I understood it&#x27;s FAKE!!!!! One year I do keratin and first one I bought in the prestige hair saloon in nyc and I know how it should feels)))))So today when I washed my hair I didn&#x27;t feel what I should feel( like it&#x27;s not real hair)))))). Anyway afraid that this shampoo can help to destroy all keratin on my hair and I will have to do it again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!!! PAY MORE MONEY BUT GET THE REAL ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I usually use Matrix Biolage Deep Smoothening shampoo and conditioner, and I absolutely loved it. Few months back I had a keratin treatment done to my hair, and the stylist recommended this shampoo. I read the reviews and decided to try it. I was not happy with the results. I feel it has makes my hair more dry. I am waiting for it finish, so I can go back to my Matrix Biolage Deep Smoothening shampoo. Maybe it works for some, but not for me</li>
            <li> Is this a joke? First of all product received is NOT product in the photo. Secondly, there is no seal underneath the cap. OPEN UPON RECEIVING. All other shampoos purchased from other sellers and the salon had seal under. Shampoo is 1/4 gone! what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am using this shampoo and conditioner as part of my regimen. I have the keratin treatment. The product was recommended by my hairdresser. They work great!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the shampoo and conditioner!  Even in humid damp weather my hair still looks better than before.</li>
            <li> This Keratin duo is awesome!  Leaves my hair so soft and super shiny - smells great too!  I have people ask me all the time what I use on my hair - this works!</li>
            <li> Great product. Unused to get brazilian blowouts and then keratin treatments when I felt like the brazilians were too dangerous. Now I just use this shampoo/conditioner. While it doesn&#x27;t have exactly the same effect as the treatment it definitely makes my hair more &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; and less frizzy. Works even better if you use it after getting a keratin treatment .</li>
            <li> very good this product are the best in the market, they really do the job.&lt;br /&gt;if you want a silky hair, this is it</li>
            <li> Hair feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Work great on my treated hair. Best product ever for keratin treated hair. Will buy again for sure!!!. Thank you</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great purchase, always love doing business here.</li>
            <li> I am someone who normally wants everything thing as pure and organic as possible, but for this, I make an exception. I had the keratin smoothing treatment done last year (prior to the recent controversial information that has emerged) and I purchased only the shampoo at the time. I was fairly pleased with the results. Well, after a few months the keratin treatment had worn off and I was faced with a bit more time blowing and straightening and not quite getting that pretty sleek look that I had after the treatment. I was out of my shampoo, so I decided to purchase the set of shampoo and conditioner and see how my hair responded just to those alone. Needless to say, I don&#x27;t think I need to spend another $300 plus on the smoothing treatment any time soon. I am not saying you get the same results with the set here, but it is so darn close that for me, the cost and potential harm, is not at all worth the marginal increase in results from the full treatment. This shampoo and conditioner not only smell great but leave your hair incredibly smooth and soft. Every time I use them (I normally just use my warehouse-size Dove shampoo and am fine with that) and follow with a blowout and/or flat iron, it looks far better than with my everyday shampoo. I am going to start strictly using these products to see the effect and if it eventually \\&quot;builds-up\\&quot; so that it looks that much better by using it daily. I love these products. Though they are sodium-chloride-free, they still contain SLS if that is a concern of yours. Finally, this is a better price than in the salon. It can be sketchy when purchasing a salon-only product from online as there are stories about false products being inserted into a similar-container, but I saved my original with a bit of the product leftover, and from what I can tell (without a lab in my home), it is the same product. I even examined the bottle to determine whether it is genuine, and it appears to be. That, coupled with the results, are enough to make me continue to purchase this product from this seller.me continue to purchase this product from this seller.</li>
            <li> Love how this shampoo and conditioner work together to make my keratin treated hair so soft and silky smooth.  Love the ease and styling these products help with my course hair.</li>
            <li> The best and most recommended shampoo after keratin treatment.Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference in shine after using this product. A little pricey but worth it. But in all honesty, I have not tried the cheaper stuff so I don&#x27;t have a base to compare to. I just know that I recieve a lot of compliments on my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It helps make my keratin treatments last. And Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this shampoo and conditioner on several occasions, but the last time I ordered this set, something was clearly off about the product. The shampoo seemed very watery, and both bottles had the barcode blacked out with sharpie. I think these are fake or older versions of what should be a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but i can definitely see the difference between this product and others i used before.. My hair is soft and doesnt get frizzy, even though its very thick and wavy. so in my case this product works just fine.. the only thing that bothers me is an exparation date on the bottom of the shampoo bottle. It&#x27;s expired 3 months ago. But still works much better than CoCo products i&#x27;ve been using before</li>
            <li> Everything about this product is misleading because it can&#x27;t be used with keratin-treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most people whose hair was treated with the Coppolla keratin, I was told sulfate-free shampoos only. In fact, after my hair was treated, my stylist handed me bottles of the Keratin Care shampoo and conditioner and sent me on my way. Initially I was thrilled with the idea of my \\&quot;free\\&quot; high-end sulfate-free shampoo (after a year of the Organix Morroccan Argan Oil shampoo my thin wavy/curly hair was left a tangled frizzy mess). My excitement vanished, however, when I read \\&quot;AMMONIUM LAURETH SULFATE\\&quot; listed as an ingredient. Seriously?! So yes, the company behind our amazing salon keratin treatments also includes sulfates in its corresponding \\&quot;keratin care\\&quot; shampoo.  I can only imagine how many customers&#x27; expensive treatments washed out after using this product...sending them right back to the salon for more keratin. Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner combo that keeps my hair clean and looking healthy. MUCH better than any Paul Mitchell product.</li>
            <li> This is recommended if you get the Coppola Keratin Smoothing System so I use it to help my hair get the most out of my treatment</li>
            <li> While I had my keratin treatments I used these products. They are a fraction of what the salon change but maintained my hair perfectly. Would definitely recommend for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set on amazon after having a coppola keratin complex smoothing treatment (3-5 month) at my local salon. After spending $300 on the treatment and waiting over 3 full days to wash my hair, I wanted to make sure I did everything possible to maintain my treatment so I bought the shampoo &amp; conditioner the owner suggested that is from the same line. While it is sodium chloride free IT IS NOT SULPHATE FREE. I took the time to read all of the Amazon reviews but I always take them in stride. I then followed up by calling the keratin complex (800) number and spoke to rep who told me that this particular set (the keratin care or smoothing therapy) does have sulphates, which he said will not hurt your keratin treatment. If you have color treated hair, then purchase the color care line which has NO SULPHATES at all. I hung up from the phone call very skeptical because I have read countless articles on how sulphates OF ANY KIND damage your hair. I then went to my local Ulta and was able to talk to the salon manager who had worked as an educator in that field for 15 years, and she told me that I would be better off using a completely sulfate free shampoo &amp; conditioner no matter what that company tells me. She liked Wen (which I was using previous to getting the treatment). She also told me that regardless of what any salon tells you, keratin treatments DO MINOR DAMAGE to your hair. I wS under the impression by all of the hair stylists I spoke to, that they were good for me and I should get them every six weeks to improve my hair!  I have very curly, somewhat frizzy Italian hair and the treatment has so far made my hair almost completely straight. I had it done 9/02 ( it is now 9/19). I blow dry it with my fingers only, no flat iron. It also cut my drying time from 15 minutes to less than 5. My hair is midway down my back.  My hair is soft feeling but already seems to be getting a slight bit of curl back (of course I was using this sulphate shampoo &amp; have now switched back to Wen). I will also note that if you have sensitive skin be careful. I had a allergic reaction to the treatment. I was wearing a v neck shirt and got a rash on my chest where my hair touched it for the 3 days I couldn&#x27;t wash it. It burned and itched so bad I had to get a prescription strength cream and pills to antihistamine to relieve it.  Hope this helps others not only with the shampoo &amp; conditioner but with what to expect when considering the treatment.hed back to Wen).

            <li> I have used this product in the past with great results.  This time it works no better at keeping my keratin-treated hair straight than the regular Pantene I use. I spoke with my hair dresser about this and she says sometimes products bought on the internet are counterfeit no matter how legitimate the packaging is. She suggests using only professional beauty supply stores. I am not sure if this is correct, but I guess I will not be ordering this from Amazon anymore.  It cleans well, but my natural frizz comes through too well.</li>
            <li> Misrepresentation of Coppola - Made by different company altogether.</li>
            <li> Seemed to dry my hair after my keratin treatment. I switched to using Suave&#x27;s Keratin infusion shampoo. I still have this one but not sure if I would use it by itself because of the drying condition.</li>
            <li> works great after a keratin process</li>
            <li> I love the product.  Everything I was hoping it would be.  Glad I had ordered it and came when I needed it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these locally first time around, but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores when I needed more.  I have curly, hard to manage hair and have had Keratin treatments by my hairdresser.  This specific shampoo and conditioner is must have!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner makes my hair very silky and shiny. It is expensive but on Amazon it&#x27;s almost half price from retail stores. It&#x27;s so nice that it arrives promptly at my door and I also save money on gas.</li>
            <li> This stuff does the trick smoothing my hair and making it really shiny! I have shoulder length silver/blonde hair, and a Brazilian Blowout was really the only way to have it not look like frizzy, old-lady hair...until I started using this.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have been getting keratin treatment for my hair for the longest time and i always used this shampoo and conditioner. Normally my treatement lasts almost six months which i have heard its really long time. so i got the keratin done by someone else and im not sure if it was because i was not using this shampoo anymore (since it doesnt smell good) but my keratin barely lasted 3 months!... i believe the shampoo helped a lot.</li>
            <li> The reason that I purchased KERATIN Care was due to my condition of &amp;#34;Thinning Hair&amp;#34;.  Keratin is widely advertised with this type of endorsement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the shampoo arrived and my reading the small print on the shampoo and conditioner.  I realized it was not what I intended to buy.  It read Keratin Complex on the label which I misread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion it&#x27;s another hype of words, to fool the buyer and sell the product that I could have purchased at the drug store. This is My personal opinion only.  No need to return, the shampoo is being used by my Granddaughter. However will not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is good, not the best. There are others free sodium products that do a much better job, but it works. At least it didn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, did it&#x27;s job in smoothing my hair after i used it. But i found another Keratin Shampoo that smells nicer than this product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair super clean after just one application. The conditioner leaves my hair silky soft, shiny and smooth.  Shipped right on time.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I wanted.  A bit on the pricey side, but will reaccess when I run out.</li>
            <li> Great price. Works awesome with keratin straitening treatment.</li>
            <li> This product works well without leaving any residue. The shampoo rinses clean with one wash, no matter how long or thick your hair is. The conditioner I tend to leave in for a few minutes to allow the product to work at its best (per the instructions on the bottle anway). It rinses cleanly and quickly, leaving behind just simply manageable, clean and shiny hair. I use Infusium 23 leave in conditioner after every shower. With this product, I haven&#x27;t needed to use it. My hair is shiny, manageable and clean. I tend to have thick oily hair so having a product that works this well and smells great is quite rare!</li>
            <li> This is not like their other Smoothing Therapy Keratin Complex set.  This product contains sulfates.  I will not be using it.  Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner. My hair is thin and fine and this stuff works great!!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> i have been using this shampoo/conditioner daily for about 1 week and i absolutely love it! i have not had the keratin treatment done to my hair. it&#x27;s naturally thick, coarse, and wavy. after a few days of using this shampoo/conditioner my hair is so soft and easy to straighten!the smell is pleasant and not too strong.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped very quickly, and in good condition. I have very curly unruly hair, and I felt like it gave it a good shine after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair out (and my daughters) and faded my dye job. The real stuff does not do this. What a rip off.</li>
            <li> My son has long hair and does not like to brush it as often as he should. He uses the Keratin Complex shampoo and conditioner. It keeps his hair from tangling as easily as other products.</li>
