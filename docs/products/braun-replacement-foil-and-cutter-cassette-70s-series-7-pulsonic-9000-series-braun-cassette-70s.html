            <li>Work great saved me from having to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li>If you love Judy Blume, you&#x27;ll enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I especially appreciated not having to handle the foil screens as they are part of the top casing.</li>
            <li>fast delivered and good.</li>
            <li>He has a strong beard</li>
            <li>It works fine, just wish they made the orginal style foils.</li>
            <li>Great Product Sipping time was too long and why from Korea?</li>
            <li>great item, BUT TAKES WAY TO LONG TO GET HERE!</li>
            <li>Been using for several years and continues to provide consistently good results.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a replacement part for a razor, how much can you say about it!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Even if it costs more, it saves easily in the long run.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in the right amount of time and it was the correct product.  </li>
            <li>replaced the old blades fine worked well, was deliver timely.</li>
            <li>For me, it does not last 18 months, more like 7 - 9.</li>
            <li>Exact replacement for my Braun.</li>
            <li>Though I enjoyed Judy Blume&#x27;s research and re-telling of this incredible year in Elizabeth, NJ, I found In the Unlikely Event, read like a young adult novel.  </li>
            <li>It looks and feels like the real thing.</li>

            <li>They cut much better and tugged less.</li>
            <li>Do not see much difference between old and new</li>
            <li>intentionally picked THIS product, and not the others just like it for 2/3 of the cost because the cassettes with the blue cutter bar (as pictured) are higher performing, and worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>My Razor cuts like new now.</li>
            <li>Made my shaver cut like new.</li>

            <li> recommend seller, great item</li>
            <li> My son orders the Foil and cutter twice a year.  He has a strong beard so this helps a lot.</li>
            <li> My Razor cuts like new now. I didn&#x27;t realize how worn mine had become.</li>
            <li> Great Product Sipping time was too long and why from Korea?</li>
            <li> Made my shaver cut like new.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> It works fine, just wish they made the orginal style foils. They cut much better and tugged less.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the speed and care you took with this product.  Everything was great and I appreciate it greatly.</li>
            <li> Tried all the other electric shavers and they are like toys.The pulsonic helps the cut.  This cassette lasts at least 18 months and still cuts even then.Even if it costs more, it saves easily in the long run.</li>
            <li> When I received this item it did NOT include the cutter, just the foil.</li>
            <li> Product delivered IS NOT the product pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I intentionally picked THIS product, and not the others just like it for 2/3 of the cost because the cassettes with the blue cutter bar (as pictured) are higher performing, and worth the extra money.  If I had known that this was the same standard cassette as all the others on Amazon, I would have saved myself the money and bought any of the countless others.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Great product and price.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in the right amount of time and it was the correct product.  It&#x27;s a replacement part for a razor, how much can you say about it!!</li>

            <li> great item, BUT TAKES WAY TO LONG TO GET HERE!</li>
            <li> Whole lot cheaper than at Walmart.  Husband said shaver was like new again. We hadn&#x27;t read book and didn&#x27;t realize these needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Do not see much difference between old and new</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my shaver.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Fair...Just about the same as the dual one I replaced</li>
            <li> Product pictured is not the product you will receive. You will get the newer cassette which you can buy cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what you need  18 months of shaving.Makes the shaver like new!</li>

            <li> When I open the case, the cassette is falling apart, simply broken. I lost a smal piece because of that. To be honest, for this kind of price, it really shouldn&#x27;t happened!!! Now I have to buy a new one again. Thank you very much!</li>

            <li> Fine, but these never last as long as you want them to.  How about lasting forever.</li>
