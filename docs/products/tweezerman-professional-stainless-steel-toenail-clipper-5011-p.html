            <li>Very nice set of clippers.</li>
            <li>Okay, not the best out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to avoid getting ingrown toenail successfully for some time now!</li>
            <li>Really good quality clippers.</li>
            <li>Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>experience with nail cutters,,,finger or toe,,, over the years is that those made in Korea have always been superior to those made elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Good product for the money.</li>
            <li>I do think they do a  good job of clipping.  </li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t any good.</li>
            <li>Good quality and clipping strength.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>

            <li>As good as advertised</li>
            <li>sturdy and good quality</li>
            <li>If you want a good pair of clippers they are going to have to be perfectly in line to get a clean cut</li>
            <li>that being said, they do work exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>This purchase is working well, I am happy and satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are nice size GOOD weight......</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Lets face it, most men don&#x27;t need two sets of clippers, we would rather use one for hands and feet!  </li>
            <li>Love these clippers!</li>
            <li>what more can you say!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have purchased a better one!</li>
            <li>Functions nicely.</li>
            <li>Then of course I saw that its jaws were quite straight (checked them against the edge of a steel pocket ruler) and perfectly aligned.</li>
            <li>My mother has lacked the strength to cut her own nails until I purchased these clippers.  </li>
            <li>regardless of what I spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the kind folks on Amazon, the Tweezerman Pro is now in my life.</li>
            <li>deserving stars to the Tweezerman Pro.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if there were a bit of curve to the blades, though.  </li>
            <li>When they arrived, I tried them on my own finger nails.</li>
            <li>With these puppies I&#x27;m chopping through my honkers like a warm knife through melted butter.</li>
            <li>It is nice to know I will never have to buy them again in my lifetime.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that cuts straight across, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Not the best, but fairly decent.  </li>
            <li>Also, they didn&#x27;t cost too very much, which is a real nice plus.</li>
            <li>Super happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Easy to use (good leverage), but cut shape is too square</li>
            <li>I owed a pair of these before and they are by far the best clippers I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I have returned to a cheap pair of drugstore clippers with superior performance, and donated these to GoodWill.</li>
            <li>Ive only used these twice since buying them and honestly, for this price, its the best deal youre ever gonna get.</li>
            <li>Not bad but not as good as the Clippi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Also, they have a nice sharpness to it making your nails look clean and nicely cut.</li>
            <li>They are easily stuck in my pocket so they are handy no matter where I am in my shop.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t ask for more than that</li>
            <li>Glad they won&#x27;t rust.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try Tweezerman because I love their tweezer products.  </li>
            <li>Love the name.</li>
            <li>Love the straight-edge.</li>
            <li>These are OK.  </li>
            <li>, it hasn&#x27;t lost its sharpness, two years later, it still works perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Durability and reliability Tweezerman famous for</li>
            <li>Better than Zwilling.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to look at the toenail after you use Tweezerman to make sure that it did the job all the way across.</li>
            <li>This requires more attention and 3-4 more snips per nail.</li>
            <li>This clipper is built-well and has been able to clip everything I have thrown at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a straight cut toenail clipper and I was happy to find this one.  </li>
            <li>How many nail clippers do you suppose you&#x27;ve ever owned?  </li>
            <li>clipper cartels aside, these would be better with a nail file.</li>
            <li>(so the nails are more pliable), on both my toenails and my fingernails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy a couple more soon.  </li>
            <li>Tweezerman really did a great job with these toenail clippers.  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite nail clippers.</li>
            <li>Instead of each blade lined up precisely on top of each-other, one is spaced forward with an over-bite and</li>
            <li>I bought these as a stocking stuffer for my husband, and they ended up being his favorite gift.</li>
            <li>what more can you say.......</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the price, and think they do the job well for the money.</li>
            <li>Well, I guess I can say more.</li>
            <li>Awesome product..sharp enough to cut the hardest toe nail...</li>
            <li>OK clipper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a better alternative.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I like the concave ones much better</li>
            <li>Way better than drugstore stuff.</li>
            <li>Recieved it quickly , and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be &amp;#34;stainless steel&amp;#34; and I do keep them in a drawer nice and clean but they are beginning to show some rust spots that cannot be removed.  </li>
            <li>They worked pretty good</li>
            <li>Very good sturdy clippers, this item will probably last me forever!</li>
            <li>It cuts more accurately.</li>
            <li>and these seem to require more force than I am comfortable with to get hold of and cut thru the nail.</li>
            <li>Weight is not the most important factor, but I can&#x27;t come up with a reason for anyone to buy these.</li>
            <li>I wanted a good straight edge clipper.</li>
            <li>think of too much to review about a pair of nail clippers, except that they are good quaility and serve the intended purpose without any issues.  </li>
            <li>These things are huge, so you won&#x27;t be able to operate these easily unless your hands are large.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sturdy, sharp and perfect size.</li>
            <li>Blades are sharp and have perfect apposition/alignment.</li>
            <li>The clippers aren&#x27;t perfectly aligned with each other.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have been using these about a month now, still cut just as easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Well made clippers, cuts nails easily.</li>
            <li>They are sharper and fit your hand much more comfortably.</li>
            <li>They are strong and cut well.</li>
            <li>Loving this product so much!</li>
            <li>Pretty nice clippers.  </li>
            <li>Good pair of clippers so far, feels very sturdy and looks good as an added bonus.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, great quality clippers!</li>
            <li>Clips nails just fine.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re just looking for something cheap that gets the job done, these are pretty nice for the money.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and fabulous, I was so excited to find them on Amazon the best place in the world.</li>
            <li>; Doesn&#x27;t give a nice, clean, crisp cut.</li>
            <li>the cheap pair I bought from Walmart opens up a lot wider.</li>
            <li>These are MUCH better and definitely worth $8.  </li>
            <li>People of Amazon: thank you for writing thoughtful reviews for seemingly inane products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Especially at the price I bought it for, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>These fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>I would buy these again even for the price (which isn&#x27;t cheap)</li>
            <li>Found just what I wanted for square nails and the end results are precise and neat looking nails.</li>
            <li>Great solid tweezers.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of cheap clippers out there that tear instead of cut.  </li>
            <li>They clip nice and evenly and they are very durable</li>
            <li>Because they are stainless steel, they are doing a wonderful job DAILY in my shop....</li>
            <li>Perfect toenail clipper that cuts straight, preventing ingrown toenails on my big toes.  </li>
            <li>Far superior to the ones you find in the drug store.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, very durable toenail clippers!!!  </li>
            <li>Very useful and efficient.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, very strong.</li>
            <li>Nice clippers--they are high quality</li>
            <li>But overall, I&#x27;m super happy with it.</li>
            <li>well its more like an 1?8 an will do better than the one I got last week for more $</li>
            <li>The convex blades work great, much better than regular concave cutters.</li>
            <li>These clippers are a life saver, definitely need to buy more of these! : )</li>
            <li>but these do just fine and are much better than the pair of nail clippers that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>That means they will bend and rip your toe nail rather than cleanly clip them.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m thinking that they are not really stainless steel but for what I need it, which is to cut my fingernails straight, it has done an excellent job.</li>
            <li>Just arrived, used only once so far, and very impressed.</li>
            <li>Well made and cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li>Cuts cleanly through nails or skin that I routinely have to cut/smooth out from working with my hands</li>
            <li>After watching other nail clippers fly apart at effort, it&#x27;s fantastic to find this.</li>
            <li>good solid build</li>
            <li>Good solid clippers.  </li>
            <li>These suckers provide a perfectly even cut every time.</li>
            <li>, it is only good grooming.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find the straight edge in most stores.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad for the straight cut to help prevent ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li>IT IS PROBS TOO MUCH POWER FOR MOST.</li>
            <li>Not a bad clipper for the price.</li>
            <li>Will Not Rust Like Other Clippers, Great Price,</li>
            <li>They are extraordinarily well made and designed for ease of use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different brands of toenail clippers, these are the best!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Way better than the drugstore kind and a lot better than my dull ones that I&#x27;ve had for 10 yrs.</li>
            <li>This is a good, sharp, accurate toenail cutter.</li>
            <li>This clipper is a beast, an incredibly efficient tool where struggling against nails is now a thing of the past.</li>
            <li>These are straight, not curved, and its easy to cut my toenails.</li>
            <li>The grip is easy thanks to the ridged design where you grip the ends for leverage.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s the first time in my life that I was ever able to cut my toenails straight across, like the health websites advise.</li>
            <li>They clearly are superior to most other drug store available clippers.</li>
            <li>These clippers offer a clean crisp cut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good so far, it&#x27;s nice and sharp</li>
            <li>Heavy duty and works great.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these professional clippers.</li>
            <li>worth the effort to return nor even to review,,,</li>
            <li>Going from a 5+ year old pair of grocery store clippers to these was magical.</li>
            <li>WORTH</li>
            <li>Cheap regular chrome clippers seem to do a better job and have sharper blades for a finer cut.</li>
            <li>I have an old one in a cracking plastic case that works better than this one.  </li>
            <li>a that little under the nail thingy is very nice to have.</li>
            <li>For 5 dollars you can find a much more suitable instrument at Walgreens for less than 5 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Real professional equipment !!!</li>
            <li>Sharp, good quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good quality toenail clipper that seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Rugged and just the right size for toenails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at all the positive reviews for this product!</li>
            <li>But if I really needed a clean cut I would reach for this nail clipper.</li>
            <li>These clippers are sharp and make a nice clean cut.  </li>
            <li>Really nothing special</li>
            <li>My first &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; clippers and the 5$ was worth it.</li>
            <li>It is very hard to find straight toe nail clippers anymore &amp; these are great!</li>
            <li>they work so good you have to be careful not to cut off too much</li>
            <li>A simple, effective, straight toenail clipper.</li>
            <li>This does a great job clipping, even on hard to cut toenails.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman is solid and safely cuts them.</li>
            <li>These toenail clippers are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My first impression is the difference in finish between the two.</li>
            <li>The next difference is its greater spring rate.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>And, again, they are much better than Revlon and similar brands that you will find at drug stores.  </li>
            <li>Leave my nails all funny.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t have unusual nails, they LOSE THINGS!  </li>
            <li>Only knock is the &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; blade design, which leaves you needing to clip each nail once or twice more to keep it rounded.</li>
            <li>Just a well made product that works  great even on thick toe nails.</li>
            <li>They literally fell apart in my hand the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I have thick toenails so these are great for me.</li>
            <li>Its so funny reading everyones reviews on toenail clippers</li>
            <li>Good heavy duty toenail clippers ...</li>
            <li>It was sharp and clipped nicely.</li>
            <li>Like the flat edge, works so much better than a curved edge.</li>
            <li>The price seemed a little bit too much for what it is, however, but it&#x27;s a good product, and saved a trip to the store.</li>
            <li>Nice stainless steel with matte finish and not really that large.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately they are made in China, but overall they are good quality and fairly priced.</li>
            <li>Either cheap steel or not very sharp</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re certainly better than a lot of the cheap clippers I&#x27;ve had in the past, but it takes quite a bit of force to cut my toenails with them.  </li>
            <li>These clippers necessitate the use of a file to smooth off the sharp edges of your freshly cut toenails, but there is no built-in filing surface!  </li>
            <li>These clippers are so sharp that most cuts can hardly be heard compared to cheap drug store kind.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have strong enough blade.</li>
            <li>I Only Buy Tweezerman Products, These Stainless Steel Toenail Clippers Are Well Made Easy To Use</li>
            <li>Very affective and strong enough to cut the thickest of nails.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something very high quality, I would look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>This creates a large number of clippings, and they fly all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;- Poor quality.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy yourself responsibly as these clippers are built to last!</li>
            <li>It is straight across, not shaped in any way.</li>
            <li>Wish I could get one with a convex blade.</li>
            <li>These do a wonderful job of &#x27;flush&#x27; cutting my wire.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li>I prefer the straight cut of the blades over the convex or concave shapes.  </li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s a straight cut blade.</li>
            <li>I thought that the straight cut made sense; but if you are used to curved blade, stay with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this clipper.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but what&#x27;s the point of having a straight edge on these?</li>
            <li>but I always feel like I may cut too much off.  </li>
            <li>Very well-made.  </li>
            <li>The straight clipper is our preference.  </li>
            <li>This nail clipper is very well made</li>
            <li>O highly recommend!</li>
            <li>They worked very well and seem to be very well made.</li>
            <li>These clippers have a straight cutter.</li>
            <li>That it&#x27;s stainless steel and won&#x27;t rust</li>
            <li>These things don&#x27;t really wear out so much as they get lost, or dare I say stolen?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased multiple clippers to replace the cheap ones I had around the house.  </li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>Cuts in a straight line.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>Much nicer then the ones by the checkout at the supermarket.</li>
            <li>Thanks to vendor for prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>I like it convex but</li>
            <li>Very goof maneuvering</li>
            <li>Not too much to say here.  </li>
            <li>They make a straight across cut as they should (rather than curved), and I don&#x27;t have to apply 5 tons pounds of pressure to get them to snip</li>
            <li>(yes, I&#x27;m an exaggerator), and they are made of stainless steel so they should be around for awhile without being damaged by moisture.</li>
            <li>Now he wants two more...silly man.</li>
            <li>He likes square straight edge..not the rounded curved model...</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I like the straight across and not curved, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li>should not be straight it should be curved</li>
            <li>Well made and work very well.</li>
            <li>It seems to be made very well.</li>
            <li>They absolutely do.</li>
            <li>This are super sharp and powerful clippers!</li>
            <li>Sharp, straight edges are so much better than the curved edge clippers we have in Australia.</li>
            <li>These clippers do NOT cut clean and I finally know why.</li>
            <li>They require so little effort and are large enough to get a good grip on.  </li>
            <li>HIgh quality, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>These are much better than conventional clippers.</li>
            <li>The main advantage of this product is that it actually does the job, dependably and cleanly.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell if this holds true.</li>
            <li>A straight edge, such as this clipper has, is exactly what you need to cut toenails ... always cut straight across to prevent ingrown toenails!</li>
            <li>Although the clippers are large they fit in my hands quite well with no fear of slipping.  </li>
            <li>They are not perfect but better than the tweezerman for sure.</li>
            <li>A bit more expensive than most</li>
            <li>i love the straight edge fingernail look instead of round.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, large enough even for your big toes, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap for the price.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I wish the shipping wasn&#x27;t so high.</li>
            <li>Recommend this item highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>Sharp, easy to use.</li>
            <li>The finish is kind of dull color</li>
            <li>Well made, sharp and strong.</li>
            <li>Strong, sharp, durable.  </li>
            <li>I use them to cut my fingernails straight and so far</li>
            <li>My toenails are like concrete.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman Professional Stainless Steel Toenail Clipper s</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t expect to ever have to buy another pair again (Tweezerman offers lifetime sharpening).</li>
            <li>That aside, they do cut pretty well, though I&#x27;m not personally a big fan of stainless steel.</li>
            <li>They work so much better than curved edge that may or may not fit the curve of your toes.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the nails seem to come off in small portions thus more nails to fly every where.</li>
            <li>As others have indicated, these are not convex as illustrated but straight, but they still do a better job on my big toe than concave ones.</li>
            <li>These clippers started to come apart on me within six months of normal use.  </li>
            <li>Nicer than a typical clipper, with very well-aligned blades that yield a smooth cut.</li>
            <li>but I thought it might be time for something new.  </li>
            <li>These still look and work like new, even after being in my pocket whenever I travel.</li>
            <li>It is very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, lightweight yet strong.</li>
            <li>It makes cutting nails more convenient (and safe.)</li>
            <li>All toenail clippers actually should be a straight edge as you are supposed to cut your toenails straight across.</li>
            <li>Finally a clipper with a straight edge!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While they are stainless steel, they are not as heavy as the old rusty cheap ones that I was replacing.  </li>
            <li>For many years I&#x27;ve used the curved nail clippers, but after purchasing these I won&#x27;t go back to any other clippers.</li>
            <li>but they are sharp, leave a clean cut.</li>
            <li>When I finally sought medical treatment, the doctor recommended the best prevention is cutting toenails straight across (not curved).</li>
            <li>Very sharp and precise</li>
            <li>They are solid, sturdy, amazingly smooth, and so very worth the few extra dollars I paid for them.</li>
            <li>While the build quality looks good, using it during the first cut the cutting edge slips forward.</li>
            <li>This thing is VERY sharp, very solidly built - love it.</li>
            <li>There is a tiny spot of rust color stain on one small spot but it hasn&#x27;t spread or anything so item still really happy with, it just seems to be surface to it doesn&#x27;t have any rough texture near the rust stain.  </li>
            <li>These are worth the money, the straight cut takes a little getting used to not ever using one before</li>
            <li>Very high quality, built to last.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - unless you really need/want a straight-edge nail clipper, buy the MEHAZ Professional Toenail clipper (model 662) for the same price as this Tweezerman.</li>
            <li>I definitely prefer the straight blade over curved.</li>
            <li>Either way, completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li>The big plus for me is these have straight blade, not curved.</li>
            <li>I like the stainless steel as it can be cleaned and rinsed with relative ease.  </li>
            <li>There is not as much room between the clipper edges as I would like, in fact the space is narrower than any of our regular clippers.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a trained eye to notice that it is stainless steel instead of chrome plating, as on the regular.</li>
            <li>Professional grade.</li>
            <li>These are definitely well-made clippers that cut a straight line, not a curved one.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend these if you&#x27;re looking for a straight toenail clipper.</li>
            <li>The clippers are perfectly straight as shown, and align properly.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far in my use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a brand thing or a professional pinky in the air thing.</li>
            <li>I just have to keep my old clippers around for the cleaning and filing purpose.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my only criticism of an otherwise well made and reasonably priced clipper.</li>
            <li>It does a professional job...</li>
            <li>I think this product setback comes from the clippers being unconventionality straight, as opposed to the traditional curved design.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty, fantastic clippers.</li>
            <li>Since it has that straight edge t does a good job of cutting straight across your nails making it easier to shape your nails square-tipped as opposed to using a regular nail clipper.</li>
            <li>minor point.&lt;br /&gt;Stainless is cool, should last FOREVER</li>
            <li>Many toenail clippers have too sharp a curve to work well, so the straight cutting edge is a plus for many users.</li>
            <li>Cutting was just ok, nothing special.</li>
            <li>I can defnitely corroborate previous reports that the Tweezerman causes my largest toenail to make a relatively silent snapping sound.</li>
            <li>Both have a precise cutting edge and they made easy work of clipping.</li>
            <li>Be careful the first time you use them</li>
            <li>Dull clippers require more pressure to actually cut the nail, not a problem with this brand.  </li>
            <li>On fingers, a little more caution is needed (due to said lack of resistance).</li>
            <li>The left side touches first, but the right side will eventually make contact if you push hard</li>
            <li>Somewhat hard to fit curved part of the nail inside the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I just wish they&#x27;d put silicone grips on all clippers in general.</li>
            <li>went back to my 25 year old Cook clippers (made in USA).</li>
            <li>The straight clippers make it easier to get in close, especially on the ends, but they will leave jagged nails that should be filed off after or you may make holey socks and possibly damage your mate in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li>The product was available at a low price from Amazon when it was not available at all from local stores.</li>
            <li>Not as much leverage as I expected.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that the blade doesn&#x27;t cut nicely and leaves a weird jagged edge.</li>
            <li>Sturdily made and they give you good control when cutting toenails.</li>
            <li>Because of the flat front you get a lot more sharp edges that need to be filed down.</li>
            <li>Not very sharp.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you can still trim your nails with it, but then the little nail cutoff pieces will fly all over your room...</li>
            <li>These nail clippers are straight and sharp.</li>
            <li>These clippers are sharp and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and clips without having to use too much pressure.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, wish it had a nail cleaning knife, alas I still love how solid and sharp it is.</li>
            <li>Major league, big time nail clippers.</li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s indestructible but not even close to sharp enough, metal way too thick at end, hard to fit around nails</li>
            <li>Or you can responsibly pick up after yourself, or clip responsibly in the shower, tool shed, gym locker room, or other manly areas where the evidence can be discarded or hidden.  </li>
            <li>The opening on these is not wide enough.  </li>
            <li>You just have to smooth down the edges of the nail, if you dont want sharp square edges, but rest of the nail shape is taken care of by this clipper whereas when I use a nail clipper with curved edge, I always end up clipping more nail than I intend to and its not perfectly square either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sharp, but my main beef with this clipper is that it&#x27;s not curved.</li>
            <li>Now, even tho&#x27; not pretty, are properly straight and short enough for me.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, stainless steel finish.</li>
            <li>Very sharp but too straight across.</li>
            <li>Very, very sharp and cut perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>I have always owned the typical curved edge tweezers, and as a nurse, I know you are supposed to cut straight across, then file the edges.</li>
            <li>You have to squeeze super hard for the blades to finally press through</li>
            <li>The Mehaz clippers seem to be much sharper and take much less force to actually clip the nail.  </li>
            <li>This clipper is big enough so that I can hold it steady in one hand and a squirming guinea pig in the other.</li>
            <li>They work amazingly for this task because they are very sharp and have a straight cutting surface.</li>

            <li> Really good quality clippers.</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> experience with nail cutters,,,finger or toe,,, over the years is that those made in Korea have always been superior to those made elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> Good product for the money.</li>
            <li> I do think they do a  good job of clipping.  </li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t any good.</li>
            <li> Good quality and clipping strength.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>

            <li> As good as advertised</li>
            <li> sturdy and good quality</li>
            <li> If you want a good pair of clippers they are going to have to be perfectly in line to get a clean cut</li>
            <li> that being said, they do work exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This purchase is working well, I am happy and satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>

            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> Lets face it, most men don&#x27;t need two sets of clippers, we would rather use one for hands and feet!  </li>
            <li> Love these clippers!</li>
            <li> what more can you say!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have purchased a better one!</li>
            <li> Functions nicely.</li>
            <li> Then of course I saw that its jaws were quite straight (checked them against the edge of a steel pocket ruler) and perfectly aligned.</li>
            <li> My mother has lacked the strength to cut her own nails until I purchased these clippers.  </li>
            <li> regardless of what I spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the kind folks on Amazon, the Tweezerman Pro is now in my life.</li>
            <li> deserving stars to the Tweezerman Pro.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if there were a bit of curve to the blades, though.  </li>
            <li> When they arrived, I tried them on my own finger nails.</li>
            <li> With these puppies I&#x27;m chopping through my honkers like a warm knife through melted butter.</li>
            <li> It is nice to know I will never have to buy them again in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that cuts straight across, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Not the best, but fairly decent.  </li>
            <li> Also, they didn&#x27;t cost too very much, which is a real nice plus.</li>
            <li> Super happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use (good leverage), but cut shape is too square</li>
            <li> I owed a pair of these before and they are by far the best clippers I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I have returned to a cheap pair of drugstore clippers with superior performance, and donated these to GoodWill.</li>
            <li> Ive only used these twice since buying them and honestly, for this price, its the best deal youre ever gonna get.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not as good as the Clippi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Also, they have a nice sharpness to it making your nails look clean and nicely cut.</li>
            <li> They are easily stuck in my pocket so they are handy no matter where I am in my shop.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ask for more than that</li>
            <li> Glad they won&#x27;t rust.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try Tweezerman because I love their tweezer products.  </li>
            <li> Love the name.</li>
            <li> Love the straight-edge.</li>
            <li> These are OK.  </li>
            <li> , it hasn&#x27;t lost its sharpness, two years later, it still works perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Durability and reliability Tweezerman famous for</li>
            <li> Better than Zwilling.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to look at the toenail after you use Tweezerman to make sure that it did the job all the way across.</li>
            <li> This requires more attention and 3-4 more snips per nail.</li>
            <li> This clipper is built-well and has been able to clip everything I have thrown at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a straight cut toenail clipper and I was happy to find this one.  </li>
            <li> How many nail clippers do you suppose you&#x27;ve ever owned?  </li>
            <li> clipper cartels aside, these would be better with a nail file.</li>
            <li> (so the nails are more pliable), on both my toenails and my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy a couple more soon.  </li>
            <li> Tweezerman really did a great job with these toenail clippers.  </li>
            <li> These are my favorite nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Instead of each blade lined up precisely on top of each-other, one is spaced forward with an over-bite and</li>
            <li> I bought these as a stocking stuffer for my husband, and they ended up being his favorite gift.</li>
            <li> what more can you say.......</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the price, and think they do the job well for the money.</li>
            <li> Well, I guess I can say more.</li>
            <li> Awesome product..sharp enough to cut the hardest toe nail...</li>
            <li> OK clipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a better alternative.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I like the concave ones much better</li>
            <li> Way better than drugstore stuff.</li>
            <li> Recieved it quickly , and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be &amp;#34;stainless steel&amp;#34; and I do keep them in a drawer nice and clean but they are beginning to show some rust spots that cannot be removed.  </li>
            <li> They worked pretty good</li>
            <li> Very good sturdy clippers, this item will probably last me forever!</li>
            <li> It cuts more accurately.</li>
            <li> and these seem to require more force than I am comfortable with to get hold of and cut thru the nail.</li>
            <li> Weight is not the most important factor, but I can&#x27;t come up with a reason for anyone to buy these.</li>
            <li> I wanted a good straight edge clipper.</li>
            <li> think of too much to review about a pair of nail clippers, except that they are good quaility and serve the intended purpose without any issues.  </li>
            <li> These things are huge, so you won&#x27;t be able to operate these easily unless your hands are large.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sturdy, sharp and perfect size.</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp and have perfect apposition/alignment.</li>
            <li> The clippers aren&#x27;t perfectly aligned with each other.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using these about a month now, still cut just as easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Well made clippers, cuts nails easily.</li>
            <li> They are sharper and fit your hand much more comfortably.</li>
            <li> They are strong and cut well.</li>
            <li> Loving this product so much!</li>
            <li> Pretty nice clippers.  </li>
            <li> Good pair of clippers so far, feels very sturdy and looks good as an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, great quality clippers!</li>
            <li> Clips nails just fine.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re just looking for something cheap that gets the job done, these are pretty nice for the money.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and fabulous, I was so excited to find them on Amazon the best place in the world.</li>
            <li> ; Doesn&#x27;t give a nice, clean, crisp cut.</li>
            <li> the cheap pair I bought from Walmart opens up a lot wider.</li>
            <li> These are MUCH better and definitely worth $8.  </li>
            <li> People of Amazon: thank you for writing thoughtful reviews for seemingly inane products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially at the price I bought it for, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> These fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> I would buy these again even for the price (which isn&#x27;t cheap)</li>
            <li> Found just what I wanted for square nails and the end results are precise and neat looking nails.</li>
            <li> Great solid tweezers.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of cheap clippers out there that tear instead of cut.  </li>
            <li> They clip nice and evenly and they are very durable</li>
            <li> Because they are stainless steel, they are doing a wonderful job DAILY in my shop....</li>
            <li> Perfect toenail clipper that cuts straight, preventing ingrown toenails on my big toes.  </li>
            <li> Far superior to the ones you find in the drug store.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, very durable toenail clippers!!!  </li>
            <li> Very useful and efficient.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, very strong.</li>
            <li> Nice clippers--they are high quality</li>
            <li> But overall, I&#x27;m super happy with it.</li>
            <li> well its more like an 1?8 an will do better than the one I got last week for more $</li>
            <li> The convex blades work great, much better than regular concave cutters.</li>
            <li> These clippers are a life saver, definitely need to buy more of these! : )</li>
            <li> but these do just fine and are much better than the pair of nail clippers that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> That means they will bend and rip your toe nail rather than cleanly clip them.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m thinking that they are not really stainless steel but for what I need it, which is to cut my fingernails straight, it has done an excellent job.</li>
            <li> Just arrived, used only once so far, and very impressed.</li>
            <li> Well made and cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li> Cuts cleanly through nails or skin that I routinely have to cut/smooth out from working with my hands</li>
            <li> After watching other nail clippers fly apart at effort, it&#x27;s fantastic to find this.</li>
            <li> good solid build</li>
            <li> Good solid clippers.  </li>
            <li> These suckers provide a perfectly even cut every time.</li>
            <li> , it is only good grooming.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find the straight edge in most stores.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad for the straight cut to help prevent ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> IT IS PROBS TOO MUCH POWER FOR MOST.</li>
            <li> Not a bad clipper for the price.</li>
            <li> Will Not Rust Like Other Clippers, Great Price,</li>
            <li> They are extraordinarily well made and designed for ease of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of toenail clippers, these are the best!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Way better than the drugstore kind and a lot better than my dull ones that I&#x27;ve had for 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> This is a good, sharp, accurate toenail cutter.</li>
            <li> This clipper is a beast, an incredibly efficient tool where struggling against nails is now a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> These are straight, not curved, and its easy to cut my toenails.</li>
            <li> The grip is easy thanks to the ridged design where you grip the ends for leverage.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s the first time in my life that I was ever able to cut my toenails straight across, like the health websites advise.</li>
            <li> They clearly are superior to most other drug store available clippers.</li>
            <li> These clippers offer a clean crisp cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good so far, it&#x27;s nice and sharp</li>
            <li> Heavy duty and works great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these professional clippers.</li>
            <li> worth the effort to return nor even to review,,,</li>
            <li> Going from a 5+ year old pair of grocery store clippers to these was magical.</li>
            <li> WORTH</li>
            <li> Cheap regular chrome clippers seem to do a better job and have sharper blades for a finer cut.</li>
            <li> I have an old one in a cracking plastic case that works better than this one.  </li>
            <li> a that little under the nail thingy is very nice to have.</li>
            <li> For 5 dollars you can find a much more suitable instrument at Walgreens for less than 5 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Real professional equipment !!!</li>
            <li> Sharp, good quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very good quality toenail clipper that seems like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Rugged and just the right size for toenails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at all the positive reviews for this product!</li>
            <li> But if I really needed a clean cut I would reach for this nail clipper.</li>
            <li> These clippers are sharp and make a nice clean cut.  </li>
            <li> Really nothing special</li>
            <li> My first &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; clippers and the 5$ was worth it.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find straight toe nail clippers anymore &amp; these are great!</li>
            <li> they work so good you have to be careful not to cut off too much</li>
            <li> A simple, effective, straight toenail clipper.</li>
            <li> This does a great job clipping, even on hard to cut toenails.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman is solid and safely cuts them.</li>
            <li> These toenail clippers are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My first impression is the difference in finish between the two.</li>
            <li> The next difference is its greater spring rate.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> And, again, they are much better than Revlon and similar brands that you will find at drug stores.  </li>
            <li> Leave my nails all funny.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t have unusual nails, they LOSE THINGS!  </li>
            <li> Only knock is the &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; blade design, which leaves you needing to clip each nail once or twice more to keep it rounded.</li>
            <li> Just a well made product that works  great even on thick toe nails.</li>
            <li> They literally fell apart in my hand the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I have thick toenails so these are great for me.</li>
            <li> Its so funny reading everyones reviews on toenail clippers</li>
            <li> Good heavy duty toenail clippers ...</li>
            <li> It was sharp and clipped nicely.</li>
            <li> Like the flat edge, works so much better than a curved edge.</li>
            <li> The price seemed a little bit too much for what it is, however, but it&#x27;s a good product, and saved a trip to the store.</li>
            <li> Nice stainless steel with matte finish and not really that large.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they are made in China, but overall they are good quality and fairly priced.</li>
            <li> Either cheap steel or not very sharp</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re certainly better than a lot of the cheap clippers I&#x27;ve had in the past, but it takes quite a bit of force to cut my toenails with them.  </li>
            <li> These clippers necessitate the use of a file to smooth off the sharp edges of your freshly cut toenails, but there is no built-in filing surface!  </li>
            <li> These clippers are so sharp that most cuts can hardly be heard compared to cheap drug store kind.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have strong enough blade.</li>
            <li> I Only Buy Tweezerman Products, These Stainless Steel Toenail Clippers Are Well Made Easy To Use</li>
            <li> Very affective and strong enough to cut the thickest of nails.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something very high quality, I would look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> This creates a large number of clippings, and they fly all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;- Poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy yourself responsibly as these clippers are built to last!</li>
            <li> It is straight across, not shaped in any way.</li>
            <li> Wish I could get one with a convex blade.</li>
            <li> These do a wonderful job of &#x27;flush&#x27; cutting my wire.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li> I prefer the straight cut of the blades over the convex or concave shapes.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s a straight cut blade.</li>
            <li> I thought that the straight cut made sense; but if you are used to curved blade, stay with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this clipper.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but what&#x27;s the point of having a straight edge on these?</li>
            <li> but I always feel like I may cut too much off.  </li>
            <li> Very well-made.  </li>
            <li> The straight clipper is our preference.  </li>
            <li> This nail clipper is very well made</li>
            <li> O highly recommend!</li>
            <li> They worked very well and seem to be very well made.</li>
            <li> These clippers have a straight cutter.</li>
            <li> That it&#x27;s stainless steel and won&#x27;t rust</li>
            <li> These things don&#x27;t really wear out so much as they get lost, or dare I say stolen?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased multiple clippers to replace the cheap ones I had around the house.  </li>
            <li> works very well</li>
            <li> Cuts in a straight line.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> Much nicer then the ones by the checkout at the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Thanks to vendor for prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I like it convex but</li>
            <li> Very goof maneuvering</li>
            <li> Not too much to say here.  </li>
            <li> They make a straight across cut as they should (rather than curved), and I don&#x27;t have to apply 5 tons pounds of pressure to get them to snip</li>
            <li> (yes, I&#x27;m an exaggerator), and they are made of stainless steel so they should be around for awhile without being damaged by moisture.</li>
            <li> Now he wants two more...silly man.</li>
            <li> He likes square straight edge..not the rounded curved model...</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I like the straight across and not curved, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> should not be straight it should be curved</li>
            <li> Well made and work very well.</li>
            <li> It seems to be made very well.</li>
            <li> They absolutely do.</li>
            <li> This are super sharp and powerful clippers!</li>
            <li> Sharp, straight edges are so much better than the curved edge clippers we have in Australia.</li>
            <li> These clippers do NOT cut clean and I finally know why.</li>
            <li> They require so little effort and are large enough to get a good grip on.  </li>
            <li> HIgh quality, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These are much better than conventional clippers.</li>
            <li> The main advantage of this product is that it actually does the job, dependably and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if this holds true.</li>
            <li> A straight edge, such as this clipper has, is exactly what you need to cut toenails ... always cut straight across to prevent ingrown toenails!</li>
            <li> Although the clippers are large they fit in my hands quite well with no fear of slipping.  </li>
            <li> They are not perfect but better than the tweezerman for sure.</li>
            <li> A bit more expensive than most</li>
            <li> i love the straight edge fingernail look instead of round.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, large enough even for your big toes, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap for the price.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I wish the shipping wasn&#x27;t so high.</li>
            <li> Recommend this item highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Sharp, easy to use.</li>
            <li> The finish is kind of dull color</li>
            <li> Well made, sharp and strong.</li>
            <li> Strong, sharp, durable.  </li>
            <li> I use them to cut my fingernails straight and so far</li>
            <li> My toenails are like concrete.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman Professional Stainless Steel Toenail Clipper s</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t expect to ever have to buy another pair again (Tweezerman offers lifetime sharpening).</li>
            <li> That aside, they do cut pretty well, though I&#x27;m not personally a big fan of stainless steel.</li>
            <li> They work so much better than curved edge that may or may not fit the curve of your toes.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the nails seem to come off in small portions thus more nails to fly every where.</li>
            <li> As others have indicated, these are not convex as illustrated but straight, but they still do a better job on my big toe than concave ones.</li>
            <li> These clippers started to come apart on me within six months of normal use.  </li>
            <li> Nicer than a typical clipper, with very well-aligned blades that yield a smooth cut.</li>
            <li> but I thought it might be time for something new.  </li>
            <li> These still look and work like new, even after being in my pocket whenever I travel.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, lightweight yet strong.</li>
            <li> It makes cutting nails more convenient (and safe.)</li>
            <li> All toenail clippers actually should be a straight edge as you are supposed to cut your toenails straight across.</li>
            <li> Finally a clipper with a straight edge!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While they are stainless steel, they are not as heavy as the old rusty cheap ones that I was replacing.  </li>
            <li> For many years I&#x27;ve used the curved nail clippers, but after purchasing these I won&#x27;t go back to any other clippers.</li>
            <li> but they are sharp, leave a clean cut.</li>
            <li> When I finally sought medical treatment, the doctor recommended the best prevention is cutting toenails straight across (not curved).</li>
            <li> Very sharp and precise</li>
            <li> They are solid, sturdy, amazingly smooth, and so very worth the few extra dollars I paid for them.</li>
            <li> While the build quality looks good, using it during the first cut the cutting edge slips forward.</li>
            <li> This thing is VERY sharp, very solidly built - love it.</li>
            <li> There is a tiny spot of rust color stain on one small spot but it hasn&#x27;t spread or anything so item still really happy with, it just seems to be surface to it doesn&#x27;t have any rough texture near the rust stain.  </li>
            <li> These are worth the money, the straight cut takes a little getting used to not ever using one before</li>
            <li> Very high quality, built to last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line - unless you really need/want a straight-edge nail clipper, buy the MEHAZ Professional Toenail clipper (model 662) for the same price as this Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer the straight blade over curved.</li>
            <li> Either way, completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> The big plus for me is these have straight blade, not curved.</li>
            <li> I like the stainless steel as it can be cleaned and rinsed with relative ease.  </li>
            <li> There is not as much room between the clipper edges as I would like, in fact the space is narrower than any of our regular clippers.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a trained eye to notice that it is stainless steel instead of chrome plating, as on the regular.</li>
            <li> Professional grade.</li>
            <li> These are definitely well-made clippers that cut a straight line, not a curved one.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend these if you&#x27;re looking for a straight toenail clipper.</li>
            <li> The clippers are perfectly straight as shown, and align properly.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far in my use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a brand thing or a professional pinky in the air thing.</li>
            <li> I just have to keep my old clippers around for the cleaning and filing purpose.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only criticism of an otherwise well made and reasonably priced clipper.</li>
            <li> It does a professional job...</li>
            <li> I think this product setback comes from the clippers being unconventionality straight, as opposed to the traditional curved design.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty, fantastic clippers.</li>
            <li> Since it has that straight edge t does a good job of cutting straight across your nails making it easier to shape your nails square-tipped as opposed to using a regular nail clipper.</li>
            <li> minor point.&lt;br /&gt;Stainless is cool, should last FOREVER</li>
            <li> Many toenail clippers have too sharp a curve to work well, so the straight cutting edge is a plus for many users.</li>
            <li> Cutting was just ok, nothing special.</li>
            <li> I can defnitely corroborate previous reports that the Tweezerman causes my largest toenail to make a relatively silent snapping sound.</li>
            <li> Both have a precise cutting edge and they made easy work of clipping.</li>
            <li> Be careful the first time you use them</li>
            <li> Dull clippers require more pressure to actually cut the nail, not a problem with this brand.  </li>
            <li> On fingers, a little more caution is needed (due to said lack of resistance).</li>
            <li> The left side touches first, but the right side will eventually make contact if you push hard</li>
            <li> Somewhat hard to fit curved part of the nail inside the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I just wish they&#x27;d put silicone grips on all clippers in general.</li>
            <li> went back to my 25 year old Cook clippers (made in USA).</li>
            <li> The straight clippers make it easier to get in close, especially on the ends, but they will leave jagged nails that should be filed off after or you may make holey socks and possibly damage your mate in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li> The product was available at a low price from Amazon when it was not available at all from local stores.</li>
            <li> Not as much leverage as I expected.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that the blade doesn&#x27;t cut nicely and leaves a weird jagged edge.</li>
            <li> Sturdily made and they give you good control when cutting toenails.</li>
            <li> Because of the flat front you get a lot more sharp edges that need to be filed down.</li>
            <li> Not very sharp.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you can still trim your nails with it, but then the little nail cutoff pieces will fly all over your room...</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are straight and sharp.</li>
            <li> These clippers are sharp and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and clips without having to use too much pressure.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, wish it had a nail cleaning knife, alas I still love how solid and sharp it is.</li>
            <li> Major league, big time nail clippers.</li>
            <li> sure it&#x27;s indestructible but not even close to sharp enough, metal way too thick at end, hard to fit around nails</li>
            <li> Or you can responsibly pick up after yourself, or clip responsibly in the shower, tool shed, gym locker room, or other manly areas where the evidence can be discarded or hidden.  </li>
            <li> The opening on these is not wide enough.  </li>
            <li> You just have to smooth down the edges of the nail, if you dont want sharp square edges, but rest of the nail shape is taken care of by this clipper whereas when I use a nail clipper with curved edge, I always end up clipping more nail than I intend to and its not perfectly square either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp, but my main beef with this clipper is that it&#x27;s not curved.</li>
            <li> Now, even tho&#x27; not pretty, are properly straight and short enough for me.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, stainless steel finish.</li>
            <li> Very sharp but too straight across.</li>
            <li> Very, very sharp and cut perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> I have always owned the typical curved edge tweezers, and as a nurse, I know you are supposed to cut straight across, then file the edges.</li>
            <li> You have to squeeze super hard for the blades to finally press through</li>
            <li> The Mehaz clippers seem to be much sharper and take much less force to actually clip the nail.  </li>
            <li> This clipper is big enough so that I can hold it steady in one hand and a squirming guinea pig in the other.</li>
            <li> They work amazingly for this task because they are very sharp and have a straight cutting surface.</li>
            <li> Not much to say but that it is very sharp and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Other similar clippers I have open twice as wide and are much easier and quicker to use.  </li>
            <li> I had some Seki Edge&#x27;s ($20, and made in Japan) which were clearly better-made and heavier-duty than these, but they left a really sharp edge on the nail that I didn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned they don&#x27;t open wide enough, they could open a bit more for folks who have extra thick or odd shaped toenails ...</li>
            <li> If you are used to your normal nail clippers that your mom gave you, you are gonna mess yourself up with these.</li>
            <li> High quality, heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I strongly prefer the straight edge instead of the curved cutting edge on other models.</li>
            <li> : Flat front, no under the nail cleaner thingy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never seen a pair of clippers with a flat front.</li>
            <li> They feel like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Cuts through thick man-nails like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> Ancient feet get super tough nails</li>
            <li> The opening is a little smaller than most clippers and could slow you down.</li>
            <li> Every few years I have to buy new clippers because they disappear to &amp;#34;who knows where&amp;#34; and I always buy tweezerman products because one time I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> So men... don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s less masculine to file</li>
            <li> Yes, there is no doubt a dangerous nail clipper cartel that burgles only clippers from the innocent.  </li>
            <li> The toenail clipper, however, did not live up to its standard.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are pretty serious.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Since the cutting edge is flat, you&#x27;ll have to clip 2 or 3 times more on each nail.  </li>
            <li> It allows me to cut my entire nail with just a single clip!</li>
            <li> Old ones used to be sharp years ago but got dull and I needed to find new clippers.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find toenail clippers that cut the nail straight across.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to want to even cut through my fingernails without having to really push hard.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, Im not thrilled with the convex design.</li>
            <li> This will be a strange review.</li>
            <li> The straight clippers are less harsh on your nails.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to hold onto the regular clipper for use on all but my big toe, because the curvature of its jaws is too small for that nail only.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s relatively unremarkable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This just doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough power or sharpness to cut through my nails even though I don&#x27;t really have very thick</li>
            <li> Have been using this brand for a very long time and can always tell a difference between this brand and a dollar store brand.  </li>
            <li> I have one toenail that grows with a split in the middle of it, so there are three sections of nail (the center grows independently of the sides) and the clippers make it easier to trim the odd pieces.</li>
            <li> 52 year old male and my nails are thick.</li>
            <li> Did good cutting my toenails which are usually thick.</li>
            <li> Seem thick and high quality.</li>
            <li> Not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> We had several in the house, down to one which is a curved clipper.  </li>
            <li> Solidly built, very sharp.</li>
            <li> I got these for my husband, who has very thick toenails, and I don&#x27;t think these will be strong enough to withstand his tough nails.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t paying close enough attention and didn&#x27;t see that it didn&#x27;t have the little nail file with an under the nail cleaner thingy</li>
            <li> The blade is flat unlike a typical curved blade nail clipper.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these clippers, unfortunately there is a huge design fail.</li>
            <li> The cutting edge is sharper than your old nail clippers but, not by as much as one should expect.</li>
            <li> It is definitely sturdy, I wish they had a somewhat more standard arced cutting line - the square/straight cutting line is harder to agree with the natural arc of my nails.</li>
            <li> Well, there is not much to say about a toe nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> These should last a few years of continual use before they get end up in my tackle box.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes to file off the jaggies.  </li>
            <li> Works as I had hoped, but it seems to have a bit of a rough finish.</li>
            <li> These serve the purpose but not as well as I expected.  </li>
            <li> and I like the wide design.</li>
            <li> Also size was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected and meets all of my needs.  </li>
            <li> it may be my toenails, but it just doesn&#x27;t work as I expected.</li>
            <li> Not much space between the blades</li>
            <li> only drawback is that its a little too sharp for my liking</li>
            <li> My nails were in a mess until I finally broke down and purchased the Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> The clippers are made in China but are sharp and finished quite well.  </li>
            <li> These clippers do not appear to be as sturdy as other reviewers have stated.  </li>
            <li> I bought these because they were supposed to be sharp.  </li>
            <li> Its sharp and clips the nail in just one try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, for some unknown reason, its beginning to rust!?  </li>
            <li> This purchase was on other reviews of the product.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and sharp.</li>
            <li> is that it doesn&#x27;t have any clipping &amp;#34;storage&amp;#34; found in other clippers.  </li>
            <li> These work well and are so sharp.</li>
            <li> Does the job extremely well.</li>
            <li> is a plus, and the blades are sharp, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is great--nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and sharp.</li>
            <li> Extremely well made - this thing feels solid!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> This clipper is well made and sharp, but its just a bit &#x27;machined&#x27; in feel.  </li>
            <li> Sharp precision.</li>
            <li> edges of the body are sharp and</li>
            <li> I wanted a pair wide enough for my thick toenails.</li>
            <li> From the reviews, I expected something of at least similar quality, but they aren&#x27;t even close.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 pair they are not as sharp as the black ones that are for sale made by tweezerman.</li>
            <li> but they work if you try hard enough.</li>
            <li> sharp cutting edge slices right through the thickest</li>
            <li> The one complaint is true that using them on your fingernails can feel a bit weird, it still works..</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t have a nail file attached.</li>
            <li> and I realised how much better it was than the Duane Read bought crap I had at home.</li>
            <li> I would like to find a unit where I do not get carpals of the hand every time I try to push down on these toenail cutters.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman&#x27;s products never let you down.  </li>
            <li> however the edges on the body are not rounded and are a little sharp after a while</li>
            <li> The flat cutter is really hard to work with</li>
            <li> Very sharp and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Pros: Very sharp, well made, looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sharp and well built..</li>
            <li> Heavy, well-designed, sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> they are very sharp and effortless to use</li>
            <li> OK but not very easy to use for cutting tough toenails.</li>
            <li> Odd shape.</li>
            <li> I previously bought another Tweezeman product (the travel tweezer) which I adore.  </li>
            <li> Blade has a slight curve as can be seen in the photos.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a slight roundness to it&#x27;s cut.</li>
            <li> They really mess up your finger/toenails, just get a curved one.</li>
            <li> Like I said, these are not as well-made as the Seki&#x27;s and they don&#x27;t cut as easily, but they don&#x27;t leave that annoying sharp-edge either and are less than 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> Cutting edges are ok,  holding the clipper when using it is uncomfortable due to the square corners and edges,  would not have bought this item</li>
            <li> otherwise they will not cleanly cut your nails.</li>
            <li> They are a little flimsier than i thought they would be but they still work...</li>
            <li> sometimes a nail that has been injured may grow in crooked or very thick.</li>
            <li> Cutting edge/blade is almost straight.</li>
            <li> Looks heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> Waste of $$$$ YFR</li>
            <li> A few years ago I bought Mehaz Toenail clippers from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> THESE WERE A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> (I use these to clip dead skin off my heels)</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s missing the nail cleaner and nail file.</li>
            <li> They never clipped evenly, left pieces behind, and were semi-rusted junk,</li>
            <li> Not a smooth cut.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> That was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Need a clipper which is sharp and has the leverage to trim those those thick and impossible-to-trim nails which are ruining your socks?</li>
            <li> These tweezers are sharp and cut thick toenails like butter.  </li>
            <li> It packs a powerful clipping punch, making toenail cutting a breeze (even for my kickboxing beaten up ones!).</li>
            <li> However, being unable to find the same quality scissors as a pair that I misplaced, I bought these clippers.  </li>
            <li> Needs very little pressure to clip even  the toughest nails.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad thing, its just that it feels very &#x27;tool like&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Most of the clippers sold at drug stores, Target, etc nowadays are terrible.  </li>
            <li> and then it sends a small shock-wave through your finger...</li>
            <li> the cutting action slips each time.</li>
            <li> Pro quality product, no more rusted nail clippers.</li>
            <li> This is a very painful process, and so is the process of the nail growing back over all the nerve endings that would normally be under the nail.</li>
            <li> Very Heavy Duty.</li>
            <li> The offset is not major but they are definitely not perfectly in line.</li>
            <li> However, I needed sharp because my nails are thick and tough.  </li>
            <li> Having really thick nails not many clippers will cut them;being that they look acrylic, I also like to cut them in a square shape.</li>
            <li> They are so dull, they couldn&#x27;t even cut paper.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s bulky, hard to cut.</li>
            <li> :  Maybe because the cutting edges are so sharp, the resulting cut toenails will be SHARP!  </li>
            <li> so you gotta be a little careful when cutting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a different, and dangerous, ballgame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cutting them in an arc like you do with fingernails, can and eventually will cause an ingrown toenail which if not taken care of, will result in having to get the entire nail removed.</li>
            <li> The cutting ends do not make contact at the same time.</li>
            <li> lot&#x27;s of room for thick nails like mine.</li>
            <li> My toenails are freakin thick as a 2x4.</li>
            <li> When you squeeze the tweezers together, you will see what I mean yourself.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll understand what I mean.  </li>
            <li> Flat cutting edge</li>
            <li> I also bought toenail clippers, but these work just fine on my toenails (and I have weird, ugly toenails!).  </li>
            <li> the edges of the tool are very rough and angular, making them uncomfortable to hold, and the distance between the clipping blades is so narrow that it is difficult to get them around even moderately thick nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After years of struggling with awful finger and toe nail clippers, I simply had enough.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them on my toenails and don&#x27;t intend to, they are for cutting loose and excess materials on shoes/clothing and they work like a charm.</li>
            <li> The convex cutting edge baffles my mind- so useless!</li>
            <li> My old clippers just mangled the crap out of them.</li>
            <li> The slit between the cutting edges opens to less than 1/16\\&quot;, which makes it trial and error to position it over my nails, which aren&#x27;t thick.  </li>
            <li> I was really unhappy with this because I thought this was a sharp pair, or precision nail clipper</li>
            <li> I have very hard toenails</li>
            <li> I like the straight edge as opposed to the curved type; this will help prevent ingrown toenails, which are horribly painful!!</li>
            <li> Nobody has broken them yet.</li>
            <li> The distance between cutting edges is very tight.</li>
            <li> These are by far the very worst toenail clippers I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This is the second pair I&#x27;ve tried and both Tweezernan clippers were terrible,</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand, they seem quite durable too.</li>
            <li> SORRY</li>
            <li> However, to me, it feels weird because I&#x27;m used to clippers &amp;#34;snapping&amp;#34; the nail off.</li>
            <li> just overall awful.  </li>
            <li> Just expensive clippers.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to get my toenails between the pincers to get an even clip.  </li>
            <li> Worthless for thick toenails.</li>
            <li> I would put off cutting my toenails until they were poking through my expensive business socks.</li>
            <li> I was sick and tired of those nail clippers that curve, and curve sharper than my toenail, making it very difficult to cut my toenails with any precision.</li>
            <li> Well this was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Bad choice.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with these clippers.</li>
            <li> I hate to say it, but it took me forever to locate a pair like these</li>
            <li> These Tweezerman nail clippers aren&#x27;t the worst, but I found them tearing the nails instead of cleanly cutting them.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!</li>
            <li> These are the worst clippers I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It will cut through my nasty toenails like its butter.</li>
            <li> of the worst pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever seen,</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great clippers and service.</li>
            <li> Clips nails just fine.  Looks heavy duty.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a good, sharp, accurate toenail cutter. It is straight across, not shaped in any way. There is no emery tool.</li>
            <li> they work so good you have to be careful not to cut off too much lol</li>
            <li> High quality. I definitely prefer the straight blade over curved.</li>
            <li> Really good quality clippers.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well enough.  Wish I could get one with a convex blade.</li>
            <li> This will be a strange review. I LOVE these professional clippers. Not for clipping my toenails but for clipping wire that I use in my jewelry designs!!! These do a wonderful job of &#x27;flush&#x27; cutting my wire. They are easily stuck in my pocket so they are handy no matter where I am in my shop. Because they are stainless steel, they are doing a wonderful job DAILY in my shop....and....yes, I have used them on my toenails! LOL Even after using them as a wire cutter, they cut my toenails perfectly!!! Great clippers!</li>
            <li> good solid build however the edges on the body are not rounded and are a little sharp after a while</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price. You can&#x27;t ask for more than that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and durable. Super happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with these clippers. I bought 2 pair they are not as sharp as the black ones that are for sale made by tweezerman. I do not think I will buy this style again.</li>
            <li> very good clipper, cuts well</li>
            <li> Just received my clippers, was excited to have a quality clipper that works!!!!!!!!  WRONG!!! the cheap pair I bought from Walmart opens up a lot wider. Very disappointed. I wanted a pair wide enough for my thick toenails. Waste of $$$$ YFR</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these clippers, unfortunately there is a huge design fail. These clippers do NOT cut clean and I finally know why. When you squeeze the tweezers together, you will see what I mean yourself. The two blades on the clippers DO NOT LINE UP! That means they will bend and rip your toe nail rather than cleanly clip them. The offset is not major but they are definitely not perfectly in line. If you want a good pair of clippers they are going to have to be perfectly in line to get a clean cut otherwise they will not cleanly cut your nails. That aside, they do cut pretty well, though I&#x27;m not personally a big fan of stainless steel. I don&#x27;t know if all the clippers are this way or if I just got defective ones. Either way, completely unacceptable. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest ordering these and taking a chance.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, built to last.</li>
            <li> Great product. Sturdy, sharp and perfect size.</li>
            <li> Well, there is not much to say about a toe nail clippers.  Either they work or they don&#x27;t.  These work.  I actually bought 3 different toe nail clippers.  They are all about the same.  The big plus for me is these have straight blade, not curved.</li>
            <li> Worthless for thick toenails. The distance between cutting edges is very tight. For 5 dollars you can find a much more suitable instrument at Walgreens for less than 5 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with nail cutters,,,finger or toe,,, over the years is that those made in Korea have always been superior to those made elsewhere. Have no idea why this is.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the effort to return nor even to review,,,</li>
            <li> The flat cutter is really hard to work with</li>
            <li> Good heavy duty toenail clippers ... The finish is kind of dull color so hope it doesn&#x27;t rust.  I just wish they&#x27;d put silicone grips on all clippers in general. Maybe I&#x27;m just dreaming.</li>
            <li> This tool chops through the thickest of toe nails with ease.  I like the stainless steel as it can be cleaned and rinsed with relative ease.  Although the clippers are large they fit in my hands quite well with no fear of slipping.  I prefer the straight cut of the blades over the convex or concave shapes.  The clippers are made in China but are sharp and finished quite well.  These should last a few years of continual use before they get end up in my tackle box.  Glad they won&#x27;t rust.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Good product for the money.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I bought Mehaz Toenail clippers from Amazon.  They worked pretty good but I thought it might be time for something new.  I decided to try Tweezerman because I love their tweezer products.  Bad choice.  The Mehaz clippers seem to be much sharper and take much less force to actually clip the nail.  They are not perfect but better than the tweezerman for sure.</li>
            <li> made n China I think.  Either cheap steel or not very sharp; Doesn&#x27;t give a nice, clean, crisp cut.</li>
            <li> just came today, someone said on a review its a 1/16 for a bite well its more like an 1?8 an will do better than the one I got last week for more $</li>
            <li> Very good toe nail clippers and so glaad I have them.  I recommend these.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my workplace had them in their bathrooms and I realised how much better it was than the Duane Read bought crap I had at home. This thing is VERY sharp, very solidly built - love it.</li>
            <li> Love the name. Love the straight-edge. Functions nicely. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Good solid clippers.  Ancient feet get super tough nails and these are up to the job.</li>
            <li> If you are used to your normal nail clippers that your mom gave you, you are gonna mess yourself up with these. This is like when you are used to wrestling with a puppy and then you try to fight a homeless guy. It&#x27;s just a different, and dangerous, ballgame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, they do work exceptionally well. Just don&#x27;t cut off the tips of your fingers.</li>
            <li> These clippers do not appear to be as sturdy as other reviewers have stated.  They bend quite a bit, as if they may break.  There is not as much room between the clipper edges as I would like, in fact the space is narrower than any of our regular clippers.  I got these for my husband, who has very thick toenails, and I don&#x27;t think these will be strong enough to withstand his tough nails.</li>
            <li> These are much better than conventional clippers.</li>
            <li> Love these! Very sturdy, large enough even for your big toes, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap for the price. Will be re-buying.</li>
            <li> Need a clipper which is sharp and has the leverage to trim those those thick and impossible-to-trim nails which are ruining your socks? This is the one you need! Highly recommended. My nails were in a mess until I finally broke down and purchased the Tweezerman. Now, even tho&#x27; not pretty, are properly straight and short enough for me. Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long!</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. Going from a 5+ year old pair of grocery store clippers to these was magical.</li>
            <li> Did good cutting my toenails which are usually thick. I like that it&#x27;s a straight cut blade. It cuts more accurately.</li>
            <li> These are OK.  Not the best, but fairly decent.  I bought them as a second pair to my Seki Edge clippers.  From the reviews, I expected something of at least similar quality, but they aren&#x27;t even close.  They&#x27;re certainly better than a lot of the cheap clippers I&#x27;ve had in the past, but it takes quite a bit of force to cut my toenails with them.  If you&#x27;re looking for something very high quality, I would look elsewhere.  But if you&#x27;re just looking for something cheap that gets the job done, these are pretty nice for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were supposed to be sharp.  They are!  However, I needed sharp because my nails are thick and tough.  The opening on these is not wide enough.  I thought that the straight cut made sense; but if you are used to curved blade, stay with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my 25 year old Cook clippers (made in USA).</li>
            <li> I basically ordered this clipper for my finger nails. I like to keep my finger nails square and this is just the perfect tool to maintain those. You just have to smooth down the edges of the nail, if you dont want sharp square edges, but rest of the nail shape is taken care of by this clipper whereas when I use a nail clipper with curved edge, I always end up clipping more nail than I intend to and its not perfectly square either. Its sharp and clips the nail in just one try. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Professional-grade nail cutter that is above the rest. Loving this product so much!</li>
            <li> Best clippers on the market</li>
            <li> I kept buying those &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; clippers at the stores only to get them home and find out that they can&#x27;t even cut through a piece of thread. These suckers provide a perfectly even cut every time. I haven&#x27;t used them on my toenails and don&#x27;t intend to, they are for cutting loose and excess materials on shoes/clothing and they work like a charm.</li>
            <li> These are the worst clippers I have ever used.  They are so dull, they couldn&#x27;t even cut paper. This is the second pair I&#x27;ve tried and both Tweezernan clippers were terrible,</li>
            <li> had no problem tackling my unruely man nails</li>
            <li> The convex cutting edge baffles my mind- so useless! I made the mistake of not looking closely enough at these to notice before I ordered them. Guess I&#x27;ll use these to cut wire for craft projects or something.</li>
            <li> Somewhat hard to fit curved part of the nail inside the trimmer.</li>
            <li> These toenail clippers are the best I have ever used!</li>
            <li> 52 year old male and my nails are thick. Tweezerman is solid and safely cuts them.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty and works great.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, great quality clippers! I like the straight edge as opposed to the curved type; this will help prevent ingrown toenails, which are horribly painful!! These toenail clippers are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have been using this &amp;#34;toenail clipper&amp;#34; since 2013.  I use them to cut my fingernails straight and so far, it hasn&#x27;t lost its sharpness, two years later, it still works perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for some unknown reason, its beginning to rust!?  It is supposed to be &amp;#34;stainless steel&amp;#34; and I do keep them in a drawer nice and clean but they are beginning to show some rust spots that cannot be removed.  So I&#x27;m thinking that they are not really stainless steel but for what I need it, which is to cut my fingernails straight, it has done an excellent job.</li>
            <li> I really like this clipper. I use it on my fingernails to maintain a square look. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, very strong. Can probably cut a copper wire even. I use this for both fingernails and toenails.</li>
            <li> only drawback is that its a little too sharp for my liking</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp, but my main beef with this clipper is that it&#x27;s not curved. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but what&#x27;s the point of having a straight edge on these? If I saw it I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it... Now I&#x27;m looking for a one with a curved edge. It makes cutting nails more convenient (and safe.) Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you can still trim your nails with it, but then the little nail cutoff pieces will fly all over your room...</li>
            <li> These tweezers are sharp and cut thick toenails like butter.  the clippings do fly however, so be prepared for that.  The straight clippers make it easier to get in close, especially on the ends, but they will leave jagged nails that should be filed off after or you may make holey socks and possibly damage your mate in the middle of the night.  It only takes a few minutes to file off the jaggies.  So men... don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s less masculine to file, it is only good grooming.</li>
            <li> I have lost several pairs of clippers. This purchase was on other reviews of the product. I keep the clippers on the bed stand.</li>
            <li> I compared it to a regular (no name) toenail clipper having curved jaws. My first impression is the difference in finish between the two. It doesn&#x27;t take a trained eye to notice that it is stainless steel instead of chrome plating, as on the regular. Then of course I saw that its jaws were quite straight (checked them against the edge of a steel pocket ruler) and perfectly aligned. The next difference is its greater spring rate. Frankly though I don&#x27;t think it needed a stiffer leaf spring than is on the regular clipper. Next I compared how the two worked. I can defnitely corroborate previous reports that the Tweezerman causes my largest toenail to make a relatively silent snapping sound. However, both clippers did an equally neat job. I&#x27;m going to hold onto the regular clipper for use on all but my big toe, because the curvature of its jaws is too small for that nail only.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very solid product.  I have been using these about a month now, still cut just as easy.  The one complaint is true that using them on your fingernails can feel a bit weird, it still works..but I always feel like I may cut too much off.  That said for toe nails as advertised, they are perfect.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand, they seem quite durable too.</li>
            <li> Durability and reliability Tweezerman famous for</li>
            <li> Very well-made.  Professional grade.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my gym. Nobody has broken them yet.</li>
            <li> Works as I had hoped, but it seems to have a bit of a rough finish.</li>
            <li> THESE WERE A WASTE OF MONEY. THEY DO NOT WORK WORTH A DARN.  SORRY</li>
            <li> Perfect! Sharp, easy to use. Better than Zwilling.</li>
            <li> Okay, not the best out there.</li>
            <li> The main advantage of this product is that it actually does the job, dependably and cleanly. You don&#x27;t have to look at the toenail after you use Tweezerman to make sure that it did the job all the way across. The product was available at a low price from Amazon when it was not available at all from local stores.</li>
            <li> never going back to non tweezerman after this</li>
            <li> These serve the purpose but not as well as I expected.  I have very hard toenails and these seem to require more force than I am comfortable with to get hold of and cut thru the nail.</li>
            <li> Excellent toenail clipper.  We had several in the house, down to one which is a curved clipper.  The straight clipper is our preference.  This does a great job clipping, even on hard to cut toenails.</li>
            <li> Works great! Used it for several months now and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it or seen any rust on it.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and sharp. Slices through the nail. However, to me, it feels weird because I&#x27;m used to clippers &amp;#34;snapping&amp;#34; the nail off.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Solidly built, very sharp.</li>
            <li> Rugged and just the right size for toenails.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find the straight edge in most stores.  Not much to say but that it is very sharp and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper is very well made and I like the wide design. It allows me to cut my entire nail with just a single clip! O highly recommend! Very sharp, stainless steel finish.</li>
            <li> The blade is flat unlike a typical curved blade nail clipper. This requires more attention and 3-4 more snips per nail. Not to mention that the blade doesn&#x27;t cut nicely and leaves a weird jagged edge.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Sharp, straight edges are so much better than the curved edge clippers we have in Australia. Ideal for finger nails as well as toe nails.</li>
            <li> Real professional equipment !!!</li>
            <li> Just got them and used today. Well made, sharp and strong. Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Very sharp but too straight across.</li>
            <li> These are definitely well-made clippers that cut a straight line, not a curved one. Sturdily made and they give you good control when cutting toenails. Definitely recommend these if you&#x27;re looking for a straight toenail clipper.</li>
            <li> This is the manliest toenail clipper I could find.  I wanted something hardcore and built to last.  Lets face it, most men don&#x27;t need two sets of clippers, we would rather use one for hands and feet!  This clipper is built-well and has been able to clip everything I have thrown at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only point I want to throw out there is that it doesn&#x27;t have any clipping &amp;#34;storage&amp;#34; found in other clippers.  So if your wife complains that she finds toenails on the floor, we can all blame you for buying this device.  Or you can responsibly pick up after yourself, or clip responsibly in the shower, tool shed, gym locker room, or other manly areas where the evidence can be discarded or hidden.  Enjoy yourself responsibly as these clippers are built to last!</li>
            <li> Finally a clipper with a straight edge!  They work so much better than curved edge that may or may not fit the curve of your toes. They work perfectly on even the toughest nails.</li>
            <li> These clippers offer a clean crisp cut. Easy to use. Does not come with nail file attached. Best clippers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great toenail clipper, just right for my toenails!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice set of clippers.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not as good as the Clippi&#x27;s. They seem to be well made and should last you several years (if you don&#x27;t lose them like I seemingly always do!).  However, these were cheaper than Clippis. I would rate them just a notch below them. They worked very well and seem to be very well made. I would rate them a very solid 8.0 to 8.5 out of ten - recommended for all!</li>
            <li> These clippers have a straight cutter. They cut great. Way better than the drugstore kind and a lot better than my dull ones that I&#x27;ve had for 10 yrs. Old ones used to be sharp years ago but got dull and I needed to find new clippers. These work well and are so sharp.</li>
            <li> Quality nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I thought that the clippers would be larger-my husband has mega-toenails.  I do think they do a  good job of clipping.  I wish the shipping wasn&#x27;t so high.</li>
            <li> Wanted a larger clipper for squaring off my nails.  Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find straight toe nail clippers anymore &amp; these are great! (I use these to clip dead skin off my heels)</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I use this to cut my guinea pigs nails.  This clipper is big enough so that I can hold it steady in one hand and a squirming guinea pig in the other.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers to remove skin tags. They work amazingly for this task because they are very sharp and have a straight cutting surface.</li>
            <li> My mother has lacked the strength to cut her own nails until I purchased these clippers.  They are extraordinarily well made and designed for ease of use.</li>
            <li> Needing a heavy duty clipper, this clipper suits that need very well. Very sharp, lightweight yet strong. Just arrived, used only once so far, and very impressed.</li>
            <li> Great clippers. Very sharp and sturdy.</li>
            <li> These are worth the money, the straight cut takes a little getting used to not ever using one before but they are sharp, leave a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my dad for Christmas last year.&lt;br /&gt;He has toenails like eagle talons and he gives them two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> After watching other nail clippers fly apart at effort, it&#x27;s fantastic to find this. It&#x27;s much larger and heavier than I considered, but this thing rocks! The best nail clippers ever!</li>
            <li> Most of the clippers sold at drug stores, Target, etc nowadays are terrible.  You have to squeeze super hard for the blades to finally press through and then it sends a small shock-wave through your finger...they&#x27;re just overall awful.  These are MUCH better and definitely worth $8.  I had some Seki Edge&#x27;s ($20, and made in Japan) which were clearly better-made and heavier-duty than these, but they left a really sharp edge on the nail that I didn&#x27;t like so I figured I&#x27;d give these a shot.  Like I said, these are not as well-made as the Seki&#x27;s and they don&#x27;t cut as easily, but they don&#x27;t leave that annoying sharp-edge either and are less than 1/2 the price. And, again, they are much better than Revlon and similar brands that you will find at drug stores.  Unfortunately they are made in China, but overall they are good quality and fairly priced.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Does the job extremely well.</li>
            <li> Cheap regular chrome clippers seem to do a better job and have sharper blades for a finer cut.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a straight cut toenail clipper and I was happy to find this one.  A bit more expensive than most but it has worked well and I&#x27;m glad for the straight cut to help prevent ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> Very Heavy Duty. Though it&#x27;s missing the nail cleaner and nail file.</li>
            <li> People of Amazon: thank you for writing thoughtful reviews for seemingly inane products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of struggling with awful finger and toe nail clippers, I simply had enough. They never clipped evenly, left pieces behind, and were semi-rusted junk, regardless of what I spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the kind folks on Amazon, the Tweezerman Pro is now in my life. This clipper is a beast, an incredibly efficient tool where struggling against nails is now a thing of the past. It packs a powerful clipping punch, making toenail cutting a breeze (even for my kickboxing beaten up ones!). You literally don&#x27;t struggle even 1% against nail surfaces. On fingers, a little more caution is needed (due to said lack of resistance). Still - and again - what a joy to realize nail clipping doesn&#x27;t have to be a chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five deserving stars to the Tweezerman Pro. 10 stars for the Amazon community for posting their reviews of it.</li>
            <li> The slit between the cutting edges opens to less than 1/16\\&quot;, which makes it trial and error to position it over my nails, which aren&#x27;t thick.  Other similar clippers I have open twice as wide and are much easier and quicker to use.  That it&#x27;s stainless steel and won&#x27;t rust is a plus, and the blades are sharp, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t any good. Not very sharp. Odd shape. Leave my nails all funny.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these because I have children.  Huh?  No- they don&#x27;t have unusual nails, they LOSE THINGS!  How many nail clippers do you suppose you&#x27;ve ever owned?  These things don&#x27;t really wear out so much as they get lost, or dare I say stolen?  Ooooooh!  He went there!  Yes, there is no doubt a dangerous nail clipper cartel that burgles only clippers from the innocent.  Where&#x27;s Geraldo when you need him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nail clipper cartels aside, these would be better with a nail file.</li>
            <li> Very good sturdy clippers, this item will probably last me forever!</li>
            <li> These are great toenail clippers. All toenail clippers actually should be a straight edge as you are supposed to cut your toenails straight across. Cutting them in an arc like you do with fingernails, can and eventually will cause an ingrown toenail which if not taken care of, will result in having to get the entire nail removed. This is a very painful process, and so is the process of the nail growing back over all the nerve endings that would normally be under the nail.</li>
            <li> Cutting edges are ok,  holding the clipper when using it is uncomfortable due to the square corners and edges,  would not have bought this item had I known this is the case,  may find it necessary to stop using it for those reasons,  so therefore I can&#x27;t say I am&lt;br /&gt;happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very, very sharp and cut perfectly straight. Arrived on time; packaged well.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  A simple, effective, straight toenail clipper.</li>
            <li> Perfect toenail clipper that cuts straight, preventing ingrown toenails on my big toes.  I hate to say it, but it took me forever to locate a pair like these then I found Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wanted a good straight edge clipper. This is great--nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> Great Product, arrived in time!</li>
            <li> fits big nails for us big guys like a breeze</li>
            <li> HIgh quality, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The clippers are perfectly straight as shown, and align properly. The metal quality and finish is even nicer than it looks on here. Especially at the price I bought it for, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I Only Buy Tweezerman Products, These Stainless Steel Toenail Clippers Are Well Made Easy To Use Will Not Rust Like Other Clippers, Great Price, The Best You Can Buy</li>
            <li> Very good quality toenail clipper that seems like it will last a long time. No complaints so far in my use.</li>
            <li> Well made - looks like it will last forever.</li>
            <li> Strong, sharp, durable.  I&#x27;ve used Tweezerman products for years.  They clearly are superior to most other drug store available clippers.</li>
            <li> I prefer toenail scissors to clippers, personally.  However, being unable to find the same quality scissors as a pair that I misplaced, I bought these clippers.  I&#x27;ve used them, after a shower (so the nails are more pliable), on both my toenails and my fingernails.  They seem to be well made, and they do the job.  It would be nice if there were a bit of curve to the blades, though.  I noted with interest that these were actually easier to use on one of my toenails than the scissors that I favor - I have one toenail that grows with a split in the middle of it, so there are three sections of nail (the center grows independently of the sides) and the clippers make it easier to trim the odd pieces.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are straight and sharp. I was sick and tired of those nail clippers that curve, and curve sharper than my toenail, making it very difficult to cut my toenails with any precision. These are straight, not curved, and its easy to cut my toenails. I feel like a sculptor. I would put off cutting my toenails until they were poking through my expensive business socks. It was quite stressful. My quality of life drastically improved after using these, and I wish I did so sooner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good so far, it&#x27;s nice and sharp so you gotta be a little careful when cutting. My first &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; clippers and the 5$ was worth it.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used. Blades are sharp and have perfect apposition/alignment. Cuts through thick man-nails like a hot knife through butter. Only knock is the &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; blade design, which leaves you needing to clip each nail once or twice more to keep it rounded. But overall, I&#x27;m super happy with it.</li>
            <li> High quality, heavy duty.</li>
            <li> This are super sharp and powerful clippers! Be careful the first time you use them but then you will be use to their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find toenail clippers that cut the nail straight across.  These fit the bill.  They are strong and cut well.</li>
            <li> These clippers are sharp and very sturdy.  I also bought toenail clippers, but these work just fine on my toenails (and I have weird, ugly toenails!).  I&#x27;ve purchased multiple clippers to replace the cheap ones I had around the house.  The price was great too.  I&#x27;ll probably buy a couple more soon.  My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t have a nail file attached.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman really did a great job with these toenail clippers.  They require so little effort and are large enough to get a good grip on.  There is a tiny spot of rust color stain on one small spot but it hasn&#x27;t spread or anything so item still really happy with, it just seems to be surface to it doesn&#x27;t have any rough texture near the rust stain.  They also haven&#x27;t lost any of there sharpness.  I would buy these again even for the price (which isn&#x27;t cheap)</li>
            <li> Need to buy again....works very well</li>
            <li> These are my favorite nail clippers. The straight clippers are less harsh on your nails.</li>
            <li> These clippers are so sharp that most cuts can hardly be heard compared to cheap drug store kind. Must have.</li>
            <li> Since childhood, I&#x27;ve been plagued by ingrown toenail. When I finally sought medical treatment, the doctor recommended the best prevention is cutting toenails straight across (not curved). The Tweezeman Toenail Clipper gets the job done effortlessly! I&#x27;ve been able to avoid getting ingrown toenail successfully for some time now!</li>
            <li> Very sharp. Cuts in a straight line.</li>
            <li> finally. a toenail clipper that doesn&#x27;t curve into my nail! thank you.</li>
            <li> I owed a pair of these before and they are by far the best clippers I have ever used! They are sharp and fabulous, I was so excited to find them on Amazon the best place in the world.</li>
            <li> Rugged. Not a smooth cut. I was really unhappy with this because I thought this was a sharp pair, or precision nail clipper, it&#x27;s bulky, hard to cut. Avoid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at all the positive reviews for this product! These are by far the very worst toenail clippers I have ever used! the edges of the tool are very rough and angular, making them uncomfortable to hold, and the distance between the clipping blades is so narrow that it is difficult to get them around even moderately thick nails. I have returned to a cheap pair of drugstore clippers with superior performance, and donated these to GoodWill.</li>
            <li> Very useful and efficient. Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> We have been searching for a good toe nail clipper for a while, the search is over!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the quality and sharpness of these nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Well made. Sturdy and sharp. Needs very little pressure to clip even  the toughest nails. Even use it on my fingernails. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice clippers.  I strongly prefer the straight edge instead of the curved cutting edge on other models.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman products work well for me. Good quality and clipping strength.</li>
            <li> I tested it out on a toenail. It cut the toenail off with ease. Much nicer then the ones by the checkout at the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Not as much leverage as I expected. My toenails are like concrete. I would like to find a unit where I do not get carpals of the hand every time I try to push down on these toenail cutters.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality, but work.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman still makes the best clippers for the price.  Have been using this brand for a very long time and can always tell a difference between this brand and a dollar store brand.  These clippers are sharp and make a nice clean cut.  Dull clippers require more pressure to actually cut the nail, not a problem with this brand.  Def recommend these!!</li>
            <li> Pros: Very sharp, well made, looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Flat front, no under the nail cleaner thingy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never seen a pair of clippers with a flat front. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a brand thing or a professional pinky in the air thing. It takes some getting used to. I wasn&#x27;t paying close enough attention and didn&#x27;t see that it didn&#x27;t have the little nail file with an under the nail cleaner thingy I would have not gotten this thing. Because of the flat front you get a lot more sharp edges that need to be filed down. Also I&#x27;m a working man and get dirt under my nails a lot, so a that little under the nail thingy is very nice to have. I just have to keep my old clippers around for the cleaning and filing purpose.</li>
            <li> This toenail clipper works well. It was sharp and clipped nicely. Only time will tell if this holds true. My only complaint is that the nails seem to come off in small portions thus more nails to fly every where. All in all it seems well constructed. Not a bad clipper for the price.</li>
            <li> They really mess up your finger/toenails, just get a curved one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use (good leverage), but cut shape is too square</li>
            <li> These work great, well made</li>
            <li> Pricey but seem like they&#x27;ll last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a generic &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; clipper. Cutting was just ok, nothing special. Also size was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> While the build quality looks good, using it during the first cut the cutting edge slips forward. Instead of each blade lined up precisely on top of each-other, one is spaced forward with an over-bite and the cutting action slips each time.</li>
            <li> Found just what I wanted for square nails and the end results are precise and neat looking nails. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> These are well made. Far superior to the ones you find in the drug store. I bought these as a stocking stuffer for my husband, and they ended up being his favorite gift.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those who have don&#x27;t have rounded nails. Solid construction. Rib design on handle gives you a solid grip. Thanks to vendor for prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Beautiful design and great functionality. They feel like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This purchase is working well, I am happy and satisfied.</li>
            <li> Since it has that straight edge t does a good job of cutting straight across your nails making it easier to shape your nails square-tipped as opposed to using a regular nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Nicer than a typical clipper, with very well-aligned blades that yield a smooth cut. Many toenail clippers have too sharp a curve to work well, so the straight cutting edge is a plus for many users.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are nice size GOOD weight......what more can you say.......</li>
            <li> These work great!!! Very sharp and precise</li>
            <li> Pro quality product, no more rusted nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Y&#x27;know, they&#x27;re tweezers, and they work as you would expect. Seem thick and high quality.</li>
            <li> Cutting edge/blade is almost straight. I like it convex but minor point.&lt;br /&gt;Stainless is cool, should last FOREVER</li>
            <li> As others have indicated, these are not convex as illustrated but straight, but they still do a better job on my big toe than concave ones. I have misplaced the convex one I had and have dfficulty replacing it.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Extremely well made - this thing feels solid!&lt;br /&gt;Very sharp cutting edge slices right through the thickest toenails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Maybe because the cutting edges are so sharp, the resulting cut toenails will be SHARP!  Imagine laser-cut steel and the resulting edge and you&#x27;ll understand what I mean.  These clippers necessitate the use of a file to smooth off the sharp edges of your freshly cut toenails, but there is no built-in filing surface!  That&#x27;s my only criticism of an otherwise well made and reasonably priced clipper.</li>
            <li> Very goof maneuvering</li>
            <li> Love these clippers! Best ones I&#x27;ve had in years. Cuts the nail with no tearing or ragged edges! Recommend this item highly.</li>
            <li> Just a well made product that works  great even on thick toe nails.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman Professional Stainless Steel Toenail Clipper s OK but not very easy to use for cutting tough toenails. It doesn&#x27;t have strong enough blade.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Flat cutting edge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- These things are huge, so you won&#x27;t be able to operate these easily unless your hands are large.&lt;br /&gt;- Since the cutting edge is flat, you&#x27;ll have to clip 2 or 3 times more on each nail.  This creates a large number of clippings, and they fly all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;- Poor quality.  These clippers started to come apart on me within six months of normal use.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered the toenail clippers instead of the fingernail ones but these do just fine and are much better than the pair of nail clippers that cost twice as much. I&#x27;ll be ordering a pair of their actual fingernail clippers next.</li>
            <li> lot&#x27;s of room for thick nails like mine. Very sharp and well built..</li>
            <li> Recieved it quickly , and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> great clippers. i use it for my fingernails and toes. i love the straight edge fingernail look instead of round. so it is perfect and sturdy.</li>
            <li> These are tweezers, larger sized, and they work well.  Not too much to say here.  The grip is easy thanks to the ridged design where you grip the ends for leverage.  I was satisfied with the price, and think they do the job well for the money.</li>
            <li> Heavy, well-designed, sharp. I fully expect this to last for some years. Other than that, it&#x27;s relatively unremarkable.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Stocking stuffers for the post teen sons.  Every few years I have to buy new clippers because they disappear to &amp;#34;who knows where&amp;#34; and I always buy tweezerman products because one time I didn&#x27;t.  That was a waste of time and money. Tweezerman &#x3D; Quality Product</li>
            <li> Great solid tweezers. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Well this was disappointing.  They literally fell apart in my hand the first time I used them.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out home to reassemble it, so they went into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While they are stainless steel, they are not as heavy as the old rusty cheap ones that I was replacing.  Weight is not the most important factor, but I can&#x27;t come up with a reason for anyone to buy these.</li>
            <li> great size, great price</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Works just as expected and meets all of my needs.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of cheap clippers out there that tear instead of cut.  Tweezerman&#x27;s products never let you down.  These are not the least expensive but they work great.</li>
            <li> Best toenail clippers I&#x27;ve ever had, that&#x27;s all I can say. Well, I guess I can say more. They make a straight across cut as they should (rather than curved), and I don&#x27;t have to apply 5 tons pounds of pressure to get them to snip (yes, I&#x27;m an exaggerator), and they are made of stainless steel so they should be around for awhile without being damaged by moisture. Also, they didn&#x27;t cost too very much, which is a real nice plus.</li>
            <li> This clipper is well made and sharp, but its just a bit &#x27;machined&#x27; in feel.  There is no part of it that isn&#x27;t squared off.  This isn&#x27;t a bad thing, its just that it feels very &#x27;tool like&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. They are solid, sturdy, amazingly smooth, and so very worth the few extra dollars I paid for them. I really don&#x27;t expect to ever have to buy another pair again (Tweezerman offers lifetime sharpening). I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> The convex blades work great, much better than regular concave cutters.</li>
            <li> These are good quaility and cut nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t think of too much to review about a pair of nail clippers, except that they are good quaility and serve the intended purpose without any issues.  The price seemed a little bit too much for what it is, however, but it&#x27;s a good product, and saved a trip to the store.</li>
            <li> Awesome product..sharp enough to cut the hardest toe nail...</li>
            <li> Just expensive clippers.</li>
            <li> It does a professional job... what more can you say!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of toenail clippers, these are the best! I won&#x27;t use anything else. I am replacing every grooming device I have with Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> I have always owned the typical curved edge tweezers, and as a nurse, I know you are supposed to cut straight across, then file the edges. Well now I can, and I&#x27;m really happy with them.</li>
            <li> These Tweezerman nail clippers aren&#x27;t the worst, but I found them tearing the nails instead of cleanly cutting them. I think this product setback comes from the clippers being unconventionality straight, as opposed to the traditional curved design.</li>
            <li> The clippers aren&#x27;t perfectly aligned with each other.</li>
            <li> Very affective and strong enough to cut the thickest of nails. Having really thick nails not many clippers will cut them;being that they look acrylic, I also like to cut them in a square shape. This has helped achieve that look.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, very durable toenail clippers!!!  Couldn&#x27;t have purchased a better one!</li>
            <li> I love these clippers!! I use them for my fingers bc I am a nail addict and paint them 2-3 times a week and i like the square shape. They clip nice and evenly and they are very durable</li>
            <li> Just what the MASTER wanted. Now he wants two more...silly man. He likes square straight edge..not the rounded curved model...this is the one.</li>
            <li> sure it&#x27;s indestructible but not even close to sharp enough, metal way too thick at end, hard to fit around nails</li>
            <li> I previously bought another Tweezeman product (the travel tweezer) which I adore.  The toenail clipper, however, did not live up to its standard.  I have an old one in a cracking plastic case that works better than this one.  It is difficult to get my toenails between the pincers to get an even clip.  it may be my toenails, but it just doesn&#x27;t work as I expected.</li>
            <li> Well made clippers, cuts nails easily.</li>
            <li> Like the flat edge, works so much better than a curved edge. Quality product, recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> OK clipper. Not much space between the blades</li>
            <li> This does a good job. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty, fantastic clippers. It will cut through my nasty toenails like its butter.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my Dad who prefers to use straight-edge nail clippers as opposed to the curved-edge nail clippers. When they arrived, I tried them on my own finger nails. The cutting edge is sharper than your old nail clippers but, not by as much as one should expect. Nice stainless steel with matte finish and not really that large. Really nothing special but, they get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - unless you really need/want a straight-edge nail clipper, buy the MEHAZ Professional Toenail clipper (model 662) for the same price as this Tweezerman. They are sharper and fit your hand much more comfortably.</li>
            <li> I have thick toenails so these are great for me. They are a little flimsier than i thought they would be but they still work...</li>
            <li> This just doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough power or sharpness to cut through my nails even though I don&#x27;t really have very thick nails.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to want to even cut through my fingernails without having to really push hard.  I&#x27;m looking for a better alternative.</li>
            <li> Great clipper! Does the job!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Well made and cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to do. I do prefer another brand though.  I like the straight across and not curved, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> My toenails are freakin thick as a 2x4. My old clippers just mangled the crap out of them. With these puppies I&#x27;m chopping through my honkers like a warm knife through melted butter. BE WARNED: IT IS PROBS TOO MUCH POWER FOR MOST.</li>
            <li> Great nail clippers. Does their job superbly.</li>
            <li> Good quality, does the job.</li>
            <li> For many years I&#x27;ve used the curved nail clippers, but after purchasing these I won&#x27;t go back to any other clippers. Also, they have a nice sharpness to it making your nails look clean and nicely cut. These clippers are a life saver, definitely need to buy more of these! : )</li>
            <li> It is definitely sturdy, I wish they had a somewhat more standard arced cutting line - the square/straight cutting line is harder to agree with the natural arc of my nails.</li>
            <li> Good pair of clippers so far, feels very sturdy and looks good as an added bonus. The opening is a little smaller than most clippers and could slow you down. Blade has a slight curve as can be seen in the photos. These still look and work like new, even after being in my pocket whenever I travel. Sharp and clips without having to use too much pressure.</li>
            <li> Its so funny reading everyones reviews on toenail clippers i havent bought any but 5 stars bc i laughed</li>
            <li> should have bought at walmart</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really light and thin. It took some time to get used to. But if I really needed a clean cut I would reach for this nail clipper.</li>
            <li> This sucks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip should not be straight it should be curved</li>
            <li> Item as listed.  Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The best ever. Great product.Sturdy.Sharp precision.</li>
            <li> These clippers are pretty serious. Like industrial strength. I love them.</li>
            <li> Very sharp. A straight edge, such as this clipper has, is exactly what you need to cut toenails ... always cut straight across to prevent ingrown toenails! Another reviewer mentioned they don&#x27;t open wide enough, they could open a bit more for folks who have extra thick or odd shaped toenails ... sometimes a nail that has been injured may grow in crooked or very thick.</li>
            <li> Well made and work very well.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, wish it had a nail cleaning knife, alas I still love how solid and sharp it is. Cuts cleanly through nails or skin that I routinely have to cut/smooth out from working with my hands</li>
            <li> Sharp, good quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Im not thrilled with the convex design. I like the concave ones much better</li>
            <li> These are the sharpest toenail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used!  And it&#x27;s the first time in my life that I was ever able to cut my toenails straight across, like the health websites advise.</li>
            <li> The cutting ends do not make contact at the same time. The left side touches first, but the right side will eventually make contact if you push hard enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The edges of the body are sharp and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the worst pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever seen, but they work if you try hard enough. Not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> good product at a fair price...David</li>
            <li> Ive only used these twice since buying them and honestly, for this price, its the best deal youre ever gonna get. go to the drug store and this quality of nail clippers will cost you about $20. SO AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> Major league, big time nail clippers. It is nice to know I will never have to buy them again in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> Nice clippers--they are high quality</li>
            <li> they are very sharp and effortless to use</li>
            <li> Best clippers I have ever owned. Way better than drugstore stuff.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a slight roundness to it&#x27;s cut. If you&#x27;re looking for something that cuts straight across, it&#x27;s perfect. I like it&#x27;s buffed finish. It seems to be made very well.</li>
            <li> As good as advertised</li>
            <li> Do they work? They absolutely do. Both have a precise cutting edge and they made easy work of clipping. But these were not that great.</li>
            <li> sturdy and good quality</li>
