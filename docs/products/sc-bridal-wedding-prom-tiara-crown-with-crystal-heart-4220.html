            <li>I love this tiara!</li>
            <li>A really lovely design!</li>
            <li>I love this tiara!  </li>
            <li>This tiara was more than I anticipated!</li>
            <li>ANY PRINCESS WOULD LOVE IT !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely and made of sturdy metal set with &amp;#34;gems&amp;#34; with a beautiful sparkle; so much better than a plastic tiara for costumes.</li>
            <li>The delivery of it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>and it is going to look amazing with my wedding dress and cathedral veil</li>
            <li>The quality is topnotch....and the price amazing for what you get.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li>It seems well made and has a nice weight to it.  </li>
            <li>When I tried it on it kind of pinched my head.</li>
            <li>Nicely designed with crystal jewels, instead of plastic; was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>This was really a nice substantial tiara for the price.</li>
            <li>But the nine-year old loved it and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>so its goes perfect for my heart theme and the bling really does shine</li>
            <li>It was beautiful, but most importantly it stayed on her head.  </li>
            <li>Very sweet!</li>
            <li>this is the perfect accessory to pair with it (something new)</li>
            <li>The tiara was beautiful, and it arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>Bends very easily and the comb to keep it in place came messed up.</li>
            <li>…they made it very easy to return&lt;</li>
            <li>It arrived in perfect condition, with no missing crystals or damaged pieces.</li>
            <li>Cute, cute, cute!  </li>
            <li>Very Sturdy &amp; good price!</li>
            <li>it is real metal or good weight with combs!</li>
            <li>love it its just it bends and stretches very easily.....</li>
            <li>This company is very prompt in mailing out the product and they are beautiful.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived I was amazed at how beautiful it really is.</li>
            <li>They arrived fast and in a beautiful container.</li>
            <li>beautiful and very sparkling.  </li>
            <li>They shipped very quickly, were packaged nicely and made us both feel like royalty for the night.</li>
            <li>This is a much better option than the toddler sized toy tiaras, (most of which were plastic and very cheap looking).</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Regardless of that, it is still a cute, well made tiara with a lot of bling.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>

            <li>I had top bend the Combs a bit</li>
            <li>I bought this for a homecoming dance and it was okay.</li>
            <li>...made her feel like a queen. :-)</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not being pleased with it.  </li>

            <li>Love the case it is packed in as I&#x27;m taking it in a suitcase for a cruise.  </li>
            <li>:) My daughter and I went as princesses, and these tiaras were the iceing on the sparkly cake.</li>
            <li>but after a couple days trying to decide between this one and 2 more i decided to go with this one.</li>
            <li>It looked even better in person.  </li>
            <li>You will not find anything better.</li>
            <li>OK?</li>
            <li>Given as a gift, the recipient adored it, &amp; tried to find more reasons to wear it.</li>
            <li>My daughter (8) loves this tiara.  </li>
            <li>It is holding up to her handling and adjusts appropriately.</li>
            <li>I was able to bend it to work on her head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll wear the crown for a halloween office party but it would also make a lovely wedding tiara as well.</li>
            <li>Outstanding quality.</li>
            <li>and I felt like a princess :-)  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Looks OK.</li>
            <li>Slightly better than what you would get at Party City, but the teeth that hold it in came bent and</li>
            <li>For the price, it was an okay purchase.</li>
            <li>These are well made and will be used for many years to come.</li>
            <li>It looks better than it shows online.</li>
            <li>We can sometimes share headbands, so I thought maybe she would be able to use this tiara.</li>
            <li>Love this tiara.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased.</li>
            <li>It was not made out of cheap material either!</li>
            <li>it is adorable for my daughter.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT ONE FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER AND HAD TO BUY ONE FOR MYSELF</li>

            <li>It was absolutely everything I needed it to be with a great price tag.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I think it looks so elegant on the girl who is chosen as Ms. Wheelchair Wisconsin each year at our annual pageant.</li>
            <li>I love it and so did everyone else</li>
            <li>It really looks great for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i am very excited to wear it for my wedding.</li>
            <li>It was great, Look really pretty and reflected the light well.</li>
            <li>, I was soo impressed with the quality, it beats paying $200 for one at David&#x27;s Bridal, this was just as nice less the price, don&#x27;t feel intimidated to buy</li>
            <li>This was a gift for a beautiful 4 year old birthday princess.</li>
            <li>it was some pretty it can be used for a wedding good quality, I would buy from this company again.</li>
            <li>I thought this wasn&#x27;t going to be nice because it was set at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>They are nice quality and very pretty.</li>
            <li>I was worried about buying cheap tiara online, scared that it will look very cheap and plasticy.</li>
            <li>but I was able to carefully bend it to fit her perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I am sure this would fit a child without difficulty.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I purchased it again.</li>
            <li>It was nice and sparkly with just the right amount of crystals.  </li>
            <li>Extremely well made and very impressive for the price.</li>
            <li>lots of sparkle and seems sturdy, like it won&#x27;t fall apart easily.</li>
            <li>It also comes in a sturdy plastic box so it can easily be stored for years to come.</li>
            <li>It looks way better than the pictures, Fits an adult size head well and looks good when worn.</li>
            <li>I found it to feel very sturdy and was very pleased with it&#x27;s construction for the price.  </li>
            <li>This tiara is solidly made and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>This tiara is pretty durable, and looks nice.</li>
            <li>Tiara was not as big as it looked, but it was beautiful.  </li>
            <li>It will look just fine.  </li>
            <li>The tiara arrived fine.</li>
            <li>As a piece for a party, it is fine.</li>
            <li>It was easy to shape it a bit to fit my daughter.</li>
            <li>for quality, it fine.  </li>
            <li>It is super cute</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very pretty, not tacky like many costume jewelry tiaras I saw in stores when I was shopping for my Halloween costume.</li>
            <li>They feel like little princesses we are very happy with them.</li>
            <li>The tiara is very beautiful, I feel like a little princess.</li>
            <li>Fit her but would also fit me</li>
            <li>The metal frame can be bent to fit the head shape.</li>
            <li>something on the cheap side.</li>
            <li>It sparkled in the light and was just as pictured.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>It was so comfortable.</li>
            <li>do not look cheap at all.</li>
            <li>Does not look cheap at all</li>
            <li>but still worth the buy :)</li>
            <li>but, it actually fit her quite well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i think that is important too</li>
            <li>I look fabulous in it, and I wish I had an occasion to wear it...</li>
            <li>I wore this for the big 30 lol.</li>
            <li>And it was cheap.</li>
            <li>The attached combs on each side of the crown caused pain to the child and the design of these cheap combs</li>
            <li>Worked ok but wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend used this crown for a Cinderella costume because the crown her costume came with was terribly cheap looking.</li>
            <li>It was light, comfortable, and sparkling.</li>
            <li>no, this is much sturdier and way more beautiful than the photo can possibly do it credit.</li>
            <li>The seller was very helpful and nice when I contacted them about my problem, they were quick to tell me I could return it or exchange it</li>
            <li>more sparkle ;)</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>Definatly worth the price!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my daughters 5th birthday</li>
            <li>:) Both fit great: I could easly bend the thick and strong metal of the tiara to fit my daughters head</li>
            <li>but glad I purchased, now my headpiece wear is complete : )</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used them several times and they are just as beautiful now as when we first purchased them.</li>
            <li>We paired this with the shamrock veil for our lilttle irish girl&#x27;s first communion, she looked beautiful, felt like a princess.</li>
            <li>Importantly, it did not look cheap at all for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>The item came a day early (I chose regular shipping) and was in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have tea parties sometimes for birthdays or special events and all the attending ladies wear one.</li>
            <li>Although this product was ment for a wedding I gave this to someone special to me on to wear on her 24th birthday.</li>
            <li>This made my birthday really special.</li>
            <li>the price, I was surprised at how well made and nice looking</li>
            <li>I wanted a tiara for my daughter&#x27;s Princess Sofia costume and thought this was cute and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Got it for my sister&#x27;s sweet sixteen</li>
            <li>looks like it cost way more that the reasonable  price</li>
            <li>haha :)</li>
            <li>She received many compliments because of how &#x27;real&#x27; it looks.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, looks way more expensive than it was,  shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Came quick packed well and in one piece with no damage.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE PRICE VERY DURABLE , CONSIDERING HOW MANY PLASTIC ONES</li>
            <li>Very pretty tiara for the price</li>
            <li>it was very pretty</li>
            <li>It did not snag my hair and was pretty light on my head.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty</li>
            <li>I wore this onmy wedding day, it was beautiful and not cheaply made.</li>
            <li>so, when it was time for her to open her present, she actually enjoyed it very much and it was beautiful.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you purchase it especially since it has a great price.</li>
            <li>It was so cool and put that nice final touch to my attire.  </li>
            <li>It was bigger and more beautiful than what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li>/&gt;And this little gem proved to be an overwhelmingly great</li>
            <li>My daughter wanted a real princess crown for Christmas and this one fit the idea of that desire.  </li>
            <li>Really sturdy plastic, doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.</li>
            <li>I wanted to pick up a nice tiara to present to her on her birthday.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It is nice enough to wear at a wedding.  </li>
            <li>It was able to stay in her hair with a natural style as well as with braids.</li>
            <li>Just for fun, we got our 10 year old Grand Daughter this for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>It is nice enough to wear for a wedding!</li>
            <li>I got this tiara as a fun hair accessory.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is well worth the purchase</li>
            <li>When my daughter was recovering from back surgery but still a inpatient, we both wore a tiara and went through the hospital (St. Anthony&#x27;s in Lakewood, CO - great care) to thank the countless people who took such good care of her.  </li>
            <li>It was packaged well and the little round clear plastic it came in is perfect to store it in and keep it nice!  </li>
            <li>It was a little big diameter-wise for our winning girl, who is a 4th grader, but still beautiful.</li>
            <li>Shipment was received right on time.  </li>
            <li>I received it right on time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size for my 4yr.</li>
            <li>It is shiny &amp; just the right size.</li>
            <li>The weight is distributed well and the combs are in the right spot.</li>
            <li>But when I opened the packaging it was just the right size.</li>
            <li>Nice, heavy and real well fitting on my head.</li>
            <li>If your little girl wants to play princess, this is a great item to get her.</li>
            <li>Very pretty ships extremely fast.</li>
            <li>it was exactly what the seller said it would be, and was shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>It was a very fast transaction after I placed my order.</li>
            <li>But what I love the most is that it stayed in place the whole time I ran the Princess Half Marathon.</li>
            <li>It adds to the special aura of using the fine teacups, teapots, tiny gold spoons, etc.</li>
            <li>The look and sparkle is amazing so beautiful, shipping and price was not to bad</li>
            <li>Fast service!</li>
            <li>Very well made and durable!</li>
            <li>I was at first</li>
            <li>IT WAS SO PRETTY,</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying from them again :)</li>
            <li>and i got married</li>
            <li>But overall i love it</li>
            <li>the metal head band is malleable enough that we were able to make it fit her head, as it is meant for an adult.</li>
            <li>exactly the product I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I purchased several for my online business and hope the beauty of these will make Sparkly Crystal  famous.  </li>
            <li>She said she felt like a real princess!</li>
            <li>Looks pretty.  </li>
            <li>It looks pretty real!</li>
            <li>First this tiara is made of metal.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>:) Only issue: the rhinestones are loosly fitted into the metal.</li>
            <li>during the first time I used this.</li>
            <li>Still a pretty tiara.</li>
            <li>It does look pretty though.</li>
            <li>Pretty Tiara Crown that I collect and display at home.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty in my hair, and I look forward to wearing it on Halloween.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty tiara.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t getting married....</li>
            <li>and it really sparkles!</li>
            <li>And it is still really pretty.</li>
            <li>This makes me feel pretty.</li>
            <li>The dress is more theatrical quality than a costume.  </li>
            <li>It was surprisingly well made and heavy.</li>
            <li>but just right for a lady who wants to make a statement but not be obnoxious.</li>
            <li>The crystals are very well set, the metal is very strong and can&#x27;t possibly accidentally bend or get dinged funny, the combs actually hold well even in my hard-to-hold-onto fine hair.</li>
            <li>It was really beautiful, and for a 5 year old, felt more expensive than any of the toy ones she has.</li>
            <li>We use this tiara at our church&#x27;s Celebration for girls who complete a special incentive program.  </li>
            <li>this is really nice tiara, I brought this tiara for my little girl for the wedding and this tiara was actually bigger and better</li>
            <li>I got this based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive but looks pretty.</li>
            <li>It looks like a beautiful simple crown, sitting flat on a flat surface, which is exactly what I was looking for but that was not the case when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>Every little girl needs a non-plastic amazing tiara that she can wear when she if feeling princessy.  </li>
            <li>It made my little princes thrilled when she saw it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these items to any one looking to complete their look, for any special occasion.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for anyone from a bride to be to princess for a day!</li>
            <li>It really was the finishing touch to my wedding day</li>
            <li>I really cannot say too much about it.</li>
            <li>The tiara I ordered was just as pictured and was received  in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li>she wore it the whole day (work and birthday party) and every girl just admired it.</li>
            <li>it was priced much lower than the ones at wedding websights</li>
            <li>so I did not expect much.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, too.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be taller, but it is still stunning.</li>
            <li>It was much nicer than I thought it would be for the price.</li>
            <li>She loves it and thinks it is real even though I told her they are not diamonds.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>price quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>and it was very well made for the price.</li>
            <li>but it seems to fit younger kids also.</li>
            <li>The crystals are very well fused to the tiara and</li>
            <li>the metal is real and nicely-weighted.</li>
            <li>This tiara was definitely not made cheaply.</li>
            <li>This lifted the spirits of my &amp;#34;princess&amp;#34; the minute I gave it to her, after a very trying day at work.</li>
            <li>This was even better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>They were very well made.</li>
            <li>My two nieces really like these.  </li>
            <li>she gets to be a real princess</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too much.  </li>
            <li>thought I paid so much money for it boy</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy, very durable.</li>
            <li>She is right in that age where she is getting to old for Barbies but still likes to play with hair and nails and lipstick.</li>
            <li>As this is metal it can be carefully and easily shaped to fit a young 2 year old&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>the other reviewers have written, the tiara is substantial and very lovely, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She really does look so very pretty in it and it will last forever.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for a 6 year old to play with and it is pretty substantial.</li>
            <li>However, be aware that this is made for adult use.</li>
            <li>That is most likely my local UPS&#x27;s fault though.</li>
            <li>Even her older sisters had to try it on.</li>
            <li>When my older daughter saw it, she wanted it too.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was only for a costume</li>
            <li>The fake diamonds really sparkle and its a great buy.</li>
            <li>Very Classy, I must say!</li>
            <li>it would be too high when i recieved it today in the package</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more durable than something you would find in Party City.</li>
            <li>I thought it was just be a cute little tiara to wear when goofing off with friends...</li>
            <li>Sturdy quality, had a little flexibility to better mold to her head but was not flimsy.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t exactly the sellers fault other than that packaging wasn&#x27;t very sturdy, but the box and the crown inside looks like it had been sat on by a very large man.</li>
            <li>sent this to adult daughter to surprise her for accomplishment -- I&#x27;m not sure she liked the gift.  </li>
            <li>My spirits were lifted when I saw the big smile on her face.</li>
            <li>The tiara is very sparkly and pretty and seems very similar to ones I saw while bridal shopping except a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Subsequently I&#x27;ve worn this just for fun to meet friends.  </li>
            <li>Heavy and beautiful  but a lil too heavy to keep in place.</li>
            <li>We live here, why not?</li>
            <li>GOT IT FOR A NEW</li>
            <li>Either way if you are planing on buying it do it, just make sure you order it with plenty of time in advance because if your delivery men are anything like mine they might leave you with a crushed crown and needing to rush to find a new one at the local claires.</li>
            <li>Product quality FAR EXCEEDS expectations!</li>
            <li>I have a large head, and this was too big for me.  </li>
            <li>What a beautiful little tiara for such a small amount of money.</li>
            <li>Got it for my 8yr old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tiara is well made,the packaging is very sturdy,it&#x27;s a very simple statement piece.</li>
            <li>old niece, she likes to wear girly-girl things</li>
            <li>Bought it for my 9 yr old  daughter for Halloween .</li>
            <li>Gave to my 4 year old daughter for her birthday</li>
            <li>It showed up very well in the picture on the front page of the local paper!</li>
            <li>I gave this to my buddy&#x27;s young girl from for her birthday.  </li>
            <li>My daughter (7 yrs old) is the flower girl in a wedding this summer.</li>
            <li>I chose to wear my mother&#x27;s wedding dress (something old)</li>
            <li>This was for my seven year old granddaughter Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>purchased for 7 year old granddaughter...</li>
            <li>But so far it&#x27;s everything I could want.  </li>
            <li>*4 years old*,</li>
            <li>Much prettier and larger in person.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 10 year old daughter for a school event.  </li>
            <li>I bought this tiara for a classy bachelorette party.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old granddaughter wears this everywhere.</li>
            <li>I bought this tiara for a nine year old who loves to dress up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks slightly smaller in real life, but that may just be because the picture is not taken on a person&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone searching for an adult tiara.</li>
            <li>And I am an adult.  </li>
            <li>This is for a 5 year old and 7 year old.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen it as I sent it directly to our granddaughters in WA.  </li>
            <li>But this one completely amazed me when I got it in the mail.</li>
            <li>I bought this tiara for my 3 1/2 year old daughter to wear to a princess themed birthday party.</li>
            <li>Maybe my next one will be 18 kt platinum with real diamonds.  </li>
            <li>and it holds up to a 3 year old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality (for a silly birthday gift).  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that one of the sequins fell off pretty quickly, but she doesn&#x27;t seem to really mind.</li>
            <li>It is smaller than I pictured and I am not sure this will fit on my girlfriend&#x27;s head!</li>
            <li>It is very solidly made and high quality.</li>
            <li>I was too scared to bend them and every one was pretty large on their small heads.</li>
            <li>Our little princess really enjoys this very well-made tiara.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The stones were adequately sparkly and there wasn&#x27;t any glue over them or anything messy like that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks a little bigger in the pic than the original size.</li>
            <li>The product is VERY sparkly and shiny and everthing described exept it came crushed in the mail..</li>
            <li>I got this for my 5 yr old and it was big for her</li>
            <li>Christmas present for 4-year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>not too heavy, just the right amount of sparkle.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money at Claire&#x27;s or Icing, which will rip you off, when you can get the same item for less, through Amazon. :)</li>
            <li>but young kids tend not to wear them for too long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s quite sparkly, sturdy, and just plain pretty...</li>
            <li>My only problem is that it is a little too big which is funny because i thought t would be too small, but my hair is thick so i will definately try to blend my hair better with the tiara to hide the space.</li>
            <li>good and bad thing</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this tiara!</li>
            <li> A really lovely design!</li>
            <li> I love this tiara!  </li>
            <li> This tiara was more than I anticipated!</li>
            <li> ANY PRINCESS WOULD LOVE IT !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely and made of sturdy metal set with &amp;#34;gems&amp;#34; with a beautiful sparkle; so much better than a plastic tiara for costumes.</li>
            <li> The delivery of it was amazing.  </li>
            <li> and it is going to look amazing with my wedding dress and cathedral veil</li>
            <li> The quality is topnotch....and the price amazing for what you get.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> It seems well made and has a nice weight to it.  </li>
            <li> When I tried it on it kind of pinched my head.</li>
            <li> Nicely designed with crystal jewels, instead of plastic; was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> This was really a nice substantial tiara for the price.</li>
            <li> But the nine-year old loved it and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> so its goes perfect for my heart theme and the bling really does shine</li>
            <li> It was beautiful, but most importantly it stayed on her head.  </li>
            <li> Very sweet!</li>
            <li> this is the perfect accessory to pair with it (something new)</li>
            <li> The tiara was beautiful, and it arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> Bends very easily and the comb to keep it in place came messed up.</li>
            <li> …they made it very easy to return&lt;</li>
            <li> It arrived in perfect condition, with no missing crystals or damaged pieces.</li>
            <li> Cute, cute, cute!  </li>
            <li> Very Sturdy &amp; good price!</li>
            <li> it is real metal or good weight with combs!</li>
            <li> love it its just it bends and stretches very easily.....</li>
            <li> This company is very prompt in mailing out the product and they are beautiful.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived I was amazed at how beautiful it really is.</li>
            <li> They arrived fast and in a beautiful container.</li>
            <li> beautiful and very sparkling.  </li>
            <li> They shipped very quickly, were packaged nicely and made us both feel like royalty for the night.</li>
            <li> This is a much better option than the toddler sized toy tiaras, (most of which were plastic and very cheap looking).</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Regardless of that, it is still a cute, well made tiara with a lot of bling.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> everything i asked for and more thank you</li>
            <li> I love this tiara.</li>
            <li> It looks better than the picture.  </li>
            <li> and i am SOOOOO in love.</li>
            <li> and i cannot wait till my bdayy to wear it :-)</li>
            <li> This one is lovely.</li>
            <li> I had top bend the Combs a bit</li>
            <li> I bought this for a homecoming dance and it was okay.</li>
            <li> ...made her feel like a queen. :-)</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not being pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> It is quite lovely.  </li>
            <li> Love the case it is packed in as I&#x27;m taking it in a suitcase for a cruise.  </li>
            <li> :) My daughter and I went as princesses, and these tiaras were the iceing on the sparkly cake.</li>
            <li> but after a couple days trying to decide between this one and 2 more i decided to go with this one.</li>
            <li> It looked even better in person.  </li>
            <li> You will not find anything better.</li>
            <li> OK?</li>
            <li> Given as a gift, the recipient adored it, &amp; tried to find more reasons to wear it.</li>
            <li> My daughter (8) loves this tiara.  </li>
            <li> It is holding up to her handling and adjusts appropriately.</li>
            <li> I was able to bend it to work on her head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wear the crown for a halloween office party but it would also make a lovely wedding tiara as well.</li>
            <li> Outstanding quality.</li>
            <li> and I felt like a princess :-)  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Looks OK.</li>
            <li> Slightly better than what you would get at Party City, but the teeth that hold it in came bent and</li>
            <li> For the price, it was an okay purchase.</li>
            <li> These are well made and will be used for many years to come.</li>
            <li> It looks better than it shows online.</li>
            <li> We can sometimes share headbands, so I thought maybe she would be able to use this tiara.</li>
            <li> Love this tiara.</li>
            <li> and I was pleased.</li>
            <li> It was not made out of cheap material either!</li>

            <li> and I love it.</li>

            <li> I love it and so did everyone else</li>
            <li> It really looks great for the price.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It was great, Look really pretty and reflected the light well.</li>
            <li> , I was soo impressed with the quality, it beats paying $200 for one at David&#x27;s Bridal, this was just as nice less the price, don&#x27;t feel intimidated to buy</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a beautiful 4 year old birthday princess.</li>
            <li> it was some pretty it can be used for a wedding good quality, I would buy from this company again.</li>

            <li> They are nice quality and very pretty.</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying cheap tiara online, scared that it will look very cheap and plasticy.</li>
            <li> but I was able to carefully bend it to fit her perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I am sure this would fit a child without difficulty.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I purchased it again.</li>
            <li> It was nice and sparkly with just the right amount of crystals.  </li>
            <li> Extremely well made and very impressive for the price.</li>
            <li> lots of sparkle and seems sturdy, like it won&#x27;t fall apart easily.</li>
            <li> It also comes in a sturdy plastic box so it can easily be stored for years to come.</li>
            <li> It looks way better than the pictures, Fits an adult size head well and looks good when worn.</li>
            <li> I found it to feel very sturdy and was very pleased with it&#x27;s construction for the price.  </li>

            <li> for quality, it fine.  </li>
            <li> It is super cute</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very pretty, not tacky like many costume jewelry tiaras I saw in stores when I was shopping for my Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> They feel like little princesses we are very happy with them.</li>
            <li> The tiara is very beautiful, I feel like a little princess.</li>
            <li> Fit her but would also fit me</li>
            <li> The metal frame can be bent to fit the head shape.</li>
            <li> something on the cheap side.</li>
            <li> It sparkled in the light and was just as pictured.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> It was so comfortable.</li>
            <li> do not look cheap at all.</li>
            <li> Does not look cheap at all</li>
            <li> but still worth the buy :)</li>
            <li> but, it actually fit her quite well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i think that is important too</li>
            <li> I look fabulous in it, and I wish I had an occasion to wear it...</li>
            <li> I wore this for the big 30 lol.</li>
            <li> And it was cheap.</li>
            <li> The attached combs on each side of the crown caused pain to the child and the design of these cheap combs</li>
            <li> Worked ok but wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend used this crown for a Cinderella costume because the crown her costume came with was terribly cheap looking.</li>
            <li> It was light, comfortable, and sparkling.</li>
            <li> no, this is much sturdier and way more beautiful than the photo can possibly do it credit.</li>
            <li> The seller was very helpful and nice when I contacted them about my problem, they were quick to tell me I could return it or exchange it</li>
            <li> more sparkle ;)</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Definatly worth the price!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my daughters 5th birthday</li>
            <li> :) Both fit great: I could easly bend the thick and strong metal of the tiara to fit my daughters head</li>
            <li> but glad I purchased, now my headpiece wear is complete : )</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used them several times and they are just as beautiful now as when we first purchased them.</li>
            <li> We paired this with the shamrock veil for our lilttle irish girl&#x27;s first communion, she looked beautiful, felt like a princess.</li>
            <li> Importantly, it did not look cheap at all for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The item came a day early (I chose regular shipping) and was in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have tea parties sometimes for birthdays or special events and all the attending ladies wear one.</li>
            <li> Although this product was ment for a wedding I gave this to someone special to me on to wear on her 24th birthday.</li>
            <li> This made my birthday really special.</li>
            <li> the price, I was surprised at how well made and nice looking</li>
            <li> I wanted a tiara for my daughter&#x27;s Princess Sofia costume and thought this was cute and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Got it for my sister&#x27;s sweet sixteen</li>
            <li> looks like it cost way more that the reasonable  price</li>
            <li> haha :)</li>
            <li> She received many compliments because of how &#x27;real&#x27; it looks.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, looks way more expensive than it was,  shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Came quick packed well and in one piece with no damage.</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH THE PRICE VERY DURABLE , CONSIDERING HOW MANY PLASTIC ONES</li>
            <li> Very pretty tiara for the price</li>
            <li> it was very pretty</li>
            <li> It did not snag my hair and was pretty light on my head.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty</li>
            <li> I wore this onmy wedding day, it was beautiful and not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> so, when it was time for her to open her present, she actually enjoyed it very much and it was beautiful.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you purchase it especially since it has a great price.</li>
            <li> It was so cool and put that nice final touch to my attire.  </li>
            <li> It was bigger and more beautiful than what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> /&gt;And this little gem proved to be an overwhelmingly great</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted a real princess crown for Christmas and this one fit the idea of that desire.  </li>
            <li> Really sturdy plastic, doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted to pick up a nice tiara to present to her on her birthday.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It is nice enough to wear at a wedding.  </li>
            <li> It was able to stay in her hair with a natural style as well as with braids.</li>
            <li> Just for fun, we got our 10 year old Grand Daughter this for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> It is nice enough to wear for a wedding!</li>
            <li> I got this tiara as a fun hair accessory.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is well worth the purchase</li>
            <li> When my daughter was recovering from back surgery but still a inpatient, we both wore a tiara and went through the hospital (St. Anthony&#x27;s in Lakewood, CO - great care) to thank the countless people who took such good care of her.  </li>
            <li> It was packaged well and the little round clear plastic it came in is perfect to store it in and keep it nice!  </li>
            <li> It was a little big diameter-wise for our winning girl, who is a 4th grader, but still beautiful.</li>
            <li> Shipment was received right on time.  </li>
            <li> I received it right on time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size for my 4yr.</li>
            <li> It is shiny &amp; just the right size.</li>
            <li> The weight is distributed well and the combs are in the right spot.</li>
            <li> But when I opened the packaging it was just the right size.</li>
            <li> Nice, heavy and real well fitting on my head.</li>
            <li> If your little girl wants to play princess, this is a great item to get her.</li>
            <li> Very pretty ships extremely fast.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what the seller said it would be, and was shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> It was a very fast transaction after I placed my order.</li>
            <li> But what I love the most is that it stayed in place the whole time I ran the Princess Half Marathon.</li>
            <li> It adds to the special aura of using the fine teacups, teapots, tiny gold spoons, etc.</li>
            <li> The look and sparkle is amazing so beautiful, shipping and price was not to bad</li>
            <li> Fast service!</li>
            <li> Very well made and durable!</li>
            <li> I was at first</li>
            <li> IT WAS SO PRETTY,</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying from them again :)</li>
            <li> and i got married</li>
            <li> But overall i love it</li>
            <li> the metal head band is malleable enough that we were able to make it fit her head, as it is meant for an adult.</li>
            <li> exactly the product I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I purchased several for my online business and hope the beauty of these will make Sparkly Crystal  famous.  </li>
            <li> She said she felt like a real princess!</li>
            <li> Looks pretty.  </li>
            <li> It looks pretty real!</li>
            <li> First this tiara is made of metal.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> :) Only issue: the rhinestones are loosly fitted into the metal.</li>
            <li> during the first time I used this.</li>
            <li> Still a pretty tiara.</li>
            <li> It does look pretty though.</li>
            <li> Pretty Tiara Crown that I collect and display at home.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty in my hair, and I look forward to wearing it on Halloween.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty tiara.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t getting married....</li>
            <li> and it really sparkles!</li>
            <li> And it is still really pretty.</li>
            <li> This makes me feel pretty.</li>
            <li> The dress is more theatrical quality than a costume.  </li>
            <li> It was surprisingly well made and heavy.</li>
            <li> but just right for a lady who wants to make a statement but not be obnoxious.</li>
            <li> The crystals are very well set, the metal is very strong and can&#x27;t possibly accidentally bend or get dinged funny, the combs actually hold well even in my hard-to-hold-onto fine hair.</li>
            <li> It was really beautiful, and for a 5 year old, felt more expensive than any of the toy ones she has.</li>
            <li> We use this tiara at our church&#x27;s Celebration for girls who complete a special incentive program.  </li>
            <li> this is really nice tiara, I brought this tiara for my little girl for the wedding and this tiara was actually bigger and better</li>
            <li> I got this based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive but looks pretty.</li>
            <li> It looks like a beautiful simple crown, sitting flat on a flat surface, which is exactly what I was looking for but that was not the case when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> Every little girl needs a non-plastic amazing tiara that she can wear when she if feeling princessy.  </li>
            <li> It made my little princes thrilled when she saw it.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these items to any one looking to complete their look, for any special occasion.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for anyone from a bride to be to princess for a day!</li>
            <li> It really was the finishing touch to my wedding day</li>
            <li> I really cannot say too much about it.</li>
            <li> The tiara I ordered was just as pictured and was received  in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li> she wore it the whole day (work and birthday party) and every girl just admired it.</li>
            <li> it was priced much lower than the ones at wedding websights</li>
            <li> so I did not expect much.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, too.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be taller, but it is still stunning.</li>
            <li> It was much nicer than I thought it would be for the price.</li>
            <li> She loves it and thinks it is real even though I told her they are not diamonds.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> price quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> and it was very well made for the price.</li>
            <li> but it seems to fit younger kids also.</li>
            <li> The crystals are very well fused to the tiara and</li>
            <li> the metal is real and nicely-weighted.</li>
            <li> This tiara was definitely not made cheaply.</li>
            <li> This lifted the spirits of my &amp;#34;princess&amp;#34; the minute I gave it to her, after a very trying day at work.</li>
            <li> This was even better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> They were very well made.</li>
            <li> My two nieces really like these.  </li>
            <li> she gets to be a real princess</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too much.  </li>
            <li> thought I paid so much money for it boy</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy, very durable.</li>
            <li> She is right in that age where she is getting to old for Barbies but still likes to play with hair and nails and lipstick.</li>
            <li> As this is metal it can be carefully and easily shaped to fit a young 2 year old&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> the other reviewers have written, the tiara is substantial and very lovely, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She really does look so very pretty in it and it will last forever.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for a 6 year old to play with and it is pretty substantial.</li>
            <li> However, be aware that this is made for adult use.</li>
            <li> That is most likely my local UPS&#x27;s fault though.</li>
            <li> Even her older sisters had to try it on.</li>
            <li> When my older daughter saw it, she wanted it too.</li>
            <li> Luckily it was only for a costume</li>
            <li> The fake diamonds really sparkle and its a great buy.</li>
            <li> Very Classy, I must say!</li>
            <li> it would be too high when i recieved it today in the package</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more durable than something you would find in Party City.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just be a cute little tiara to wear when goofing off with friends...</li>
            <li> Sturdy quality, had a little flexibility to better mold to her head but was not flimsy.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t exactly the sellers fault other than that packaging wasn&#x27;t very sturdy, but the box and the crown inside looks like it had been sat on by a very large man.</li>
            <li> sent this to adult daughter to surprise her for accomplishment -- I&#x27;m not sure she liked the gift.  </li>
            <li> My spirits were lifted when I saw the big smile on her face.</li>
            <li> The tiara is very sparkly and pretty and seems very similar to ones I saw while bridal shopping except a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Subsequently I&#x27;ve worn this just for fun to meet friends.  </li>
            <li> Heavy and beautiful  but a lil too heavy to keep in place.</li>
            <li> We live here, why not?</li>
            <li> GOT IT FOR A NEW</li>
            <li> Either way if you are planing on buying it do it, just make sure you order it with plenty of time in advance because if your delivery men are anything like mine they might leave you with a crushed crown and needing to rush to find a new one at the local claires.</li>
            <li> Product quality FAR EXCEEDS expectations!</li>
            <li> I have a large head, and this was too big for me.  </li>
            <li> What a beautiful little tiara for such a small amount of money.</li>
            <li> Got it for my 8yr old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tiara is well made,the packaging is very sturdy,it&#x27;s a very simple statement piece.</li>
            <li> old niece, she likes to wear girly-girl things</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 9 yr old  daughter for Halloween .</li>
            <li> Gave to my 4 year old daughter for her birthday</li>
            <li> It showed up very well in the picture on the front page of the local paper!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my buddy&#x27;s young girl from for her birthday.  </li>
            <li> My daughter (7 yrs old) is the flower girl in a wedding this summer.</li>
            <li> I chose to wear my mother&#x27;s wedding dress (something old)</li>
            <li> This was for my seven year old granddaughter Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> purchased for 7 year old granddaughter...</li>
            <li> But so far it&#x27;s everything I could want.  </li>
            <li> *4 years old*,</li>
            <li> Much prettier and larger in person.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 10 year old daughter for a school event.  </li>
            <li> I bought this tiara for a classy bachelorette party.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old granddaughter wears this everywhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this tiara for a nine year old who loves to dress up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks slightly smaller in real life, but that may just be because the picture is not taken on a person&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone searching for an adult tiara.</li>
            <li> And I am an adult.  </li>
            <li> This is for a 5 year old and 7 year old.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen it as I sent it directly to our granddaughters in WA.  </li>
            <li> But this one completely amazed me when I got it in the mail.</li>
            <li> I bought this tiara for my 3 1/2 year old daughter to wear to a princess themed birthday party.</li>
            <li> Maybe my next one will be 18 kt platinum with real diamonds.  </li>
            <li> and it holds up to a 3 year old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality (for a silly birthday gift).  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that one of the sequins fell off pretty quickly, but she doesn&#x27;t seem to really mind.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I pictured and I am not sure this will fit on my girlfriend&#x27;s head!</li>
            <li> It is very solidly made and high quality.</li>
            <li> I was too scared to bend them and every one was pretty large on their small heads.</li>
            <li> Our little princess really enjoys this very well-made tiara.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The stones were adequately sparkly and there wasn&#x27;t any glue over them or anything messy like that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks a little bigger in the pic than the original size.</li>
            <li> The product is VERY sparkly and shiny and everthing described exept it came crushed in the mail..</li>
            <li> I got this for my 5 yr old and it was big for her</li>
            <li> Christmas present for 4-year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> not too heavy, just the right amount of sparkle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money at Claire&#x27;s or Icing, which will rip you off, when you can get the same item for less, through Amazon. :)</li>
            <li> but young kids tend not to wear them for too long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s quite sparkly, sturdy, and just plain pretty...</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it is a little too big which is funny because i thought t would be too small, but my hair is thick so i will definately try to blend my hair better with the tiara to hide the space.</li>
            <li> good and bad thing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but very well made, no problems or complaints.</li>
            <li> besides walking my dog, which for the time being serves as the only place I can get away with wearing it without getting strange looks and comments about my opinion of myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 3yr old, it is a little big but fits</li>
            <li> If I had gone to a store and saw this I would have expected it to be much more expensive.</li>
            <li> It also came a reusable plastic container that was thin, but adequate for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comes packaged well in a little clear plastic case.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s held up for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This tiara was larger than I expected in the photo.  </li>
            <li> It is also romantic with the heart in the center.</li>
            <li> It will not stay on her head at all, and the band is definitely too wide for a toddler&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> It is long</li>
            <li> than I thought it would be, it was bigger than the other tiara that I had brought for me.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first that it would be too small.</li>
            <li> I was also afraid that it might of been too big to fit her</li>
            <li> Pretty crown, but poor design.</li>
            <li> The Tiara is a little big.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much help at all.</li>
            <li> Bridal Wedding Tiara Crown With Center</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s 18th birthday party, along with the pink &amp;#34;Birthday Diva&amp;#34; sash.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s held up through a year of rough play.</li>
            <li> It came before the expected delivery date</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> Especially since it is supposed to be a keepsake for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Three stars because it isn&#x27;t too noticeable that the crystal is missing.</li>
            <li> it came very quickly and it was as ordered, unfortunately, it was not appropriate for the occasion</li>
            <li> Nothing rough, but still it&#x27;s been tossed around on the floor with all of her other toys.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tight, but I may have a bigger head.</li>
            <li> the other day I found it in her garbage.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of comments about how pretty it was and how expensive it must have been.  </li>
            <li> So that is pretty lame.</li>
            <li> I bought this item based off the other reviews</li>
            <li> (The other tiara we had was &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34;.)</li>
            <li> I was afraid I might be getting some cheap made plastic tiara, but this is well made and heavy.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I could say is that it doesn&#x27;t look pricey.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and ordered it for my four year old because I was tired of the cheapo plastic junk tiaras that would break after three uses.</li>
            <li> It seems too delicate for a little girl to play with, but too small for an adult.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little 9 year old cousin for secret santa.</li>
            <li> It has a very sturdy metal base and clear crystals all over.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend vs. fake plastic ones.</li>
            <li> but it still felt like a too tight headband</li>
            <li> Only issue is that it can be uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time...</li>
            <li> but unfortunately my little princess won&#x27;t even touch it.</li>
            <li> Little girls even came up to me to say HI to the \\&quot;princess.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Cons are that it hurt her head a little bit, we tried bending it</li>
            <li> I was replacing one that another little girl had accidentally (hopefully) taken from her at a birthday party.</li>
            <li> Not saying that it is little</li>
            <li> Little princess adored it.</li>
            <li> The tiara feels sturdy without  being too heavy on my head.</li>
            <li> also received this product a few days before the edd</li>
            <li> The metal is not flimsy but not too heavy on the head.</li>
            <li> If you have a budding princess like my granddaughter, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> She had been avoiding it due to negative reviews.</li>
            <li> The diamonds and details are not perfect - different spaces between them and so forth, which makes it look a little shotty up close.</li>
            <li> Given the quality, it is not that much expensive compared to those plastic ones, price of which adds up by buying them over and over, each time after only few days of playing.</li>
            <li> What every little girl needs, a crown!</li>
            <li> I usually give her some type of diamond jewelry for Christmas,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> i thought it would be too small</li>
            <li> I wore this for my engagement party this past weekend</li>
            <li> This is not a cheaply constructed piece (well, it&#x27;s not a feat of engineering either, but at least it&#x27;s not flimsy).</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed - I am an amateur photographer</li>
            <li> I tried the tiara hair comb, but it was small.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this dress is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a little girl whose family is going through a tough time.  </li>
            <li> It does sit on my head a bit awkwardly, which is why I gave it less than five stars.</li>
            <li> This is a very delicate tiara.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a tiara that is inexpensive but looks expensive, this product is not it.</li>
            <li> you will not be sorry</li>
            <li> &#x27;s crafted well, the sparklies don&#x27;t fall out randomly, and it&#x27;s fahbulous!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The nurse for whom I bought this was enchanted with it, and wore it all night on her birthday.</li>
            <li> Got it for my 8yr old. Fits well and she likes it.</li>
            <li> Just ordered this on Friday night-arrived this Monday afternoon. Our daughter turns 13 in 2 weeks and we&#x27;re surprising her with a trip to Disney World. I wanted to pick up a nice tiara to present to her on her birthday. Thought I was going to have to go the way of craft stores/bridal section with coupons to find one under $40.&lt;br /&gt;$15.99 for this beautiful piece??? Delivered in a flash???&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for saving me money,providing a well made item and delivering it in a flash. Our daughter is going to be so surprised.&lt;br /&gt;The tiara is well made,the packaging is very sturdy,it&#x27;s a very simple statement piece. Lots of flash but not overdone.&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ll upgrade her crown when she turns 16...more sparkle ;)</li>
            <li> These were gifts for my three flower girls in my wedding last December.  I loved the way they looked but they were advertised as flower girl tiaras and were big enough for adults. I was too scared to bend them and every one was pretty large on their small heads. They didn&#x27;t mind and loved being princesses for one night.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Tiara for my daughter&#x27;s wedding. She didn&#x27;t care for the look of a veil so she opted for a tiara. This tiara is solidly made and looks beautiful. I feel it was an exceptional bargain at the price I paid. Highly recommend this for anyone from a bride to be to princess for a day!</li>
            <li> I just received this Tiara and it is beautiful.  Well worth the money.  The product is great but the website needs to show the sizes (height)in the description.  Shipment was received right on time.  Love it.</li>
            <li> The Tiara is a little big.  I thought the crystal wiggled in the middle of the heart but it does not.  For $13.00 it is beautiful.  I am still planning on wearing it for my wedding.  It will look just fine.  The delivery of it was amazing.  I received it right on time.  It was a very fast transaction after I placed my order. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this tiara to wear on my July 2011 wedding day.  I may have just missed where it listed the size, because going by the pic I was expecting something a bit larger. Regardless of that, it is still a cute, well made tiara with a lot of bling. Plus for $17 (that&#x27;s including s&amp;h) it&#x27;s a much better deal than the $200 tiaras they try to sell you at Davids Bridal! It really was the finishing touch to my wedding day look that I wanted. So if your thinking of doing a tiara forget the ones in the bridal stores and try this one!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend for her birthday in 2008 and she loved it. I suppose it&#x27;s still around. I really cannot say too much about it. I&#x27;m not much help at all. But, if you want a crazy/expensive tiara, this is not one for you. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Bends very easily and the comb to keep it in place came messed up. Jewels have begun falling off after a month of sporadic use.</li>
            <li> The product is VERY sparkly and shiny and everthing described exept it came crushed in the mail.. This isn&#x27;t exactly the sellers fault other than that packaging wasn&#x27;t very sturdy, but the box and the crown inside looks like it had been sat on by a very large man. That is most likely my local UPS&#x27;s fault though. The seller was very helpful and nice when I contacted them about my problem, they were quick to tell me I could return it or exchange it but it was 2 days before I needed it so I just plan on returning it. The only reason I have not already is because amazon for some reason won&#x27;t let me, or I just can&#x27;t figure out how to return it. Either way if you are planing on buying it do it, just make sure you order it with plenty of time in advance because if your delivery men are anything like mine they might leave you with a crushed crown and needing to rush to find a new one at the local claires.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves this tiara!  It is well made and beautiful!</li>
            <li> The tiara I ordered was just as pictured and was received  in a very timely manner.  I would order from this site again.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Need I say more?</li>
            <li> Great price! Fast service! Product quality FAR EXCEEDS expectations! Beautiful tiara!!! Very well made and durable!</li>
            <li> Only got to wear it once before it got all rusty.</li>
            <li> Received this item on time. It&#x27;s just the right size for my 4yr. old niece, she likes to wear girly-girl things and she&#x27;s into the Disney princess themes, If your little girl wants to play princess, this is a great item to get her. I know my niece will just love it! The crystals sparkle wonderfully! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 9 yr old  daughter for Halloween . Was very impressed with the quality of it. Nicely made and would recommend for anyone!! Fit her but would also fit me</li>
            <li> This tiara is absolutely gorgeous it is a perfect fit for my head and it is going to look amazing with my wedding dress and cathedral veil</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive but looks pretty. I would recommend it. The metal frame can be bent to fit the head shape. So far it&#x27;s held up for a few weeks. Gave to my 4 year old daughter for her birthday and she&#x27;s worn it on &amp; off for days now. Nothing rough, but still it&#x27;s been tossed around on the floor with all of her other toys.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughters birthday.  It is nice enough to wear at a wedding.  Great value</li>
            <li> Heavy and beautiful  but a lil too heavy to keep in place.</li>
            <li> Love it! Bought it for my Elsa (from Frozen) Costume for Halloween and it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> I brought this to wear for my wedding coming up 10/9/10, it went so well with my swavorski veil I brought from gingerwedding on here, I was soo impressed with the quality, it beats paying $200 for one at David&#x27;s Bridal, this was just as nice less the price, don&#x27;t feel intimidated to buy I was at first but glad I purchased, now my headpiece wear is complete : )</li>
            <li> I bought several of these to use during tea parties after my friend advised me that every girl must have a tiara and sceptor. They are nice quality and very pretty. We&#x27;ve used them several times and they are just as beautiful now as when we first purchased them. I have 3 daughters in their 20&#x27;s. We have tea parties sometimes for birthdays or special events and all the attending ladies wear one. It adds to the special aura of using the fine teacups, teapots, tiny gold spoons, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a little girl whose family is going through a tough time.  I know it will make her feel like the princess she is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the other reviewers have written, the tiara is substantial and very lovely, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every girl needs a tiara!</li>
            <li> I bought this crown on Amazon and I also bought one for my best friend ([[ASIN:B000WN45WO Bridal Wedding Tiara Crown With Center Drop 40596]].) We wore them to our Prom in 2010. They were prefect! They shipped very quickly, were packaged nicely and made us both feel like royalty for the night. I would highly recommend these items to any one looking to complete their look, for any special occasion. Don&#x27;t waste your money at Claire&#x27;s or Icing, which will rip you off, when you can get the same item for less, through Amazon. :)</li>
            <li> This tiara is really very nice.  It seems well made and has a nice weight to it.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a prince &amp; princess pageant for 1st-5th graders. It was a little big diameter-wise for our winning girl, who is a 4th grader, but still beautiful. The height and amount of rhinestones were perfect. It showed up very well in the picture on the front page of the local paper! It was substantial and sparkly, and I will probably order it again for next year&#x27;s pageant!</li>
            <li> LOVE!! I WORE IT MY ENTIRE 25TH BIRTHDAY WEEKEND..IT WAS SO PRETTY, MADE ME FEEL LIKE A PRINCESS.</li>
            <li> This crown is made of sturdy metal.  We bought it for a Disney cruise and I was quite impressed with the quality verses the price.  It comes packaged in a round plastic case that works really well for storage, too.  I recommend you purchase this crown.</li>
            <li> The tiara was beautiful, and it arrived right on time. I would do business with this company again.</li>
            <li> Although this product was ment for a wedding I gave this to someone special to me on to wear on her 24th birthday. SHE absolutely loved it! she wore it the whole day (work and birthday party) and every girl just admired it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Tiara! It was so wonderfully crafted. I will definitely be buying from them again :)</li>
            <li> i purchased the crown for my step daughter her mother and i got married and her mother had a tiara and she wanted one. it was beautiful and a great value. it was exactly what the seller said it would be, and was shipped super fast. everything i asked for and more thank you</li>
            <li> The bride wore this multiple times! It was able to stay in her hair with a natural style as well as with braids. It came packaged well and you could see the beauty as soon as taking it out of the box!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wedding.  it was priced much lower than the ones at wedding websights so I did not expect much.  It was bigger and more beautiful than what I expected.  I am so glad I bought it here!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as a &amp;#34;joke&amp;#34;. I usually give her some type of diamond jewelry for Christmas,&lt;br /&gt;and she always says the only thing she doesn&#x27;t have is a Tiara.&lt;br /&gt;So before I gave her some diamond hoop earrings, I gave her this as a joke.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I was surprised at how well made and nice looking this was; I was&lt;br /&gt;expecting something on the cheap side.</li>
            <li> I love this tiara. I wear it to go get the mail and I wear it around the house to feel beautiful....All Brides hear this..This a a good deal and very becoming I wear it all of the time!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect , product looked even better in person ... Fast delivery...</li>
            <li> I thought this wasn&#x27;t going to be nice because it was set at such a great price.  It looks better than the picture.  I highly recommend that you purchase it especially since it has a great price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this crown for a play my daughter was in.  It sparkled in the light and was just as pictured.  Beautiful.</li>
            <li> It was great, Look really pretty and reflected the light well. I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> We paired this with the shamrock veil for our lilttle irish girl&#x27;s first communion, she looked beautiful, felt like a princess.</li>
            <li> Used the Tiara Crown for my wedding and bachelorette recently.  It was a perfect fit and it looked beautiful.  Fast shipping, too.</li>
            <li> The picture is deceiving! It looks like a beautiful simple crown, sitting flat on a flat surface, which is exactly what I was looking for but that was not the case when I opened the package. It has hair prongs on the back, which my daughter HATES! The tiara itself is beautiful but unfortunately my little princess won&#x27;t even touch it. I n fact the other day I found it in her garbage.</li>
            <li> The tiara is beautiful and a great price.  My daughter wanted a real princess crown for Christmas and this one fit the idea of that desire.  My only complaint is that one of the sequins fell off pretty quickly, but she doesn&#x27;t seem to really mind. She wears it even to watch television.</li>
            <li> I jus got my tiara today and i am SOOOOO in love. I bought it for my bday it is the perfect height. When i saw the picture i houht it would be too high when i recieved it today in the package it came in i thought it would be too small but once i put it on my head i realized it is the perfect height. My only problem is that it is a little too big which is funny because i thought t would be too small, but my hair is thick so i will definately try to blend my hair better with the tiara to hide the space. But overall i love it and i cannot wait till my bdayy to wear it :-)</li>
            <li> Very pretty tiara for the price (the packaging was not so good). I plan to use it for my wedding.  I did not want to spend lots of money for a one time use accessory.  This will work.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my buddy&#x27;s young girl from for her birthday.  Now, I&#x27;m a hero forever.</li>
            <li> This is well made and gorgeous. Made me feel like a princess on my wedding day.  Little girls even came up to me to say HI to the \\&quot;princess.\\&quot;  It was so cool and put that nice final touch to my attire.  Very happy with this purchase.  Well worth it!</li>
            <li> this is really nice tiara, I brought this tiara for my little girl for the wedding and this tiara was actually bigger and better than I thought it would be, it was bigger than the other tiara that I had brought for me. If you are considering getting this tiara I would recommend it unless you want a really big tiara. Overall I am happy with this purchase I would defiantly purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My daughter (7 yrs old) is the flower girl in a wedding this summer. She wanted a tiara to wear. This one is lovely. lots of sparkle and seems sturdy, like it won&#x27;t fall apart easily. The combs at each end of the tiara fit perfectly into her hair so it will stay put. the metal head band is malleable enough that we were able to make it fit her head, as it is meant for an adult. exactly the product I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> It made my little princes thrilled when she saw it.  Even her older sisters had to try it on. Excellent quality, looks way more expensive than it was,  shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it!! I got it in 4 days. As soon as I got it, I had it on my head. I walked around all day with it on. I felt like a princess. It was so comfortable. I expected it to be taller, but it is still stunning.</li>
            <li> Sister loved the tiara. Could not wear all day like others claimed. Over all it was beautiful piece on her head</li>
            <li> I bought this tiara to wear as part of a Halloween costume, and the quality is very good. The tiara feels sturdy without  being too heavy on my head. And it&#x27;s very pretty, not tacky like many costume jewelry tiaras I saw in stores when I was shopping for my Halloween costume. It arrived in perfect condition, with no missing crystals or damaged pieces. I kept it to reuse for future costume parties.</li>
            <li> This company is very prompt in mailing out the product and they are beautiful.  I purchased several for my online business and hope the beauty of these will make Sparkly Crystal  famous.  Jewelry....Sparkly Crystal</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a beautiful 4 year old birthday princess. She absolutely loved her tiara. She said she felt like a real princess!</li>
            <li> Very nice product! Very Sturdy &amp; good price! I am thankful for the reviews I had read before buying this. I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful!  We use this tiara at our church&#x27;s Celebration for girls who complete a special incentive program.  They love the tiaras!!</li>
            <li> It is absolutely beautiful I would give 5 stars but have not worn it yet so unsure of the fit but my fingers are crossed.</li>
            <li> My Daughter use for pretend play for 2 mo before it broke. Looks pretty.  She loved it while it lasted!</li>
            <li> I chose to wear my mother&#x27;s wedding dress (something old) this is the perfect accessory to pair with it (something new) i am very excited to wear it for my wedding.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Tiara. purchased for my stepdaughter to finalize her Frozen outfit. It was much nicer than I thought it would be for the price. Only issue is that it can be uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time... but young kids tend not to wear them for too long.</li>
            <li> This tiara is pretty durable, and looks nice. I got this for a friend to wear the week before her wedding. She seemed to like it.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful Tiara. I bought one for younger daughter. When my older daughter saw it, she wanted it too. It is sparkly and well made. Both girls have it for pretend play. Given the quality, it is not that much expensive compared to those plastic ones, price of which adds up by buying them over and over, each time after only few days of playing. Bridal Wedding Tiara is also very nice for adults for any occasion. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Looked great on the bride on bachelorette party.  Cons are that it hurt her head a little bit, we tried bending it but it still felt like a too tight headband</li>
            <li> This was for my seven year old granddaughter Christmas gift. Good quality for the price. She loves it and thinks it is real even though I told her they are not diamonds. She slept in it.</li>
            <li> Very beautifully made. When I tried it on it kind of pinched my head. I had top bend the Combs a bit but it still looks great!</li>
            <li> This tiara crown was priced perfectly and was made of good quality material. It serves it&#x27;s purpose as a photography prop.</li>
            <li> Made my wife the Domestic Princess</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter.  She absolutely loves it.  The tiara looks like a million bucks.  Very beautiful and sparkly.</li>
            <li> This Tierra was perfect! Bought it for my 3yr old, it is a little big but fits and she loves it.. Definatly worth the price!</li>
            <li> What every little girl needs, a crown!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a homecoming dance and it was okay. I would not recommend it for a bride at all! It&#x27;s a little more durable than something you would find in Party City. If you need it for a party, dance, birthday, or night out with the girls; GET IT! Just don&#x27;t order it for your wedding day!</li>
            <li> purchased for 7 year old granddaughter...perfect!  not too heavy, just the right amount of sparkle. she loves it.  price quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> Just for fun, we got our 10 year old Grand Daughter this for Christmas.  She loved it!  She is right in that age where she is getting to old for Barbies but still likes to play with hair and nails and lipstick. She really does look so very pretty in it and it will last forever.  It looks pretty real!</li>
            <li> I got this tiara for my Mother&#x27;s 90th birthday....it is beautiful and she was thrilled with it...made her feel like a queen. :-) It&#x27;s made so well and I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not being pleased with it.  The quality is topnotch....and the price amazing for what you get.  Do not hesitate to pick this tiara...for any age or event.  Kudos to the sellers.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several of these for my daughter and her friends birthdays. They feel like little princesses we are very happy with them. They stay on your head with the built in hair combs.</li>
            <li> Was purchased as a statement piece to celebrate a 44th wedding anniversary. It looks way better than the pictures, Fits an adult size head well and looks good when worn. Came quick packed well and in one piece with no damage.</li>
            <li> This tiara was larger than I expected in the photo.  It is quite lovely.  I am very pleased with the quality.  It is not flimsy at all.</li>
            <li> First this tiara is made of metal.  That includes the combs on the side that hold it in place.  I found it to feel very sturdy and was very pleased with it&#x27;s construction for the price.  It also came a reusable plastic container that was thin, but adequate for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loved it. I was replacing one that another little girl had accidentally (hopefully) taken from her at a birthday party. Lots of hugs were given and faith in Daddy was restored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stones were adequately sparkly and there wasn&#x27;t any glue over them or anything messy like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was everything it claimed to be and I couldn&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This crown was for a birthday party it was some pretty it can be used for a wedding good quality, I would buy from this company again. do not look cheap at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted a tiara for my daughter&#x27;s Princess Sofia costume and thought this was cute and reasonably priced. When it arrived I was amazed at how beautiful it really is. She absolutely loves it! It is sturdy and made well for it&#x27;s price. If I had gone to a store and saw this I would have expected it to be much more expensive. So happy we got it!</li>
            <li> Looks far nicer than I expected.  Love the case it is packed in as I&#x27;m taking it in a suitcase for a cruise.  I haven&#x27;t worn it yet, so if I experience any problems I&#x27;ll post when I return.  But so far it&#x27;s everything I could want.  Does not look cheap at all (like some I&#x27;ve seen at hobby stores)</li>
            <li> Got this for my friend as a birthday and engagement gift. It turns out she had been eyeing it for herself and didn&#x27;t buy it yet, and I had no way of knowing. She had been avoiding it due to negative reviews. It&#x27;s small but very well made, no problems or complaints. Very sweet! Not fancy but just right for a lady who wants to make a statement but not be obnoxious.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these tiaras for Samhain/Halloween last year. :) My daughter and I went as princesses, and these tiaras were the iceing on the sparkly cake. :) Both fit great: I could easly bend the thick and strong metal of the tiara to fit my daughters head *4 years old*, and it fit mine perfectly. :) Only issue: the rhinestones are loosly fitted into the metal. I had to fix one of the 2 tiaras. . . 4 stones fell out. . . but still worth the buy :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wedding, i was a bit ifffy but after a couple days trying to decide between this one and 2 more i decided to go with this one. It looks a little bigger in the pic than the original size. It looks more expensive that what i paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;I also received this product a few days before the edd and thats a plus for me. I would buy from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;Its simply Beautiful... It goes well with my wedding dress...Just Perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Sturdy for an aspiring princess.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect bachelorette Tiara.  It looked even better in person.  It was nice and sparkly with just the right amount of crystals.  Importantly, it did not look cheap at all for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Our little princess really enjoys this very well-made tiara.  I highly recommend it. You will not find anything better. OK?</li>
            <li> Given as a gift, the recipient adored it, &amp; tried to find more reasons to wear it. It is shiny &amp; just the right size.</li>
            <li> Well made of metal and durable. Nicely designed with crystal jewels, instead of plastic; was a nice touch. My Granddaughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Tiara was not as big as it looked, but it was beautiful.  My daughter wore it for her fifteenth birthday.</li>
            <li> The tiara is very beautiful, I feel like a little princess. Look forward to wearing it on my wedding day!</li>
            <li> My daughter (8) loves this tiara.  It was beautiful, but most importantly it stayed on her head.  The weight is distributed well and the combs are in the right spot.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my flower girl and it was perfect. She felt like a princess and it was very well made for the price.</li>
            <li> This tiara is very nice and excellent value for the price. It does sit on my head a bit awkwardly, which is why I gave it less than five stars.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful tiara for the price! A bit big but my friend has big hair so worked out well</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who was Maid of Honor in my wedding. Very pretty ships extremely fast. Good quailty item, great deal for the price. Much prettier and larger in person. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little 9 year old cousin for secret santa. I was worried that it wasn&#x27;t going to look so great so, when it was time for her to open her present, she actually enjoyed it very much and it was beautiful. I was also afraid that it might of been too big to fit her but, it actually fit her quite well. Not saying that it is little but it seems to fit younger kids also. So, this is a very  nice product and very good price.</li>
            <li> The tiara arrived fine. I bought it for a 6 year old to play with and it is pretty substantial. It is holding up to her handling and adjusts appropriately. It is nice enough to wear for a wedding!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 10 year old daughter for a school event.  I have a large head, and this was too big for me.  I was able to bend it to work on her head.  Otherwise, the tiara was well-made and beautiful.</li>
            <li> sent this to adult daughter to surprise her for accomplishment -- I&#x27;m not sure she liked the gift.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s 18th birthday party, along with the pink &amp;#34;Birthday Diva&amp;#34; sash. Cute, cute, cute!  I&#x27;ll wear the crown for a halloween office party but it would also make a lovely wedding tiara as well.</li>
            <li> I got this tiara as a fun hair accessory. I was a little worried at first that it would be too small. But when I opened the packaging it was just the right size. It has a very sturdy metal base and clear crystals all over. I&#x27;m guessing the crystals won&#x27;t be falling out and the tiara won&#x27;t be snapping any time soon. The crystals are very well fused to the tiara and the metal is real and nicely-weighted. This tiara was definitely not made cheaply. I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> Ignore complaints about size issues for toddlers. As this is metal it can be carefully and easily shaped to fit a young 2 year old&#x27;s head. Outstanding quality. Sofia, watch out!</li>
            <li> I wore this for my engagement party this past weekend and it was perfect!  Everyone loved it and I felt like a princess :-)  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Great value.  Little princess adored it.</li>
            <li> I bought this tiara for a classy bachelorette party. It didn&#x27;t disappoint. It was surprisingly well made and heavy. The bride was very happy to wear it.</li>
            <li> This tiara was beautiful great quality price and speed!!! My wife loved it and looked stunning in it!!! If your buying this for a child keep in mind it is real metal or good weight with combs! So she would need to be a true princess!!! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and well made</li>
            <li> This was really a nice substantial tiara for the price.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old granddaughter wears this everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is a very delicate tiara. So if you want something dainty and beautiful, this is the one for you. It is also romantic with the heart in the center.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful! But what I love the most is that it stayed in place the whole time I ran the Princess Half Marathon. It didn&#x27;t bother me one bit.</li>
            <li> I bought this for two of my girlfriends for their 40th birthday and they LOVED it.  It&#x27;s good quality (for a silly birthday gift).  My friends lot a lot of compliments and had a great time wearing it.</li>
            <li> Nice, heavy and real well fitting on my head. I bought it more for dress up purposes but think it would looke great for any bride.</li>
            <li> it came very quickly and it was as ordered, unfortunately, it was not appropriate for the occasion…they made it very easy to return&lt;br /&gt;i think that is important too</li>
            <li> Looks OK. Slightly better than what you would get at Party City, but the teeth that hold it in came bent and&lt;br /&gt;broke during the first time I used this. Luckily it was only for a costume so i don&#x27;t care, but would&lt;br /&gt;not reccommend it for a &#x27;bride.&#x27;</li>
            <li> The tiara wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34; as the necklace set purchased to wear with it. Still a pretty tiara. For the price, it was an okay purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this for my roommate&#x27;s birthday and she is not like me and hates attention.  So despite it looking great and fitting well she refused to wear it.  Perfect tiara for any occassion.</li>
            <li> Sent this to my niece for her birthday. It was really beautiful, and for a 5 year old, felt more expensive than any of the toy ones she has. She LOVED it!</li>
            <li> Comes packaged well in a little clear plastic case. Seem to be made of quality material (metal not plastic). It is smaller than I pictured and I am not sure this will fit on my girlfriend&#x27;s head! The diamonds and details are not perfect - different spaces between them and so forth, which makes it look a little shotty up close. It seems too delicate for a little girl to play with, but too small for an adult. I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if it fits her. It does look pretty though.</li>
            <li> Purchased these to go with their princess dresses for Disney. They arrived fast and in a beautiful container. These are well made and will be used for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Pretty Tiara Crown that I collect and display at home.</li>
            <li> Very nice! This is not a cheaply constructed piece (well, it&#x27;s not a feat of engineering either, but at least it&#x27;s not flimsy). Looks pretty in my hair, and I look forward to wearing it on Halloween.</li>
            <li> This tiara is great! I got it for a Princess and the Frog Halloween costume and it has exceed my expectations. It&#x27;s lovely and made of sturdy metal set with &amp;#34;gems&amp;#34; with a beautiful sparkle; so much better than a plastic tiara for costumes. It also comes in a sturdy plastic box so it can easily be stored for years to come.</li>
            <li> I bought this tiara for a nine year old who loves to dress up.  She LOVED it!  The item came a day early (I chose regular shipping) and was in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks slightly smaller in real life, but that may just be because the picture is not taken on a person&#x27;s head.  But the nine-year old loved it and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This lifted the spirits of my &amp;#34;princess&amp;#34; the minute I gave it to her, after a very trying day at work. My spirits were lifted when I saw the big smile on her face. It is perfect!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my daughters 5th birthday but it&#x27;s held up through a year of rough play. The tiara is very sparkly and pretty and seems very similar to ones I saw while bridal shopping except a fraction of the cost. The metal is not flimsy but not too heavy on the head. Very pleased with our purchase.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> It looks better than it shows online.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 5 yr old and it was big for her but I was able to carefully bend it to fit her perfectly.  It was packaged well and the little round clear plastic it came in is perfect to store it in and keep it nice!  It was dropped and messed with a lot and held up.  I got a lot of comments about how pretty it was and how expensive it must have been.  Great Buy!</li>
            <li> I got this based on the positive reviews. It is a beautiful, well-made, sturdy piece. I look fabulous in it, and I wish I had an occasion to wear it...besides walking my dog, which for the time being serves as the only place I can get away with wearing it without getting strange looks and comments about my opinion of myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot fault the tiara at all. However, be aware that this is made for adult use. I took a chance and ordered it for my four year old because I was tired of the cheapo plastic junk tiaras that would break after three uses. We can sometimes share headbands, so I thought maybe she would be able to use this tiara. That is not the case. It will not stay on her head at all, and the band is definitely too wide for a toddler&#x27;s head. I&#x27;ll still be on the lookout for a non-junky child&#x27;s tiara, and will keep this one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone searching for an adult tiara. If you&#x27;re looking for one for a child, keep searching.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my friends Bachelor party... great quality for the price. He loved it!</li>
            <li> Very Happy with Purchase. I bought this for my daughter for hallowen. It fit her great and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Love this tiara. I had this tiara before until a friends children destroyed it &amp; it was used without my permission after a hair pageant. I loved it so much that I purchased it again. I wore it for my birthday and I will probably reuse it again and again. It came before the expected delivery date and I was pleased.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed - I am an amateur photographer and I bought this tiara to use as a prop.  It&#x27;s just the perfect item!  Can&#x27;t wait to try it out!!!</li>
            <li> I was afraid I might be getting some cheap made plastic tiara, but this is well made and heavy.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This was a birthday present from my husband, and just like Amy Farrah Fowler of the Big Bang Theory: &amp;#34;I&#x27;m a princess and this is my tiara!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It is glittery,and has all the rhinestones.  It&#x27;s a little tight, but I may have a bigger head. And I am an adult.  I am sure this would fit a child without difficulty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty tiara. The price justify the product. The only negative thing I could say is that it doesn&#x27;t look pricey. If you are looking for a tiara that is inexpensive but looks expensive, this product is not it.</li>
            <li> I tried the tiara hair comb, but it was small.  This is for a 5 year old and 7 year old.  I haven&#x27;t seen it as I sent it directly to our granddaughters in WA.  They loved it!  She said it made her feel like a princess.  Her comment, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s gorgeous&amp;#34;.  My daughter said it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love this tiara! I wasn&#x27;t getting married....I wore this for the big 30 lol. It&#x27;s really nice! Very Classy, I must say!</li>
            <li> Yes, yes, and YES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have all daughters in our Castle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this little gem proved to be an overwhelmingly great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite sparkly, sturdy, and just plain pretty... great characteristics of a really good tiara/crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well worth the purchase price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for pageantry. It is light and not of the best quality.  As a piece for a party, it is fine. If you  are watching you  budget, I guess this would work.</li>
            <li> Got it for my sister&#x27;s sweet sixteen and she loved it! it was very pretty and it really sparkles! It was not made out of cheap material either!</li>
            <li> This was even better than I expected it to be. What a beautiful little tiara for such a small amount of money. If you have a budding princess like my granddaughter, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying cheap tiara online, scared that it will look very cheap and plasticy. But this one completely amazed me when I got it in the mail. Really sturdy plastic, doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all. The fake diamonds really sparkle and its a great buy.</li>
            <li> it is adorable for my daughter. However the stones fall out so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> It looks perfect for prom!! I felt like a princess!!</li>
            <li> A hit with my darling granddaughter, Xallie.</li>
            <li> It is super cute and I love it. The only problem is it lost one of the crystals the day I got it. So that is pretty lame. Especially since it is supposed to be a keepsake for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Three stars because it isn&#x27;t too noticeable that the crystal is missing. And it is still really pretty. And it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my nieces to wear in my sisters wedding.  They were very well made.</li>
            <li> This was a beautiful tiara. looks like it cost way more that the reasonable  price i paid.&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully made, well packaged great value for the money</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!! I BOUGHT ONE FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER AND HAD TO BUY ONE FOR MYSELF SO WE CAN PLAY TOGETHER WITH THEM</li>
            <li> Every little girl needs a non-plastic amazing tiara that she can wear when she if feeling princessy.  My two nieces really like these.  They go great with a tutu.</li>
            <li> The look and sparkle is amazing so beautiful, shipping and price was not to bad im wearing this for my wedding so its goes perfect for my heart theme and the bling really does shine</li>
            <li> love it its just it bends and stretches very easily..... good and bad thing</li>
            <li> Extremely well made and very impressive for the price. I bought this item based off the other reviews and I must say that I am very glad I did!</li>
            <li> This makes me feel pretty.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and exceeded my expectations! Nice bling and great facets!  It was for my great aunt 90th birthday and was a hit!!</li>
            <li> I got this to treat myself for my birthday. I thought it was just be a cute little tiara to wear when goofing off with friends... no, this is much sturdier and way more beautiful than the photo can possibly do it credit. The crystals are very well set, the metal is very strong and can&#x27;t possibly accidentally bend or get dinged funny, the combs actually hold well even in my hard-to-hold-onto fine hair. This is keepsake material. This made my birthday really special.</li>
            <li> amazing! Daughter loves it vs. the plastic ones! She wears it daily! Highly recommend vs. fake plastic ones. Thank you !</li>
            <li> I bought this tiara for my 3 1/2 year old daughter to wear to a princess themed birthday party. The tiara definitely exceeded my expectations! It is very solidly made and high quality. A really lovely design! It was easy to shape it a bit to fit my daughter. This is a much better option than the toddler sized toy tiaras, (most of which were plastic and very cheap looking). I was really impressed with the design and quality of the tiara, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> It is Beautiful &amp; met my expatation. This is a gift for my niece. Terrific gift &amp; she gets to be a real princess</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten more use from this tiara than I could have guessed.  When my daughter was recovering from back surgery but still a inpatient, we both wore a tiara and went through the hospital (St. Anthony&#x27;s in Lakewood, CO - great care) to thank the countless people who took such good care of her.  We cheered up the entire hospital. Subsequently I&#x27;ve worn this just for fun to meet friends.  It&#x27;s a great prop and encouraged us to take picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for quality, it fine.  It&#x27;s not too much.  Maybe my next one will be 18 kt platinum with real diamonds.  (The other tiara we had was &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34;.)</li>
            <li> Christmas present for 4-year old granddaughter.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is Cinderella in the play and needed  a \\&quot;ball gown\\&quot;.  Saw this gown and thought it would work.  Well it turned out to be just perfect.  The quality of this dress is unbelievable.  It is long but we read another review that suggested making scallops like Belle&#x27;s dress and it looks beautiful.  The dress is more theatrical quality than a costume.  Absolutely lovely!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter wore this for her Quinceanera. Looked beautiful!! Sturdy quality, had a little flexibility to better mold to her head but was not flimsy.</li>
            <li> The attached combs on each side of the crown caused pain to the child and the design of these cheap combs caused the child&#x27;s hair to get caught in the comb.  Pretty crown, but poor design.</li>
            <li> Actually purchased this for a friend&#x27;s 50th surprise birthday party.  It was absolutely everything I needed it to be with a great price tag.  Will be used again I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I love this tiara!  I think it looks so elegant on the girl who is chosen as Ms. Wheelchair Wisconsin each year at our annual pageant.</li>
            <li> I wore this onmy wedding day, it was beautiful and not cheaply made. It did not snag my hair and was pretty light on my head.</li>
            <li> I love it and so did everyone else it was perfect for my wedding it fits awesome on my head</li>
            <li> My husband and I decided to elope in Vegas. Spur of the moment thing. We live here, why not? haha :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So aside from jeans and a blouse, I ordered this to be a princess for a day. It really looks great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s crafted well, the sparklies don&#x27;t fall out randomly, and it&#x27;s fahbulous!</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this.  She likes to be a princess.  It is very pretty and it holds up to a 3 year old.</li>
            <li> beautiful and very sparkling.  My daughter said it was the perfect cinderella tiara that matched her gown and wedding theme</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy, very durable. A bit difficult to bend to more of a head shape and the combs dig in to the scalp a bit, but well worth the awesome compliments and look.</li>
            <li> I ordered this crown for my girlfriend, for her birthday, I wanted to get one of that did not look or feel like it came from a dollar store. very happy with everything about it..best buy..you will not be sorry</li>
            <li> Worked ok but wasn&#x27;t worth the money. Got charged extra for internatioal fee purchases out of USA. Willbuy there again never</li>
            <li> My girlfriend used this crown for a Cinderella costume because the crown her costume came with was terribly cheap looking. She received many compliments because of how &#x27;real&#x27; it looks. It sparkles beautifully and is well made.</li>
            <li> This tiara was more than I anticipated! I bought it for my Mother &#x27;s 90th Birthday celebration; it made her look like a queen. It was light, comfortable, and sparkling. She wore it for the entire event!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful as the photo showed and can&#x27;t wait to wear it for my wedding</li>
            <li> GOT IT FOR A NEW BORN  MOM LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> It looks amazing! I used it for my princess Halloween costume and I loved it!</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER IS IN HER 1ST PAGEANT , THATS WHY I PURCHASED THIS , ITS A LIL BIG FOR HER , BUT JUST MEANS SHE CAN USE IT LONGER . SHE LOVES IT . WELL WORTH THE PRICE VERY DURABLE , CONSIDERING HOW MANY PLASTIC ONES WE&#x27;VE BEEN THREW .... ANY PRINCESS WOULD LOVE IT !</li>
            <li> This is so beautiful I used it for my wedding and I must say I looked like a queen . And it doesn&#x27;t look cheep at all people thought I paid so much money for it boy did I fool them lol heheh :--)</li>
