            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye lid tapes and the one has got to be the best eyelid tape I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>and my eyes came out beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy this product exists.</li>
            <li>thing I would suggest is that it doesn&#x27;t stick all that great sometimes</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>These are great for women my age</li>
            <li>so great cause</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>GREAT product again.</li>
            <li>very nice</li>
            <li>Of course, the adhesive wont be able to hold out against water, especially warm water, so be weary of that if you&#x27;re thinking of wearing these to the pool.</li>
            <li>I just bought this tape and loving it!</li>
            <li>Not so good for that..</li>
            <li>Good as it always be~</li>
            <li>It works good for me</li>
            <li>Holds on so good.</li>
            <li>The good news is that It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do.</li>
            <li>But delivery was on time and great. :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already been seeing some great results:)</li>
            <li>This works beautifully right now, and I got exquisite results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best using one in the am and right before bed.</li>
            <li>My FAVORITE!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found this!  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li>but it was so nice to look .</li>
            <li>This type of tape is popular in East Asia, where some women prefer to create a double-eyelid.</li>
            <li>You can feel the tape when you&#x27;re wearing it but its not any discomfort kind of feel.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of using this product, I am very satisfied and glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li>but if you were in hurry , it wont look nice, so you need more time, but I stop using it anymore.</li>
            <li>This eyelid tape is the best I ever use so far.</li>
            <li>This double-sided one seemed ideal for starters, it came with 60 pairs and the price was very reasonable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if that&#x27;s true then its a good alternative to surgery.</li>
            <li>I tried it and its very comfortable and uncomplicated.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing and easy to use</li>
            <li>Def will be ordering more &#x3D;).</li>
            <li>lol I looked very strange!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>If you are asian and are using it for what it was made for im sure it will work great!</li>
            <li>I love this eyelid tape.</li>
            <li>I tried several kinds of eyelid tape, and this is the best.</li>
            <li>I will feel more confident going out.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work well on top of makeup, but you can apply makeup on top to help camouflage the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; fold.  </li>
            <li>This one fits ok with the size of my eyes but for now its my favorite.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the blue one will be perfect when i purchase it next :D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that if you can put on gel or liquid eyeliner with some ease, you&#x27;ll definitely be able to put this tape on.</li>
            <li>Meaning it can cause your lids to droop even more.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I don&#x27;t even remember it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>These were okay, but I still like the Eye Charm tapes better.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different types but this one works the best!</li>
            <li>Maybe the &amp;#34;Extra&amp;#34; will be better instead of the &amp;#34;Mild&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s definitely more pronounced.</li>
            <li>Love it and will keep getting it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Also, I can say that this product is definitely better than eye glue....</li>
            <li>i had started out with buying the extra strength version, which stayed on all day, which is wonderful.</li>
            <li>difference is that it stays on between 6-8 hours (and i have oily eyelids, so i&#x27;m sure it would stay on longer for people who do not)</li>
            <li>I have used it for over a year now and keep on ordering more.</li>
            <li>Works great so far :)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping Good quality</li>
            <li>When I did get it right it did look nice though.</li>
            <li>When I got the tape, I followed the directions on a youtube video that my fiance found for me, and my eye matches the other one perfectly.</li>
            <li>Some people have said that it took them many tries to perfect, but I found this NOT to be true.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to get off using makeup remover.</li>
            <li>These were easy to use and I am considering not proceeding with the surgery, but instead using these moving forward.</li>
            <li>Nice, I love it so so much.</li>
            <li>Easy application and removal with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>up application has not been easy wearing these</li>
            <li>Oil will easily get these off without having to pull at your lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great product, the only thing you can&#x27;t put make up on top of it as it will unstick.</li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>easier to apply with fine tweezers then using the eyelid fork thingy to put it in place.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Really easy to put on and comfortable to wear&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to work great for asian woman.</li>
            <li>great product for temporary double eyelids.</li>
            <li>so you have to be precise about placement</li>
            <li>It makes me look more awake and fresh.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for people who want double eyelids or want to correct their eye crease.</li>
            <li>Since my lids have more skin from aging, I place the tape right on my crease which means my lid space is increased by just a fraction of an inch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also getting married, and will feel much better about the photes taken.</li>
            <li>Love it so much !</li>
            <li>Cannot successfully produce double eye lid on my face.</li>
            <li>This really good for Asian people eyes people who have mono-lids</li>
            <li>The double sided tape holds up for a good 12-20 hrs.</li>
            <li>but overall, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>If you are not sure like i was i think its best you give it a try first.  </li>
            <li>My eyelids get super oily, so tapes have the tendency to slide off overtime.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply(after you watch the tutorial video on Youtube), and even though this one says mild, but it still works very well.</li>
            <li>It sticks on for the whole day!!</li>
            <li>It is easier to used Tweezers rather than the \\&quot;fork\\&quot; provided, but the fork is useful for getting an even application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even took a HOT shower with the tape on and washed my face; it&#x27;s now an hour later, and it shows no signs of peeling--though, to be fair, I didn&#x27;t exactly scrub my eyelids.</li>
            <li>The Eye Charm tapes are easier to use and look more natural.  </li>
            <li>This product was worth trying but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I could never get it quite right - to apply the eyelid cutout to the correct place.  </li>
            <li>Had to try it a couple days before getting to know where to put it to get it right.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, unnoticeable, and easy enough to put on.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product except for the fact that the MILD version was actually more irritating than the regular; very itchy  </li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t stick the tape right</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re Asian or a white girl with Asian-looking eyes like me, and all you want is ANY eye lid showing, then this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I Purchased this item cause like most asian woman i always wanted to have a crease.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly know what this does</li>
            <li>It is the first time I tried using eyelid tape.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used something like this.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of practice but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see what happens by the time I run out of this first pack.</li>
            <li>But if your not wearing make up most times it can last 24hrs aCrossing my fingers</li>
            <li>Whether that translates into being able to use each one longer is probably a different story.</li>
            <li>my first time to try this</li>
            <li>I tried putting this tape on first and as soon as I put my eyeshadow primer on, it was gumming up the tape.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I did was order the tape.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used eyelid tape</li>
            <li>but you can use that eye stick thingy to test it out first.</li>
            <li>It sticks pretty well if you know how to apply it</li>
            <li>(if you don&#x27;t know, just look up a video on YouTube and look through the pictures in the booklet that comes with it), however when I first used it, one of the corners of the eyelid tape kept pricking me, but then I realized I just had to cut some of the corner that would prick me with a scissor</li>
            <li>And if you like it I recommend you put on your make up first</li>
            <li>the tape sticks to my lid pretty well, but the sticky parts will stay on my lid when I take the tape off.</li>
            <li>but once it&#x27;s done right, can be looked like real</li>
            <li>Looks really good, not easy using those.</li>
            <li>Maybe next time I&#x27;ll try the blue one to see whether it&#x27;s as good as this.</li>
            <li>Even so, I was positive</li>
            <li>I use these on a regular basis, they work well, and are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The product comes without any English instructions, but the tape is really easy to place and use.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s simple and easy to apply on your eyelids.  </li>
            <li>It was fast shipping</li>
            <li>So before going through with the surgery I wanted to try these out to see if having the crease would make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very noticeable-disappointed with this product?</li>
            <li>This really works well for me.</li>
            <li>It really does stay and creates an evenness on my eyelids that I desired.</li>
            <li>If you wants a dramatically larger/more visible eyelids, then a surgical eye lift is probably what you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li>I use this product every night during my whole sleep.</li>
            <li>This product really works</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t impact your look a whole lot, but product works as intended.</li>
            <li>One day I saw a youtube video on how one girl corrected her irregularity with D.U.P eyelid tape, she wore them for three months straight, 22 hours a day.</li>
            <li>fast forward to purchasing this product...</li>
            <li>I have used another kind of tape which only stick on one side which totally didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>so I would buy the more stickier version of this unless you are wearing this daily, then go for something like this that won&#x27;t damage the sensitive skin around your eyes..</li>
            <li>I am so thankful that I didn&#x27;t have to take more extreme measures to correct this problem.</li>
            <li>I was first just looking it up for fun to see if they made such a thing for myself</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have great lasting power either, and will start peeling from the edges of my eyes within a few hours--which doesnt help with the itchiness!</li>
            <li>Actually very easy; I probably wasted about two in all.</li>
            <li>stuff is very sticky and is very clear blends with skin very well.</li>
            <li>, so not quite sure it&#x27;s my problem or not, it&#x27;s not very easy to apply on,</li>
            <li>I think this brand is better than most as this doesn&#x27;t have those weird cross-lines on the tape.</li>
            <li>having tried both versions, I think the extra one holds the double eyelid better</li>
            <li>Then I apply white or lighter color eye shadow just under the browline &amp; that seems to make the eye lid appear more open.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s only sometimes when I don&#x27;t put it on right or put too much eyeshadow on over it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend eyelid tape.</li>
            <li>It does the job, and had the best lasting power out of all the other tapes I used in the past.</li>
            <li>Okay i bought few this items ....</li>
            <li>I was fed up with it being uneven most of the time</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a V shaped prong which is used to press in the lid to get the new crease as well as to hold onto the tape, but I couldn&#x27;t get the tape on correctly using it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Edited on June 2, 2014:  I&#x27;ve noticed that if I wear these pretty much daily, after about the 4-5 week my new lid crease will stay for about a week.</li>
            <li>So I gotta train my other eyelid to have the same crease :)</li>
            <li>two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was scared to use these at first because eyelid tape weakens the elasticity in you eye (thins and stretches out the skin), this will cause the opposite effect if you wear the tape too often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just applying light shadow on my lid, dark eyeshadow in the outer corners and the cat eye liner which works for now.  </li>
            <li>For hooded lids, I would recommend putting eye makeup on first and placing the tape last.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest a product that has a little more width and the advantage of a gel to allow for repeated tries to get it right.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it had a very apparent shade of white which became more obvious as you put the actual item on your eyes.</li>
            <li>I accidentally purchased the mild adhesive so will try the extra adhesive on my next order.</li>
            <li>It does get a little itchy sometimes, but when is beauty ever comfortable?</li>
            <li>I was under the impression that this item is clear and transparent as it stated.</li>
            <li>The item in question was neither clear nor transparent.</li>
            <li>They give my eyes the natural crease look, they are sweatproof, and sleep proof too.</li>
            <li>This tape feel so naturally</li>
            <li>your eyes come out really naturally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised it worked</li>
            <li>(How much lid you can get to show will depend on how much lid skin you actually have and the different ways you apply the product.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m two weeks in so far wearing them 24-7.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the side of the tape may not stick well enough and may pierce out, but it&#x27;s not too much of a burden</li>
            <li>Overall lasts during the whole day, no problems at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit my eyes, or maybe my eyelids are just too heavy for them.</li>
            <li>The only useful double eye tape on the market.</li>
            <li>Was able to wear for a few hours for a couple days at a time for several weeks and my eyelid is mostly back to normal.</li>
            <li>It works really well but makes my eyelids a little bit itchy at first.</li>
            <li>It is not for older folks who have flaccid eyelids and multiple skin folds.  </li>
            <li>I think creating a \\&quot;lid\\&quot; on people of Asian decent.</li>
            <li>I was diagnosed with juevenile macular degeneration at age 10 in my left eye, so that eye was getting a lot of exercise my whole life having to work to see, because I&#x27;m kind of blind in that eye, as a reslult</li>
            <li>So I used my tweezers instead and only used the prongs to find where I wanted my new crease to be.  </li>
            <li>Not that easy to wear, too thick</li>
            <li>so this double sided works a lot better but feels a bit uncomfortable and kind of hard to it a hold of it because of its double sided tape.  </li>
            <li>People could never see the color of my eye shadow before, but with this product I can get enough of my lid showing that the color is clearly visible.</li>
            <li>Stays on all day and you can barely notice it.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little practice getting them in the right spot to achieve the shape you want, but it does work.</li>
            <li>It really works and helped one of my eyelid become symmetric with the other.</li>
            <li>the tape is transparent and not really noticeable, the only part that i can see is the very end tips of the tape probably because of the way I taped it on.</li>
            <li>I am lucky to have round and big eyes just no extra lid.</li>
            <li>I did hope for a slightly more dramatic lift, but I&#x27;ve only used them a handful of times since receiving them, so I still have a lot of experimenting to do.</li>
            <li>Now I have uneven eyelids because my right is slightly bigger than my left</li>
            <li>just right i can add another...then use a mineral blusher on the lids, applying w/a small brush &amp; \\&quot;dabbing\\</li>
            <li>All in all, this product is worth trying if your eyelids have failed you in some way ;)</li>
            <li>and it was not long enough atleast</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Perfect!!</li>
            <li> so I try a lot of eyelid tape and for now this is the best one.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I am trying to even out my eyelids and this has working wonderfully!</li>
            <li> The product quality itself is great!</li>
            <li> Great product for anyone with mono or hooded lids!  </li>
            <li> I have been wearing it for a week now, about 20 hours a day, and I have to say I am soooo impressed!</li>
            <li> It works GREAT!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye lid tapes and the one has got to be the best eyelid tape I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!</li>
            <li> and my eyes came out beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy this product exists.</li>
            <li> thing I would suggest is that it doesn&#x27;t stick all that great sometimes</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> These are great for women my age</li>
            <li> so great cause</li>
            <li> great product.</li>
            <li> GREAT product again.</li>
            <li> very nice</li>
            <li> Of course, the adhesive wont be able to hold out against water, especially warm water, so be weary of that if you&#x27;re thinking of wearing these to the pool.</li>
            <li> I just bought this tape and loving it!</li>
            <li> Not so good for that..</li>
            <li> Good as it always be~</li>
            <li> It works good for me</li>
            <li> Holds on so good.</li>
            <li> The good news is that It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do.</li>
            <li> But delivery was on time and great. :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already been seeing some great results:)</li>
            <li> This works beautifully right now, and I got exquisite results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best using one in the am and right before bed.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found this!  </li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> but it was so nice to look .</li>
            <li> This type of tape is popular in East Asia, where some women prefer to create a double-eyelid.</li>
            <li> You can feel the tape when you&#x27;re wearing it but its not any discomfort kind of feel.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using this product, I am very satisfied and glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> but if you were in hurry , it wont look nice, so you need more time, but I stop using it anymore.</li>
            <li> This eyelid tape is the best I ever use so far.</li>
            <li> This double-sided one seemed ideal for starters, it came with 60 pairs and the price was very reasonable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if that&#x27;s true then its a good alternative to surgery.</li>
            <li> I tried it and its very comfortable and uncomplicated.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing and easy to use</li>
            <li> Def will be ordering more &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> lol I looked very strange!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> If you are asian and are using it for what it was made for im sure it will work great!</li>
            <li> I love this eyelid tape.</li>
            <li> I tried several kinds of eyelid tape, and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I will feel more confident going out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on top of makeup, but you can apply makeup on top to help camouflage the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; fold.  </li>
            <li> This one fits ok with the size of my eyes but for now its my favorite.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the blue one will be perfect when i purchase it next :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that if you can put on gel or liquid eyeliner with some ease, you&#x27;ll definitely be able to put this tape on.</li>
            <li> Meaning it can cause your lids to droop even more.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I don&#x27;t even remember it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> These were okay, but I still like the Eye Charm tapes better.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different types but this one works the best!</li>
            <li> Maybe the &amp;#34;Extra&amp;#34; will be better instead of the &amp;#34;Mild&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s definitely more pronounced.</li>
            <li> Love it and will keep getting it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Also, I can say that this product is definitely better than eye glue....</li>
            <li> i had started out with buying the extra strength version, which stayed on all day, which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> difference is that it stays on between 6-8 hours (and i have oily eyelids, so i&#x27;m sure it would stay on longer for people who do not)</li>
            <li> I have used it for over a year now and keep on ordering more.</li>
            <li> Works great so far :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping Good quality</li>
            <li> When I did get it right it did look nice though.</li>
            <li> When I got the tape, I followed the directions on a youtube video that my fiance found for me, and my eye matches the other one perfectly.</li>
            <li> Some people have said that it took them many tries to perfect, but I found this NOT to be true.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to get off using makeup remover.</li>
            <li> These were easy to use and I am considering not proceeding with the surgery, but instead using these moving forward.</li>
            <li> Nice, I love it so so much.</li>
            <li> Easy application and removal with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> up application has not been easy wearing these</li>
            <li> Oil will easily get these off without having to pull at your lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great product, the only thing you can&#x27;t put make up on top of it as it will unstick.</li>
            <li> and it was fine.</li>
            <li> easier to apply with fine tweezers then using the eyelid fork thingy to put it in place.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Really easy to put on and comfortable to wear&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to work great for asian woman.</li>
            <li> great product for temporary double eyelids.</li>
            <li> so you have to be precise about placement</li>
            <li> It makes me look more awake and fresh.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for people who want double eyelids or want to correct their eye crease.</li>
            <li> Since my lids have more skin from aging, I place the tape right on my crease which means my lid space is increased by just a fraction of an inch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also getting married, and will feel much better about the photes taken.</li>
            <li> Love it so much !</li>
            <li> Cannot successfully produce double eye lid on my face.</li>
            <li> This really good for Asian people eyes people who have mono-lids</li>
            <li> The double sided tape holds up for a good 12-20 hrs.</li>
            <li> but overall, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> If you are not sure like i was i think its best you give it a try first.  </li>
            <li> My eyelids get super oily, so tapes have the tendency to slide off overtime.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply(after you watch the tutorial video on Youtube), and even though this one says mild, but it still works very well.</li>
            <li> It sticks on for the whole day!!</li>
            <li> It is easier to used Tweezers rather than the \\&quot;fork\\&quot; provided, but the fork is useful for getting an even application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even took a HOT shower with the tape on and washed my face; it&#x27;s now an hour later, and it shows no signs of peeling--though, to be fair, I didn&#x27;t exactly scrub my eyelids.</li>
            <li> The Eye Charm tapes are easier to use and look more natural.  </li>
            <li> This product was worth trying but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I could never get it quite right - to apply the eyelid cutout to the correct place.  </li>
            <li> Had to try it a couple days before getting to know where to put it to get it right.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, unnoticeable, and easy enough to put on.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product except for the fact that the MILD version was actually more irritating than the regular; very itchy  </li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t stick the tape right</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re Asian or a white girl with Asian-looking eyes like me, and all you want is ANY eye lid showing, then this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I Purchased this item cause like most asian woman i always wanted to have a crease.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exactly know what this does</li>
            <li> It is the first time I tried using eyelid tape.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used something like this.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see what happens by the time I run out of this first pack.</li>
            <li> But if your not wearing make up most times it can last 24hrs aCrossing my fingers</li>
            <li> Whether that translates into being able to use each one longer is probably a different story.</li>
            <li> my first time to try this</li>
            <li> I tried putting this tape on first and as soon as I put my eyeshadow primer on, it was gumming up the tape.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I did was order the tape.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used eyelid tape</li>
            <li> but you can use that eye stick thingy to test it out first.</li>
            <li> It sticks pretty well if you know how to apply it</li>
            <li> (if you don&#x27;t know, just look up a video on YouTube and look through the pictures in the booklet that comes with it), however when I first used it, one of the corners of the eyelid tape kept pricking me, but then I realized I just had to cut some of the corner that would prick me with a scissor</li>
            <li> And if you like it I recommend you put on your make up first</li>
            <li> the tape sticks to my lid pretty well, but the sticky parts will stay on my lid when I take the tape off.</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s done right, can be looked like real</li>
            <li> Looks really good, not easy using those.</li>
            <li> Maybe next time I&#x27;ll try the blue one to see whether it&#x27;s as good as this.</li>
            <li> Even so, I was positive</li>
            <li> I use these on a regular basis, they work well, and are easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The product comes without any English instructions, but the tape is really easy to place and use.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s simple and easy to apply on your eyelids.  </li>
            <li> It was fast shipping</li>
            <li> So before going through with the surgery I wanted to try these out to see if having the crease would make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very noticeable-disappointed with this product?</li>
            <li> This really works well for me.</li>
            <li> It really does stay and creates an evenness on my eyelids that I desired.</li>
            <li> If you wants a dramatically larger/more visible eyelids, then a surgical eye lift is probably what you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li> I use this product every night during my whole sleep.</li>
            <li> This product really works</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t impact your look a whole lot, but product works as intended.</li>
            <li> One day I saw a youtube video on how one girl corrected her irregularity with D.U.P eyelid tape, she wore them for three months straight, 22 hours a day.</li>
            <li> fast forward to purchasing this product...</li>
            <li> I have used another kind of tape which only stick on one side which totally didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> so I would buy the more stickier version of this unless you are wearing this daily, then go for something like this that won&#x27;t damage the sensitive skin around your eyes..</li>
            <li> I am so thankful that I didn&#x27;t have to take more extreme measures to correct this problem.</li>
            <li> I was first just looking it up for fun to see if they made such a thing for myself</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have great lasting power either, and will start peeling from the edges of my eyes within a few hours--which doesnt help with the itchiness!</li>
            <li> Actually very easy; I probably wasted about two in all.</li>
            <li> stuff is very sticky and is very clear blends with skin very well.</li>
            <li> , so not quite sure it&#x27;s my problem or not, it&#x27;s not very easy to apply on,</li>
            <li> I think this brand is better than most as this doesn&#x27;t have those weird cross-lines on the tape.</li>
            <li> having tried both versions, I think the extra one holds the double eyelid better</li>
            <li> Then I apply white or lighter color eye shadow just under the browline &amp; that seems to make the eye lid appear more open.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s only sometimes when I don&#x27;t put it on right or put too much eyeshadow on over it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend eyelid tape.</li>
            <li> It does the job, and had the best lasting power out of all the other tapes I used in the past.</li>
            <li> Okay i bought few this items ....</li>
            <li> I was fed up with it being uneven most of the time</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a V shaped prong which is used to press in the lid to get the new crease as well as to hold onto the tape, but I couldn&#x27;t get the tape on correctly using it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Edited on June 2, 2014:  I&#x27;ve noticed that if I wear these pretty much daily, after about the 4-5 week my new lid crease will stay for about a week.</li>
            <li> So I gotta train my other eyelid to have the same crease :)</li>
            <li> two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was scared to use these at first because eyelid tape weakens the elasticity in you eye (thins and stretches out the skin), this will cause the opposite effect if you wear the tape too often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just applying light shadow on my lid, dark eyeshadow in the outer corners and the cat eye liner which works for now.  </li>
            <li> For hooded lids, I would recommend putting eye makeup on first and placing the tape last.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest a product that has a little more width and the advantage of a gel to allow for repeated tries to get it right.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it had a very apparent shade of white which became more obvious as you put the actual item on your eyes.</li>
            <li> I accidentally purchased the mild adhesive so will try the extra adhesive on my next order.</li>
            <li> It does get a little itchy sometimes, but when is beauty ever comfortable?</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that this item is clear and transparent as it stated.</li>
            <li> The item in question was neither clear nor transparent.</li>
            <li> They give my eyes the natural crease look, they are sweatproof, and sleep proof too.</li>
            <li> This tape feel so naturally</li>
            <li> your eyes come out really naturally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised it worked</li>
            <li> (How much lid you can get to show will depend on how much lid skin you actually have and the different ways you apply the product.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m two weeks in so far wearing them 24-7.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the side of the tape may not stick well enough and may pierce out, but it&#x27;s not too much of a burden</li>
            <li> Overall lasts during the whole day, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit my eyes, or maybe my eyelids are just too heavy for them.</li>
            <li> The only useful double eye tape on the market.</li>
            <li> Was able to wear for a few hours for a couple days at a time for several weeks and my eyelid is mostly back to normal.</li>
            <li> It works really well but makes my eyelids a little bit itchy at first.</li>
            <li> It is not for older folks who have flaccid eyelids and multiple skin folds.  </li>
            <li> I think creating a \\&quot;lid\\&quot; on people of Asian decent.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with juevenile macular degeneration at age 10 in my left eye, so that eye was getting a lot of exercise my whole life having to work to see, because I&#x27;m kind of blind in that eye, as a reslult</li>
            <li> So I used my tweezers instead and only used the prongs to find where I wanted my new crease to be.  </li>
            <li> Not that easy to wear, too thick</li>
            <li> so this double sided works a lot better but feels a bit uncomfortable and kind of hard to it a hold of it because of its double sided tape.  </li>
            <li> People could never see the color of my eye shadow before, but with this product I can get enough of my lid showing that the color is clearly visible.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day and you can barely notice it.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little practice getting them in the right spot to achieve the shape you want, but it does work.</li>
            <li> It really works and helped one of my eyelid become symmetric with the other.</li>
            <li> the tape is transparent and not really noticeable, the only part that i can see is the very end tips of the tape probably because of the way I taped it on.</li>
            <li> I am lucky to have round and big eyes just no extra lid.</li>
            <li> I did hope for a slightly more dramatic lift, but I&#x27;ve only used them a handful of times since receiving them, so I still have a lot of experimenting to do.</li>
            <li> Now I have uneven eyelids because my right is slightly bigger than my left</li>
            <li> just right i can add another...then use a mineral blusher on the lids, applying w/a small brush &amp; \\&quot;dabbing\\</li>
            <li> All in all, this product is worth trying if your eyelids have failed you in some way ;)</li>
            <li> and it was not long enough atleast</li>
            <li> This double sided tape is very soft and flexible, it tends to set down on the lid at the opposite end of the tweezer held end</li>
            <li> Great concept that I have used in the past with clumsy medical tape to address uneven eyelids due to swelling.</li>
            <li> As far as the visibility, I wear dark ripped eyeglasses and no one has noticed that I have the tape on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it is going to last</li>
            <li> my eye lids are pretty thick it don&#x27;t work for them, I will just need to have a lift surgery I think.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting as well.</li>
            <li> Had single eyelids, but after using this for a while, my eyelids became double.</li>
            <li> the loose skin folds on my upper eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and one of my eyelid is different from the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed I was really excited for this product.......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soft and messy for the precision placing.  </li>
            <li> All my life I had to live with a slight irregularity in my eyelids, one was thicker than the other, and I had to adjust my makeup accordingly so that they look even.</li>
            <li> one of my eyelid was mono and the other was double</li>
            <li> one of my eyelid is smaller than the other.</li>
            <li> If you do need to go outside with it, wear some dark sunglasses (it&#x27;s summer</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re purchasing don&#x27;t leave the tape on for too long and be careful when removing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty clumsy and impatient, so I ended up using my fingers instead of the applicator that is included in the package.</li>
            <li> Ill have to try the large one (blue).</li>
            <li> Purchased this to fix one eyelid that became uneven (smaller) after swelling from medications.</li>
            <li> I used this only once and my uneven eyelid corrected itself and it has been even for 2ish weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have heavy upper eyelids.</li>
            <li> It takes few try to get the hang of it but as to the strength this is the only brand works.</li>
            <li> With my eyes closed, you CAN see a line where the tape has \\&quot;glued\\&quot; the lid skin together.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 because it&#x27;s not what I personally expected in terms of this product achieving what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It bends halfway so its not strong enough to put a fold on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> A little frustrating to apply at first.</li>
            <li> i did have a little bit of irritation where the tape had been after using a few days in a row but not nearly as much as when i used the extra strength, and the irritation went away after a day of non-use.</li>
            <li> Well the other one was sagging so</li>
            <li> I was feeling pretty sad about it.</li>
            <li> Will buy other tape</li>
            <li> I hesitated on whether I should purchase this item due to the price.</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes at all like other tapes do.</li>
            <li> Also, have to trim off the sharp ends</li>
            <li> have uneven eyelids and occasionally the uneven eye would correct itself.</li>
            <li> had I not trimmed them down or wear dark eye shadow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s double sided and really subtle.</li>
            <li> a day and is much less aggressive on the skin when taken off.</li>

            <li> It takes a few tries to get the feel of the delicate.</li>

            <li> I Purchased this item cause like most asian woman i always wanted to have a crease.  I was first just looking it up for fun to see if they made such a thing for myself and here it was!  I tried it and its very comfortable and uncomplicated.  If you are not sure like i was i think its best you give it a try first.  Def will be ordering more &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> I could never get it quite right - to apply the eyelid cutout to the correct place.  It is not for older folks who have flaccid eyelids and multiple skin folds.  I would suggest a product that has a little more width and the advantage of a gel to allow for repeated tries to get it right.  This product, once you&#x27;ve placed it, is tricky to get off and try another location.</li>
            <li> Okay i bought few this items .... they sometimes bothered my eyelids ..but it was so nice to look .</li>
            <li> Not that easy to wear, too thick</li>
            <li> It seems to work great for asian woman. Thought I would try it for saggy eye lids. Not so good for that..lol I looked very strange!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is very sticky and is very clear blends with skin very well. If you are asian and are using it for what it was made for im sure it will work great!</li>
            <li> Good as it always be~</li>
            <li> I love this eyelid tape. Actually I&#x27;m a beginner to make up stuff. I tried several kinds of eyelid tape, and this is the best. Easy to use and easy to get off using makeup remover. Maybe next time I&#x27;ll try the blue one to see whether it&#x27;s as good as this.</li>
            <li> It was fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;and it makes my eye bigger and&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t feel like i have it on when i put them on my eyes&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> I have monolids and have been considering the eyelid surgery for quite some time now. I am lucky to have round and big eyes just no extra lid. So before going through with the surgery I wanted to try these out to see if having the crease would make much of a difference. These were easy to use and I am considering not proceeding with the surgery, but instead using these moving forward. They give my eyes the natural crease look, they are sweatproof, and sleep proof too. I accidentally purchased the mild adhesive so will try the extra adhesive on my next order.</li>
            <li> my eye lids are pretty thick it don&#x27;t work for them, I will just need to have a lift surgery I think.</li>
            <li> Now I have uneven eyelids because my right is slightly bigger than my left and especially when get up in the morning ugh! its really annoying!  I have used another kind of tape which only stick on one side which totally didn&#x27;t work for me so this double sided works a lot better but feels a bit uncomfortable and kind of hard to it a hold of it because of its double sided tape.  but it does work when use correctly.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with juevenile macular degeneration at age 10 in my left eye, so that eye was getting a lot of exercise my whole life having to work to see, because I&#x27;m kind of blind in that eye, as a reslult my left eye lid is toned and does not sag at all. Well the other one was sagging so I was feeling pretty sad about it. I felt like in the future when it got really bad I would have to get surgery. When I got the tape, I followed the directions on a youtube video that my fiance found for me, and my eye matches the other one perfectly. Where you put the tape will depend on where your fold is on your eyelid. I thought that I would have to get surgery at some point, because with my eye problem I know it can only get worse. This works beautifully right now, and I got exquisite results. I can&#x27;t see the tape at all!! I took a picture, and my eye&#x27;s are identical on both sides!, where before they looked very uneven. I even zoomed into the picture to see if my eyes were matched. Perfect!! I&#x27;m really happy this product exists. I will feel more confident going out. I&#x27;m also getting married, and will feel much better about the photes taken. Yay!!!</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that this item is clear and transparent as it stated. But after purchase and trying it. The item in question was neither clear nor transparent. In fact, it had a very apparent shade of white which became more obvious as you put the actual item on your eyes. I am attempting a return and refund of my purchase for this reason.</li>
            <li> It works good for me but sometimes you will get tired .I&#x27;m using it everyday before I put eye make up but if you were in hurry , it wont look nice, so you need more time, but I stop using it anymore. I&#x27;ve using it for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> extremely difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This eyelid tape is the best I ever use so far. I have mono-lid eyes so I try a lot of eyelid tape and for now this is the best one. At first I couldn&#x27;t stick the tape right and my eyes always comes out in different shape but after I try it out like 5-6times I got use to how it work and my eyes came out beautifully. This tape feel so naturally when you put the tape on and after like 5minutes it doesn&#x27;t even feel you have something on your eyes and your eyes come out really naturally. This really good for Asian people eyes people who have mono-lids should try this!AWESOME PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I&#x27;m trying it now. If I remember to review in 3 months if this product  works or not I&#x27;ll leave a comment. I saw this from YouTube  channel  from Michelle  Phan. Works great so far :) I&#x27;m Asian and one of my eyelid is different from the other. So I gotta train my other eyelid to have the same crease :)</li>
            <li> Purchased this to fix one eyelid that became uneven (smaller) after swelling from medications. Was able to wear for a few hours for a couple days at a time for several weeks and my eyelid is mostly back to normal. Doesn&#x27;t work well on top of makeup, but you can apply makeup on top to help camouflage the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; fold.  Will likely purchase the stronger version next time. Great concept that I have used in the past with clumsy medical tape to address uneven eyelids due to swelling. It&#x27;s a wonder that this can work to actually change eyelid fold size/shape! I do think the paper covering the strip should be one piece instead of two - would make removing the tape with tweezers easier.The fork should also be wider for hybrid Asian or nonAsian eyes.</li>
            <li> The Tape is white in color not transparent as the discription said. It bends halfway so its not strong enough to put a fold on the eyelid. Very noticeable-disappointed with this product? Will buy other tape</li>
            <li> great product for temporary double eyelids.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE! Holds on so good. Ill have to try the large one (blue). This one fits ok with the size of my eyes but for now its my favorite. Hopefully the blue one will be perfect when i purchase it next :D</li>
            <li> Awesome product! The tape is transparent. It&#x27;s not white. The white thing is the tape that you can peel it off once you use it. It is like double sided tape. This really works well for me.</li>
            <li> Nice, I love it so so much. I got it in two days, which is faster than what I expect. very nice</li>
            <li> A little frustrating to apply at first. I&#x27;m pretty clumsy and impatient, so I ended up using my fingers instead of the applicator that is included in the package. It does the job, and had the best lasting power out of all the other tapes I used in the past. My eyelids get super oily, so tapes have the tendency to slide off overtime. Of course, the adhesive wont be able to hold out against water, especially warm water, so be weary of that if you&#x27;re thinking of wearing these to the pool. The only downside was that on my eyelids, the tape was noticeable had I not trimmed them down or wear dark eye shadow.</li>
            <li> it hella pulls the eye lid. used it once and my husband thought that i got my eye lid cute.ugly looking</li>
            <li> It works well for me. But just remember not to put foundation on your eyelids, since it won&#x27;t be as sticky.</li>
            <li> I like this since I do have lids but sometimes I&#x27;ll wake up and one lid would be have multiple creases so I put this on to even out my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would suggest is that it doesn&#x27;t stick all that great sometimes so I would buy the more stickier version of this unless you are wearing this daily, then go for something like this that won&#x27;t damage the sensitive skin around your eyes..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exactly know what this does but she hasnt told me anything so I guess she likes it? lol</li>
            <li> I hesitated on whether I should purchase this item due to the price. After 3 weeks of using this product, I am very satisfied and glad that I bought it. It really works and helped one of my eyelid become symmetric with the other. (side note: one of my eyelid was mono and the other was double so I used tape on the mono) I haven&#x27;t used tape for a month and my eyelid still remains double!</li>
            <li> I bought these after seeing an online tutorial from makeup blogger Michelle Phan. This type of tape is popular in East Asia, where some women prefer to create a double-eyelid. Phan says she wore the tape 22 hours for 3 months and now permanently changed her eyelids. I&#x27; doubt that it will do anything permanent on me, and I don&#x27;t want to wear the tape every day for 22 hours, but that&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one droopy eyelid (aka ptosis). I had it surgically corrected a few years ago, but the droopiness remains. It&#x27;s not all that noticeable, but I wanted to try the tape (though I was skeptical). The good news is that It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do. It really does stay and creates an evenness on my eyelids that I desired. It&#x27;s comfortable, unnoticeable, and easy enough to put on. I&#x27;d say that if you can put on gel or liquid eyeliner with some ease, you&#x27;ll definitely be able to put this tape on. It is easier to used Tweezers rather than the \\&quot;fork\\&quot; provided, but the fork is useful for getting an even application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the packaging is almost entirely in Japanese, I&#x27;d suggest looking up Phan&#x27;s tutorial for tips on how to put the tape on.</li>
            <li> It is the first time I tried using eyelid tape. I&#x27;m surprised it worked so well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have uneven eyelids and occasionally the uneven eye would correct itself. I was fed up with it being uneven most of the time so I decided to purchase this to even them out. I used this only once and my uneven eyelid corrected itself and it has been even for 2ish weeks. I don&#x27;t know how long it is going to last I&#x27;ll (possibly) update in a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was scared to use these at first because eyelid tape weakens the elasticity in you eye (thins and stretches out the skin), this will cause the opposite effect if you wear the tape too often. Meaning it can cause your lids to droop even more. So if you&#x27;re purchasing don&#x27;t leave the tape on for too long and be careful when removing it. I removed the tape with baby oil.</li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t terribly difficult to apply or take off, it does bother my eyes. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s the adhesive or the thickness/roughness of the actual strip, but when I use this, my eyes itch so badly. the strip is also quite noticeable when I do use it. It doesn&#x27;t have great lasting power either, and will start peeling from the edges of my eyes within a few hours--which doesnt help with the itchiness!</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all.  Applicator was stiff and hard to hold onto the thin eyelid strips.</li>
            <li> It works really well but makes my eyelids a little bit itchy at first. Anyways it works so I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am trying to even out my eyelids and this has working wonderfully! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or anything. Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have heavy upper eyelids. I am only 28 and I was looking to see if this would work to lift them a little. I had to use 2 to get it to lift where I wanted. Overall I think these work for what they are meant for, which is I think creating a \\&quot;lid\\&quot; on people of Asian decent.</li>
            <li> If you wants a dramatically larger/more visible eyelids, then a surgical eye lift is probably what you&#x27;ll need. But if you&#x27;re Asian or a white girl with Asian-looking eyes like me, and all you want is ANY eye lid showing, then this is a great product. People could never see the color of my eye shadow before, but with this product I can get enough of my lid showing that the color is clearly visible. (How much lid you can get to show will depend on how much lid skin you actually have and the different ways you apply the product.) The product quality itself is great! The tape is not visible if applied correctly, and it sticks like nobody&#x27;s business, whether you have makeup on your eyes or not. I even took a HOT shower with the tape on and washed my face; it&#x27;s now an hour later, and it shows no signs of peeling--though, to be fair, I didn&#x27;t exactly scrub my eyelids. Even so, I was positive the water alone would cause the tape to peel off, but it didn&#x27;t. It does get a little itchy sometimes, but when is beauty ever comfortable? The occasional itch definitely isn&#x27;t bothersome enough to stop using. Most of the time I don&#x27;t even remember it&#x27;s there. I did hope for a slightly more dramatic lift, but I&#x27;ve only used them a handful of times since receiving them, so I still have a lot of experimenting to do. All in all, this product is worth trying if your eyelids have failed you in some way ;)</li>
            <li> does not work at all!</li>
            <li> These were okay, but I still like the Eye Charm tapes better.  The Eye Charm tapes are easier to use and look more natural.  I buy the slim.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used something like this. It takes a bit of practice but it works pretty well. After one day after I took it off it stayed at the crease. I heard your suppose to wear it for 22 hours a day for 3 months for the effects to be permanent . So if that&#x27;s true then its a good alternative to surgery.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of turning my eyelid into double eyelid. I use this product every night during my whole sleep. And now I succeed being double eyelid. Love it so much !</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I already have lids, but when I open my eyes, they disappear a bit. I got this eyelid tape because 1) Michelle Phan recommended it and 2) I wanted to change my eyelid shape to where you can see the lids when my eyes are open. It takes a little practice getting them in the right spot to achieve the shape you want, but it does work. Sometimes the tape doesn&#x27;t stay sticky and hold the eye lid skin and then you end up seeing the tape, but that&#x27;s only sometimes when I don&#x27;t put it on right or put too much eyeshadow on over it. It hasn&#x27;t changed my eyelid shape yet, but I&#x27;m hoping it will! I&#x27;ll see what happens by the time I run out of this first pack.</li>
            <li> Looks really good, not easy using those. Cannot successfully produce double eye lid on my face.</li>
            <li> not perfect but I am still using it. For example it still hurts my eyelid sometimes and can&#x27;t stay all day. But overall it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m two weeks in so far wearing them 24-7. I have one eyelid that has increasingly drooped over the years and was worried I&#x27;d need surgery. After discovering the eyelid tape online, I was immediately cured.  Easy application and removal with eye makeup remover. It takes a few tries to get the feel of the delicate. I wear makeup and work out with the tape on. The double sided tape holds up for a good 12-20 hrs. It&#x27;s best using one in the am and right before bed. But if your not wearing make up most times it can last 24hrs aCrossing my fingers this turns out to be a perminant fix over the next couple months. If not, i will continue to use them anyway to avoid the scalpel.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stick. Tried multiple times. Will buy the medical grade, double sided tape next time.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply(after you watch the tutorial video on Youtube), and even though this one says mild, but it still works very well.</li>
            <li> The only useful double eye tape on the market. I have tried many different types but this one works the best! You need to apply it before any powder eyeshadows. It takes few try to get the hang of it but as to the strength this is the only brand works.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know  how to even use it, non of the directions were in English...need English with these products very disappointed,</li>
            <li> I think this brand is better than most as this doesn&#x27;t have those weird cross-lines on the tape. It sticks on my lids for quite some time after putting it on. The hard part is just getting the tape stick onto the applicator. Maybe the &amp;#34;Extra&amp;#34; will be better instead of the &amp;#34;Mild&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product really works it&#x27;s amazing and easy to use</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just psychological, but, having tried both versions, I think the extra one holds the double eyelid better--it&#x27;s definitely more pronounced. Whether that translates into being able to use each one longer is probably a different story. (They both last around 2/3 of the day from my experience.)</li>
            <li> my first time to try this, so not quite sure it&#x27;s my problem or not, it&#x27;s not very easy to apply on, but once it&#x27;s done right, can be looked like real</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product except for the fact that the MILD version was actually more irritating than the regular; very itchy  Both my daughter and I use these on a regular basis, they work well, and are easy to use.  Some people have said that it took them many tries to perfect, but I found this NOT to be true.  Actually very easy; I probably wasted about two in all.</li>
            <li> Had single eyelids, but after using this for a while, my eyelids became double. Doesn&#x27;t impact your look a whole lot, but product works as intended. Sometimes the side of the tape may not stick well enough and may pierce out, but it&#x27;s not too much of a burden</li>
            <li> At my age, the space on my double eyelid has gotten smaller through the years.  I&#x27;ve thought of eyelid lift surgery but it&#x27;s pricy and I don&#x27;t want to go through the weeks of healing.  I began my research on youtube to see how people have produced double eyelids or lifted lids, and what they used.  This double-sided one seemed ideal for starters, it came with 60 pairs and the price was very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a V shaped prong which is used to press in the lid to get the new crease as well as to hold onto the tape, but I couldn&#x27;t get the tape on correctly using it.  So I used my tweezers instead and only used the prongs to find where I wanted my new crease to be.  This double sided tape is very soft and flexible, it tends to set down on the lid at the opposite end of the tweezer held end so you have to be precise about placement OR you&#x27;ll have to lift the end to re-apply in the correct area which can be tricky.  Since my lids have more skin from aging, I place the tape right on my crease which means my lid space is increased by just a fraction of an inch.  But it does make a difference.  It makes me look more awake and fresh.  With my eyes closed, you CAN see a line where the tape has \\&quot;glued\\&quot; the lid skin together.  It looks a bit weird but will only be noticed if a person is close to you when your eyes are closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make up application has not been easy wearing these so I&#x27;m still figuring that out.  I&#x27;m just applying light shadow on my lid, dark eyeshadow in the outer corners and the cat eye liner which works for now.  To remove these, I use Almay moisturizing eye makeup remover which is basically mineral oil.  Oil will easily get these off without having to pull at your lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On me, these last all day until I remove them before I shower, so about 12-15 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited on June 2, 2014:  I&#x27;ve noticed that if I wear these pretty much daily, after about the 4-5 week my new lid crease will stay for about a week.</li>
            <li> Been wearing these about a year &amp; am waiting to get the face &amp; eye lift Spring 2013...am 57 y.o.  I&#x27;m happy w/these til I can get the lids lifted.  These have helped w/the loose skin folds on my upper eyelids.  Don&#x27;t use a cream or eye shadow on your lids b/4 or these won&#x27;t stick.  I&#x27;ve found if I don&#x27;t place one just right i can add another...then use a mineral blusher on the lids, applying w/a small brush &amp; \\&quot;dabbing\\&quot; my eyelids AFTER placing these on.  Then I apply white or lighter color eye shadow just under the browline &amp; that seems to make the eye lid appear more open.  These are great for women my age and I&#x27;ll continue wearing them until I don&#x27;t need to any lonoger.  (Even my Botox Dr. hadn&#x27;t noticed them til my last injections-pointed them out to him...said he&#x27;d never noticed them b/4).</li>
            <li> Great product for anyone with mono or hooded lids!  The product comes without any English instructions, but the tape is really easy to place and use.  I am so glad to have found this!  For hooded lids, I would recommend putting eye makeup on first and placing the tape last.  I tried putting this tape on first and as soon as I put my eyeshadow primer on, it was gumming up the tape.  But that isn&#x27;t a criticism of the product.  Love this!</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 because it&#x27;s not what I personally expected in terms of this product achieving what I wanted. But delivery was on time and great. :)</li>
            <li> All my life I had to live with a slight irregularity in my eyelids, one was thicker than the other, and I had to adjust my makeup accordingly so that they look even. I got to the point where I was seriously considering surgery. One day I saw a youtube video on how one girl corrected her irregularity with D.U.P eyelid tape, she wore them for three months straight, 22 hours a day. The first thing I did was order the tape. I have been wearing it for a week now, about 20 hours a day, and I have to say I am soooo impressed! I&#x27;m already noticing a difference without the tape. As far as the visibility, I wear dark ripped eyeglasses and no one has noticed that I have the tape on. I am so thankful that I didn&#x27;t have to take more extreme measures to correct this problem. I highly recommend eyelid tape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s double sided and really subtle. Love it and will keep getting it. Very long lasting as well. I can even wear it to bed and the next day the fold will be there without the tape.</li>
            <li> I just received my package two days ago and just started trying out the double eyelid tape.  It works GREAT!  Stays on all day and you can barely notice it.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used eyelid tape and it&#x27;s simple and easy to apply on your eyelids.  You just kinda got to figure out where you want the crease in your eye but you can use that eye stick thingy to test it out first. I LOVE IT and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a few months before I wrote this review...This product is great for people who want double eyelids or want to correct their eye crease. This is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered this product and I&#x27;ve already been seeing some great results:) You can&#x27;t wear this in public because it IS noticeable but I like to wear this at home and to sleep. If you do need to go outside with it, wear some dark sunglasses (it&#x27;s summer so nobody will care). Also, to apply it, I found tweezers easier to use than the applicator they provide. In the beginning, you might find it hard to put on, but after the fifth time, you get the hang of it. Also, I can say that this product is definitely better than eye glue....</li>
            <li> after applying on my eyelid, the plastics won&#x27;t be seen! It&#x27;s so great cause no one can tell you&#x27;re wearing a eyelid lift. Of course your friends can tell cause they make your eyes look much bigger!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping Good quality</li>
            <li> great product. i had started out with buying the extra strength version, which stayed on all day, which is wonderful. after several days of using though, my eyelid got irritated and actually started to peel where the tape had been. fast forward to purchasing this product...GREAT product again. difference is that it stays on between 6-8 hours (and i have oily eyelids, so i&#x27;m sure it would stay on longer for people who do not) a day and is much less aggressive on the skin when taken off. i did have a little bit of irritation where the tape had been after using a few days in a row but not nearly as much as when i used the extra strength, and the irritation went away after a day of non-use.</li>
            <li> It sticks pretty well if you know how to apply it (if you don&#x27;t know, just look up a video on YouTube and look through the pictures in the booklet that comes with it), however when I first used it, one of the corners of the eyelid tape kept pricking me, but then I realized I just had to cut some of the corner that would prick me with a scissor and it was fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye lid tapes and the one has got to be the best eyelid tape I&#x27;ve tried. It sticks on for the whole day!! Plus it doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes at all like other tapes do. Double eyelid tapes are always stronger and this one works wonders.</li>
            <li> This product was worth trying but it did not work for me. I just could not get the tape where I wanted it and it was not long enough atleast that&#x27;s what I think. And if you like it I recommend you put on your make up first and then the eye lid tape because if you do it afterwards the tape shows. When I did get it right it did look nice though.</li>
            <li> I just bought this tape and loving it! one of my eyelid is smaller than the other. You can feel the tape when you&#x27;re wearing it but its not any discomfort kind of feel. the tape is transparent and not really noticeable, the only part that i can see is the very end tips of the tape probably because of the way I taped it on. (still practicing) I suggest not wearing eyeshadow because the take will end up showing as well as not sticking, however you can still wear eyeliner and mascera! easier to apply with fine tweezers then using the eyelid fork thingy to put it in place.</li>
            <li> great product, the only thing you can&#x27;t put make up on top of it as it will unstick. Overall lasts during the whole day, no problems at all. I have used it for over a year now and keep on ordering more.</li>
            <li> ehh. It doesn&#x27;t fit my eyes, or maybe my eyelids are just too heavy for them. either way, they don&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Had to try it a couple days before getting to know where to put it to get it right.  It helps. Also, have to trim off the sharp ends otherwise it hurts a little bit from time to time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soft and messy for the precision placing.  I would not recommand it to any of my friends ever.</li>
            <li> the tape sticks to my lid pretty well, but the sticky parts will stay on my lid when I take the tape off. but overall, it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> Terrible! Doesn&#x27;t stay on, and you can just see white line. Also, when you put makeup on, it doesn&#x27;t go on. And doesn&#x27;t do the work. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed I was really excited for this product.......</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Although a little bit expensive......&lt;br /&gt;Really easy to put on and comfortable to wear&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will purchase again and recommend to another friend!!</li>
