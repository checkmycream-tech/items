            <li>I got this free or at a discounted price for my honest feedback</li>
            <li>My latest order will accompany me on my motorcycle touring trip while camping.</li>
            <li>and I love using konjac sponges</li>
            <li>Also, on top of all these great qualities these particular sponges come in an adorable heart shaped gift box.</li>
            <li>I used the heart one to wash my face and it felt sooooo nice, cool, and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about this product is not only is it easy to use</li>
            <li>Strange and wonderful sponge!</li>
            <li>This would be a great gift for a new mom and baby.</li>
            <li>She loved them and spent more time than I have ever seen her cleaning her face because she said it felt so good before and after.</li>
            <li>This sponges work very nicely for the face and those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>are chemical free and nontoxic.&lt;br /&gt;Includes one heart shaped sponge and two oval ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free or at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Chemical Free - NO Phthalates, Sulfates, Parabens &amp; Petroleum&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that they are easy to hold, but nothing special about them.  </li>
            <li>I am older but that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t want my skin to look the best it can, so trying this product was going to be very enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;- Environmentally Friendly and 100% Organic&lt;</li>
            <li>I originally bought them for myself, to replace my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super cute in the packaging and this company (pegasus guild) seem really responsive because they always contact you to make sure you received your sponges and that you are satisfied which is always appreciated.</li>
            <li>You can clean them easily.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I think perhaps she was not taking the time to clean it well until she used this product</li>
            <li>I use them with creamy cleanser, and my skin feels really clean yet pampered afterward.</li>
            <li>These were super soft and baby actually enjoyed her bath!</li>
            <li>First let me say they come in a heart shaped box, wrapped nicely and ready to go.</li>
            <li>They are nice and soft and my baby likes taking a bath with it</li>
            <li>and she wants to wash her face more often  </li>
            <li>and I appreciate the quick customer service.</li>
            <li>it really wasn&#x27;t necessary, but I greatly appreciate it nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s natural too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve taken to using it on my neck and chest to remove sunblock, and it works great without making a drippy mess.</li>
            <li>These sponges are soft and safe to use on my skin.</li>
            <li>I did not think they were worth the money at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft and lovely, plus affordable.</li>
            <li>After a short soak in warm water, they soften.</li>
            <li>A very good price too for 3 sponges that will probably last way longer than those scratchy puffs that loose shape in 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The string used to hold to your hand pulled out of one, and then the whole sponge quickly fell apart after that.  </li>
            <li>It is just very gentle- which my skin needs.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more of these in the future.  </li>
            <li>Soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>VERY ICE PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>- otherwise you&#x27;ll rip them like I did with the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this product and the value you get for such a cute gift pack</li>
            <li>By comparison to a cellulose sponge my Konjac sponge has smaller holes and feels softer and more</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>(This is why I asked my somewhat amusing question about edibility referenced in my other</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Such a nice soft product.</li>
            <li>Pretty much anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>soak the sponge in lukewarm water for a 1-2 minutes and now you have super soft sponges to use on your skin for facials, cleansing, anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(those organic/natural baby sun blocks are not that easy to remove) - and you only need the tiniest amount of face wash, as the sponge helps to foam it up beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For example my face tends to have certain areas of sensitivity</li>
            <li>They did not cause any irritation on my skin and were very gently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These sponges are so gentle they could be used on babies.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s too gentle for my face.</li>
            <li>Three little spongesin a heart-shaped box, makes a nice gift for a baby or for someone older who likes to baby their face.  </li>
            <li>They dry easily, they are soft and just the right size.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and very gentle on my baby and older children.</li>
            <li>These particular ones for babies/sensitive skin are a bath item I do not want to be without.  </li>
            <li>Carefully Handmade from 100% Natural Plant Ingredients - 100% Safe for Babies</li>
            <li>The one heart-shaped and two oblong sponges were individually shrink-wrapped and packed in an adorable white cardboard heart box.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They take a long time to totally dry out after use, and it is nice that they come with a loop string.</li>
            <li>They become creamy soft and they feel very pleasurable to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I really did not think this was going to happen, it was like my skin came alive again and at my age</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve really gone far and beyond -</li>
            <li>The box has a ribbon and a cute heavy card stock gift tag.</li>
            <li>I use them with normal baby wash even though the sponge instructions say you don&#x27;t need to use cleanser/soap.</li>
            <li>Ok so as I started this slide show I have been using this everyday and since it comes with three</li>
            <li>Very soft on baby skin.</li>
            <li>It gently cleanses my face and the general appearance of my skin is brighter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One very important note: they are delicate and you can&#x27;t squeeze them - for both foaming and rinsing, press between your palms</li>
            <li>When you are done using it, press out the excess water and hang it by its little embedded chord to dry.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging states the sponges are completely additive free and made from Konjac, specifically amorphophallus konjac, a plant grown on pristine natural mountain slopes at altitudes of 2500 to 4500 feet.  </li>
            <li>I am truly amazed because I have highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So soft and soothing.  </li>
            <li>These sponges are for baby&#x27;s or people with sensitive skin, they are supposed to be made from 100% natural plant ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So soft on my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>So I thought I&#x27;d try it on my 3 yr old, to help remove his zinc-based sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My three year old loves it</li>
            <li>I love that these sponges have a little string attached so you can hang them up to dry.</li>
            <li>Had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER sensitive skin so exfoliators are too harsh for me.</li>
            <li>The white ones are the only ones I am going to use because I prefer them to be free of any additives due to my skin sensitivities.  </li>
            <li>I have used one for over 2 weeks and by following the care instructions it still looks brand new.  </li>
            <li>Gentle Enough for Daily Use</li>
            <li>I know we all tend to think that supposedly biodegradable items break down in our landfills and so are not harmful to the environment, but in an anaerobic (without oxygen) environment, many &amp;#34;biodegradable&amp;#34; things don&#x27;t break down at all.</li>
            <li>Better than expected and better than others on the market - got 3 pack for same price as one from other sellers, plus these are a little thicker than others I&#x27;ve purchased previously.</li>
            <li>the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and other land- and water-choking garbage dumps keep expanding and hurting wildlife, even the idea of using disposable cleansing cloths makes me feel guilty.</li>
            <li>Once you open and wet them they puff up into very soft and gentle sponges that you can use over and over.  </li>
            <li>Using only pressure I can decide how much or how little to exfoliate certain areas of my body.</li>
            <li>A soft washcloth would do the same job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 40s and in the past year or so, I seem to be more sensitive and can&#x27;t handle my usual exfoliation (physical &amp; chemical), so I thought I&#x27;d try a gentler method of exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very soft when wet.</li>
            <li>its a little embarrassing at how much dirt was on my face.  </li>

            <li> These sponges are so gentle they could be used on babies.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s too gentle for my face.</li>
            <li> Three little spongesin a heart-shaped box, makes a nice gift for a baby or for someone older who likes to baby their face.  </li>
            <li> They dry easily, they are soft and just the right size.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and very gentle on my baby and older children.</li>
            <li> These particular ones for babies/sensitive skin are a bath item I do not want to be without.  </li>
            <li> Carefully Handmade from 100% Natural Plant Ingredients - 100% Safe for Babies</li>
            <li> The one heart-shaped and two oblong sponges were individually shrink-wrapped and packed in an adorable white cardboard heart box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They take a long time to totally dry out after use, and it is nice that they come with a loop string.</li>
            <li> They become creamy soft and they feel very pleasurable to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I really did not think this was going to happen, it was like my skin came alive again and at my age</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve really gone far and beyond -</li>
            <li> The box has a ribbon and a cute heavy card stock gift tag.</li>
            <li> I use them with normal baby wash even though the sponge instructions say you don&#x27;t need to use cleanser/soap.</li>
            <li> Ok so as I started this slide show I have been using this everyday and since it comes with three</li>
            <li> Very soft on baby skin.</li>
            <li> It gently cleanses my face and the general appearance of my skin is brighter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One very important note: they are delicate and you can&#x27;t squeeze them - for both foaming and rinsing, press between your palms</li>
            <li> When you are done using it, press out the excess water and hang it by its little embedded chord to dry.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging states the sponges are completely additive free and made from Konjac, specifically amorphophallus konjac, a plant grown on pristine natural mountain slopes at altitudes of 2500 to 4500 feet.  </li>
            <li> I am truly amazed because I have highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So soft and soothing.  </li>
            <li> These sponges are for baby&#x27;s or people with sensitive skin, they are supposed to be made from 100% natural plant ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So soft on my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> So I thought I&#x27;d try it on my 3 yr old, to help remove his zinc-based sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My three year old loves it</li>
            <li> I love that these sponges have a little string attached so you can hang them up to dry.</li>
            <li> Had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER sensitive skin so exfoliators are too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> The white ones are the only ones I am going to use because I prefer them to be free of any additives due to my skin sensitivities.  </li>
            <li> I have used one for over 2 weeks and by following the care instructions it still looks brand new.  </li>
            <li> Gentle Enough for Daily Use</li>
            <li> I know we all tend to think that supposedly biodegradable items break down in our landfills and so are not harmful to the environment, but in an anaerobic (without oxygen) environment, many &amp;#34;biodegradable&amp;#34; things don&#x27;t break down at all.</li>
            <li> Better than expected and better than others on the market - got 3 pack for same price as one from other sellers, plus these are a little thicker than others I&#x27;ve purchased previously.</li>
            <li> the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and other land- and water-choking garbage dumps keep expanding and hurting wildlife, even the idea of using disposable cleansing cloths makes me feel guilty.</li>
            <li> Once you open and wet them they puff up into very soft and gentle sponges that you can use over and over.  </li>
            <li> Using only pressure I can decide how much or how little to exfoliate certain areas of my body.</li>
            <li> A soft washcloth would do the same job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40s and in the past year or so, I seem to be more sensitive and can&#x27;t handle my usual exfoliation (physical &amp; chemical), so I thought I&#x27;d try a gentler method of exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very soft when wet.</li>
            <li> its a little embarrassing at how much dirt was on my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than what I expected, but overall good price for 3 small sponges since I usually spend $10 buying just one for me</li>
            <li> These will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Konjac is actually the plant Amorphophallus konjac, from which Shiritaki noodles are made, and its root (technically a corm) is widely eaten in China and Japan.</li>
            <li> I gave one to my 3 year old little girl to use.  </li>
            <li> I searched for a long time to find a replacement for the scratchy puffs I had been using for years.  </li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:5475a3f926200c28be4af4725637de1b]]When I first opened the package these spongers were as hard as little rocks and smaller than I imagined.  </li>
            <li> I use Retin A on my skin and it is very dry when I am using it heavily, and these are amazingly soft yet exfoliant to get that flaky skin off of my face.  </li>
            <li> Inside your heart shaped box, similar to valentines day candy boxes, you find 3 individually wrapped little sponges.  </li>
            <li> Other than that they work well and hold the soap for the entire bath.</li>
            <li> Oily in the t-zone and dry everywhere else.</li>
            <li> Plus, it never dries out, and you can&#x27;t rinse it well to make it dry.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.  </li>
            <li> They just make a big mess.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used them yet because my baby hasn&#x27;t arrived yet, but I will update you once I actuall do use it on my little one.</li>
            <li> As I said I followed the directions carefully and it has been over a week now of using the product and to my surprise</li>
            <li> Once they got wet they expanded to 4\\&quot; by 3\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It is hard and small when dry, but after putting it in the bath water it is soft and slightly bigger within 40 seconds.  </li>
            <li> am reassured, therefore, to know that these sponges not only can be composted after they&#x27;ve outlived their 2- to 3-month period of average usefulness, they can also be broken into pieces and put directly into planters and container gardens (even vegetables grown to eat) without harm.</li>
            <li> come with instructions included in the package which itself is extremely cute.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, there are 3 rock-hard sponges in the box, but once you soak in water, the sponges soften and expand.  </li>
            <li> Granddaughter used the other box while I watched.</li>
            <li> Still not sure about facial use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are other brands/companies out there</li>
            <li> It seems like a nice product, good size when wet, but unfortunately  had an awful weird smell.</li>
            <li> so I apply less pressure on those areas.</li>
            <li> (the heart shaped one is a little smaller).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just waste you time or money.</li>
            <li> I am crazy about buying everything natural and organic for my baby.</li>
            <li> Too hard.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by these sponges.  </li>
            <li> Not great at all!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These sponges are soft and safe to use on my skin. I am truly amazed because I have highly sensitive skin. They did not cause any irritation on my skin and were very gently.&lt;br /&gt;They can be used on adults and babies. Pretty much anyone.&lt;br /&gt;They come with instructions included in the package which itself is extremely cute.&lt;br /&gt;Just soak the sponge in lukewarm water for a 1-2 minutes and now you have super soft sponges to use on your skin for facials, cleansing, anything.&lt;br /&gt;The pack includes three sponges. These will last you a long time. You can clean them easily.&lt;br /&gt;They are chemical free and nontoxic.&lt;br /&gt;Includes one heart shaped sponge and two oval ones.&lt;br /&gt;I received these in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and evaluation.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by these sponges.  It&#x27;s true that they are easy to hold, but nothing special about them.  The string used to hold to your hand pulled out of one, and then the whole sponge quickly fell apart after that.  A soft washcloth would do the same job.  Especially considering these only last 2-3 months I did not think they were worth the money at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE APRIL 4: Pegasus customer service noted my unsatisfactory review and responded immediately.  They offered to replace or refund the sponges.  It was very easy to work with their company and I appreciate the quick customer service.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges.  I hope I can always get these from Amazon.  I searched for a long time to find a replacement for the scratchy puffs I had been using for years.  I knew there had to be something better.  The konjac sponges are amazing!  These particular ones for babies/sensitive skin are a bath item I do not want to be without.  So soft and soothing.  My skin feels clean and soft.  I have used one for over 2 weeks and by following the care instructions it still looks brand new.  It is hard and small when dry, but after putting it in the bath water it is soft and slightly bigger within 40 seconds.  I am not a baby, but I will definitely keep using these.  A very good price too for 3 sponges that will probably last way longer than those scratchy puffs that loose shape in 2 weeks.  I will purchase more of these in the future.  The white ones are the only ones I am going to use because I prefer them to be free of any additives due to my skin sensitivities.  I use them with 2 pumps of Dove body wash.</li>
            <li> These sponges are for baby&#x27;s or people with sensitive skin, they are supposed to be made from 100% natural plant ingredients.  They arrive in beautiful packaging that would be perfect for gift giving.  Inside your heart shaped box, similar to valentines day candy boxes, you find 3 individually wrapped little sponges.  Once you open and wet them they puff up into very soft and gentle sponges that you can use over and over.  They dry easily, they are soft and just the right size.  This would be a great gift for a new mom and baby.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. They are nice and soft and my baby likes taking a bath with it</li>
            <li> Strange and wonderful sponge! It gently cleanses my face and the general appearance of my skin is brighter. I&#x27;ve never seen anything else in the world with a texture like this sponge. They come in a decorative heart, a great gift for the girly girls, but the product is good for the guys too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Like it a lot. Soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> very soft when wet. very nice.</li>
            <li> Soft and lovely, plus affordable.</li>
            <li> The Beauty Shelf sent me this 3-pack as well as the 3-pack with three heart-shaped sponges in return for my honest review. Instead of gushing here over what I said when I reviewed the hearts-only 3-pack, I&#x27;m going to list here what I forgot to add to that review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DP1V5KYMHTX6/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and other land- and water-choking garbage dumps keep expanding and hurting wildlife, even the idea of using disposable cleansing cloths makes me feel guilty. I know we all tend to think that supposedly biodegradable items break down in our landfills and so are not harmful to the environment, but in an anaerobic (without oxygen) environment, many &amp;#34;biodegradable&amp;#34; things don&#x27;t break down at all. They just make a big mess. So I&#x27;ve been trying to &amp;#34;pre-cycle&amp;#34; by not bringing things into my house that I have to throw away to begin with. (This is why I asked my somewhat amusing question about edibility referenced in my other review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am reassured, therefore, to know that these sponges not only can be composted after they&#x27;ve outlived their 2- to 3-month period of average usefulness, they can also be broken into pieces and put directly into planters and container gardens (even vegetables grown to eat) without harm. In fact, Beth at The Beauty Shelf told me when I asked that the sponges help hold water in the soil. Konjac is actually the plant Amorphophallus konjac, from which Shiritaki noodles are made, and its root (technically a corm) is widely eaten in China and Japan. Go look it up and see what it looks like. It&#x27;s a very interesting plant.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:2c19aa45407fee485a28d677fbc57743]] These are wonderful sponges. I used them on my face and my body. I do not have sensitive skin I have combination. Oily in the t-zone and dry everywhere else. I found these konjac sponges to be very good for my skin type. Using only pressure I can decide how much or how little to exfoliate certain areas of my body. For example my face tends to have certain areas of sensitivity so I apply less pressure on those areas. I am still exfoliating. It is just very gentle- which my skin needs. Then I use more pressure when I want to do my legs and arms I need a really good exfoliation. I am very happy with this product and will continue to use these sponges in my regular skin care routine. Also, on top of all these great qualities these particular sponges come in an adorable heart shaped gift box. The box has a ribbon and a cute heavy card stock gift tag. Adorable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free or at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Just received these and started using them for baby&#x27;s bath time. So far they&#x27;re great! I use them with normal baby wash even though the sponge instructions say you don&#x27;t need to use cleanser/soap. Gets a nice lather. Very soft on baby skin. Easier for me to hold than a wash cloth. Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges!!!! So soft on my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges. A great size  and good price.</li>
            <li> This sponges work very nicely for the face and those with sensitive skin. I always have extras on hand for company.</li>
            <li> VERY ICE PRODUCT!  Three little spongesin a heart-shaped box, makes a nice gift for a baby or for someone older who likes to baby their face.  As other reviewers have stated, there are 3 rock-hard sponges in the box, but once you soak in water, the sponges soften and expand.  They become creamy soft and they feel very pleasurable to the skin.  I used the heart one to wash my face and it felt sooooo nice, cool, and refreshing.  When you are done using it, press out the excess water and hang it by its little embedded chord to dry.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging states the sponges are completely additive free and made from Konjac, specifically amorphophallus konjac, a plant grown on pristine natural mountain slopes at altitudes of 2500 to 4500 feet.  It also states it is biodegradable and organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s front page states: Carefully Handmade from 100% Natural Plant Ingredients - 100% Safe for Babies&lt;br /&gt;- Chemical Free - NO Phthalates, Sulfates, Parabens &amp; Petroleum&lt;br /&gt;- Environmentally Friendly and 100% Organic&lt;br /&gt;- Gentle Enough for Daily Use&lt;br /&gt;- Hypoallergenic</li>
            <li> These were super soft and baby actually enjoyed her bath!</li>
            <li> Perfect product.  Well priced and speedy delivery</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to receive this product for a honest review. I am older but that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t want my skin to look the best it can, so trying this product was going to be very enjoyable.  First let me say they come in a heart shaped box, wrapped nicely and ready to go. Instructions are included or you can go on this website and read up on the sponges.  As I said I followed the directions carefully and it has been over a week now of using the product and to my surprise my skin looks so much better. I really did not think this was going to happen, it was like my skin came alive again and at my age that&#x27;s almost a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Granddaughter used the other box while I watched. She is a teenager so has some outbreak problems from time to time. She loved them and spent more time than I have ever seen her cleaning her face because she said it felt so good before and after. And the wonderful thing is that she saw results in her skin. I think perhaps she was not taking the time to clean it well until she used this product and it made all the difference.  This is a very nice product that just makes you feel good about yourself, and who doesn&#x27;t like to feel that.  I&#x27;m happy to recommend this product to you. I think you will love it. A great plus for the whole household.</li>
            <li> I like this product. They are soft and very gentle on my baby and older children. They are about the size of my palm and sometimes slip out of my hand. Other than that they work well and hold the soap for the entire bath. The kids like to play with them.</li>
            <li> Better than expected and better than others on the market - got 3 pack for same price as one from other sellers, plus these are a little thicker than others I&#x27;ve purchased previously.</li>
            <li> I had no intention of buying these, was not looking for these, and almost did not buy these.  They popped up as a suggestion when I was buying my face cleanser.  I splurged and tried them and I absolutely love these.  I use Retin A on my skin and it is very dry when I am using it heavily, and these are amazingly soft yet exfoliant to get that flaky skin off of my face.  Very, very nice.</li>
            <li> Such a nice soft product. Love that it&#x27;s natural too!</li>
            <li> The one heart-shaped and two oblong sponges were individually shrink-wrapped and packed in an adorable white cardboard heart box. After a short soak in warm water, they soften. I have SUPER sensitive skin so exfoliators are too harsh for me. These sponges are so gentle they could be used on babies. I use them with creamy cleanser, and my skin feels really clean yet pampered afterward.</li>
            <li> Not great at all!  Just waste you time or money.</li>
            <li> Too hard.  Would not recommend these at all.</li>
            <li> These Konjac sponges are designed for babies but they are so cute and perfect for face cleansing. I use the heart shaped one once a day when I&#x27;m in the shower. It is simple to rehydrate the sponge and then use it with some organic skin cleanser. I love that these sponges have a little string attached so you can hang them up to dry. Each package contains two oval sponges and one heart-shaped sponge. Since there are three sponges, mom can have one and baby can have two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one box of sponges for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I originally bought them for myself, to replace my Clarisonic. I&#x27;m in my early 40s and in the past year or so, I seem to be more sensitive and can&#x27;t handle my usual exfoliation (physical &amp; chemical), so I thought I&#x27;d try a gentler method of exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the sponge every night and I think it&#x27;s too gentle for my face. So I thought I&#x27;d try it on my 3 yr old, to help remove his zinc-based sunscreen. The heart-shape is perfect for going around his eyes and nose! Unlike with wash cloths, he dosn&#x27;t complain when I take my time (those organic/natural baby sun blocks are not that easy to remove) - and you only need the tiniest amount of face wash, as the sponge helps to foam it up beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken to using it on my neck and chest to remove sunblock, and it works great without making a drippy mess. Still not sure about facial use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One very important note: they are delicate and you can&#x27;t squeeze them - for both foaming and rinsing, press between your palms - otherwise you&#x27;ll rip them like I did with the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other brands/companies out there but I will continue to purchase from The Beauty Shelf because they have EXCELLENT customer service. Thank you, Beth!  You&#x27;ve really gone far and beyond - it really wasn&#x27;t necessary, but I greatly appreciate it nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I am crazy about buying everything natural and organic for my baby. Had such high hopes for this product. It seems like a nice product, good size when wet, but unfortunately  had an awful weird smell. Plus, it never dries out, and you can&#x27;t rinse it well to make it dry. Had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:498d2b6511d0d9b7efe0e89890a6c38a]] Ok so as I started this slide show I have been using this everyday and since it comes with three I gave one to my 3 year old little girl to use.  The best thing about this product is not only is it easy to use but it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.  My three year old loves it and she wants to wash her face more often  I recommend this product and the value you get for such a cute gift pack is amazing.  Check out my slide show.. its a little embarrassing at how much dirt was on my face.  I got this free or at a discounted price for my honest feedback</li>
            <li> I love these sponges! My latest order will accompany me on my motorcycle touring trip while camping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smaller than what I expected, but overall good price for 3 small sponges since I usually spend $10 buying just one for me and I love using konjac sponges so I got these for my baby. They&#x27;re super cute in the packaging and this company (pegasus guild) seem really responsive because they always contact you to make sure you received your sponges and that you are satisfied which is always appreciated. I haven&#x27;t actually used them yet because my baby hasn&#x27;t arrived yet, but I will update you once I actuall do use it on my little one.</li>
            <li> Awesome, so gentle!!!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:5475a3f926200c28be4af4725637de1b]]When I first opened the package these spongers were as hard as little rocks and smaller than I imagined.  Once they got wet they expanded to 4\\&quot; by 3\\&quot; (the heart shaped one is a little smaller).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges I use on regular basis are made from cellulose (i.e. wood pulp). Konjac sponge is made from the root of the Konjac plant (which is a potato-like plant). By comparison to a cellulose sponge my Konjac sponge has smaller holes and feels softer and more resilient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They take a long time to totally dry out after use, and it is nice that they come with a loop string. I have vaccum hooks in my shower on which I hang to them to aid drying.  I like using them with a bit of soap and foam well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second set of Konjac sponged, using them daily I get about 3 months of use out of each sponge before it starts falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These spongers come in an attractive box and will make a nice looking present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are provided by The Beauty Shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> Love the sponges! Easy to use. Great results! Thanks!</li>
