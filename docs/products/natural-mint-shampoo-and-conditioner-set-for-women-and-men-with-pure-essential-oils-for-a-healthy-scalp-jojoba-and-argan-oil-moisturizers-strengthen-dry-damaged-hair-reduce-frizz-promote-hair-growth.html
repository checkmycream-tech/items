            <li>The good thing is that it cleans</li>
            <li>i never knew shampoo could be this good.</li>
            <li>It leaves a good feeling after drying my hair.</li>
            <li>Me and my daughters all use this and like the smell of both the shampoo and the conditioner and feel they both are good products at a good price.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, it ensures your hair smells really good for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loved it! :)</li>
            <li>It lathers rich and the conditioner is great!</li>
            <li>shampoo and am very happy to say &amp;#34;Wow was I wrong!&amp;#34; The first thing I loved was the scent of both the shampoo and the conditioner - amazing!</li>
            <li>I love the beautiful sent.</li>
            <li>I was super impressed with the smell and the lathering of the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo and Conditioner not only smell wonderful, but work great!</li>
            <li>if you want the best for your hair and not those cheap knock-offs somewhere else that pose as something that it&#x27;s not, then this is the product that you should buy! :))</li>
            <li>Shampoo lathers beautifully, it has almost like a gel-like texture, and the conditioner is very light but effective.</li>
            <li>so I am very pleased with what I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly it could use a better name, it sounds like a laundry product, lol</li>
            <li>Smells great and my hair stays healthy.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied, although they do not lather too well</li>
            <li>THE MINT SHAMPOO IS AMAZING AND SMELLS GOOD TOO</li>
            <li>Honestly, it was surprisingly good.</li>
            <li>Good product, really nice execution.</li>
            <li>I honestly have loved every product I have purchased from them and will continue to support Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I just received the shampoo and conditioner, the flavor is good, and I&#x27;ll have a try immediately.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many shampoos and conditioners for years, this one is the best by far better than any name brand!!!</li>
            <li>my hair is beautiful, full and shines!</li>
            <li>This is a great product, by far the best shampoo I have used.</li>
            <li>It says &amp;#34;winter blend&amp;#34; but it is very refreshing, really perfect for spring and summer, or after sports when I really want to refresh my scalp!  </li>
            <li>I love the way the shampoo makes my scalp feel!</li>
            <li>I love the winter blend!  </li>

            <li>Love this stuff!</li>

            <li>I am in love with these products!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I love Maple Holistics!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I found this product!</li>
            <li>and I love it!.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel and smell!</li>
            <li>Pleasant and not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is very good at degreasing and afterwards the conditioner does a great job to make it soft again.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is also amazing.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s truly amazing the difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Amazing Combo.</li>
            <li>use a leave-in coconut conditioner after I use these in the shower and the smell/added moisture combined is amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Both the shampoo and conditioner are amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Shampoo is great,  but conditioner lacks the oils that make your hair smooth.</li>
            <li>The smell is absolutely amazing, the mint extracts leave your hair and scalp smelling and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>all of it.&lt;br /&gt;Second, my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>The Winter Blend shampoo and conditioner set also smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing</li>
            <li>the shine is amazing.  </li>
            <li>These two products are absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>They are AMAZING and</li>
            <li>The minty scent of shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner both have an amazing aroma that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  </li>
            <li>The Silk 18 smells and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Winter Blend with Silk Conditioner along with the Argan shampoo to rotate, and my hair looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is ok it smells great, but I am not in love with.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making this great product!</li>
            <li>I would (and have) recommend this shampoo &amp; conditioner to anyone who wants their hair to feel, look and smell wonderful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely refreshing and smells really good.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner really is silky and also smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Kathy ordered the Winter Blend Shampoo and Silk 18 Conditioner and told me she really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Really, really liked it after two uses.  </li>
            <li>Both the shampoo and conditioner smell really nice and neither has an obnoxious or perfume like smell.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like these do a good job of not drying it out more.</li>
            <li>conditioner was quite nice too.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kind of disheartening whenever I pull the hair tie off and a lot of hair came off with it.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I will probably buy this forever.</li>
            <li>I have colored, curly hair that doesn&#x27;t play nice</li>
            <li>It does not bother her at all and on top of that it smells good and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>made my hair look and smell nice.</li>
            <li>Something that is really nice</li>
            <li>I really liked this shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li>The smell was nice, but that is where the cons end.  </li>
            <li>Really liked this stuff.</li>
            <li>; Well it IS nice.</li>
            <li>Has a nice minty smell.</li>
            <li>My skin feels kind of tingly, or it sort of has that stimulated feeling like when you chew minty gum or when you just brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple of months and they work nicely.</li>
            <li>Kind of like its clarifying.</li>
            <li>I really liked the shampoo and conditioner blend.  </li>
            <li>I have joked with a friend that I should have a garage sale with all the hair products I own that I&#x27;ve used once or twice and never again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not expect them to reach out and be so courteous without being prompted.</li>
            <li>Gives that very thorough cleaning and leaves a wonderful scent on my hair.</li>
            <li>And had to get my own.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think my hair liked the results.</li>
            <li>I liked the feeling of my hair after using it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>When I was done rinsing off the conditioner my scalp felt renewed and kind of cold-hot and frosty.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely, cleans and rinses off well.</li>
            <li>Maple Holistics, you have my business for years to come unless you do like so many other wonderful companies - reformulate an already perfect product.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love the scent!!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful minty smell and leaves hair feeling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>The texture is perfect and you can tell that it is made with high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is the best ive used so far!!</li>
            <li>As a woman, I treasure my hair, this is very effective in clearing my hair from dirt and hair products, so I can sleep at night with a clean head of hair on me.</li>
            <li>The winter blend for being sulfate free, surprisingly had a nice lather to it.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner also has a great smell and is super creamy.</li>
            <li>The conditioner smells amazing and goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>It smells very good too (very minty) and we will continue to use.  </li>
            <li>They offer free products for a good review - I feel like I was scammed out of the money.</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife and she is very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>Sure, the peppermint is nice, but I noticed no difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo I have used.  </li>
            <li>Wow, this is the best shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to find a natural shampoo that is safe to use and makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li>I thought these were fairly pricy but just had a keratin treatment and needed to purchase phosphate free prpducts.</li>
            <li>It is so nice treating my hair and scalp to healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>They are natural products which are great!</li>
            <li>I also liked the smell, which is often also off-putting in many organic/natural hair products.</li>
            <li>This is by far the very best!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny for beautiful healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Excellent products and my hair has not looked this good for a long time.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product, my hair feels super light, free of chemical additives.</li>
            <li>And it came SUPER fast...which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free and uses good quality ingredients conducive to a healthier scalp.  </li>
            <li>I will update this review as I use the product more times but so far I am very happy with them and would recommend to everybody.</li>
            <li>This thing smells good and the mint is cool.</li>
            <li>Smells good, makes hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>I really liked this combination--you get really clean hair as well as a nice, light, and effective condition.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo and conditioner, my hair looks sleek and smooth and so much better than it has in years!</li>
            <li>I have been on the search for alternative sulfate free hair products, and I highly pleased with your products!</li>
            <li>and I can feel good about supporting products that don&#x27;t contribute to the eutrophication of our water systems!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the super cool sensation on the scalp!!!</li>
            <li>I see a huge difference in my hair!</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell makes a mint Tea Tree shampoo ( same price) that is wonderful.</li>
            <li>The minty smell is refreshing.</li>
            <li>This shampoo would work best for a white girl with greasy hair.</li>
            <li>I just purchased 2 more bottles to give to my niece for Christmas.</li>
            <li>but I love mint</li>
            <li>Will buy more, for sure.</li>
            <li>The conditioner smells lovely (I&#x27;m a fan of vanilla scents) and gives described results: silky hair.</li>
            <li>: all the shampoos should come as a combo set, with the conditioner, as it&#x27;s definitely a better deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be more inclined to purchase that option than the shampoo alone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results and plan on purchasing again.</li>
            <li>It was just ok.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this combo pack.  </li>
            <li>but I love these products and almost look forward to washing my hair, not one of my favorite activities.  </li>
            <li>Product as described and became a favorite of the family.</li>
            <li>But hey.... cruelty free!</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I will order from Maple Holistics again, just a better smelling product.</li>
            <li>I was worried that I would not be able to purchase Winter Blend in the summer</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so pleased to find it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love the scene,</li>
            <li>Will try to update more on it.</li>
            <li>After using the products a couple of times, I noticed my hair had much more shine and body</li>
            <li>I love how both the shampoo and conditioner smell.</li>
            <li>Overall though, with the Silk 18, it seems to replace the dryness and smells wonderfully</li>
            <li>Since then, I have continued using this product and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I treated myself to these products and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I really love the Winter Blend Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love the winter mint and even use it now into spring as I love the minty freshness.</li>
            <li>This product has thoroughly conditioned my hair and it&#x27;s getting better each time I use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love the way these smell.(Natural smelling mint blend.)</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t feel like the conditioner was just sitting on top my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not overpowering just lite and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It feels softer and is more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use I&#x27;ll see even more results.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it made it even drier and more unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>This cleans and conditions better than any brand I&#x27;ve tried (I tend to use better brands from Sephora).</li>
            <li>My hair is more manageable and looks like I just was at the salon.</li>
            <li>With most shampoos and conditioners, my scalp breaks out.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with their products.</li>
            <li>Better shampoo than most brands.</li>
            <li>I Love  that shampoo.</li>
            <li>That is my favorite as you can feel all the mints cooling your scalp as you use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My wife and I have been using the winter blend for a couple weeks and love it.  </li>
            <li>The sheen, the brilliance, the smooth and silky hair, it&#x27;s just, amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe for colored hair.</li>
            <li>But love the timely shipping.</li>
            <li>I also found out that most organic shampoo and conditioners irritated my scalp.</li>
            <li>But, my scalp feels so much better.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it my first impression was how wonderful the scent of the shampoo was.  </li>
            <li>It is not a unnatural perfume scent you get with many shampoos, it smells minty.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because after showering I no longer smell that wonderful scent on my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m definitely glad I continued using this product.</li>
            <li>but I like the conditioner more than the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>These two bottles has undid most of the damage in just under two weeks.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I love this shampoo and conditioner, but I do like it.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li>Hairs feels much better after use.</li>
            <li>I trusted the reviews on this product and went for it - I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>I really love the winter blend shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed each Maple Holistics product that I&#x27;ve tried, and I also love how dedicated to customer service the company is.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought these products.</li>
            <li>I love them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked so healthy.</li>
            <li>Love both products.</li>
            <li>When received, opened and enjoyed the scent we chose to, instead, use it ourselves.</li>
            <li>I love the condition this leaves my hair in.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the winter blend shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love the way the mint flavor feels on my scalp.</li>
            <li>the winter blend is one of the most memorable bottles of hair care that i have used.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I Love Love</li>
            <li>Some conditioners make my hair static and untamed.  </li>
            <li>I had so many problems with scabbing, itching and flaking</li>
            <li>Oh and did I mention the cost for this magic in a bottle can be all yours for about just $12.</li>
            <li>feel I love.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smelling amazing and so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love these 2 products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many that work</li>
            <li>I really love the scent of both the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love these products and will continue to use the Maple Holistics products.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much product to get great results.</li>
            <li>it is so good, smells so great,  that you can bet I will order it again in the future.</li>
            <li>That being said, I love the way the conditioner makes my hair feel after I blowdry it.</li>
            <li>but I am able to let it continue to grow because of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>but it still works much better than the shampoo I used to use.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell of both the conditioner and shampoo</li>
            <li>and I love that the smell lasts all day.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, smells good, and looks really good.</li>
            <li>I love it,  </li>
            <li>and we both really love the quality.  </li>
            <li>and I love them both.</li>
            <li>so when I went to order some more shampoo I saw this set and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>winter blend is such an awesome feeling on the head.</li>
            <li>better thank</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li>Love the smell of the shampoo and it cleans my hair well.</li>
            <li>Love the ingredients of both, would buy again.</li>
            <li>, I love this set.</li>
            <li>I like it, I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and the shampoo and conditioner are both great, very minty feel on the scalp which is soothing for anytime not just winter in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I began by looking through the name-brands carried by many hair salons</li>
            <li>Trying the read the labels of most hair products brings flashbacks to organic chemistry class.  </li>
            <li>These labels are much more straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting something more minty, cooling or refreshing</li>
            <li>I love that!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Who knew peppermint and vanilla would smell so lovely together.</li>
            <li>I love mint.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell of these products--the shampoo has a lovely minty scent and the conditioner smells like vanilla.</li>
            <li>Love the winter blend shampoo smells great and the conditioner really seems to help.</li>
            <li>I love the mint fragrance...</li>
            <li>It became softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>Love the way this smells and makes my hair feel, will be purchasing more when mine runs out :)</li>
            <li>and I liked the idea of these products being sulfate free and all-natural.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a great minty fragrance, very invigorating for the winter.</li>
            <li>It has a nice lather despite being sulfate free.</li>
            <li>My hair is nice and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I have noticed more softness and strength in my hair</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It does stop the static electricity.</li>
            <li>The more I use it the better it gets.</li>
            <li>These products gave me that and more.</li>
            <li>you know what shampoo brand smells better than this one?</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Love the scent on both the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>absolutely love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>to continue using your products :)</li>
            <li>I would prefer the conditioner to be more creamy</li>
            <li>Secondly, it works great!</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this as I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>Need a combo that is more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying from then again! :)</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Not only does this product do that, it also smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great product and Fast Shipping.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the conditioner and have ordered it alone</li>
            <li>so I thought the shampoo would be a favorite of mine as well.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is nice and smells great but doesn&#x27;t balance out the complete dryness wrought by the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This works perfectly with this blend, but I couldn&#x27;t ever stretch it an extra day with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter</li>
            <li>LOVE the scent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>The conditioner seems to make hair softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>Anyways, it felt good, fresh and silky.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>such a wonderful scent!</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great and really lathers well.</li>
            <li>My hair felt silky and I am very happy with the initial results.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Maple Holistics shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Winter Blend about 4 times and it actually works the best on me.  </li>
            <li>It is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>so I like it being sulfate free!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this blend...</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>Vanilla Mint is a lovely smell. :)</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the conflicting reviews.</li>
            <li>This is the 1st no sulfates, no parabens, vegan-friendly, safe for color treated hair combo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying more Maple Holistics products.</li>
            <li>I love the conditioner, but the shampoo is just not for me.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo makes my hair feel like straw, I may need more of a hydrating shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Thanks great product</li>
            <li>and so glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already in love</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair soft, clean and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is nice, not as rich as the conditioner I am used to (which contains silicons), but richer than the silicone-free conditioner from V05.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo it literally leaves your hair squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and clean feel after use!</li>
            <li>This stuff was amazing right from the start!  </li>
            <li>However, the more I use it, the softer and more easily manageable my hair has become.</li>
            <li>Makes hair very clean</li>
            <li>The mint shampoo makes your hair very clean.</li>
            <li>It gets my hair very clean, though I do not use any product in it.</li>
            <li>and I would have to say this is one of the best shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve came across in a long time.</li>
            <li>but this shampoo did a pretty good job with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can now successfully mock the herbal essence commercials with execution thanks to Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li>washes away all the impurities from my hair and establishes my good looks pretty well.</li>
            <li>After blow-drying, my hair was left feeling smooth and had a wonderful healthy shine.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great and has pleasant light minty scent; however, I have used many other conditioners better than this one.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really enjoyable, the shampoo works great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, nothing powerful, but just fresh.</li>
            <li>Most sulfate free shampoos are safe and don&#x27;t run my color.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is non-drying (thought it might be with the mint) and has a lovely lather (many sulfate free do not).</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free, and I love how it feels in my hair.</li>
            <li>my hair feels soft and looks great ant it has made my scalp feel so much better from</li>
            <li>I love it, and my daughter loved it so much when she smelled it on me that I had to order her a set as well.</li>
            <li>great products, keep up the natural work!</li>
            <li>I love the smell; it&#x27;s just refreshing and clean, unlike my home.</li>
            <li>my hair is really clean and feels nice and light.</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a pleasant scent from the vanilla and does a great job of smoothing out typically fuzzy hair.</li>
            <li>Very good price too compared to similar brands at health food stores.</li>
            <li>I also love that the shampoo is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use conditioner every day, but the Silk 18 was great so far.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the fact that it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been happy with the repair to my hair that seems to be taking place.  </li>
            <li>This was my most favorite shampoo and conditioner to use, how it had my hair soft silky and smelling good, I could never find it in Walmart.</li>
            <li>A great shampoo and conditioner treatment for my and my family&#x27;s hair (We have sensitive scalps so...).</li>
            <li>Not anymore, will be purchasing more before the winter blend isn&#x27;t available.  </li>
            <li>Light and minty :)</li>
            <li>I have been using Sulfate free products for about a year and most have this issue.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good sulfate free shampoo and conditioner combo for a while, and when I first used this product I can say that my search is over.</li>
            <li>She said most of the store shampoos are filled with chemicals that strip the hair and waxes that continually build up.  </li>
            <li>I am happy so far with this product based on one use alone.</li>
            <li>It seemed to help smooth frizzy hair and it was safe for my color treated hair.</li>
            <li>Most people get fabulous hair while pregnant....not this girl.  </li>
            <li>good for my hair, really like the blend maple holistics made for the hair.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it for how nice they made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>My scalp stopped itching after the very first washing and the shampoo and the condition smell great and leave my scalp feeling fresh and Clean.  </li>
            <li>I can easily go three or four days without washing and still feel clean!</li>
            <li>The shampoo is super minty but not too intense and feels great on your scalp.</li>
            <li>All in all, my hair is left feeling clean and smooth but not waxy or oily, and smells great to boot!</li>
            <li>There is a very nice natural scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price for such good products!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I thought to myself I need to order more so that I never run out!</li>
            <li>I look for pure ingredients that offer clean fresh scents as well as making my hair feel healthy and look great.</li>
            <li>I loved it, left my hair feeling and smelling so amazing.</li>
            <li>I love the clean scent and my hair loves the conditioner.</li>
            <li>But since I moved out of town, I decided to look to Amazon for an easy way to obtain quality shampoo.</li>
            <li>And I love how well it rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I can get away with washing once every 3 days easily,</li>
            <li>The hair brushes out easy after washing.</li>
            <li>I have wavy/curly hair that tends to frizz easily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt more clean and refreshed after getting out the shower before using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>The winter blend does have a strong scent</li>
            <li>The smell is way too strong for me and has a musky or woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a nice peppermint scent and a soft warm vanilla conditioner.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong.</li>
            <li>Price were decent for combo and the smell was good.  </li>
            <li>first time I used them was when I bleached my hair, and the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft or smelled so amazing!  </li>
            <li>Normally you get good smelling shampoo when it goes on</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think I liked the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Cool, refreshing, but no guilt.</li>
            <li>Love the smell,tingles and hair was full and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>I had originally used a more well known, cheap shampoo and conditioner for years until I wanted to try a change.  </li>
            <li>This has a wonderful, bright crisp mint scent, but it&#x27;s also a little sweet.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this didn&#x27;t quite work for me.</li>
            <li>I like the peppermint smell along with the silky fine conditioner.  </li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re pregnant, hold off on this until you have the baby. :-)</li>
            <li>Then, I happened to find this set and loved the natural ingredient list!  </li>
            <li>A very clean  but light sweet smell.</li>
            <li>I felt that it dried out my fine, curly hair, but the smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li>It smells great and gets my hair so nice and clean, without weighing it down or stripping it.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, I recommend this company because I am a huge animal lover, but not this Winter Blend hairpaste.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge change myself.</li>
            <li>HUGE MISTAKE.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, it smells amazing and leaves my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I started looking for sulfate and chemical free shampoos &amp; conditioners about a month ago.  </li>
            <li>Was looking for something Sulfate Free after reading the reviews decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research in search of a sulfate free shampoo and decided on this combo set.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this set and gotta say thathe I have never had such a great customer service as at maple</li>
            <li>I am loving how this makes my hair feel and have noticed that it seems to be working really well for my family as well.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important to me.</li>
            <li>It would be wonderful if they started making a Winter Blend Conditioner and sold both year round.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not some amazing shampoo and conditioner that I can really feel a difference with.</li>
            <li>really enjoy the Silk 18 conditioner.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the great product, I will definitely be buying your products from now on!</li>
            <li>My hair feels great after using this, esp especially in combo with the silk 18 conditioner.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair its smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It smelled great but left my hair oily</li>
            <li>so this review is not written lightly.  </li>
            <li>, I am fond of the conditioner and the way that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too smooth.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this products because of all the great reviews on it.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh feel the shampoo gives my scalp when applying.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because it was sulfate free and for the mint in the shampoo.</li>
            <li>purchase, I was worried that I&#x27;d smell like a candy cane, but that smell is fleeting -- great to open the sinuses in the shower, but then rinses away as you&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li>[Maple Holistics gave me a free bottle of conditioner as a reward for writing this review.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was sulfate free &amp; that&#x27;s what washes the color out.  </li>
            <li>This is FABULOUS shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I had another keratin treatment and decide to try a strore bought, cheaper sulfate free product.</li>
            <li>It seemed to contain great essential oils, but it did not do my hair justice.</li>
            <li>It is stronger, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>the shampoo feels like a clarifying one - leaves my hair feeling weightless and free of residue.</li>
            <li>they are fantastic .</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and I don&#x27;t have to use too much either.  </li>
            <li>There are no chemical free hair products here that work so well.</li>
            <li>This blend of shampoo and conditioner filled with mint has cleaned my hair of dandruff and my wife uses it to make her hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s very humid here, I found myself showering more and more often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good natural, sulfate-free, shampoo and conditioner for a while.</li>
            <li>Will update if problems arise but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Sadly, so far, not so good.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and the smell is nice</li>
            <li>I appreciate that this company does their hair research and uses good, natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not positive; however, what I can state is this product smells incredibly fresh and wonderful.</li>
            <li>thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li>this is very useful for repairing damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Very fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair feeling clean, healthy and fresh.</li>
            <li>I was astonished when I rinsed it out and it felt like normal hair again, even better than before!</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner smells wonderful, not overwhelming, and leaves hair light and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the shampoo is very light, minty and sudsy.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the tingling clean feeling while waiting the 2-3 minutes of allowing the shampoo to do its work on my scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair felt light and clean after I showered and the smell of the Mint oils woke me and my brain up.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy that I finally found a product that is natural and healthy for my hair!</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves our hair feel silky and smooth all day long!</li>
            <li>and so far works great on my hair (fine , straight, highlights).</li>
            <li>I was familiar with Silk 18 as my daughter uses this conditioner</li>
            <li>and so excited jumped in the shower and washed my hair and went to sleep.</li>
            <li>Okay, first thing to know about this product.</li>
            <li>This 2 in 1 keeps my head cool while keeping my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I love anything mint so decided to try these for the first time.</li>
            <li>After washing my hair with the shampoo, there was significant residue.  </li>
            <li>I delayed to write this review in order to get familiar with the product and how reliable it is.</li>
            <li>Hence, I am very satisfied with the shampoo and conditioner for what it does to my hair: makes them shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Well worth it to save lots of money by purchasing the set!</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying other products from this company and hope they are as good!</li>
            <li>My hair is softer, shinier, and had better body after first use.</li>
            <li>The price point is friendly and you get a lot of bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the mint - the smell, the tingle..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not picky with my shampoo as long as it smells great</li>
            <li>And the funny thing is, friends and coworkers noticed how healthy and shiny my hair is now.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>and I was really excited to try this out.</li>
            <li>very refreshing minty sense that leaves my hair (and scalp) feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>However, as a former hairdresser, I feel this would be a very good choice for somebody with coarser hair or somebody who wears their hair completely straight..</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave any build-up and my scalp and hair feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>It smells like glue and does not get my hair clean.</li>
            <li>This helps clean the grease.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a great product for all types of dry hair.</li>
            <li>They both smell yummy, my hair feels so clean and refreshed</li>
            <li>only they make her hair feel light, conditioned, and smelling good.  </li>
            <li>Hair is squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>This makes it feel clean but not overly stripped.</li>
            <li>Shampoo that makes my hair feeling and smelling clean.</li>
            <li>It is great for dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels squeaky clean with it.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so clean.</li>
            <li>smelled wonderful and left my hair soft.</li>
            <li>The mint shampoo also clean really well and top it off with Silk 18, your hair will feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair feeling clean and like hair.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a matte looking clean.  </li>
            <li>Nothing gets my hair so CLEAN on my scalp and conditions</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp feel incredibly clean, and there is no build up whatsoever</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a tree-hugger, either; I need something to clean and condition my hair.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves my hair squeaky clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>The shampoo makes my hair feel clean without stripping it.</li>
            <li>After using the conditioner it left my hair smelling delicious and feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos containing any kind of mint fragrance or ingredients are way to strong and that tingling sensation eventually turns to dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t require that the review to be positive, just sincere.</li>
            <li>I accidentally found this brand while searching for something else and decided based on the positive reviews to try this combo out seeing as how it&#x27;s winter and all. :-)</li>
            <li>Loving it so far!  </li>
            <li>This is my second purchase from Maple Holistics, the first set was the Winter Blend + Silk 18 which I loved but felt it caused a lot of static</li>
            <li>I also love that the price is pretty reasonable too compared to so many overpriced products out there.  </li>
            <li>Invigorating, cleansing and made my hair feel soft and healthy!</li>
            <li>This emulsifies easily and leaves a good feeling on my scalp and hair and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>it left my hair very clean and it smells amazing</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so I don&#x27;t need anything too powerful.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is fine, but I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Cool feeling, clean head.</li>
            <li>have also ordered and used the winter special shampoo.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you they were all right!</li>
            <li>The shampoo really deep cleanses your hair with all the mint ingredients which give a good clean feel to the hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair and scalp feeling great, along with smelly very fresh, due to the mint and spearmint.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner consistently leave my hair and scalp feeling clean and moisturized, and my hair is now super-soft!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad shampoo, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>I love that these are sulfate free, natural products!!</li>
            <li>Makes your soft and smell amazing.</li>
            <li>I expected my hair looks great after using it for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>You have to give this a try if you&#x27;re curious, they work great together.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it to stars is it did feel and smell good.</li>
            <li>I have never used such good products.</li>
            <li>I suffer from frequent headaches and this provided a nice cooling feeling which aided in relief from the pain.</li>
            <li>My hair was very greasy and frizzy and it was time to switch to a better shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li>I like the cool mint feeling on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It smells sweet but not in an overpowering way.</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair feeling nice and soft though.  </li>
            <li>My momma always told me to keep my head cool.</li>
            <li>I like the minty smell and cool feel.</li>
            <li>Smells cool and minty.</li>
            <li>Feels cool and minty on the scalp.</li>
            <li>The cool feeling is a plus</li>
            <li>They not only smell good, but the consistency of the products and they way</li>
            <li>It gives my head that cool feeling when applied.</li>
            <li>My ABSOLUTE favorite is the Silk 18.  </li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner, it really helps my scalp even in the summer</li>
            <li>The winter blend seems to work just as well, but with a refreshing minty smell I really like.  </li>
            <li>The winter duo is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>Well, it seems than finally I found a good quality hair products.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does not tingle all that much for me, but I can smell the mint, which is refreshing.  </li>
            <li>The whole family uses it and we are all satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>These have a very aromatherapeutic, refreshing mint scent.</li>
            <li>I have now used the Maple Holistics Winter Blend Shampoo and Conditioner set for a full week.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>Was kind of unsure of buying this set but was blown away at how soft it made my damaged hair feel...</li>
            <li>I left it on for a good 10 mins and then rinsed it out.</li>
            <li>and I definitely recommend this product for those winter scent lover out there or for anyone who just want a good shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>My one problem is with the vanilla scent, to me it smells like a combination of vanilla, flowers, and a sickly sweet perfume.</li>
            <li>Both bottles were full to the brim with the products - no rip off there.</li>
            <li>Finally, they smell really good.</li>
            <li>The shampoo keeps my scalp cool, while the conditioner makes my hair, severely treated with colors and hair products, feel smoother, not greasy  and nicer altogether.</li>
            <li>it really works :)</li>
            <li>To make this review concise: I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely fell in love with the Silk18 Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love them, they leave my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>This one seems light but still gives just the right moisture for me.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how gentle these are, and they are sulfate free - these would be great for people who exercise often and have to wash hair a lot, but don&#x27;t want to damage hair with too much shampooing.  </li>
            <li>The mint varieties really lend a large part in the amazing feeling this leaves on my scalp and the scent is truly cooling.</li>
            <li>I probably wash my hair way too much, but have very strong hot flashes where I end up drenched, so always feel the need to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>I want to try other products from Maple Holistics, but I am going to stick with this one since I&#x27;m so happy with it.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s nice that the product is holistic and environmentally friendly, I know there are other products out there which perform much better, but still qualify for those descriptions.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great smell and product.</li>
            <li>The minty smell is great, and I find, especially if I lather, rinse and repeat, my hair has that squeaky clean feeling, and definitely feels like it has more body and shine.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t at the top like most products but it was still present.</li>
            <li>The smell is sensational and left my scalp tingly.</li>
            <li>I currently use Aveda rosemary mint shampoo and conditioner, but wanted to try something sulfate free (honestly, I used it for the smell).  </li>
            <li>but once it dries, it quickly subsides so do not be concerned about that.</li>
            <li>The smell when dry is pleasant but not over whelming.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>When I began using this set, I quickly noticed a change in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Super bummed about this</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if your looking for a healthy alternative to chemical laden shampoos/conditioners.</li>
            <li>This is the first sulfate free shampoo that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy with fairly curly hair and most products make my hair coarse and &#x27;poofy&#x27; instead of soft and relaxed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews for most products that I order.</li>
            <li>The silk conditioner leaves my hair pretty smooth and easier to comb but not greasy</li>
            <li>Sweetly minty fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Both products leave my hair feeling clean, soft, and moisturized and I feel better knowing it has no carcinogenic or animal ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thinning hair and every time I shampoo my hair immediately feels thicker and as soon as I apply the conditioner my hair is silky soft.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite brand.</li>
            <li>BUT...I had my new shampoo that promised me a refreshing minty scent, and a tingly scalp (I&#x27;ll take tingly anywhere these days).</li>
            <li>I am going to give Silk 18 a try as I see that people with dry hair have good experiences with it.</li>
            <li>Maybe good for dry hair.</li>
            <li>It is soft, clean, and LIGHT which is incredibly important considering the length of my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really made my hair shiny(!!)</li>
            <li>I will be definitely be looking into more of these products!</li>
            <li>Some organic and all-natural shampoos leave my hair feeling coarse and dry, but this did an excellent job with moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair and this combination of shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>This is the first &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; shampoo I&#x27;ve tried that lathered and made my hair feel truly clean...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been very particular about my hair products - Always sulfate/paraben free.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fairly fine, shoulder length and straight.</li>
            <li>With many shampoos my hair is left so fine that it floats with the slightest breeze.</li>
            <li>I also tried it because the scents of mint &amp; eucalyptus helps to calm my migraines at times.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair VERY shiny, light and bouncy.</li>
            <li>My have greasy scalp but dry hair, the shampoo does a great job getting the oil and grease out of my scalp leaves my hair feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Both shampoo and conditioner  are very fragrant which is also a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>After years of highlighting, straightening, and curling, I was looking for a gentle sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to help my hair feel silky and look smooth.</li>
            <li>I feel better about using this natural product as well.</li>
            <li>(I have naturally curly hair that has a mind of its own) and looks so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo has a great tingle and clears up gross scalp buildup, and the conditioner made my hair salon soft.</li>
            <li>and I love how soft it makes her hair</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m enjoying this blend.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and looks better than it ever has.</li>
            <li>months.i also love the fact that it contains natural ingredients</li>
            <li>but this could be that it&#x27;s adjusting to the more natural ingredients and will normalize once again.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>As a result, my scalp began producing more natural oils to combat me washing the oil away...</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way my hair feels silky soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>It has a refreshing and uplifting mint fragrance, and feels soft and silky when you lather it into your hair.</li>
            <li>The icing on the cake is that it is natural and with out all the chemicals that plague so many hair products on the market.  </li>
            <li>Yes, you will smell like spearmint fresh out of the shower</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to be effective so the bottles will last awhile.</li>
            <li>are on the more natural end of the spectrum.</li>
            <li>I  like the fresh mint smell which is not over bearing</li>
            <li>Many of the ones I have tried have shorter ingredient lists or easily identifiable ingredients</li>
            <li>They are safe, natural and they work wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells minty and fresh.</li>
            <li>I LOVE HOW SOFT, MANAGEABLE AND SILKY MY HAIR IS AFTER USING IT.</li>
            <li>Love the product so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*This is NOT a sponsored post, I have purchased these on my own, with my personal funds.</li>
            <li>, it just seemed my hair was kind of tangled initially after rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a nice tingly effect, especially while leaving it in for 2-3 min as recommended.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make the change to a more natural and sulfate-free shampoo</li>
            <li>Definitely worth investing into.</li>
            <li>The scent is fairly powerful in the bottle but a suggestion once used in the hair.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again, and think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Dime-sized shampoo is all I needed to clean my hair, and I feel very comfortable with only washing my hair once a week.  </li>
            <li>This is great for say, a once a week deep clean if you use a lot of hair products, but I found it to be too much for frequent use.</li>
            <li>This was the best money I spent for my hair, I have really dry and damaged hair from dying and straightening and this helped my hair feel so much more healthy and my scalp didn&#x27;t feel as dry!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results, and now that the dry winter is over</li>
            <li>However, the salon treatments didn&#x27;t last, so I&#x27;ve been looking for a good shampoo and conditioner that would leave my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It is natural and real, I too am a natural women and we all deserve this much help to feel beautiful.</li>
            <li>This product smells so good &amp; makes my hair feel clean and health, I suggest it if you don&#x27;t want harsh chemicals in your hair or on your scalp.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this shampoo without conditioner though, because it strips my hair of all the natural oils also - like I said, very clean.</li>
            <li>Other wise it would be a 5</li>
            <li>The minty smell is lovely, the feeling is a light but not overwhelming refreshing sensation.</li>
            <li>but I found that many of them had the exact same ingredients as my cheap shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo- works good, smells good but does dry up your hair a little</li>
            <li>right after rinsing</li>
            <li>We received this product and my daughter used it right away.  </li>
            <li>It may not work for you right away.</li>
            <li>There seemed to be improvement right away.</li>
            <li>Right after I used the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Everything is all right with this shampoo and conditioner pack.</li>
            <li>Maple Holistics gets it right with this product.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I will buy this particular combo again when it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>I have fairly normal hair and my hair is doing just fine with this.</li>
            <li>These products made my dry ends even dryer and more brittle!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t leave my hair super soft or smooth.  </li>
            <li>As for the condition I love it, my hair is less tangled after using it and it gives my hair so much more body.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a nice smell and keeps my hair very clean much longer than previous shampoos I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>It has a great smell but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>very drying, my hair was full of statics, and I don&#x27;t even blow-dry it.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair smell minty and nice all day long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding something that is good for my hair and leaves it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>My roots on the other hand are nice and soft, and I love the scent. .</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase again!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend - worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, makes your scalp tingle and makes your hair feel so clean yet soft at the same time!</li>
            <li>I love this product because it is really gentle and has no harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li>The conditioner left my hair feeling soft and seems to give it good volume.</li>
            <li>I am so glad someone has finally made a product worth every penny</li>
            <li>The products arrived quickly, and I appreciated the tracking update e-mail, also.</li>
            <li>this particular shampoo gets your hair squeaky clean...</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast..</li>
            <li>Very much a Spearmint odor to that</li>
            <li>With all the color and chlorine in my hair, it&#x27;s amazing how these two little bottles could clean up and maintain my hair&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine, too early to tell.</li>
            <li>and so far I like it fine.  </li>
            <li>My hair now has a lovely shine and isn&#x27;t getting greasy super fast, and when it does, it doesn&#x27;t feel or look really gross!</li>
            <li>I have been using this since two months ago because this is really soothing and relaxing, and it really keeps my hair clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of peppermint oil because it has helped clear my jaw acne (I put a dab on my jaw every night after washing my face)</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d like the smell of vanilla in my hair, but I find I really do like it!</li>
            <li>different price and better.......</li>
            <li>I am pretty picky.</li>
            <li>Lately, I&#x27;ve been purchasing products that are natural and organic, so I was intrigued when I stumbled upon this brand - so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>My hair has also become so much more thicker since I started using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I never tried this product before, but the reviews I read Iam willing to try it, since my hair is limp.no volume and lack of body, I have tried alot of products that claim they volumize your hair and they dont.</li>
            <li>Enjoy supporting products that are made out of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>From the first use, my hair was noticeably softer.</li>
            <li>but it does work very well!  </li>
            <li>I used just the shampoo as it didn&#x27;t come with the conditioner the first purchase and it made a heck of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Thanks MapleHolistics!</li>
            <li>After receiving the Winter Blend set, I eagerly awaited my next hair appointment to get the latest verdict.</li>
            <li>My hair was back healthy again.</li>
            <li>I noticed that normal store shampoos/conditioner made my hair far more dry/frizzy.</li>
            <li>but I have to say that they really work!</li>
            <li>This was the first product I have tried from mapleholistic, but I have also purchased the silk18 conditioner.</li>
            <li>Both products leave our hair soft, shiny and tangle free.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much in order to do the trick!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better now, I wish I could&#x27;ve known about this  earlier.</li>
            <li>But, this is definitely better than a lot of traditional shampoo and conditioners that are on the shelves at target, etc.</li>
            <li>I bought it, and after the first shampoo/conditioner session I saw a difference.</li>
            <li>If you cleanse daily or more than once a day, your hair won&#x27;t feel brittle.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different sulfate free shampoos--I have found my keeper!  </li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant about the mint-</li>
            <li>At first I used Silk 18.  </li>
            <li>Now, my hair feels light and soft.  </li>
            <li>Second time I&#x27;ve purchased this item because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>It is the first time I haven&#x27;t had tangles after shampooing.</li>
            <li>I love this dynamic duo!  </li>
            <li>I get lots of lather with the shampoo, and the conditioner really moisturizes my hair well!  </li>
            <li>I actually use it in the summer but will also love it in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I will be back for more...</li>
            <li>Upon first using them, I have to say...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s August in Memphis, which equates to hot as hell, yet there&#x27;s snow on my shoulders.</li>
            <li>The mint shampoo is very refreshing with a smell that is multi-layered and deeper than the average mint scent.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I plan to order more products from Maple Holistics in the future!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this product was the smell.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo and conditioner for the first time, my hair already felt muck silkier than ever before.</li>
            <li>and I will most likely buy it again once I run out.</li>
            <li>I feel like I should put it in Hot Chocolate and drink it (don&#x27;t do that).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll most definitely keep using the Silk 18 when this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is really helping with the dryness of my hair!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, fragile and gets super greasy in just a days time if I don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li>I leave it on my hair just a bit longer than necessary to enjoy the scent!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time for me to purchase a set, simply because the container is cute.</li>
            <li>Thanks Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li>and now it actually looks and feels so much better not frizzy at all....</li>
            <li>The whole package!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the shampoo itself left my hair feeling</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get it in the UK, but I gladly pay the international postage.</li>
            <li>BUUUUT, with this 2 pack im able to last 4 days without washing my hair.   </li>
            <li>It does exactly what is says</li>
            <li>The first time I used the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>The conditioner does not get much use from me but it is useful too.</li>
            <li>but I already felt the difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>Since I just had a baby I can say that if I had tried to use this conditioner in my first trimester (when you have the nose of a werewolf) there is no way I could have handled it.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing from you guys again soon:)</li>
            <li>will come back after a month with a better review</li>
            <li>Amazing, have been struggling with goopy dry hair and have tried many shampoos, this really made a difference finally.</li>
            <li>Yes this product does have a long ingredient list and some of the ingredients have a low toxicity rating on EWG but it certainly has gentler ingredients and more plant-based ingredients than most of the hair/beauty products out there (no sulfates, no parabens, no artificial scent).</li>
            <li>I have previously tried it and liked it but thought it wasn&#x27;t enough to detangle my very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I was right about not having to use a lot of product, all I really need is about a tablespoon.</li>
            <li>Not only is the smell amazing, but I leaves my hair feeling so incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>The shampoo cleans well with a very small amount of product, plus it smells great.</li>
            <li>Lathers up nicely just like any other shampoo as well.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does have a nice fresh scent, but I found it a little drying.  </li>
            <li>I have tried my fair share of natural conditioners, and a lot of them just leave my hair super tangled and super hard to comb through.</li>
            <li>My hair felt a lot more clean than it typically does after using this.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so clean and soft after using this.</li>
            <li>Now, it feels clean, soft, and silky.</li>
            <li>After my first use my hair is soft and full of body.  </li>
            <li>I have tried almost every brand of hair care products carried by Whole Foods and Sprouts in search of something safe and that actually works.</li>
            <li>my hair is smooth, silky soft and very shiny.  </li>
            <li>On top of that its full volume these have no chemicals weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my hair felt soft or anything special after using.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have very damaged dry hair, have been using these for 2 weeks, and while I didn&#x27;t see yet any apparent improvement it does maintain my hair pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, VERY fine, straight hair, which I perm once a year for body and curl.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a sulfate free shampoo that is healthy for colored hair (I currently have blue hair</li>
            <li>Smell is good and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried soo many natural brands over the last 8 years: Aubrey Organics (Rose Hip line), Acure (Moroccan Argan Stem Cell + Argan Oil line), Alaffia Dry Coconut line, Pure peppermint soaps,</li>
            <li>Most of the main ingredients are coconut derivatives and the scent comes from 100% mint essential oils.</li>
            <li>It has a nice lather and the conditioner didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>The Maple Holistics set left my hair feeling soft, shiny and it was very easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>Bought it to try it out, the minty smell is pretty nice but maybe a little too minty.</li>
            <li>My hair is really thick and coarse and I love how smooth it makes my hair look and feel:)</li>
            <li>I have very dry winter scalp and the Winter Blend Shampoo is refreshing and invigorating while the Silk 18 leaves my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something different than just buying the sulfate free shampoo sold by Brazilian Blowout or other popular brand name.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair soft and shinier than before, it doesn&#x27;t make it feel super silky</li>
            <li>Most said my hair was dry, brittle, and littered with split ends.</li>
            <li>Our hair is super soft.  </li>
            <li>He is very particular about shampoo but he loves this.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Great product and keeps my hair soft even in the dead of winter!</li>
            <li>i have dry frizzy hair &amp;tried so many products.</li>
            <li>During the winter months my hair tends to be dry and it sheds more.</li>
            <li>My hair has felt more dry and lost its sheen.</li>
            <li>My hair was extremely dry, and brittle, I am pleased with there product.</li>
            <li>Sure I bought this product in Summer, but I rarely turn down any peppermint themed</li>
            <li>Sulfate-free products are purely market-driven to get consumers to purchase the product.</li>
            <li>This Winter Blend set is a smart purchase.  </li>
            <li>I have added a large rubber band around one of the bottles</li>
            <li>I have fine thin, permanently colored hair, and it has never felt or looked better!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good shampoo and conditioner for my fine, dry, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>After getting my hair done with several different beauticians, the comments were obviously true; I no longer had healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the effects after a few more uses!</li>
            <li>I have very wavy almost curly hair that is fairly coarse and gets tangled easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a more &#x27;natural&#x27; shampoo, but have struggled to find one that has the right consistency for my long hair.</li>
            <li>Price is very high though.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t certain if winter blends really made a noticeable difference or change in my hair texture.</li>
            <li>I need to use more than directed for my hair to feel clean and the bottles are so small</li>
            <li>meaning I could potentially get away with walking out the door and not doing anything else to it (no ponytail), which is HUGE for me.  </li>
            <li>my hair is really clean and feels so light, like when I leave the salon (because your hair stylist will always use less product than you do at home).</li>
            <li>Thanks for providing us with such a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>The conditioner smells like vanilla and works really well too.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be purchasing from this company again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the price though.</li>
            <li>I picked the package up and the whole car ride home</li>
            <li>Thanks soooooo much.</li>
            <li>I recently was given this as a gift and love it.shampoo made my hair soft as i have very damaged hair from being over processed.the conditioner made my hair managable.i will be purchasing again...</li>
            <li>I am very upset with this product.</li>
            <li>I maybe using too much, so I am going to give it some time.  </li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much for a hair product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very minty, smells like a spa.</li>
            <li>For a while now, I have been looking for a shampoo/conditioner that meets the highest ethical standards and does well with my hair.  </li>
            <li>so I used a tad too much.</li>
            <li>and it looks so much healthier</li>
            <li>Really fantastic product, I just wish they made larger sizes.</li>
            <li>It also smells very refreshing but not overwhelmingly minty.</li>
            <li>I also really like the way my hair feel safer shampoo and conditioner use.  </li>
            <li>really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, I like it so much I bought a backup for my gym bag.</li>
            <li>Really appreciate this wholesome product.</li>
            <li>FOR REAL.</li>
            <li>The conditioner really straightens my hair.</li>
            <li>really helpful</li>
            <li>My hair is so much softer and easier to brush with the combination of these two products.</li>
            <li>The conditioner didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; at all.  </li>
            <li>i really like these two things.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t like the smell all that much.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is very moisturizing AND it detangles.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so shiny and the mint really helps my scalp.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much .</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very out of control and</li>
            <li>You know, where the shampoo seemed pretty good for the first use but subsequently makes your hair heavy or</li>
            <li>i would definetly recommend this duo to anyone who wants to see immediate change in just one use.</li>
            <li>My hair has so much shine and body...</li>
            <li>Recommend for those with shorter hair, or that don&#x27;t use that much.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizes hair.</li>
            <li>/reviewers so it really depends on the person &amp; type of hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this set</li>
            <li>After a few more applications, I will decide if I will use this as my daily shampoo, or as more of a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t moisturize nearly as much as Purology Hydrate or Joico Moisture Recovery.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>The shampoo in this set really does leave the hair &amp;#34;squeaky clean,&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The conditioner is also very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent lots finding something I really love.</li>
            <li>However, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>and this product didn&#x27;t really help with the frizz.</li>
            <li>it feels much softer to the touch w/</li>
            <li>I would also recommend the winter blend shampoo to people with a greasy scalp, it cleanses and degreases the scalp very well.</li>
            <li>and so I really like this in a shampoo.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not thin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s straight as well.</li>
            <li>After doing research on these, I would really like to try them to fix the damage I have done.</li>
            <li>(my hair is normally very oily).</li>
            <li>They have absolutely transformed my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work on my aging hair.  </li>
            <li>and I really can&#x60;t use anything else anymore.</li>
            <li>I actually just used it and my hair is extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo combo.</li>
            <li>I did think from some of the reviews that it would help with my dandruff, however it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My hair is very finicky when it comes to shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to the cheap $3 shampoos and conditioners in the big bottles that you have to use A TON of in order to get it to lather.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m used to conditioners that don&#x27;t spread very well at all, but</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I was not really needing this but after seeing the effects, I am glad I purchased this</li>
            <li>I really want to like this.</li>
            <li>It is even better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioners have made my hair so much silkier and smoother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d call it a clarifying shampoo, really.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Both are very aromatic without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>I am on day 3 now and my hair still feels very clean!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am finding the shampoo to be great for my thick, naturally curly colored hair.  </li>
            <li>They must have spilled an actual nice smelling shampoo next to it and it leaked on my winterfresh box.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend is extremely sensitive to a lot of different ingredients and many can give her allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>Kind of dried my hair out.</li>
            <li>Left it soft and the mint smell was wonderful-even better smelling mint.  </li>
            <li>No more :) I waited a full month to see how this would transform my hair</li>
            <li>didnt really work for my thick hair but smells good</li>
            <li>Coming across products that actually work as promised is very rare nowadays, let alone products that are &amp;#34;unbranded&amp;#34; so to speak.</li>
            <li>I have wavy, coarse hair that I curl and flat iron too much, leaving it kind of frizzy and fried looking a lot of the time.  </li>
            <li>My two wishes for this product: it was also available in 16 oz (or other larger size) and it was more affordable.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend uses the conditioner and she stated that it is super light and doesn&#x27;t weigh her hair down.</li>
            <li>However, with this the next day it is not greasy at all and still smooth, and it looks clean as though it was washed the same day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I had a shorter haircut and notice that my hair didn&#x27;t fall out as much but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was due to the cut or products or combination of both.  </li>
            <li>A vibrant, fresh scent with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>The smell of the conditioner is a little overwhelming at first.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m able to wash every other day.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d love to try out other products from this brand.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I absolutely LOVE this set!</li>
            <li>I would love to try other shampoos, too, but you cannot pry my hands off of the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love it and can&#x27;t wait to try other products.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li>(I problem I&#x27;ve had with most other shampoos).</li>
            <li>All in all its a great product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It is much better than my other shampoos in keeping my hair silky.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d like to try other shampoos to see if there is something better for me.</li>
            <li>but I agree with other reviewers that it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li>I learned that I can only use the shampoo about twice a month because I literally leaves my hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>It left my scalp so clean and refreshed--I had an ahhh feeling.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hair felt so clean.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner have a wonderful soft smell which I appreciate, I hate being enveloped in strong smells.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, highlighted hair &amp; dandruff.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and smooth after using the conditioner, really did feel &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; and definitely not dry.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry lengths which I haven&#x27;t cut in years, and was pleased to see the conditioner makes them very soft.</li>
            <li>and I have a super sensitive eczema skin, so I am all about natural products.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is very minty and maybe a touch too strong for me as I&#x27;m not much of a mint person</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this as long as its available.</li>
            <li>Suitable for everyday use as well.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have to use my serum that I&#x27;d normally use after washing, but I still prefer to.</li>
            <li>the use a small amount of conditioner because no matter how nice my hair is, it tangles at the ends.</li>
            <li>My first use and my hair felt so soft.</li>
            <li>After using it for the first time, I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This is my first natural shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>the flakes practically disappeared and my scalp was left feeling cool and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos and conditioners weigh down my hair and make it look crunchy when combined with styling product.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner alleviates static cling (flyaway hair) and adds body and volume without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>Love this combo, i have less hair falling out using this.</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner for my dry scalp, chemically and colored treated hair when I came upon the Maple Holistics Wintery Blend shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>particular product didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m such a fan of this shampoo/conditioner and Silk 18 conditioner that I can&#x27;t sing its praises enough :-)  </li>
            <li>Particularly, the mint and peppermint.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this products because it made my coarse hair soft,and silky and well moisturized especially in this winter</li>
            <li>I have had numerous compliments on how soft and moisturized my hair feels - and I really enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>The minty smell is mild, and this works the same as</li>
            <li>For me in particular, it did not act as a &amp;#34;detangler&amp;#34; once out of the shower</li>
            <li>The curls looked decent but again I didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>I was looking for a shampoo with a mint fragrance that wouldn&#x27;t wash out my red hair color so quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I believe this is the conditioner&#x27;s work - particularly the argan oil in it.</li>
            <li>I have to switch brands often due to my hair becoming oily and the product build up.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing and they both left my long curly hair feeling so soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>; Conditioner is amazing; I have long hair and it lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li>My hair is curly with lots of frizz and can get very dry if I don&#x27;t use the right products, so I chose maple holistics based on the average reviews and the fact that these products are sulfate free!&lt;br /&gt;After using the shampoo, my hair felt very clean!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Clearly high quality stuff.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Maple Holistics Winter Blend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying the Maple Holistics line of products.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>The product lasted as long spas other products, I was very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Second the fact that I needed so little product to make my flat, pin straight, blah hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li>Again I can not stress enough about removing the build up on you hair first!</li>
            <li>Also, they both smell lovely, and I like how the shampoo gives a little bit of a tingling feeling on my scalp.</li>
            <li>It worked well, but I didn&#x27;t love the fragrance (vanilla, a little musky).</li>
            <li>I needed to use a little more than I would my normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the dead sea mud mask and the silk 18 conditioner works just as well and has a lovely vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>This product is natural and gentle.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling very silky and soft.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use a natural product I get a very itchy scalp and flaky scalp.  </li>
            <li>My son, 8 years old, likes the scents and it is so gentle on his eyes.</li>
            <li>You might laugh, but I think that not only type of hair, but also water supply affects products.  </li>
            <li>My scalp felt better in just a few days.</li>
            <li>Overall, Worth a try.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few products that makes my hair feel healthy again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tingly and fresh blend of mints (especially helpful during colds...opens up the sinuses and relieves headaches)</li>
            <li>My hair stays with fresh minty smell even at the 2nd day</li>
            <li>to fall out normally.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner helped make my hair which felt bristly and harsh develop a better texture.</li>
            <li>Still lots of curls - just not the tangled knots that I normally get.</li>
            <li>My hair type is normal to oily.</li>
            <li>I recieved this combo last christmas from my mother , she has always liked the quality of the maple holistics line , I have very dry limp hair , the shampoo made my hair feel very clean and the conditioner made my hair extremely soft and managable</li>
            <li>I have pin straight and very fine strands, but thick hair</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a safe alternative, and checked every single ingredient.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty healthy hair (straight long black hair), but my scalp gets a bit itchy</li>
            <li>However, I was looking for a shampoo to help with my thick, frizzy, fly away hair in a particularly dry, winter climate</li>
            <li>I have dry, wavy and frizzy asian hair, and it bothered me for so many years.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair super soft after 1 use only!!!</li>
            <li>I often treat my hair with hair oils, and the shampoo was strong enough to properly wash my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve contacted customer service, described everything which I was not happy with and the very next day I got the full refund and on top of that they have recommended me another products of theirs which were shipped to me immediately!</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m alternating using the winter blend with the tea tree oil shampoo (also from Maple Holistics) to make it last longer.</li>
            <li>Not strong but prominent.</li>
            <li>It is not easy to find a scent that is also appealing to men.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathered extremely well despite being sulfate free.</li>
            <li>My husband and three little boys also use it and they love the way it smells and their hair is so so soft.</li>
            <li>I loved the soft minty scent of the shampoo, but it was a little drying for my already dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to trying a new product from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li>Definitely my new shampoo and conditioner choice</li>
            <li>My new shampoo and conditioner for life</li>
            <li>Great shampoo, no itch, smells cold and very minty.</li>
            <li>This was cheap and this is really something that helps me in my everyday toils with wax on my hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo isnt too harsh and I love the natural tingle from the mint.</li>
            <li>I get a dry scalp and hair SO quickly.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference as I had long straight hair and my hair cont.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You might also think you don&#x27;t get very much since it is only 8oz.</li>
            <li>A very natural and soothing shampoo and conditioner for my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair very soft, takes out the knots, and feel like it did when I was in my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It makes you hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Hair is very soft - and - no sulfites.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast and both products were properly sealed.</li>
            <li>My scalp is usually tight, itchy, and flakes fairly easily.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>But, as for the conditioner... it is a gift crafted and sent to me from God himself just in time for this unexpected winter too!</li>
            <li>This was helpful to me at first because I was used to lots of soap suds from regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>After just one use my hair looked healthier and was no longer a grease pit by early afternoon!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the shampoo and conditioner a few times but so far I&#x27;m really loving both.  </li>
            <li>This product made her hair feel soft with no frizz, and her curls bounced!  </li>
            <li>Smells and feels just like another big name brand shampoo starting with a c and ends with an r (I think it&#x27;s pretty clear), but it makes my hair smooth and not coarse.</li>
            <li>I am now able to wash my hair every other day if I prep my hair with a bit of baby shower the morning of the second day.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I thought the only logical explanation could be psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, and usually the conditioner makes my hair</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft, looked shiny, and smelled like minty vanilla!</li>
            <li>First off, my strands of hair actually felt cleaner.  </li>
            <li>After the first wash I definitely noticed a difference as my hair was softer and shinier.  </li>
            <li>Also made my hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cool on the head and is everything I&#x27;ve ever expected from a shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li>However, the shampoo is a little strong on the peppermit.</li>
            <li>The scent on the conditioner is a little strong for my taste</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos and conditioners and haven&#x27;t found one that really right for my curly/frizzy, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>but these kept my hair cool enough for me not to get irritated enough to shout at my employees.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the 5-mint blend in the shampoo, only wish it was a little stronger as I suffer from a pretty itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>It did leave my hair feeling a little on the dry side, which is where the silk conditioner comes in handy.</li>
            <li>You only need to use a small amount, the shampoo lathers nicely and leaves hair feeling squeaky clean (unlike other natural products I have tried) and the conditioner leaves hair unbelievably soft and comb-able.  </li>
            <li>bit.&lt;br /&gt;Silk18 conditioner- works really well, left my hair very soft</li>
            <li>Makes hair silky and is richly conditioning but does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>Will certainly order this pack from here in the nearest future</li>
            <li>I can not say better words about this set of shampoo, they are small, I know, but compare to regular shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;ve used before, you only need to use about 1/2-1/3 of regular amount per time, and you get rich foam</li>
            <li>Just average hair and this product didn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
            <li>and I had nothing else in the bath - Wow, really soothing and now using daily</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much in the way of scent but was pleasantly surprised to be greeted with a smell reminiscent of cupcakes.</li>
            <li>Overall it works well to clean my hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I have always used natural hair care products</li>
            <li>I have used (which claim they could leave hair soft and non-static in winter time).  </li>
            <li>My hair becomes soft, silky and not frizzy at all.</li>
            <li>Really helped me maintain my hair color (white).</li>
            <li>Now if you like smelling like Crest Complete with Herbal mint toothpaste, then go ahead and buy this product.</li>
            <li>So far, using both set I have managed to get all the way to the bottom of both bottles without having to switch up.  </li>
            <li>so I began a search for an all natural alternative.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always searching for natural shampoos conditioners and hair products and found this.</li>
            <li>The natural conditioner is one of her favorites.</li>
            <li>The only con I can say is their isn&#x27;t a whole lot of product for the price.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it my hair feels so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo and conditioner set several times I can say that each time I feel my hair really silk.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this one actually rinsed out quite fast and</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of the shampoo and wish the conditioner had a similar scent.  </li>
            <li>My hair has not felt this soft in years.</li>
            <li>once so far.</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients are always a plus.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo and conditioner set because it is an all natural product containing no harmful ingredients, etc.</li>
            <li>hair has become really soft after using the product.smells</li>
            <li>It makes and keeps my hair soft and manageable all day.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t help, my hair took up as much oil as it could and then left it still brittle (and now also greasy).</li>
            <li>I have natural &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I bought this under my husband&#x27;s name so it is not the review of a guy, but is a review from his classy wife.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>, I was pleasantly surprised after using this product.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shine.</li>
            <li>I have naturally frizzy wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>We have eliminated using toxins and dangerous chemicals in our household and try to look for the most natural choice available in any product.</li>
            <li>Both the conditioner and shampoo smell like natural mint and</li>
            <li>I stay directly under sunlight every weekend because of my mountain hiking trips.</li>
            <li>After using the silk conditioner my hair was sooooo soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been one day, and I&#x27;m ready to commit like a love-crazed teenager.</li>
            <li>I TRY TO USED NATURAL AND ORGANIC PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I would still recommend to anyone that&#x27;s looking for an inexpensive natural shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>So I started hunting for a natural shampoo.  </li>
            <li>All natural and organic.</li>
            <li>Just after a couple of days of using these 2 products together my hair was immediately silkier and felt soft.</li>
            <li>I learned of Maple Holistics Degreaser shampoo after I bought this set, so I am really hoping to try that one next.</li>
            <li>I have very damaged hair from bleaching blonde.  </li>
            <li>As far as the conditioner goes I feel like my hair is a lot shinier and softer</li>
            <li>My highlighted hair is so soft and silky</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft but not over-conditioned.</li>
            <li>The set works well together and leaves hair soft and shiny and does not seem to leave a waxy build-up.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I unexpectedly had family at my house for a week and every one of them wanted to know where to get this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Nothing has ever made my hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is definitely lighter and compared to the Acure I have to use twice as much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft but not over-conditioned.</li>
            <li>The shampoo completely stripped my hair of all moisture, and no it wasn&#x27;t just product removal</li>
            <li>I works wonderfully for those that have thin, delicate or dyed hair because it hydrates so well.</li>
            <li>but after using both a few more times I now notice a big difference in the silkiness and softness in my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair feels extremely soft, and I can tell it looks healthier already, especially toward the bottom where I was experiencing the most trouble.</li>
            <li>whether thin or thick hair, this blend would be the best for your scalp&#x27;s needs!</li>
            <li>I am anxious to see how she likes it! :-)</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty dry</li>
            <li>I have oily hair so need something with a little suds to help wash out the oil and give me a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>They all suggested the same thing, get a new brand of shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>The shampoo has sort of a tingly feeling and seems to clean well without being too harsh.  </li>
            <li>Not that I&#x27;m recommending you do this because I see they also have a facial serum which I&#x27;m about to try as it&#x27;s actually for the face, hahahaha!  </li>
            <li>This really, really makes me feel it was definitely worth the price because these bottles will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li>I used them together, and it left my hair clean yet very soft and not weighed down!  </li>
            <li>Came about this brand when I was looking for a new shampoo as my old one was seriously killing my hair and the price for this set was pretty reasonable for natural products, so I gave a try.</li>
            <li>I can smell the vanilla all day long and it is very soothing.</li>
            <li>First time and it cleans my hair well, also, leaves my hair soft unlike other</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says; there is not much to it.</li>
            <li>When you blow dry, if you&#x27;re looking for volume, you&#x27;ll need to add another product as this will not produce large chemical like hair like the salon will.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>Tough to find when opting for more natural products.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling softer, more managable, and less tangled than with any other product I have used.</li>
            <li>Kathy lives in MD and I live in MA, so we have different types of water.  </li>
            <li>I am in my 40s with colored hair that is mid-length and &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; - not too dry or greasy, not stick straight nor curly.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend  this product for every day use, it seems to over dry  scalp when used every day but now knowing that  I use it 2 to 3 times a week and am very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maple Holistics worked much better for my thick, coarse, curly hair!  </li>
            <li>It left my hair looking shimmery and feeling soft with no frizziness!</li>
            <li>I am a little too obsessed with my hair and ever since losing it all with Lupus I take extremely good care of it (and myself!).</li>
            <li>After a week of using both the shampoo and conditioner, I noticed a major improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m thrilled that the conditioner is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t way my expensive curls down!  </li>
            <li>I have long naturally curly hair and it leaves my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>I let my hair air dry no product after using this shampoo conditioner and it dried quite nicely and minimal frizz.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but thick (lots of it).</li>
            <li>I would love it if it would leave a subtle hint of mint on my hair until my next shampoo.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy again -- but only as a set -- as I gave this a four out of five stars because the price is high.</li>
            <li>After seeing all of the positive reviews from other buyers, I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>and I have generally used high-end salon brands.</li>
            <li>This is gross smelling product that is clearly seasonal.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I will definitely be coming back for more and if you are looking for an all natural shampoo &amp; conditioner, I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Side note, you don&#x27;t have to use much of the shampoo to get your head lathered up, so this will last as long as my pert bottle that was twice the size.</li>
            <li>The conditioner has left my hair so soft my stylist can&#x27;t believe it, and it&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
            <li>This product is bringing my hair back naturally.</li>
            <li>Used it only once so far, and can already see the shine in the hair.</li>
            <li>My wife and I are big into all natural shampoo, soap, and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying again in the near future!</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair (that has a big problem with frizz in the summer), which I often style with heat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much money on shampoos and conditioners trying to find the miracle worker.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these products to anyone looking for an all natural solution that works well.</li>
            <li>I have been using natural shampoos/conditioners for awhile now and they always left a build up that required a weekly ACV rinse.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable and has its shine back!!  </li>
            <li>If you are trying to reduce the amount of chemicals used in the shower (soaps and such) then this is a natural progression.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently deep conditioning to get it back to normal.</li>
            <li>my kid like this better.hers is a dry hair but after this hair is very soft and silky.definitely recommend this product !</li>
            <li>Please MH, consider making this permanent and not limited edition!</li>
            <li>I have normal hair that gets really dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, color-treated hair, so not only do I need color protection and moisture, I also can&#x27;t have products that are too heavy or my hair gets weighed</li>
            <li>It lathered beautifully, much better than other organic type shampoos I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different NATURAL shampoos but they all left my hair feeling dry and dull, almost like I never even washed my hair.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my hair smooth without weighing it down, which has been an issue with other conditioners.</li>
            <li>I have extremely thick, but fine short hair</li>
            <li>But other than the way it smells and tingles on my scalp, it did&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much time and money researching for a great shampoo and conditioner, but I always get disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was nervous about the ingredients at first because there was not a full list of them on Amazon or the Maple Holistics website, but I took their word for it and purchased.</li>
            <li>The shampoo didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me as other reviewers have noted, but I did like it</li>
            <li>I read about Maple Holistics and decided to try the winter Blend because of other reviews and because the mint and eucalyptus sounded like it would be very soothing.  </li>
            <li>With my super thick hair I went through this stuff in no time, especially the conditioner which is not very thick.</li>
            <li>The shampoo put what felt like a gel-like substance feeling in my hair using only a quarter size like the instructions said, after letting my hair sit the recommended 3 minutes I couldn&#x27;t believe how squeeky clean my hair was (this was after I hadn&#x27;t used shampoo or conditioner in a little over half a week), so much so that I didn&#x27;t think I should even do it a second time contrary to their recommendations.</li>
            <li>I tried all sorts of natural remedies such as the vinegar, baking soda and water solution to coconut and tea tree oils and all kinds of &#x27;miracle shamoos&#x27; that simply did not work 100%.</li>
            <li>This did not dry my hair out at all</li>
            <li>This set leaves my hair squeaky, I mean squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>Good conditioner that helps my hair grow back without the old, bad things clinging to it.</li>
            <li>Shiny, Silky and soft hair all day long.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to go to the salon to dye my hair for the last time, back to my natural color and let it grow out.</li>
            <li>Throughout the day I sniffed my hair and could still smell the conditioner and my long hair still feels soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me it was because I had alot of product build up from silicone conditioners, it made my hair feel heavy and unplesant at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other natural shampoos before and they usually leave my hair feeling not quite as clean but this one didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>if it didn&#x27;t work for me it wouldn&#x27;t bee too much money down the drain.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s not really anything new.</li>
            <li>I can let air dry and it still feels soft.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair</li>
            <li>I bought this because everyone said it was amazing, and unfortunately it made my hair dry.</li>
            <li>Also, one of the things that I really didn&#x27;t like about my previous shampoos was that I can still see some flakes left in my hair after I washed it</li>
            <li>These Winter Blend products arrived at my house on the first day of spring (when it was still pretty chilly where I live), and I&#x27;ve been using them for a week now.</li>
            <li>Really silky hair which is usually dry and fuzzy due to over processing.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my scalp feeling clean and not the least bit dry.</li>

            <li> the shampoo and conditioner smells so good.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good.</li>
            <li> I was using John Frieda, and I thought it was good shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo feels nice on the scalp and the conditioner makes my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> A good hair care product</li>
            <li> A good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked this good.</li>
            <li> I like the products as they seems to do a good job for being holistic.</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner are of good quality.</li>
            <li> this is like a good vinyl album for those music junkies or a killer car engine for the car lovers.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good ingredients and the fact that mint wakes me up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> The reviews for these were good</li>
            <li> Good for the scalp.</li>
            <li> so I had a really good idea of how these worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled across this and saw some good reviews and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> It smells good,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of mint shampoo and conditioner, and this stuff hit it on the head.</li>

            <li> i never knew shampoo could be this good.</li>
            <li> It leaves a good feeling after drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Me and my daughters all use this and like the smell of both the shampoo and the conditioner and feel they both are good products at a good price.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, it ensures your hair smells really good for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loved it! :)</li>
            <li> It lathers rich and the conditioner is great!</li>
            <li> shampoo and am very happy to say &amp;#34;Wow was I wrong!&amp;#34; The first thing I loved was the scent of both the shampoo and the conditioner - amazing!</li>
            <li> I love the beautiful sent.</li>
            <li> I was super impressed with the smell and the lathering of the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo and Conditioner not only smell wonderful, but work great!</li>
            <li> if you want the best for your hair and not those cheap knock-offs somewhere else that pose as something that it&#x27;s not, then this is the product that you should buy! :))</li>
            <li> Shampoo lathers beautifully, it has almost like a gel-like texture, and the conditioner is very light but effective.</li>
            <li> so I am very pleased with what I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly it could use a better name, it sounds like a laundry product, lol</li>
            <li> Smells great and my hair stays healthy.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied, although they do not lather too well</li>

            <li> my hair is beautiful, full and shines!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, by far the best shampoo I have used.</li>
            <li> It says &amp;#34;winter blend&amp;#34; but it is very refreshing, really perfect for spring and summer, or after sports when I really want to refresh my scalp!  </li>
            <li> I love the way the shampoo makes my scalp feel!</li>
            <li> I love the winter blend!  </li>

            <li> and I love it!.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel and smell!</li>
            <li> Pleasant and not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very good at degreasing and afterwards the conditioner does a great job to make it soft again.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is also amazing.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s truly amazing the difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Amazing Combo.</li>
            <li> use a leave-in coconut conditioner after I use these in the shower and the smell/added moisture combined is amazing.</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner are amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is great,  but conditioner lacks the oils that make your hair smooth.</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely amazing, the mint extracts leave your hair and scalp smelling and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> all of it.&lt;br /&gt;Second, my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li> The Winter Blend shampoo and conditioner set also smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing</li>
            <li> the shine is amazing.  </li>
            <li> These two products are absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> They are AMAZING and</li>
            <li> The minty scent of shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner both have an amazing aroma that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  </li>
            <li> The Silk 18 smells and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Winter Blend with Silk Conditioner along with the Argan shampoo to rotate, and my hair looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is ok it smells great, but I am not in love with.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making this great product!</li>
            <li> I would (and have) recommend this shampoo &amp; conditioner to anyone who wants their hair to feel, look and smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely refreshing and smells really good.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner really is silky and also smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Kathy ordered the Winter Blend Shampoo and Silk 18 Conditioner and told me she really liked it.  </li>
            <li> Really, really liked it after two uses.  </li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner smell really nice and neither has an obnoxious or perfume like smell.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like these do a good job of not drying it out more.</li>
            <li> conditioner was quite nice too.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kind of disheartening whenever I pull the hair tie off and a lot of hair came off with it.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I will probably buy this forever.</li>
            <li> I have colored, curly hair that doesn&#x27;t play nice</li>
            <li> It does not bother her at all and on top of that it smells good and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> made my hair look and smell nice.</li>
            <li> Something that is really nice</li>
            <li> I really liked this shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li> The smell was nice, but that is where the cons end.  </li>
            <li> Really liked this stuff.</li>
            <li> ; Well it IS nice.</li>
            <li> Has a nice minty smell.</li>
            <li> My skin feels kind of tingly, or it sort of has that stimulated feeling like when you chew minty gum or when you just brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple of months and they work nicely.</li>
            <li> Kind of like its clarifying.</li>
            <li> I really liked the shampoo and conditioner blend.  </li>
            <li> I have joked with a friend that I should have a garage sale with all the hair products I own that I&#x27;ve used once or twice and never again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not expect them to reach out and be so courteous without being prompted.</li>
            <li> Gives that very thorough cleaning and leaves a wonderful scent on my hair.</li>
            <li> And had to get my own.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think my hair liked the results.</li>
            <li> I liked the feeling of my hair after using it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> When I was done rinsing off the conditioner my scalp felt renewed and kind of cold-hot and frosty.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely, cleans and rinses off well.</li>
            <li> Maple Holistics, you have my business for years to come unless you do like so many other wonderful companies - reformulate an already perfect product.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love the scent!!  </li>
            <li> Wonderful minty smell and leaves hair feeling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> The texture is perfect and you can tell that it is made with high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is the best ive used so far!!</li>
            <li> As a woman, I treasure my hair, this is very effective in clearing my hair from dirt and hair products, so I can sleep at night with a clean head of hair on me.</li>
            <li> The winter blend for being sulfate free, surprisingly had a nice lather to it.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner also has a great smell and is super creamy.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells amazing and goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> It smells very good too (very minty) and we will continue to use.  </li>
            <li> They offer free products for a good review - I feel like I was scammed out of the money.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she is very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Sure, the peppermint is nice, but I noticed no difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have used.  </li>
            <li> Wow, this is the best shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to find a natural shampoo that is safe to use and makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li> I thought these were fairly pricy but just had a keratin treatment and needed to purchase phosphate free prpducts.</li>
            <li> It is so nice treating my hair and scalp to healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> They are natural products which are great!</li>
            <li> I also liked the smell, which is often also off-putting in many organic/natural hair products.</li>
            <li> This is by far the very best!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny for beautiful healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent products and my hair has not looked this good for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner!  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product, my hair feels super light, free of chemical additives.</li>
            <li> And it came SUPER fast...which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free and uses good quality ingredients conducive to a healthier scalp.  </li>
            <li> I will update this review as I use the product more times but so far I am very happy with them and would recommend to everybody.</li>
            <li> This thing smells good and the mint is cool.</li>
            <li> Smells good, makes hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> I really liked this combination--you get really clean hair as well as a nice, light, and effective condition.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo and conditioner, my hair looks sleek and smooth and so much better than it has in years!</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for alternative sulfate free hair products, and I highly pleased with your products!</li>
            <li> and I can feel good about supporting products that don&#x27;t contribute to the eutrophication of our water systems!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the super cool sensation on the scalp!!!</li>
            <li> I see a huge difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell makes a mint Tea Tree shampoo ( same price) that is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The minty smell is refreshing.</li>
            <li> This shampoo would work best for a white girl with greasy hair.</li>
            <li> I just purchased 2 more bottles to give to my niece for Christmas.</li>
            <li> but I love mint</li>
            <li> Will buy more, for sure.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells lovely (I&#x27;m a fan of vanilla scents) and gives described results: silky hair.</li>
            <li> : all the shampoos should come as a combo set, with the conditioner, as it&#x27;s definitely a better deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be more inclined to purchase that option than the shampoo alone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results and plan on purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It was just ok.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this combo pack.  </li>
            <li> but I love these products and almost look forward to washing my hair, not one of my favorite activities.  </li>
            <li> Product as described and became a favorite of the family.</li>
            <li> But hey.... cruelty free!</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I will order from Maple Holistics again, just a better smelling product.</li>
            <li> I was worried that I would not be able to purchase Winter Blend in the summer</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so pleased to find it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Love the scene,</li>
            <li> Will try to update more on it.</li>
            <li> After using the products a couple of times, I noticed my hair had much more shine and body</li>
            <li> I love how both the shampoo and conditioner smell.</li>
            <li> Overall though, with the Silk 18, it seems to replace the dryness and smells wonderfully</li>
            <li> Since then, I have continued using this product and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I treated myself to these products and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I really love the Winter Blend Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love the winter mint and even use it now into spring as I love the minty freshness.</li>
            <li> This product has thoroughly conditioned my hair and it&#x27;s getting better each time I use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I love the way these smell.(Natural smelling mint blend.)</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t feel like the conditioner was just sitting on top my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not overpowering just lite and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It feels softer and is more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use I&#x27;ll see even more results.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it made it even drier and more unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> This cleans and conditions better than any brand I&#x27;ve tried (I tend to use better brands from Sephora).</li>
            <li> My hair is more manageable and looks like I just was at the salon.</li>
            <li> With most shampoos and conditioners, my scalp breaks out.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with their products.</li>
            <li> Better shampoo than most brands.</li>
            <li> I Love  that shampoo.</li>
            <li> That is my favorite as you can feel all the mints cooling your scalp as you use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using the winter blend for a couple weeks and love it.  </li>
            <li> The sheen, the brilliance, the smooth and silky hair, it&#x27;s just, amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe for colored hair.</li>
            <li> But love the timely shipping.</li>
            <li> I also found out that most organic shampoo and conditioners irritated my scalp.</li>
            <li> But, my scalp feels so much better.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it my first impression was how wonderful the scent of the shampoo was.  </li>
            <li> It is not a unnatural perfume scent you get with many shampoos, it smells minty.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because after showering I no longer smell that wonderful scent on my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m definitely glad I continued using this product.</li>
            <li> but I like the conditioner more than the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> These two bottles has undid most of the damage in just under two weeks.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love the scent.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I love this shampoo and conditioner, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li> Hairs feels much better after use.</li>
            <li> I trusted the reviews on this product and went for it - I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> I really love the winter blend shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed each Maple Holistics product that I&#x27;ve tried, and I also love how dedicated to customer service the company is.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought these products.</li>
            <li> I love them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked so healthy.</li>
            <li> Love both products.</li>
            <li> When received, opened and enjoyed the scent we chose to, instead, use it ourselves.</li>
            <li> I love the condition this leaves my hair in.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the winter blend shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love the way the mint flavor feels on my scalp.</li>
            <li> the winter blend is one of the most memorable bottles of hair care that i have used.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I Love Love</li>
            <li> Some conditioners make my hair static and untamed.  </li>
            <li> I had so many problems with scabbing, itching and flaking</li>
            <li> Oh and did I mention the cost for this magic in a bottle can be all yours for about just $12.</li>
            <li> feel I love.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smelling amazing and so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love these 2 products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many that work</li>
            <li> I really love the scent of both the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love these products and will continue to use the Maple Holistics products.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much product to get great results.</li>
            <li> it is so good, smells so great,  that you can bet I will order it again in the future.</li>
            <li> That being said, I love the way the conditioner makes my hair feel after I blowdry it.</li>
            <li> but I am able to let it continue to grow because of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> but it still works much better than the shampoo I used to use.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell of both the conditioner and shampoo</li>
            <li> and I love that the smell lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, smells good, and looks really good.</li>
            <li> I love it,  </li>
            <li> and we both really love the quality.  </li>
            <li> and I love them both.</li>
            <li> so when I went to order some more shampoo I saw this set and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> winter blend is such an awesome feeling on the head.</li>
            <li> better thank</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the shampoo and it cleans my hair well.</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients of both, would buy again.</li>
            <li> , I love this set.</li>
            <li> I like it, I don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and the shampoo and conditioner are both great, very minty feel on the scalp which is soothing for anytime not just winter in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I began by looking through the name-brands carried by many hair salons</li>
            <li> Trying the read the labels of most hair products brings flashbacks to organic chemistry class.  </li>
            <li> These labels are much more straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was expecting something more minty, cooling or refreshing</li>
            <li> I love that!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Who knew peppermint and vanilla would smell so lovely together.</li>
            <li> I love mint.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell of these products--the shampoo has a lovely minty scent and the conditioner smells like vanilla.</li>
            <li> Love the winter blend shampoo smells great and the conditioner really seems to help.</li>
            <li> I love the mint fragrance...</li>
            <li> It became softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells and makes my hair feel, will be purchasing more when mine runs out :)</li>
            <li> and I liked the idea of these products being sulfate free and all-natural.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a great minty fragrance, very invigorating for the winter.</li>
            <li> It has a nice lather despite being sulfate free.</li>
            <li> My hair is nice and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I have noticed more softness and strength in my hair</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It does stop the static electricity.</li>
            <li> The more I use it the better it gets.</li>
            <li> These products gave me that and more.</li>
            <li> you know what shampoo brand smells better than this one?</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Love the scent on both the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> absolutely love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> to continue using your products :)</li>
            <li> I would prefer the conditioner to be more creamy</li>
            <li> Secondly, it works great!</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this as I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Need a combo that is more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying from then again! :)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product do that, it also smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great product and Fast Shipping.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the conditioner and have ordered it alone</li>
            <li> so I thought the shampoo would be a favorite of mine as well.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is nice and smells great but doesn&#x27;t balance out the complete dryness wrought by the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This works perfectly with this blend, but I couldn&#x27;t ever stretch it an extra day with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter</li>
            <li> LOVE the scent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> The conditioner seems to make hair softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Anyways, it felt good, fresh and silky.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li> such a wonderful scent!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great and really lathers well.</li>
            <li> My hair felt silky and I am very happy with the initial results.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Maple Holistics shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Winter Blend about 4 times and it actually works the best on me.  </li>
            <li> It is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> so I like it being sulfate free!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this blend...</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> Vanilla Mint is a lovely smell. :)</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the conflicting reviews.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st no sulfates, no parabens, vegan-friendly, safe for color treated hair combo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying more Maple Holistics products.</li>
            <li> I love the conditioner, but the shampoo is just not for me.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo makes my hair feel like straw, I may need more of a hydrating shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Thanks great product</li>
            <li> and so glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already in love</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair soft, clean and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is nice, not as rich as the conditioner I am used to (which contains silicons), but richer than the silicone-free conditioner from V05.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo it literally leaves your hair squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and clean feel after use!</li>
            <li> This stuff was amazing right from the start!  </li>
            <li> However, the more I use it, the softer and more easily manageable my hair has become.</li>
            <li> Makes hair very clean</li>
            <li> The mint shampoo makes your hair very clean.</li>
            <li> It gets my hair very clean, though I do not use any product in it.</li>
            <li> and I would have to say this is one of the best shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve came across in a long time.</li>
            <li> but this shampoo did a pretty good job with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can now successfully mock the herbal essence commercials with execution thanks to Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> washes away all the impurities from my hair and establishes my good looks pretty well.</li>
            <li> After blow-drying, my hair was left feeling smooth and had a wonderful healthy shine.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great and has pleasant light minty scent; however, I have used many other conditioners better than this one.  </li>
            <li> The smell is really enjoyable, the shampoo works great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, nothing powerful, but just fresh.</li>
            <li> Most sulfate free shampoos are safe and don&#x27;t run my color.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is non-drying (thought it might be with the mint) and has a lovely lather (many sulfate free do not).</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free, and I love how it feels in my hair.</li>
            <li> my hair feels soft and looks great ant it has made my scalp feel so much better from</li>
            <li> I love it, and my daughter loved it so much when she smelled it on me that I had to order her a set as well.</li>
            <li> great products, keep up the natural work!</li>
            <li> I love the smell; it&#x27;s just refreshing and clean, unlike my home.</li>
            <li> my hair is really clean and feels nice and light.</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a pleasant scent from the vanilla and does a great job of smoothing out typically fuzzy hair.</li>
            <li> Very good price too compared to similar brands at health food stores.</li>
            <li> I also love that the shampoo is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use conditioner every day, but the Silk 18 was great so far.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fact that it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been happy with the repair to my hair that seems to be taking place.  </li>
            <li> This was my most favorite shampoo and conditioner to use, how it had my hair soft silky and smelling good, I could never find it in Walmart.</li>
            <li> A great shampoo and conditioner treatment for my and my family&#x27;s hair (We have sensitive scalps so...).</li>
            <li> Not anymore, will be purchasing more before the winter blend isn&#x27;t available.  </li>
            <li> Light and minty :)</li>
            <li> I have been using Sulfate free products for about a year and most have this issue.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good sulfate free shampoo and conditioner combo for a while, and when I first used this product I can say that my search is over.</li>
            <li> She said most of the store shampoos are filled with chemicals that strip the hair and waxes that continually build up.  </li>
            <li> I am happy so far with this product based on one use alone.</li>
            <li> It seemed to help smooth frizzy hair and it was safe for my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Most people get fabulous hair while pregnant....not this girl.  </li>
            <li> good for my hair, really like the blend maple holistics made for the hair.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth it for how nice they made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> My scalp stopped itching after the very first washing and the shampoo and the condition smell great and leave my scalp feeling fresh and Clean.  </li>
            <li> I can easily go three or four days without washing and still feel clean!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is super minty but not too intense and feels great on your scalp.</li>
            <li> All in all, my hair is left feeling clean and smooth but not waxy or oily, and smells great to boot!</li>
            <li> There is a very nice natural scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price for such good products!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I thought to myself I need to order more so that I never run out!</li>
            <li> I look for pure ingredients that offer clean fresh scents as well as making my hair feel healthy and look great.</li>
            <li> I loved it, left my hair feeling and smelling so amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the clean scent and my hair loves the conditioner.</li>
            <li> But since I moved out of town, I decided to look to Amazon for an easy way to obtain quality shampoo.</li>
            <li> And I love how well it rinses clean.</li>
            <li> I can get away with washing once every 3 days easily,</li>
            <li> The hair brushes out easy after washing.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair that tends to frizz easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt more clean and refreshed after getting out the shower before using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The winter blend does have a strong scent</li>
            <li> The smell is way too strong for me and has a musky or woodsy scent.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a nice peppermint scent and a soft warm vanilla conditioner.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit strong.</li>
            <li> Price were decent for combo and the smell was good.  </li>
            <li> first time I used them was when I bleached my hair, and the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft or smelled so amazing!  </li>
            <li> Normally you get good smelling shampoo when it goes on</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think I liked the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Cool, refreshing, but no guilt.</li>
            <li> Love the smell,tingles and hair was full and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> I had originally used a more well known, cheap shampoo and conditioner for years until I wanted to try a change.  </li>
            <li> This has a wonderful, bright crisp mint scent, but it&#x27;s also a little sweet.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this didn&#x27;t quite work for me.</li>
            <li> I like the peppermint smell along with the silky fine conditioner.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re pregnant, hold off on this until you have the baby. :-)</li>
            <li> Then, I happened to find this set and loved the natural ingredient list!  </li>
            <li> A very clean  but light sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I felt that it dried out my fine, curly hair, but the smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li> It smells great and gets my hair so nice and clean, without weighing it down or stripping it.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, I recommend this company because I am a huge animal lover, but not this Winter Blend hairpaste.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge change myself.</li>
            <li> HUGE MISTAKE.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, it smells amazing and leaves my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I started looking for sulfate and chemical free shampoos &amp; conditioners about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for something Sulfate Free after reading the reviews decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research in search of a sulfate free shampoo and decided on this combo set.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this set and gotta say thathe I have never had such a great customer service as at maple</li>
            <li> I am loving how this makes my hair feel and have noticed that it seems to be working really well for my family as well.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s important to me.</li>
            <li> It would be wonderful if they started making a Winter Blend Conditioner and sold both year round.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not some amazing shampoo and conditioner that I can really feel a difference with.</li>
            <li> really enjoy the Silk 18 conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the great product, I will definitely be buying your products from now on!</li>
            <li> My hair feels great after using this, esp especially in combo with the silk 18 conditioner.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair its smooth texture.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> It smelled great but left my hair oily</li>
            <li> so this review is not written lightly.  </li>
            <li> , I am fond of the conditioner and the way that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too smooth.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this products because of all the great reviews on it.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh feel the shampoo gives my scalp when applying.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because it was sulfate free and for the mint in the shampoo.</li>
            <li> purchase, I was worried that I&#x27;d smell like a candy cane, but that smell is fleeting -- great to open the sinuses in the shower, but then rinses away as you&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li> [Maple Holistics gave me a free bottle of conditioner as a reward for writing this review.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was sulfate free &amp; that&#x27;s what washes the color out.  </li>
            <li> This is FABULOUS shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I had another keratin treatment and decide to try a strore bought, cheaper sulfate free product.</li>
            <li> It seemed to contain great essential oils, but it did not do my hair justice.</li>
            <li> It is stronger, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> the shampoo feels like a clarifying one - leaves my hair feeling weightless and free of residue.</li>
            <li> they are fantastic .</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and I don&#x27;t have to use too much either.  </li>
            <li> There are no chemical free hair products here that work so well.</li>
            <li> This blend of shampoo and conditioner filled with mint has cleaned my hair of dandruff and my wife uses it to make her hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s very humid here, I found myself showering more and more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good natural, sulfate-free, shampoo and conditioner for a while.</li>
            <li> Will update if problems arise but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Sadly, so far, not so good.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural and the smell is nice</li>
            <li> I appreciate that this company does their hair research and uses good, natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not positive; however, what I can state is this product smells incredibly fresh and wonderful.</li>
            <li> thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> this is very useful for repairing damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Very fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair feeling clean, healthy and fresh.</li>
            <li> I was astonished when I rinsed it out and it felt like normal hair again, even better than before!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner smells wonderful, not overwhelming, and leaves hair light and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the shampoo is very light, minty and sudsy.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the tingling clean feeling while waiting the 2-3 minutes of allowing the shampoo to do its work on my scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair felt light and clean after I showered and the smell of the Mint oils woke me and my brain up.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy that I finally found a product that is natural and healthy for my hair!</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves our hair feel silky and smooth all day long!</li>
            <li> and so far works great on my hair (fine , straight, highlights).</li>
            <li> I was familiar with Silk 18 as my daughter uses this conditioner</li>
            <li> and so excited jumped in the shower and washed my hair and went to sleep.</li>
            <li> Okay, first thing to know about this product.</li>
            <li> This 2 in 1 keeps my head cool while keeping my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I love anything mint so decided to try these for the first time.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair with the shampoo, there was significant residue.  </li>
            <li> I delayed to write this review in order to get familiar with the product and how reliable it is.</li>
            <li> Hence, I am very satisfied with the shampoo and conditioner for what it does to my hair: makes them shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Well worth it to save lots of money by purchasing the set!</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying other products from this company and hope they are as good!</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, shinier, and had better body after first use.</li>
            <li> The price point is friendly and you get a lot of bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the mint - the smell, the tingle..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not picky with my shampoo as long as it smells great</li>
            <li> And the funny thing is, friends and coworkers noticed how healthy and shiny my hair is now.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> and I was really excited to try this out.</li>
            <li> very refreshing minty sense that leaves my hair (and scalp) feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> However, as a former hairdresser, I feel this would be a very good choice for somebody with coarser hair or somebody who wears their hair completely straight..</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave any build-up and my scalp and hair feel really clean.  </li>
            <li> It smells like glue and does not get my hair clean.</li>
            <li> This helps clean the grease.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a great product for all types of dry hair.</li>
            <li> They both smell yummy, my hair feels so clean and refreshed</li>
            <li> only they make her hair feel light, conditioned, and smelling good.  </li>
            <li> Hair is squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> This makes it feel clean but not overly stripped.</li>
            <li> Shampoo that makes my hair feeling and smelling clean.</li>
            <li> It is great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels squeaky clean with it.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so clean.</li>
            <li> smelled wonderful and left my hair soft.</li>
            <li> The mint shampoo also clean really well and top it off with Silk 18, your hair will feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair feeling clean and like hair.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s a matte looking clean.  </li>
            <li> Nothing gets my hair so CLEAN on my scalp and conditions</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp feel incredibly clean, and there is no build up whatsoever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a tree-hugger, either; I need something to clean and condition my hair.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair squeaky clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> The shampoo makes my hair feel clean without stripping it.</li>
            <li> After using the conditioner it left my hair smelling delicious and feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Most shampoos containing any kind of mint fragrance or ingredients are way to strong and that tingling sensation eventually turns to dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t require that the review to be positive, just sincere.</li>
            <li> I accidentally found this brand while searching for something else and decided based on the positive reviews to try this combo out seeing as how it&#x27;s winter and all. :-)</li>
            <li> Loving it so far!  </li>
            <li> This is my second purchase from Maple Holistics, the first set was the Winter Blend + Silk 18 which I loved but felt it caused a lot of static</li>
            <li> I also love that the price is pretty reasonable too compared to so many overpriced products out there.  </li>
            <li> Invigorating, cleansing and made my hair feel soft and healthy!</li>
            <li> This emulsifies easily and leaves a good feeling on my scalp and hair and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> it left my hair very clean and it smells amazing</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, so I don&#x27;t need anything too powerful.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is fine, but I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Cool feeling, clean head.</li>
            <li> have also ordered and used the winter special shampoo.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you they were all right!</li>
            <li> The shampoo really deep cleanses your hair with all the mint ingredients which give a good clean feel to the hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair and scalp feeling great, along with smelly very fresh, due to the mint and spearmint.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner consistently leave my hair and scalp feeling clean and moisturized, and my hair is now super-soft!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad shampoo, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> I love that these are sulfate free, natural products!!</li>
            <li> Makes your soft and smell amazing.</li>
            <li> I expected my hair looks great after using it for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> You have to give this a try if you&#x27;re curious, they work great together.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it to stars is it did feel and smell good.</li>
            <li> I have never used such good products.</li>
            <li> I suffer from frequent headaches and this provided a nice cooling feeling which aided in relief from the pain.</li>
            <li> My hair was very greasy and frizzy and it was time to switch to a better shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li> I like the cool mint feeling on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It smells sweet but not in an overpowering way.</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair feeling nice and soft though.  </li>
            <li> My momma always told me to keep my head cool.</li>
            <li> I like the minty smell and cool feel.</li>
            <li> Smells cool and minty.</li>
            <li> Feels cool and minty on the scalp.</li>
            <li> The cool feeling is a plus</li>
            <li> They not only smell good, but the consistency of the products and they way</li>
            <li> It gives my head that cool feeling when applied.</li>
            <li> My ABSOLUTE favorite is the Silk 18.  </li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner, it really helps my scalp even in the summer</li>
            <li> The winter blend seems to work just as well, but with a refreshing minty smell I really like.  </li>
            <li> The winter duo is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> Well, it seems than finally I found a good quality hair products.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does not tingle all that much for me, but I can smell the mint, which is refreshing.  </li>
            <li> The whole family uses it and we are all satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> These have a very aromatherapeutic, refreshing mint scent.</li>
            <li> I have now used the Maple Holistics Winter Blend Shampoo and Conditioner set for a full week.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Was kind of unsure of buying this set but was blown away at how soft it made my damaged hair feel...</li>
            <li> I left it on for a good 10 mins and then rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> and I definitely recommend this product for those winter scent lover out there or for anyone who just want a good shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My one problem is with the vanilla scent, to me it smells like a combination of vanilla, flowers, and a sickly sweet perfume.</li>
            <li> Both bottles were full to the brim with the products - no rip off there.</li>
            <li> Finally, they smell really good.</li>
            <li> The shampoo keeps my scalp cool, while the conditioner makes my hair, severely treated with colors and hair products, feel smoother, not greasy  and nicer altogether.</li>
            <li> it really works :)</li>
            <li> To make this review concise: I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with the Silk18 Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love them, they leave my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> This one seems light but still gives just the right moisture for me.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how gentle these are, and they are sulfate free - these would be great for people who exercise often and have to wash hair a lot, but don&#x27;t want to damage hair with too much shampooing.  </li>
            <li> The mint varieties really lend a large part in the amazing feeling this leaves on my scalp and the scent is truly cooling.</li>
            <li> I probably wash my hair way too much, but have very strong hot flashes where I end up drenched, so always feel the need to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> I want to try other products from Maple Holistics, but I am going to stick with this one since I&#x27;m so happy with it.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s nice that the product is holistic and environmentally friendly, I know there are other products out there which perform much better, but still qualify for those descriptions.</li>
            <li> Other than that, great smell and product.</li>
            <li> The minty smell is great, and I find, especially if I lather, rinse and repeat, my hair has that squeaky clean feeling, and definitely feels like it has more body and shine.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t at the top like most products but it was still present.</li>
            <li> The smell is sensational and left my scalp tingly.</li>
            <li> I currently use Aveda rosemary mint shampoo and conditioner, but wanted to try something sulfate free (honestly, I used it for the smell).  </li>
            <li> but once it dries, it quickly subsides so do not be concerned about that.</li>
            <li> The smell when dry is pleasant but not over whelming.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> When I began using this set, I quickly noticed a change in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Super bummed about this</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if your looking for a healthy alternative to chemical laden shampoos/conditioners.</li>
            <li> This is the first sulfate free shampoo that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with fairly curly hair and most products make my hair coarse and &#x27;poofy&#x27; instead of soft and relaxed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews for most products that I order.</li>
            <li> The silk conditioner leaves my hair pretty smooth and easier to comb but not greasy</li>
            <li> Sweetly minty fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Both products leave my hair feeling clean, soft, and moisturized and I feel better knowing it has no carcinogenic or animal ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thinning hair and every time I shampoo my hair immediately feels thicker and as soon as I apply the conditioner my hair is silky soft.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite brand.</li>
            <li> BUT...I had my new shampoo that promised me a refreshing minty scent, and a tingly scalp (I&#x27;ll take tingly anywhere these days).</li>
            <li> I am going to give Silk 18 a try as I see that people with dry hair have good experiences with it.</li>
            <li> Maybe good for dry hair.</li>
            <li> It is soft, clean, and LIGHT which is incredibly important considering the length of my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really made my hair shiny(!!)</li>
            <li> I will be definitely be looking into more of these products!</li>
            <li> Some organic and all-natural shampoos leave my hair feeling coarse and dry, but this did an excellent job with moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair and this combination of shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> This is the first &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; shampoo I&#x27;ve tried that lathered and made my hair feel truly clean...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been very particular about my hair products - Always sulfate/paraben free.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fairly fine, shoulder length and straight.</li>
            <li> With many shampoos my hair is left so fine that it floats with the slightest breeze.</li>
            <li> I also tried it because the scents of mint &amp; eucalyptus helps to calm my migraines at times.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair VERY shiny, light and bouncy.</li>
            <li> My have greasy scalp but dry hair, the shampoo does a great job getting the oil and grease out of my scalp leaves my hair feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Both shampoo and conditioner  are very fragrant which is also a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> After years of highlighting, straightening, and curling, I was looking for a gentle sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to help my hair feel silky and look smooth.</li>
            <li> I feel better about using this natural product as well.</li>
            <li> (I have naturally curly hair that has a mind of its own) and looks so much healthier.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo has a great tingle and clears up gross scalp buildup, and the conditioner made my hair salon soft.</li>
            <li> and I love how soft it makes her hair</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m enjoying this blend.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and looks better than it ever has.</li>
            <li> months.i also love the fact that it contains natural ingredients</li>
            <li> but this could be that it&#x27;s adjusting to the more natural ingredients and will normalize once again.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> As a result, my scalp began producing more natural oils to combat me washing the oil away...</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way my hair feels silky soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> It has a refreshing and uplifting mint fragrance, and feels soft and silky when you lather it into your hair.</li>
            <li> The icing on the cake is that it is natural and with out all the chemicals that plague so many hair products on the market.  </li>
            <li> Yes, you will smell like spearmint fresh out of the shower</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to be effective so the bottles will last awhile.</li>
            <li> are on the more natural end of the spectrum.</li>
            <li> I  like the fresh mint smell which is not over bearing</li>
            <li> Many of the ones I have tried have shorter ingredient lists or easily identifiable ingredients</li>
            <li> They are safe, natural and they work wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells minty and fresh.</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW SOFT, MANAGEABLE AND SILKY MY HAIR IS AFTER USING IT.</li>
            <li> Love the product so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*This is NOT a sponsored post, I have purchased these on my own, with my personal funds.</li>
            <li> , it just seemed my hair was kind of tangled initially after rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a nice tingly effect, especially while leaving it in for 2-3 min as recommended.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make the change to a more natural and sulfate-free shampoo</li>
            <li> Definitely worth investing into.</li>
            <li> The scent is fairly powerful in the bottle but a suggestion once used in the hair.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again, and think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Dime-sized shampoo is all I needed to clean my hair, and I feel very comfortable with only washing my hair once a week.  </li>
            <li> This is great for say, a once a week deep clean if you use a lot of hair products, but I found it to be too much for frequent use.</li>
            <li> This was the best money I spent for my hair, I have really dry and damaged hair from dying and straightening and this helped my hair feel so much more healthy and my scalp didn&#x27;t feel as dry!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results, and now that the dry winter is over</li>
            <li> However, the salon treatments didn&#x27;t last, so I&#x27;ve been looking for a good shampoo and conditioner that would leave my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It is natural and real, I too am a natural women and we all deserve this much help to feel beautiful.</li>
            <li> This product smells so good &amp; makes my hair feel clean and health, I suggest it if you don&#x27;t want harsh chemicals in your hair or on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this shampoo without conditioner though, because it strips my hair of all the natural oils also - like I said, very clean.</li>
            <li> Other wise it would be a 5</li>
            <li> The minty smell is lovely, the feeling is a light but not overwhelming refreshing sensation.</li>
            <li> but I found that many of them had the exact same ingredients as my cheap shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo- works good, smells good but does dry up your hair a little</li>
            <li> right after rinsing</li>
            <li> We received this product and my daughter used it right away.  </li>
            <li> It may not work for you right away.</li>
            <li> There seemed to be improvement right away.</li>
            <li> Right after I used the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Everything is all right with this shampoo and conditioner pack.</li>
            <li> Maple Holistics gets it right with this product.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I will buy this particular combo again when it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I have fairly normal hair and my hair is doing just fine with this.</li>
            <li> These products made my dry ends even dryer and more brittle!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leave my hair super soft or smooth.  </li>
            <li> As for the condition I love it, my hair is less tangled after using it and it gives my hair so much more body.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a nice smell and keeps my hair very clean much longer than previous shampoos I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> It has a great smell but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> very drying, my hair was full of statics, and I don&#x27;t even blow-dry it.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair smell minty and nice all day long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding something that is good for my hair and leaves it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> My roots on the other hand are nice and soft, and I love the scent. .</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase again!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend - worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, makes your scalp tingle and makes your hair feel so clean yet soft at the same time!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is really gentle and has no harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> The conditioner left my hair feeling soft and seems to give it good volume.</li>
            <li> I am so glad someone has finally made a product worth every penny</li>
            <li> The products arrived quickly, and I appreciated the tracking update e-mail, also.</li>
            <li> this particular shampoo gets your hair squeaky clean...</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast..</li>
            <li> Very much a Spearmint odor to that</li>
            <li> With all the color and chlorine in my hair, it&#x27;s amazing how these two little bottles could clean up and maintain my hair&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine, too early to tell.</li>
            <li> and so far I like it fine.  </li>
            <li> My hair now has a lovely shine and isn&#x27;t getting greasy super fast, and when it does, it doesn&#x27;t feel or look really gross!</li>
            <li> I have been using this since two months ago because this is really soothing and relaxing, and it really keeps my hair clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of peppermint oil because it has helped clear my jaw acne (I put a dab on my jaw every night after washing my face)</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d like the smell of vanilla in my hair, but I find I really do like it!</li>
            <li> different price and better.......</li>
            <li> I am pretty picky.</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been purchasing products that are natural and organic, so I was intrigued when I stumbled upon this brand - so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> My hair has also become so much more thicker since I started using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I never tried this product before, but the reviews I read Iam willing to try it, since my hair is limp.no volume and lack of body, I have tried alot of products that claim they volumize your hair and they dont.</li>
            <li> Enjoy supporting products that are made out of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> From the first use, my hair was noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> but it does work very well!  </li>
            <li> I used just the shampoo as it didn&#x27;t come with the conditioner the first purchase and it made a heck of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Thanks MapleHolistics!</li>
            <li> After receiving the Winter Blend set, I eagerly awaited my next hair appointment to get the latest verdict.</li>
            <li> My hair was back healthy again.</li>
            <li> I noticed that normal store shampoos/conditioner made my hair far more dry/frizzy.</li>
            <li> but I have to say that they really work!</li>
            <li> This was the first product I have tried from mapleholistic, but I have also purchased the silk18 conditioner.</li>
            <li> Both products leave our hair soft, shiny and tangle free.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much in order to do the trick!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better now, I wish I could&#x27;ve known about this  earlier.</li>
            <li> But, this is definitely better than a lot of traditional shampoo and conditioners that are on the shelves at target, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought it, and after the first shampoo/conditioner session I saw a difference.</li>
            <li> If you cleanse daily or more than once a day, your hair won&#x27;t feel brittle.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different sulfate free shampoos--I have found my keeper!  </li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant about the mint-</li>
            <li> At first I used Silk 18.  </li>
            <li> Now, my hair feels light and soft.  </li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve purchased this item because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> It is the first time I haven&#x27;t had tangles after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I love this dynamic duo!  </li>
            <li> I get lots of lather with the shampoo, and the conditioner really moisturizes my hair well!  </li>
            <li> I actually use it in the summer but will also love it in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I will be back for more...</li>
            <li> Upon first using them, I have to say...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s August in Memphis, which equates to hot as hell, yet there&#x27;s snow on my shoulders.</li>
            <li> The mint shampoo is very refreshing with a smell that is multi-layered and deeper than the average mint scent.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I plan to order more products from Maple Holistics in the future!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this product was the smell.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo and conditioner for the first time, my hair already felt muck silkier than ever before.</li>
            <li> and I will most likely buy it again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I feel like I should put it in Hot Chocolate and drink it (don&#x27;t do that).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll most definitely keep using the Silk 18 when this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is really helping with the dryness of my hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, fragile and gets super greasy in just a days time if I don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li> I leave it on my hair just a bit longer than necessary to enjoy the scent!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time for me to purchase a set, simply because the container is cute.</li>
            <li> Thanks Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> and now it actually looks and feels so much better not frizzy at all....</li>
            <li> The whole package!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the shampoo itself left my hair feeling</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it in the UK, but I gladly pay the international postage.</li>
            <li> BUUUUT, with this 2 pack im able to last 4 days without washing my hair.   </li>
            <li> It does exactly what is says</li>
            <li> The first time I used the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> The conditioner does not get much use from me but it is useful too.</li>
            <li> but I already felt the difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> Since I just had a baby I can say that if I had tried to use this conditioner in my first trimester (when you have the nose of a werewolf) there is no way I could have handled it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing from you guys again soon:)</li>
            <li> will come back after a month with a better review</li>
            <li> Amazing, have been struggling with goopy dry hair and have tried many shampoos, this really made a difference finally.</li>
            <li> Yes this product does have a long ingredient list and some of the ingredients have a low toxicity rating on EWG but it certainly has gentler ingredients and more plant-based ingredients than most of the hair/beauty products out there (no sulfates, no parabens, no artificial scent).</li>
            <li> I have previously tried it and liked it but thought it wasn&#x27;t enough to detangle my very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I was right about not having to use a lot of product, all I really need is about a tablespoon.</li>
            <li> Not only is the smell amazing, but I leaves my hair feeling so incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> The shampoo cleans well with a very small amount of product, plus it smells great.</li>
            <li> Lathers up nicely just like any other shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does have a nice fresh scent, but I found it a little drying.  </li>
            <li> I have tried my fair share of natural conditioners, and a lot of them just leave my hair super tangled and super hard to comb through.</li>
            <li> My hair felt a lot more clean than it typically does after using this.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so clean and soft after using this.</li>
            <li> Now, it feels clean, soft, and silky.</li>
            <li> After my first use my hair is soft and full of body.  </li>
            <li> I have tried almost every brand of hair care products carried by Whole Foods and Sprouts in search of something safe and that actually works.</li>
            <li> my hair is smooth, silky soft and very shiny.  </li>
            <li> On top of that its full volume these have no chemicals weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my hair felt soft or anything special after using.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try because of all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have very damaged dry hair, have been using these for 2 weeks, and while I didn&#x27;t see yet any apparent improvement it does maintain my hair pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, VERY fine, straight hair, which I perm once a year for body and curl.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a sulfate free shampoo that is healthy for colored hair (I currently have blue hair</li>
            <li> Smell is good and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried soo many natural brands over the last 8 years: Aubrey Organics (Rose Hip line), Acure (Moroccan Argan Stem Cell + Argan Oil line), Alaffia Dry Coconut line, Pure peppermint soaps,</li>
            <li> Most of the main ingredients are coconut derivatives and the scent comes from 100% mint essential oils.</li>
            <li> It has a nice lather and the conditioner didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> The Maple Holistics set left my hair feeling soft, shiny and it was very easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> Bought it to try it out, the minty smell is pretty nice but maybe a little too minty.</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick and coarse and I love how smooth it makes my hair look and feel:)</li>
            <li> I have very dry winter scalp and the Winter Blend Shampoo is refreshing and invigorating while the Silk 18 leaves my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something different than just buying the sulfate free shampoo sold by Brazilian Blowout or other popular brand name.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair soft and shinier than before, it doesn&#x27;t make it feel super silky</li>
            <li> Most said my hair was dry, brittle, and littered with split ends.</li>
            <li> Our hair is super soft.  </li>
            <li> He is very particular about shampoo but he loves this.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product and keeps my hair soft even in the dead of winter!</li>
            <li> i have dry frizzy hair &amp;tried so many products.</li>
            <li> During the winter months my hair tends to be dry and it sheds more.</li>
            <li> My hair has felt more dry and lost its sheen.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely dry, and brittle, I am pleased with there product.</li>
            <li> Sure I bought this product in Summer, but I rarely turn down any peppermint themed</li>
            <li> Sulfate-free products are purely market-driven to get consumers to purchase the product.</li>
            <li> This Winter Blend set is a smart purchase.  </li>
            <li> I have added a large rubber band around one of the bottles</li>
            <li> I have fine thin, permanently colored hair, and it has never felt or looked better!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good shampoo and conditioner for my fine, dry, limp hair.  </li>
            <li> After getting my hair done with several different beauticians, the comments were obviously true; I no longer had healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the effects after a few more uses!</li>
            <li> I have very wavy almost curly hair that is fairly coarse and gets tangled easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more &#x27;natural&#x27; shampoo, but have struggled to find one that has the right consistency for my long hair.</li>
            <li> Price is very high though.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t certain if winter blends really made a noticeable difference or change in my hair texture.</li>
            <li> I need to use more than directed for my hair to feel clean and the bottles are so small</li>
            <li> meaning I could potentially get away with walking out the door and not doing anything else to it (no ponytail), which is HUGE for me.  </li>
            <li> my hair is really clean and feels so light, like when I leave the salon (because your hair stylist will always use less product than you do at home).</li>
            <li> Thanks for providing us with such a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells like vanilla and works really well too.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be purchasing from this company again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the price though.</li>
            <li> I picked the package up and the whole car ride home</li>
            <li> Thanks soooooo much.</li>
            <li> I recently was given this as a gift and love it.shampoo made my hair soft as i have very damaged hair from being over processed.the conditioner made my hair managable.i will be purchasing again...</li>
            <li> I am very upset with this product.</li>
            <li> I maybe using too much, so I am going to give it some time.  </li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much for a hair product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very minty, smells like a spa.</li>
            <li> For a while now, I have been looking for a shampoo/conditioner that meets the highest ethical standards and does well with my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I used a tad too much.</li>
            <li> and it looks so much healthier</li>
            <li> Really fantastic product, I just wish they made larger sizes.</li>
            <li> It also smells very refreshing but not overwhelmingly minty.</li>
            <li> I also really like the way my hair feel safer shampoo and conditioner use.  </li>
            <li> really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, I like it so much I bought a backup for my gym bag.</li>
            <li> Really appreciate this wholesome product.</li>
            <li> FOR REAL.</li>
            <li> The conditioner really straightens my hair.</li>
            <li> really helpful</li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer and easier to brush with the combination of these two products.</li>
            <li> The conditioner didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; at all.  </li>
            <li> i really like these two things.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t like the smell all that much.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is very moisturizing AND it detangles.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny and the mint really helps my scalp.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much .</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very out of control and</li>
            <li> You know, where the shampoo seemed pretty good for the first use but subsequently makes your hair heavy or</li>
            <li> i would definetly recommend this duo to anyone who wants to see immediate change in just one use.</li>
            <li> My hair has so much shine and body...</li>
            <li> Recommend for those with shorter hair, or that don&#x27;t use that much.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizes hair.</li>
            <li> /reviewers so it really depends on the person &amp; type of hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this set</li>
            <li> After a few more applications, I will decide if I will use this as my daily shampoo, or as more of a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t moisturize nearly as much as Purology Hydrate or Joico Moisture Recovery.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo in this set really does leave the hair &amp;#34;squeaky clean,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The conditioner is also very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent lots finding something I really love.</li>
            <li> However, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> and this product didn&#x27;t really help with the frizz.</li>
            <li> it feels much softer to the touch w/</li>
            <li> I would also recommend the winter blend shampoo to people with a greasy scalp, it cleanses and degreases the scalp very well.</li>
            <li> and so I really like this in a shampoo.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s straight as well.</li>
            <li> After doing research on these, I would really like to try them to fix the damage I have done.</li>
            <li> (my hair is normally very oily).</li>
            <li> They have absolutely transformed my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work on my aging hair.  </li>
            <li> and I really can&#x60;t use anything else anymore.</li>
            <li> I actually just used it and my hair is extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo combo.</li>
            <li> I did think from some of the reviews that it would help with my dandruff, however it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My hair is very finicky when it comes to shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the cheap $3 shampoos and conditioners in the big bottles that you have to use A TON of in order to get it to lather.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m used to conditioners that don&#x27;t spread very well at all, but</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was not really needing this but after seeing the effects, I am glad I purchased this</li>
            <li> I really want to like this.</li>
            <li> It is even better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioners have made my hair so much silkier and smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d call it a clarifying shampoo, really.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Both are very aromatic without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I am on day 3 now and my hair still feels very clean!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am finding the shampoo to be great for my thick, naturally curly colored hair.  </li>
            <li> They must have spilled an actual nice smelling shampoo next to it and it leaked on my winterfresh box.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is extremely sensitive to a lot of different ingredients and many can give her allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> Kind of dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> Left it soft and the mint smell was wonderful-even better smelling mint.  </li>
            <li> No more :) I waited a full month to see how this would transform my hair</li>
            <li> didnt really work for my thick hair but smells good</li>
            <li> Coming across products that actually work as promised is very rare nowadays, let alone products that are &amp;#34;unbranded&amp;#34; so to speak.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, coarse hair that I curl and flat iron too much, leaving it kind of frizzy and fried looking a lot of the time.  </li>
            <li> My two wishes for this product: it was also available in 16 oz (or other larger size) and it was more affordable.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend uses the conditioner and she stated that it is super light and doesn&#x27;t weigh her hair down.</li>
            <li> However, with this the next day it is not greasy at all and still smooth, and it looks clean as though it was washed the same day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I had a shorter haircut and notice that my hair didn&#x27;t fall out as much but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was due to the cut or products or combination of both.  </li>
            <li> A vibrant, fresh scent with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> The smell of the conditioner is a little overwhelming at first.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m able to wash every other day.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d love to try out other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I absolutely LOVE this set!</li>
            <li> I would love to try other shampoos, too, but you cannot pry my hands off of the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I love it and can&#x27;t wait to try other products.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li> (I problem I&#x27;ve had with most other shampoos).</li>
            <li> All in all its a great product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is much better than my other shampoos in keeping my hair silky.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d like to try other shampoos to see if there is something better for me.</li>
            <li> but I agree with other reviewers that it&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li> I learned that I can only use the shampoo about twice a month because I literally leaves my hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> It left my scalp so clean and refreshed--I had an ahhh feeling.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hair felt so clean.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner have a wonderful soft smell which I appreciate, I hate being enveloped in strong smells.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, highlighted hair &amp; dandruff.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and smooth after using the conditioner, really did feel &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; and definitely not dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry lengths which I haven&#x27;t cut in years, and was pleased to see the conditioner makes them very soft.</li>
            <li> and I have a super sensitive eczema skin, so I am all about natural products.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very minty and maybe a touch too strong for me as I&#x27;m not much of a mint person</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this as long as its available.</li>
            <li> Suitable for everyday use as well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have to use my serum that I&#x27;d normally use after washing, but I still prefer to.</li>
            <li> the use a small amount of conditioner because no matter how nice my hair is, it tangles at the ends.</li>
            <li> My first use and my hair felt so soft.</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time, I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This is my first natural shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> the flakes practically disappeared and my scalp was left feeling cool and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Most shampoos and conditioners weigh down my hair and make it look crunchy when combined with styling product.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner alleviates static cling (flyaway hair) and adds body and volume without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Love this combo, i have less hair falling out using this.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner for my dry scalp, chemically and colored treated hair when I came upon the Maple Holistics Wintery Blend shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> particular product didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a fan of this shampoo/conditioner and Silk 18 conditioner that I can&#x27;t sing its praises enough :-)  </li>
            <li> Particularly, the mint and peppermint.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this products because it made my coarse hair soft,and silky and well moisturized especially in this winter</li>
            <li> I have had numerous compliments on how soft and moisturized my hair feels - and I really enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> The minty smell is mild, and this works the same as</li>
            <li> For me in particular, it did not act as a &amp;#34;detangler&amp;#34; once out of the shower</li>
            <li> The curls looked decent but again I didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo with a mint fragrance that wouldn&#x27;t wash out my red hair color so quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I believe this is the conditioner&#x27;s work - particularly the argan oil in it.</li>
            <li> I have to switch brands often due to my hair becoming oily and the product build up.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing and they both left my long curly hair feeling so soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> ; Conditioner is amazing; I have long hair and it lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> My hair is curly with lots of frizz and can get very dry if I don&#x27;t use the right products, so I chose maple holistics based on the average reviews and the fact that these products are sulfate free!&lt;br /&gt;After using the shampoo, my hair felt very clean!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Clearly high quality stuff.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Maple Holistics Winter Blend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying the Maple Holistics line of products.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> The product lasted as long spas other products, I was very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Second the fact that I needed so little product to make my flat, pin straight, blah hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li> Again I can not stress enough about removing the build up on you hair first!</li>
            <li> Also, they both smell lovely, and I like how the shampoo gives a little bit of a tingling feeling on my scalp.</li>
            <li> It worked well, but I didn&#x27;t love the fragrance (vanilla, a little musky).</li>
            <li> I needed to use a little more than I would my normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend the dead sea mud mask and the silk 18 conditioner works just as well and has a lovely vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> This product is natural and gentle.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling very silky and soft.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use a natural product I get a very itchy scalp and flaky scalp.  </li>
            <li> My son, 8 years old, likes the scents and it is so gentle on his eyes.</li>
            <li> You might laugh, but I think that not only type of hair, but also water supply affects products.  </li>
            <li> My scalp felt better in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Overall, Worth a try.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that makes my hair feel healthy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tingly and fresh blend of mints (especially helpful during colds...opens up the sinuses and relieves headaches)</li>
            <li> My hair stays with fresh minty smell even at the 2nd day</li>
            <li> to fall out normally.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner helped make my hair which felt bristly and harsh develop a better texture.</li>
            <li> Still lots of curls - just not the tangled knots that I normally get.</li>
            <li> My hair type is normal to oily.</li>
            <li> I recieved this combo last christmas from my mother , she has always liked the quality of the maple holistics line , I have very dry limp hair , the shampoo made my hair feel very clean and the conditioner made my hair extremely soft and managable</li>
            <li> I have pin straight and very fine strands, but thick hair</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a safe alternative, and checked every single ingredient.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty healthy hair (straight long black hair), but my scalp gets a bit itchy</li>
            <li> However, I was looking for a shampoo to help with my thick, frizzy, fly away hair in a particularly dry, winter climate</li>
            <li> I have dry, wavy and frizzy asian hair, and it bothered me for so many years.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair super soft after 1 use only!!!</li>
            <li> I often treat my hair with hair oils, and the shampoo was strong enough to properly wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve contacted customer service, described everything which I was not happy with and the very next day I got the full refund and on top of that they have recommended me another products of theirs which were shipped to me immediately!</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m alternating using the winter blend with the tea tree oil shampoo (also from Maple Holistics) to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> Not strong but prominent.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find a scent that is also appealing to men.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathered extremely well despite being sulfate free.</li>
            <li> My husband and three little boys also use it and they love the way it smells and their hair is so so soft.</li>
            <li> I loved the soft minty scent of the shampoo, but it was a little drying for my already dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to trying a new product from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> Definitely my new shampoo and conditioner choice</li>
            <li> My new shampoo and conditioner for life</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, no itch, smells cold and very minty.</li>
            <li> This was cheap and this is really something that helps me in my everyday toils with wax on my hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo isnt too harsh and I love the natural tingle from the mint.</li>
            <li> I get a dry scalp and hair SO quickly.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference as I had long straight hair and my hair cont.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You might also think you don&#x27;t get very much since it is only 8oz.</li>
            <li> A very natural and soothing shampoo and conditioner for my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair very soft, takes out the knots, and feel like it did when I was in my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It makes you hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Hair is very soft - and - no sulfites.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and both products were properly sealed.</li>
            <li> My scalp is usually tight, itchy, and flakes fairly easily.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> But, as for the conditioner... it is a gift crafted and sent to me from God himself just in time for this unexpected winter too!</li>
            <li> This was helpful to me at first because I was used to lots of soap suds from regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> After just one use my hair looked healthier and was no longer a grease pit by early afternoon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the shampoo and conditioner a few times but so far I&#x27;m really loving both.  </li>
            <li> This product made her hair feel soft with no frizz, and her curls bounced!  </li>
            <li> Smells and feels just like another big name brand shampoo starting with a c and ends with an r (I think it&#x27;s pretty clear), but it makes my hair smooth and not coarse.</li>
            <li> I am now able to wash my hair every other day if I prep my hair with a bit of baby shower the morning of the second day.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I thought the only logical explanation could be psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, and usually the conditioner makes my hair</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft, looked shiny, and smelled like minty vanilla!</li>
            <li> First off, my strands of hair actually felt cleaner.  </li>
            <li> After the first wash I definitely noticed a difference as my hair was softer and shinier.  </li>
            <li> Also made my hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cool on the head and is everything I&#x27;ve ever expected from a shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li> However, the shampoo is a little strong on the peppermit.</li>
            <li> The scent on the conditioner is a little strong for my taste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos and conditioners and haven&#x27;t found one that really right for my curly/frizzy, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> but these kept my hair cool enough for me not to get irritated enough to shout at my employees.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the 5-mint blend in the shampoo, only wish it was a little stronger as I suffer from a pretty itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> It did leave my hair feeling a little on the dry side, which is where the silk conditioner comes in handy.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a small amount, the shampoo lathers nicely and leaves hair feeling squeaky clean (unlike other natural products I have tried) and the conditioner leaves hair unbelievably soft and comb-able.  </li>
            <li> bit.&lt;br /&gt;Silk18 conditioner- works really well, left my hair very soft</li>
            <li> Makes hair silky and is richly conditioning but does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Will certainly order this pack from here in the nearest future</li>
            <li> I can not say better words about this set of shampoo, they are small, I know, but compare to regular shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;ve used before, you only need to use about 1/2-1/3 of regular amount per time, and you get rich foam</li>
            <li> Just average hair and this product didn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
            <li> and I had nothing else in the bath - Wow, really soothing and now using daily</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much in the way of scent but was pleasantly surprised to be greeted with a smell reminiscent of cupcakes.</li>
            <li> Overall it works well to clean my hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have always used natural hair care products</li>
            <li> I have used (which claim they could leave hair soft and non-static in winter time).  </li>
            <li> My hair becomes soft, silky and not frizzy at all.</li>
            <li> Really helped me maintain my hair color (white).</li>
            <li> Now if you like smelling like Crest Complete with Herbal mint toothpaste, then go ahead and buy this product.</li>
            <li> So far, using both set I have managed to get all the way to the bottom of both bottles without having to switch up.  </li>
            <li> so I began a search for an all natural alternative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always searching for natural shampoos conditioners and hair products and found this.</li>
            <li> The natural conditioner is one of her favorites.</li>
            <li> The only con I can say is their isn&#x27;t a whole lot of product for the price.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it my hair feels so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo and conditioner set several times I can say that each time I feel my hair really silk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this one actually rinsed out quite fast and</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of the shampoo and wish the conditioner had a similar scent.  </li>
            <li> My hair has not felt this soft in years.</li>
            <li> once so far.</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients are always a plus.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner set because it is an all natural product containing no harmful ingredients, etc.</li>
            <li> hair has become really soft after using the product.smells</li>
            <li> It makes and keeps my hair soft and manageable all day.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t help, my hair took up as much oil as it could and then left it still brittle (and now also greasy).</li>
            <li> I have natural &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought this under my husband&#x27;s name so it is not the review of a guy, but is a review from his classy wife.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> , I was pleasantly surprised after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shine.</li>
            <li> I have naturally frizzy wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> We have eliminated using toxins and dangerous chemicals in our household and try to look for the most natural choice available in any product.</li>
            <li> Both the conditioner and shampoo smell like natural mint and</li>
            <li> I stay directly under sunlight every weekend because of my mountain hiking trips.</li>
            <li> After using the silk conditioner my hair was sooooo soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been one day, and I&#x27;m ready to commit like a love-crazed teenager.</li>
            <li> I TRY TO USED NATURAL AND ORGANIC PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I would still recommend to anyone that&#x27;s looking for an inexpensive natural shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> So I started hunting for a natural shampoo.  </li>
            <li> All natural and organic.</li>
            <li> Just after a couple of days of using these 2 products together my hair was immediately silkier and felt soft.</li>
            <li> I learned of Maple Holistics Degreaser shampoo after I bought this set, so I am really hoping to try that one next.</li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair from bleaching blonde.  </li>
            <li> As far as the conditioner goes I feel like my hair is a lot shinier and softer</li>
            <li> My highlighted hair is so soft and silky</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but not over-conditioned.</li>
            <li> The set works well together and leaves hair soft and shiny and does not seem to leave a waxy build-up.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I unexpectedly had family at my house for a week and every one of them wanted to know where to get this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Nothing has ever made my hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is definitely lighter and compared to the Acure I have to use twice as much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but not over-conditioned.</li>
            <li> The shampoo completely stripped my hair of all moisture, and no it wasn&#x27;t just product removal</li>
            <li> I works wonderfully for those that have thin, delicate or dyed hair because it hydrates so well.</li>
            <li> but after using both a few more times I now notice a big difference in the silkiness and softness in my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair feels extremely soft, and I can tell it looks healthier already, especially toward the bottom where I was experiencing the most trouble.</li>
            <li> whether thin or thick hair, this blend would be the best for your scalp&#x27;s needs!</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see how she likes it! :-)</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty dry</li>
            <li> I have oily hair so need something with a little suds to help wash out the oil and give me a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> They all suggested the same thing, get a new brand of shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> The shampoo has sort of a tingly feeling and seems to clean well without being too harsh.  </li>
            <li> Not that I&#x27;m recommending you do this because I see they also have a facial serum which I&#x27;m about to try as it&#x27;s actually for the face, hahahaha!  </li>
            <li> This really, really makes me feel it was definitely worth the price because these bottles will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I used them together, and it left my hair clean yet very soft and not weighed down!  </li>
            <li> Came about this brand when I was looking for a new shampoo as my old one was seriously killing my hair and the price for this set was pretty reasonable for natural products, so I gave a try.</li>
            <li> I can smell the vanilla all day long and it is very soothing.</li>
            <li> First time and it cleans my hair well, also, leaves my hair soft unlike other</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says; there is not much to it.</li>
            <li> When you blow dry, if you&#x27;re looking for volume, you&#x27;ll need to add another product as this will not produce large chemical like hair like the salon will.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Tough to find when opting for more natural products.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling softer, more managable, and less tangled than with any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> Kathy lives in MD and I live in MA, so we have different types of water.  </li>
            <li> I am in my 40s with colored hair that is mid-length and &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; - not too dry or greasy, not stick straight nor curly.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend  this product for every day use, it seems to over dry  scalp when used every day but now knowing that  I use it 2 to 3 times a week and am very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maple Holistics worked much better for my thick, coarse, curly hair!  </li>
            <li> It left my hair looking shimmery and feeling soft with no frizziness!</li>
            <li> I am a little too obsessed with my hair and ever since losing it all with Lupus I take extremely good care of it (and myself!).</li>
            <li> After a week of using both the shampoo and conditioner, I noticed a major improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m thrilled that the conditioner is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t way my expensive curls down!  </li>
            <li> I have long naturally curly hair and it leaves my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry no product after using this shampoo conditioner and it dried quite nicely and minimal frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but thick (lots of it).</li>
            <li> I would love it if it would leave a subtle hint of mint on my hair until my next shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy again -- but only as a set -- as I gave this a four out of five stars because the price is high.</li>
            <li> After seeing all of the positive reviews from other buyers, I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> and I have generally used high-end salon brands.</li>
            <li> This is gross smelling product that is clearly seasonal.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will definitely be coming back for more and if you are looking for an all natural shampoo &amp; conditioner, I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Side note, you don&#x27;t have to use much of the shampoo to get your head lathered up, so this will last as long as my pert bottle that was twice the size.</li>
            <li> The conditioner has left my hair so soft my stylist can&#x27;t believe it, and it&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
            <li> This product is bringing my hair back naturally.</li>
            <li> Used it only once so far, and can already see the shine in the hair.</li>
            <li> My wife and I are big into all natural shampoo, soap, and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying again in the near future!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair (that has a big problem with frizz in the summer), which I often style with heat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much money on shampoos and conditioners trying to find the miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these products to anyone looking for an all natural solution that works well.</li>
            <li> I have been using natural shampoos/conditioners for awhile now and they always left a build up that required a weekly ACV rinse.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and manageable and has its shine back!!  </li>
            <li> If you are trying to reduce the amount of chemicals used in the shower (soaps and such) then this is a natural progression.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently deep conditioning to get it back to normal.</li>
            <li> my kid like this better.hers is a dry hair but after this hair is very soft and silky.definitely recommend this product !</li>
            <li> Please MH, consider making this permanent and not limited edition!</li>
            <li> I have normal hair that gets really dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, color-treated hair, so not only do I need color protection and moisture, I also can&#x27;t have products that are too heavy or my hair gets weighed</li>
            <li> It lathered beautifully, much better than other organic type shampoos I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different NATURAL shampoos but they all left my hair feeling dry and dull, almost like I never even washed my hair.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair smooth without weighing it down, which has been an issue with other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, but fine short hair</li>
            <li> But other than the way it smells and tingles on my scalp, it did&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much time and money researching for a great shampoo and conditioner, but I always get disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about the ingredients at first because there was not a full list of them on Amazon or the Maple Holistics website, but I took their word for it and purchased.</li>
            <li> The shampoo didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me as other reviewers have noted, but I did like it</li>
            <li> I read about Maple Holistics and decided to try the winter Blend because of other reviews and because the mint and eucalyptus sounded like it would be very soothing.  </li>
            <li> With my super thick hair I went through this stuff in no time, especially the conditioner which is not very thick.</li>
            <li> The shampoo put what felt like a gel-like substance feeling in my hair using only a quarter size like the instructions said, after letting my hair sit the recommended 3 minutes I couldn&#x27;t believe how squeeky clean my hair was (this was after I hadn&#x27;t used shampoo or conditioner in a little over half a week), so much so that I didn&#x27;t think I should even do it a second time contrary to their recommendations.</li>
            <li> I tried all sorts of natural remedies such as the vinegar, baking soda and water solution to coconut and tea tree oils and all kinds of &#x27;miracle shamoos&#x27; that simply did not work 100%.</li>
            <li> This did not dry my hair out at all</li>
            <li> This set leaves my hair squeaky, I mean squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> Good conditioner that helps my hair grow back without the old, bad things clinging to it.</li>
            <li> Shiny, Silky and soft hair all day long.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to go to the salon to dye my hair for the last time, back to my natural color and let it grow out.</li>
            <li> Throughout the day I sniffed my hair and could still smell the conditioner and my long hair still feels soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me it was because I had alot of product build up from silicone conditioners, it made my hair feel heavy and unplesant at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other natural shampoos before and they usually leave my hair feeling not quite as clean but this one didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> if it didn&#x27;t work for me it wouldn&#x27;t bee too much money down the drain.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s not really anything new.</li>
            <li> I can let air dry and it still feels soft.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair</li>
            <li> I bought this because everyone said it was amazing, and unfortunately it made my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Also, one of the things that I really didn&#x27;t like about my previous shampoos was that I can still see some flakes left in my hair after I washed it</li>
            <li> These Winter Blend products arrived at my house on the first day of spring (when it was still pretty chilly where I live), and I&#x27;ve been using them for a week now.</li>
            <li> Really silky hair which is usually dry and fuzzy due to over processing.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my scalp feeling clean and not the least bit dry.</li>
            <li> The first day my hair is a little dry</li>
            <li> It has 5 mint essential oils, so I was a little afraid it would be super minty, but the mint is not so strong.  </li>
            <li> I will not only buy this product again, but try other products this company offers.</li>
            <li> Both products are thicker and more concentrated than my usual shampoo and conditioner, so I use only about half as much as other products require.</li>
            <li> A Little goes a long way;shampoo really lathered.  </li>
            <li> I also like the other product of Maple Holistics - Natural Hair Gel for Men and Women - Ginseng, Jojoba, Sage Leaf and Bergamot.</li>
            <li> They leave my hair soft and the conditioner never leaves my hair oily like some other products do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with a bit longer than average hair and this stuff has lasted me nearly 3 months of using it regularly.</li>
            <li> , it is hard to keep a scrunchie in the first day.</li>
            <li> This will definitely be reordered especially since my scalp tends to get dry in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t see any change in my hair texture : / which was really bumming.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small, but it&#x27;s very concentrated and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> To say the least the shampoo and conditioner combo works as described and the scent is very intoxicating!  </li>
            <li> The only negative I can find is that the product isn&#x27;t available year round.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and coarse,  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick, curly 3b hair.</li>
            <li> The mint smells heavenly and has a pretty thick consistency.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that goes wild in cold weather.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soooo soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls.</li>
            <li> Was concerned it might weigh it down or make it too soft to stle, but neither one was an issue.</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and silky without weighing it down or leaving a buildup on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Because of the stripping/poor conditioning, combing was rough and I actually lost MORE hair than has been usual of late.</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian female with blonde hair down to the middle of my back</li>
            <li> I could actually get a comb through my long hair!</li>
            <li> The only con is that I use TONS of conditioner for my very long hair, and it&#x27;ll be gone before I know it.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for a natural black girl.  </li>
            <li> without being greasy and has made a big difference in my slightly dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> , it  leaves hair soft, shinny,  and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> but I found it most helpful during cold months when my hair took a beating from being outside!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become sensitive to artificial fragrances, but these products have a cheerful, minty fragrance that doesn&#x27;t give me a headaches.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend the silk 18 conditioner for people who have dry, course hair.</li>
            <li> It smells like real mint rather than the fake peppermint you&#x27;d normally get with regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> it smells like real mint(s) rather than the fake peppermint you&#x27;d normally get with regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> (it took me awhile to make the switch from daily, to ever other day, to every 3rd day).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product now because of the harsh winters where I live and because my hair has been appearing exceptionally dry.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and like to use a little of this conditioner as a leave in.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look and feel far less dry.</li>
            <li> Due to my unbelievably dry hair and the urges of people around me, I decided to have this treatment shampoo and conditioner which apparently, works.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve learned over the years that it takes at least four uses for us to really find out if a product works.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel lifeless and limp.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected though.</li>
            <li> I am not completely sold on the conditioner though.  </li>
            <li> She started using it a long time ago</li>
            <li> than it has in a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I have long  , wavy hair that tends to frizz and</li>
            <li> I think that the &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; edition maybe too harsh and strip my hair of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> The smell of the shampoo and conditioner is divine and the smell lingers in your hair for a long time after washing.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair too soft and limp and it wouldn&#x27;t hold the curl.</li>
            <li> Took a few days for the conditioner to make my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have thin, wavy hair that can get pretty unruly if not styled properly.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and the bottles are not even close to be empty, as I was initially hesitant having in mind price and amount.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy frizzy oily hair and the shampoo really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other all natural shampoo and conditioner in the past and it left my hair feeling gross and I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through it after my shower.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the shampoo and conditioner left the ends of my chemically processed hair super frizzy and brittle.</li>
            <li> hair is thin and this set is right for me.</li>
            <li> I will definitely get it and/or experiment with other products from the Maple Holistics brand.</li>
            <li> I would definitely try other products by Maple Holistics.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be on the lookout for other shampoos and conditioners offered by this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This means I can go without washing my hair for an additional day, meaning I only need to shampoo once every other day.</li>
            <li> My aging hair is cleaner and softer than it has been in a long while!</li>
            <li> I try to only wash my hair every other day or every third day, but with other shampoos and conditioners I have had to use dry shampoo on non wash days due to the oiliness the next day.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> a bottle that I would not forget to use everyday for my hair, even though I have this weird subscription with my favorite brand of shampoo.</li>
            <li> Her ordeal with dry scalp is over now.</li>
            <li> She has dry hair that frizzes and salons</li>
            <li> Also, it seems like it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair when I wash my hair for consecutive days.</li>
            <li> I have dry Caucasian hair and my daughter has kinky 4c hair.</li>
            <li> My hair got dry and flaky after a lot of treatments.</li>
            <li> My dry, itchy scalp was thankful for relief.</li>
            <li> It then became brittle and dry, so I had salon treatments to soften it.</li>
            <li> I can see it will work well for my dry, flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> It rinsed well, and my hair no longer felt dry.</li>
            <li> and I can get away with just blowing it dry, but</li>
            <li> I feel a cooling sensation even after my hair was so dry</li>
            <li> If any one out there has a suggestion for dry, aging and curly hair, luv to hear.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel dry.  </li>
            <li> I felt my hair was still dry</li>
            <li> So I have decided to use it a couple of times a month rather than every time I wash my hair because otherwise it would dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> After this winter, my hair has been extremely dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> After getting a trim thinking I just needed to remove some of my split ends, I was still dealing with frizzy, dry strands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real vanilla smell (which unfortunately smells like my natural dog shampoo)</li>
            <li> Definitely helped my colored treated hair bounce back to life after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have to use twice as much as I would using my usual (Tre seme) but the upside is that my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair is frizzy and hard to manage</li>
            <li> Before I had to wash my hair every single day.</li>
            <li> I generally do not write product reviews but sometimes you just should be of service to other buyers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a few different sulfate-free hair products over the past few months with little success, as the products I tried left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I didnt buy this myself, but was a gift to me because I have dry and damaged hair!</li>
            <li> I spent lots of time searching the internet for a &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; shampoo to fix my dry, breaking hair.</li>
            <li> In this case, I have fairly long hair and only wash my hair a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I typically cut my hair before it gets to this length from the sheer weight of it</li>
            <li> My hair definitely feels softer after using this for a week and a half.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had with it was that my hair felt a little dry once I was done</li>
            <li> but it leaves it very dry.</li>
            <li> I have wavy below shoulder length hair that was very dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> But this made my shower a blue mess.</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry and colored hair, this product gives a soft, but not greasy, not flat but a bit puffy look of my hair.</li>
            <li> For the last few years I have had itchy, flakey, and dry scalp.</li>
            <li> and I hope that this limited edition shampoo and conditioner does not go away anytime soon!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, normal in some section and course in other sections.  </li>
            <li> Definite improvements (healthier, feels less harsh) than regular products on the store shelf.</li>
            <li> I just wish the scent was a little different.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I have to say is that by day 3, my hair is a little oilier than it was before...</li>
            <li> I have a greasy scalp but dry hair, and had been endlessly looking for a conditioner that moisturized my hair but didn&#x27;t add to the grease on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I thought the bottles were a little smaller than expected</li>
            <li> However, this shampoo + conditioner combo went above and beyond any other hair product that I&#x27;ve previously used.</li>
            <li> Vanilla scent (in the conditioner) isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it isn&#x27;t bad or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t cut my hair since late November and only recently my ends began to look frayed.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish they came in bigger bottles with a pump...</li>
            <li> The description does however mention a third conditioner called Silk 18 and from what I understood I thought that came along with the order, it&#x27;s somewhat confusing because I did not receive the 3rd product</li>
            <li> (I have long hair that goes just past the middle of my back).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like the shampoo, it&#x27;s a real vanilla smell versus the fake scent you get from regular conditioners</li>
            <li> It strips everything from my hair and drys it out to the touch even when wet.  </li>
            <li> I guess I would describe my hair as rough before using these.</li>
            <li> My order came well packed and sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> This has helped me deal with my rough hair.</li>
            <li> so I was curious to see what the silk, vanilla conditioner would do for me.</li>
            <li> I spent the day smelling like gum.  </li>
            <li> Although expensive, I think this shampoo and conditioner may be worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> I was using the Acure brand conditioner (lemongrass) and it was just too heavy for my hair, even when I would use a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> This was alarming</li>
            <li> My thick hair feels soft and manageable after use.</li>
            <li> I gave to my little sister because her exzema is worse than mine and it cleared her itchy head right up.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this product to me due to my very dry, aging, colored, medication affected hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many brands of shampoo from least to most expensive and they have always disappointed me.</li>
            <li> It turns my &amp;#34;hay&amp;#34; (you know, that dry and frizzy tangled mess) into hair again.</li>
            <li> I am a natural black girl, I have extremely thick coily hair.  </li>
            <li> It is OK but for the price I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Repairs my damaged hair due to some hair growers I use</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> But I have long, dark, thick curly hair that sits just above my tailbone.</li>
            <li> had searched Amazon for organic shampoos and found the Degreaser shampoo, after reading other reviews</li>
            <li> Beats other brands.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and nothing helped.</li>
            <li> The conditioner on the other hand</li>
            <li> tried their other products too.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a deal in comparison to the pretty expensive Kerastase I was about to buy.</li>
            <li> and I have tried everything and usually get no different result.</li>
            <li> Due to my &amp;#34;age&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try out other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> I do use the products every time I wash my hair and do not find that it dries my hair out like some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> Both products are quite luxurious feeling, meaning a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Unlike other sulfate-free shampoos, this shampoo from Maple Holistics washed my hair thoroughly.</li>
            <li> (I wash my hair every other day).</li>
            <li> After trying the bk soda and vinegar, honey ,and other no poo options</li>
            <li> , I was amazed by the way my hair felt that I have never gotten from any other shampoo and conditioner , I would reccomend this product to anyone experiencing the winter blues on their hair ....</li>
            <li> Sorry, not sorry for the TMI.</li>
            <li> The other thing I noticed is that my hair isn&#x27;t as shiny</li>
            <li> I may try one of the other shampoo formulas when the Winter Blend is gone.</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely damaged from bleaching it for years.</li>
            <li> Also, just a small amount of shampoo is enough for my mid-length hair.</li>
            <li> other day without it looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I threw all my other products away.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try some other products.</li>
            <li> I know sounds gross, i usually dont do it...</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d like to try other shampoos to see if there&#x27;s one that is not as clarifying as the Winter Blend.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of this shampoo for it to work, it doesn&#x27;t lather like other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an extremely picky person when it comes to hair product, usually opting for low cost, but I wanted to treat myself for once and chose this product based on reviews.</li>
            <li> I find the Winter Blend leaves my hair &amp;#34;super clean&amp;#34; which translates to dry, I only wash my hair every few days, but I&#x27;d prefer if it were less harsh.</li>
            <li> At that point it was a little dry, but when I put on the&lt;br /&gt;conditioner, the tangles started coming undone.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does dry my hair out a little</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course hair, and now that I&#x27;ve been using this combo for a few week I have really noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural product without sulfates and other harsh chemicals, especially since I&#x27;ve been getting terrible acne around the hairline and on the forehead after using a harsh shampoo.</li>
            <li> I want to expand my wardrobe from light colored tops to what has always been impossible...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this shampoo is too harsh at all, but I only wash my hair every few days.</li>
            <li> No messy residue or weird film was left in hair after wash.</li>
            <li> I thought it seemed a little crazy to be THAT excited about shampoo and conditioner, but I figured I&#x27;d try it out.  </li>
            <li> ; as one reviewer remarked, however, it has never left my hair feeling dried out or stiff.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is very thin and light, it took a LOT to coat my long hair, and did almost nothing to condition and moisturize my poor stripped locks.</li>
            <li> I typically wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time find a combo that actually worked for me...</li>
            <li> Not a fun head of hair to work with,</li>
            <li> second thing I noticed was that when I poured the shampoo into my hand, it was thick and luxurious feeling.</li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny and not weighted down at all.  </li>
            <li> It cleans and softens without weighing your hair down</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down either</li>
            <li> but the upside is that my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that had dry, brittle hair and every product that I&#x27;ve tried in the past</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try a few other products by Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> Squeaky clean hair and my scalp feels relief from using sulfate loaded shampoos that cause painful bumps and itchiness.</li>
            <li> I followed a previous review and did a rinse and repeat</li>
            <li> No more dry, brittle split end hair!</li>
            <li> I also think it leaves my hair looking slightly greasy by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> but I can see that my hair is improving; it&#x27;s less frizzy</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m losing less hair.</li>
            <li> Made it softer than before, but still slightly drying.</li>
            <li> A LOT less oily.</li>
            <li> I did find my hair to be softer and have less frizz</li>
            <li> Just received my 2 pack in the mail--I have purchased the silk 18 in a previous order and this made me want to try the winter blend with the silk 18.  </li>
            <li> I have it for one and half months already.</li>
            <li> I cannot stand fake scents and have a sensitivity to any kind of artificial perfume/scent.</li>
            <li> then used the conditioner based on previous experience with conditioners, as there were no directions on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have much less frizz since I started using maple products.</li>
            <li> No more itchy scalp &amp; dry limp hair.</li>
            <li> What I desperately need is a haircut to trim away the split ends first.  </li>
            <li> small gripe is that the peppery spearmint smell is a a bit too overpowering for my liking though.</li>
            <li> Without product my hair is a mess.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and was pretty desperate when I did an Amazon search for yet another shampoo for my hair.</li>
            <li> so I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I live in the Northeast where the winters are cold and indoors are dry.</li>
            <li> cleans and conditions well without a heavy grease and doesnt weighs down hair ..</li>
            <li> So I need moisture, but also can&#x27;t have products that are too heavy or my hair gets weighed down.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is hardly noticeable once my hair is dry, but it&#x27;s invigorating in the shower.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is a little pricey for the amount of product; however, when I found the winter combo, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to try something other than Pantene, which I&#x27;ve been using for the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> I use the conditioner on my little ones as well.</li>
            <li> I was using Nioxin and that helped a little.</li>
            <li> but leave me feeling a little oily.</li>
            <li> This does the job with just a little lather so that you aren&#x27;t drying out your hair.</li>
            <li> but I think I need something a little bit stronger to eradicate the dryness altogether.  </li>
            <li> so I use a little bit of Johnson &amp; Johnson</li>
            <li> I thought this shampoo was a little overpriced when I bought it, but thought I would try it anyway.</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s a limited edition--who wants to wait for winter?</li>
            <li> Doesnt weigh hair down at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks &amp;</li>
            <li> I do not have to shampoo everyday.</li>
            <li> I am infatuated with the smell of the mint + vanilla.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buy Aveda instead and know what you&#x27;re buying.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to waste it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had hoped, from all the reviews, that this would do the trick for my dried out winter hair.  </li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to write this review to experience the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find a shampoo that uses all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It says winter blend, but I use it all-year round.</li>
            <li> After doing some research on some of the ingredients in the shampoo and conditioner, I do wish a few were omitted.</li>
            <li> I started highlighting my hair a few years ago when it started getting gray.</li>
            <li> this set is just not for me, my hair felt dried out and tangled.</li>
            <li> So I need something that works well, but not overly heavy of a product.</li>
            <li> (I suffer from light dandruff at the base of my scalp)</li>
            <li> I will buy again but I will probably use this as a once a week treat rather than everyday.</li>
            <li> I have used this set a few times now.  </li>
            <li> My mother ordered some of this because I have deader than dead hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I received these a few days ago</li>
            <li> The shampoo completely dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge conditioner person</li>
            <li> It did smell a little minty in the shower but definitely not as strong when my hair dried.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel weighed down like it usually does with conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Product was received late due to weather.</li>
            <li> Based on my satisfaction with this shampoo and conditioner, I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was a regular user of Purology but wanted to see if less expensive products stood up to the test.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of having dry fluffy hair, I&#x27;ve been using pert 2 in one forever.</li>
            <li> Add a little bit of water to lather the shampoo, because it is thick.</li>
            <li> I have very average hair, it&#x27;s not too thick</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of the shampoo; it goes a long way so the cost isn&#x27;t as bad as you may think.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was only mediocre.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not satisfied with something, they will make it right--quickly.</li>
            <li> hair that is past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> For those of you who have seen the Breakfast Club, I was that weird girl in detention who could make it snow dandruff by simply rubbing my scalp.</li>
            <li> It lathers with just a small amount.</li>
            <li> , I use it all year round, not just in the winter!</li>
            <li> A small amount is all it takes to lather up.</li>
            <li> No More Tears Detangler to help comb out my hair.</li>
            <li> Made my hair silky and left a faint minty scent.  </li>
            <li> (I use just a small amount and leave it in rather than rinse it out.)  </li>
            <li> I was researching sulfate-free shampoo after noticing my usual shampoos weren&#x27;t doing anything for my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> totally unbelievable...</li>
            <li> I would give this product a 5, if it weren&#x27;t so pricy for the small (8oz.) amount of product.</li>
            <li> I seem to have a lot of dandruff this year, small flakes but not itchy.</li>
            <li> and it encompassed all of my hair (which is past my neck).</li>
            <li> which is usually what happens when I use a heavier conditioner on my hair.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> the plus side, the 100% Money Back Guarantee was simple to use, and as disappointed as I am with the product, I have to applaud Maple Holistics/Amazon on the customer service.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is VERY harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been obsessed with using my peppermint essential oil in everything</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;I would need a gallon of this stuff to sustain me for a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li> It makes my scalp feel awake and seems to help with dull headaches too.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make it fade).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been hard to get her to kick the toxic products as she claims</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find a conditioner that will detangle my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this set hopeful it would add some shine to my dull, lifeless hair secondary to pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> and it made my hair so soft after years of abuse from dye jobs and bad products.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve joked for years that we could have a garage sale for all the hair products we&#x27;ve used and not liked after one or two uses.  </li>
            <li> My only disappointment came from reading the label and seeing there was alcohol in the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> But lately it&#x27;s been tangled and breaking.</li>
            <li> ; (late 40&#x27;s), my hair is &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Both products have delicate scent.  </li>
            <li> After wanting to switch common shampoo and conditioner I started a research</li>
            <li> I stayed up late surfing Amazon for dandruff shampoos and treatments.</li>
            <li> After some medications left me loosing my hair, I was desperate for anything that might help.</li>
            <li> This set was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo to help with my thick, frizzy, hair &amp; also itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> makes your hair frizzy if you have any type of thick or curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair felt thick abd course</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders on my thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Very small amount does the job.</li>
            <li> I was constantly scratching and was very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It lathers well, and I like the subtle minty smell.</li>
            <li> It even feels cold after you rinse and let it dry.</li>
            <li> They do wonders for my itchy dry scalp and brittle hair throughout the wintery blister cold during this time of year.  </li>
            <li> but seriously... one time...</li>
            <li> Usually if I let my hair air dry, it&#x27;s ugly and poofy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Usually all my hard earned money quickly disappears with &amp;#34;responsibilities&amp;#34; (boring), but this may become one of my selfish purchases.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of my hair looking dull and lack luster.  </li>
            <li> Not a good deal for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try sulfate-free because I heard it&#x27;s not good for your hair.</li>
            <li> you have hard water and can&#x27;t afford a water softener, then buy this set!</li>
            <li> so I was afraid the conditioner would weight it down</li>
            <li> Very hard to squeeze to get product out.</li>
            <li> Although it is not made for bad dandruff, it works very nicely on dry, winter scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo &amp; conditioner for approximately 2 weeks or so....</li>
            <li> but my daughter&#x27;s is thin</li>
            <li> My hair is thin</li>
            <li> thing I am not happy about is the price-</li>
            <li> leaves no build up behind...</li>
            <li> After using this, my hair is less ugly and poofy and frizzy...</li>
            <li> Finally!&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from a very dry scalp during the winter months and this year has been brutal.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but purchased it also.  </li>
            <li> I have a difficult time with shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair used to be silly all the time</li>
            <li> I am addicted to it!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about some of these reviews when I read them.  </li>
            <li> Well, now I am one of those crazies obsessed with this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> anyway, it smells weird, didn&#x27;t work on oily hair like it said it would.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this set randomly while shopping for something else.</li>
            <li> Then, my hair began to look fake and over-processed, so I colored it medium brown.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, because yes, I want to build a snowman, but I&#x27;d prefer it to be,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find shampoo with NO SLS.</li>
            <li> I randomly bought it looking for a nicer shampoo to use.</li>
            <li> but it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> I am giving it four stars because I HATE how small the bottles are.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the smell but the worst part was it made my hair dry</li>
            <li> shampoo and conditioner (by a well known company) were leaving my hair dry and nasty.  </li>
            <li> Made my head itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> One morning I put the Silk 18 conditioner from Maple Holistics on my face and neck as I was desperate</li>
            <li> Chilly</li>
            <li> the cold dryness winter brings .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe sulfate-free is as bad as what experts are saying.</li>
            <li> and I could not break the cycle of washing my hair every day. :(</li>
            <li> Not even close! &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried these based on the reviews and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> I leave the conditioner on until the end of the shower, and it gets very cold and tingly.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Immediately after bleaching, my hair was awful - just the feeling of it was terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought these because of the mint smell. Paul Mitchell makes a mint Tea Tree shampoo ( same price) that is wonderful. The tingling while washing your hair feels great. This does not do the same at all. The smell of the shampoo is minty but doesn&#x27;t last and hair just smells like hair. I don&#x27;t think my hair felt soft or anything special after using. It is OK but for the price I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I have been looking for a natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel lifeless and limp.  This stuff was amazing right from the start!  I can&#x27;t wait to try other products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural product without sulfates and other harsh chemicals, especially since I&#x27;ve been getting terrible acne around the hairline and on the forehead after using a harsh shampoo. This product is natural and gentle. The minty smell is refreshing. The shampoo and conditioner duo actually made my hair feel thicker and look healthier. I feel better about using this natural product as well.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for a holistic shampoo and conditioner. I was just looking for a really good one. These two products are so awesome. I don&#x27;t feel like this shampoo is too harsh at all, but I only wash my hair every few days. And, my hair isn&#x27;t dyed. I love the way the shampoo makes my scalp feel! The smell of the conditioner is a little overwhelming at first. I never thought I&#x27;d like the smell of vanilla in my hair, but I find I really do like it!</li>
            <li> I am a natural black girl, I have extremely thick coily hair.  The conditioner is ok it smells great, but I am not in love with.  The shampoo is VERY harsh on my hair. It strips everything from my hair and drys it out to the touch even when wet.  I would not recommend this for a natural black girl.  This shampoo would work best for a white girl with greasy hair.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, happy buyer.</li>
            <li> They offer free products for a good review - I feel like I was scammed out of the money. It&#x27;s not bad shampoo, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> So i have &amp;#34;fashion colors&amp;#34; in my hair. Most sulfate free shampoos are safe and don&#x27;t run my color. But this made my shower a blue mess. The only reason I gave it to stars is it did feel and smell good.</li>
            <li> i find same product different website.......different price and better.......</li>
            <li> This smells so good and does a great job, hair feels silky and wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and I would have to say this is one of the best shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve came across in a long time. It truly conditions and make your hair feel good, quite silky-like.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner!  It leaves my hair shiny, bouncy and smelling great.  I just purchased 2 more bottles to give to my niece for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I ordered it after reading some great reviews and thought I&#x27;d try it for myself. The winter blend does have a strong scent but I love mint so I don&#x27;t mind it. The conditioner smells like vanilla and works really well too. Makes your soft and smell amazing. I also love that the shampoo is sulfate free. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying their argon shampoo product.</li>
            <li> I generally do not write product reviews but sometimes you just should be of service to other buyers. Let me start by saying I have always used natural hair care products and I have generally used high-end salon brands. I am pretty picky. My hair is fine but thick (lots of it). I would be about 40% gray if I did not color it. Just say that so you know my hair type and can judge accordingly. This shampoo is non-drying (thought it might be with the mint) and has a lovely lather (many sulfate free do not). It makes my scalp feel awake and seems to help with dull headaches too. The conditioner is AMAZING! Makes hair silky and is richly conditioning but does not weigh my hair down. Will buy more, for sure. Glad it showed up in some random search I did.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, my hair feels super light, free of chemical additives. Squeaky clean hair and my scalp feels relief from using sulfate loaded shampoos that cause painful bumps and itchiness. The conditioner is also amazing. It left my hair looking shimmery and feeling soft with no frizziness! Thanks for making this great product!</li>
            <li> I was more than a bit skeptical that there would be any noticeable difference between this and my store bought &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shampoo and am very happy to say &amp;#34;Wow was I wrong!&amp;#34; The first thing I loved was the scent of both the shampoo and the conditioner - amazing! Second the fact that I needed so little product to make my flat, pin straight, blah hair look and feel great. This really, really makes me feel it was definitely worth the price because these bottles will last a long, long time. I would (and have) recommend this shampoo &amp; conditioner to anyone who wants their hair to feel, look and smell wonderful!</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been purchasing products that are natural and organic, so I was intrigued when I stumbled upon this brand - so many good reviews. The shampoo is a little pricey for the amount of product; however, when I found the winter combo, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. I enjoy the 5-mint blend in the shampoo, only wish it was a little stronger as I suffer from a pretty itchy scalp. The conditioner smells lovely (I&#x27;m a fan of vanilla scents) and gives described results: silky hair. I really don&#x27;t have to use my serum that I&#x27;d normally use after washing, but I still prefer to. Here&#x27;s my suggestion: all the shampoos should come as a combo set, with the conditioner, as it&#x27;s definitely a better deal. I&#x27;d be more inclined to purchase that option than the shampoo alone. Otherwise, I will buy this particular combo again when it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I love the winter blend!  It&#x27;s extremely refreshing and smells really good.  I have fine hair, so I don&#x27;t need anything too powerful.  This does a great job.  I can&#x27;t wait to try silk18</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells amazing.  Normally you get good smelling shampoo when it goes on and then you wash it off, but this shampoo leaves your hair smelling like mint! The conditioner has left my hair so soft my stylist can&#x27;t believe it, and it&#x27;s made in the USA. I will absolutely be purchasing from this company again.</li>
            <li> So, I have been looking for a sulfate-free shampoo that actually feels like it cleanses my hair for quite a while. My hair feels clean after using this shampoo. The winter blend smells wonderful in the shower and helps me wake up. The conditioner really is silky and also smells wonderful. I have not had to fight the frizz after using it! This is a great set.</li>
            <li> I started looking for sulfate and chemical free shampoos &amp; conditioners about a month ago.  I was so tired of my hair looking dull and lack luster.  I stumbled upon Maple Holistic products one evening while I was making some purchases on Amazon.  I decided to try the Winter Blend 2-pack.  And I have not regretted giving these products a try.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo &amp; conditioner for approximately 2 weeks or so....it&#x27;s truly amazing the difference in my hair.  It&#x27;s shiny, easier to manage and style  (I have naturally curly hair that has a mind of its own) and looks so much healthier.  I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;a convert to this brand and product.  I will only be purchasing this brand in the future for me and my family.  Thank you Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of shampoos/conditioners over the years. Was looking for something Sulfate Free after reading the reviews decided to give it a try. And all I can say is it AMAZING!!  Leaves my hair feeling very silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I recently restocked on this shampoo set because it gives my hair life! I learned that I can only use the shampoo about twice a month because I literally leaves my hair squeaky clean. But, as for the conditioner... it is a gift crafted and sent to me from God himself just in time for this unexpected winter too! I&#x27;m in love. No more itchy scalp &amp; dry limp hair. My hair has also become so much more thicker since I started using it on a regular basis. I swear by this, BUY IT!</li>
            <li> First time and it cleans my hair well, also, leaves my hair soft unlike other I have used (which claim they could leave hair soft and non-static in winter time).  I will definitely continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research in search of a sulfate free shampoo and decided on this combo set.  I am finding the shampoo to be great for my thick, naturally curly colored hair.  The minty smell is great, and I find, especially if I lather, rinse and repeat, my hair has that squeaky clean feeling, and definitely feels like it has more body and shine.  I&#x27;m not a huge conditioner person and I don&#x27;t use conditioner every day, but the Silk 18 was great so far.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel weighed down like it usually does with conditioner.  I anticipate buying a product from Maple Holistics again when these run out.</li>
            <li> This is excellent. My hair is softer then ever before. Absolutely love it. Price is very high though.</li>
            <li> The scent of the mint and vanilla combined is perfection. The shampoo has a great tingle and clears up gross scalp buildup, and the conditioner made my hair salon soft. Even my husband noticed.</li>
            <li> I was familiar with Silk 18 as my daughter uses this conditioner and I love how soft it makes her hair and it smells good. However, I was looking for a shampoo to help with my thick, frizzy, fly away hair in a particularly dry, winter climate so I gave Winter Blend a shot. I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks &amp; I am impressed. My hair looks and feels smoother and silkier and the scent of both the shampoo and conditioner is pleasing to me. I am pleased with the results and plan on purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is fine, but I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price. The shampoo does have a nice fresh scent, but I found it a little drying.  The conditioner was only mediocre.  Didn&#x27;t leave my hair super soft or smooth.  It was just ok.  I am in my 40s with colored hair that is mid-length and &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; - not too dry or greasy, not stick straight nor curly.  Just average hair and this product didn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
            <li> Made my head itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> I loved it, left my hair feeling and smelling so amazing. Definitely will repurchase, if not the same one I&#x27;d purchase another type but from the same company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this combo pack.  I have long naturally curly hair and it leaves my hair very soft.  The first day my hair is a little dry but after that it is wonderful.  I do not have to shampoo everyday. I followed a previous review and did a rinse and repeat and then you get lots of soap suds. This was helpful to me at first because I was used to lots of soap suds from regular shampoo.  I do not feel the need anymore and yes one wash is all you need.  My husband and three little boys also use it and they love the way it smells and their hair is so so soft. I have been using this product for over a month and will continue to use it.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this set and gotta say thathe I have never had such a great customer service as at maple holistics.&lt;br /&gt;this particular product didn&#x27;t work for me but I&#x27;m still giving 5 stars - I&#x27;ve tried the shampoo and conditioner twice - as I mentioned it didn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve contacted customer service, described everything which I was not happy with and the very next day I got the full refund and on top of that they have recommended me another products of theirs which were shipped to me immediately! I loved them - they worked!!! (It was hydrating shampoo and argan conditioner). Highly recommend - worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the garage sale buddy that Kathleen was referring to in her review.  We&#x27;ve joked for years that we could have a garage sale for all the hair products we&#x27;ve used and not liked after one or two uses.  Kathy ordered the Winter Blend Shampoo and Silk 18 Conditioner and told me she really liked it.  Really, really liked it after two uses.  We&#x27;ve learned over the years that it takes at least four uses for us to really find out if a product works.  I was skeptical, but purchased it also.  Kathy lives in MD and I live in MA, so we have different types of water.  You might laugh, but I think that not only type of hair, but also water supply affects products.  I have thick hair, normal in some section and course in other sections.  Did I mention my cowlicks?  Not a fun head of hair to work with, but I love these products and almost look forward to washing my hair, not one of my favorite activities.  These products leave my hair looking great and healthy!!</li>
            <li> Great dandruff treatment, also calms and relaxes as the aroma of mint wafts around my head.</li>
            <li> I have never used such good products. I have dry, wavy and frizzy asian hair, and it bothered me for so many years. These products do magic to my hair! My hair becomes soft, silky and not frizzy at all. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> cleans and conditions well without a heavy grease and doesnt weighs down hair ..</li>
            <li> These two are great together! Cleanse, soften, and smell wonderful!  I have naturally curly hair and like to use a little of this conditioner as a leave in.</li>
            <li> I never tried this product before, but the reviews I read Iam willing to try it, since my hair is limp.no volume and lack of body, I have tried alot of products that claim they volumize your hair and they dont. So here I go!!</li>
            <li> Repairs my damaged hair due to some hair growers I use</li>
            <li> I am loving how this makes my hair feel and have noticed that it seems to be working really well for my family as well. I suffer from frequent headaches and this provided a nice cooling feeling which aided in relief from the pain.</li>
            <li> This is the first sulfate free shampoo that I have tried. My hair was very greasy and frizzy and it was time to switch to a better shampoo for my hair. After just one use my hair looked healthier and was no longer a grease pit by early afternoon! Very small amount does the job. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Really helped me maintain my hair color (white).</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Product as described and became a favorite of the family.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fact that it is cruelty free. I don&#x27;t really like the price though. Now for the reason I gave a 3 star. I picked the package up and the whole car ride home I kept saying &amp;#34;wow that smells so good!&amp;#34; so I got home and so excited jumped in the shower and washed my hair and went to sleep. The next day at work I kept checking my shirt because I kept smelling toothpaste! So I asked my coworkers if they saw toothpaste on me lol I kept saying &amp;#34;why do I smell like toothpaste?!&amp;#34; (And don&#x27;t act like you never had that mysterious white stain on your shirt before) Well...come to realize, it&#x27;s my hair! And the scent that was coming from the box, was actually just the box. They must have spilled an actual nice smelling shampoo next to it and it leaked on my winterfresh box. Now if you like smelling like Crest Complete with Herbal mint toothpaste, then go ahead and buy this product. I do not like it. It did smell a little minty in the shower but definitely not as strong when my hair dried. Like I said, I recommend this company because I am a huge animal lover, but not this Winter Blend hairpaste. I also didn&#x27;t see any change in my hair texture : / which was really bumming. But hey.... cruelty free! :)  I will order from Maple Holistics again, just a better smelling product.</li>
            <li> With all the color and chlorine in my hair, it&#x27;s amazing how these two little bottles could clean up and maintain my hair&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this winter blend for 6 months. For several years I&#x27;ve had a quarter sized itchy/flakey spot on my scalp.  Winter Blend Shampoo (I tried 2 others from this company also) beautifully resolved this long-time problem.  Not only that, but I love my hair again!  Also the &amp;#34;Silk 18&amp;#34; Conditioner is amazing; I have long hair and it lasts a very long time.  I was worried that I would not be able to purchase Winter Blend in the summer and I&#x27;m so pleased to find it here on Amazon.  The smell is terrific and does not linger, so as not to clash with the fragrance I wear.  Recently, I&#x27;ve been breaking out from my recently re-formulated facial moisturizer. One morning I put the Silk 18 conditioner from Maple Holistics on my face and neck as I was desperate and I had nothing else in the bath - Wow, really soothing and now using daily, my face has cleared up in a weeks time and smoothed out (I&#x27;m 47).  Not that I&#x27;m recommending you do this because I see they also have a facial serum which I&#x27;m about to try as it&#x27;s actually for the face, hahahaha!  I&#x27;m such a fan of this shampoo/conditioner and Silk 18 conditioner that I can&#x27;t sing its praises enough :-)  Maple Holistics, you have my business for years to come unless you do like so many other wonderful companies - reformulate an already perfect product.  Thanks soooooo much.</li>
            <li> This was the best money I spent for my hair, I have really dry and damaged hair from dying and straightening and this helped my hair feel so much more healthy and my scalp didn&#x27;t feel as dry!</li>
            <li> Husband bought me this set as a gift.  Love the scene, very refreshing minty sense that leaves my hair (and scalp) feeling clean and soft.  I have very damaged dry hair, have been using these for 2 weeks, and while I didn&#x27;t see yet any apparent improvement it does maintain my hair pretty good.  What I desperately need is a haircut to trim away the split ends first.  Will try to update more on it.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far!  Lack of junk is a big thing for me and I&#x27;m happy that the quality is amazing too!</li>
            <li> This is gross smelling product that is clearly seasonal. DO NOT ORDER IT! It smelled rotten when it arrived to my home!</li>
            <li> This duo does an amazing job! My thick hair feels soft and manageable after use. It also leaves my scalp feeling clean and not the least bit dry.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and plan on purchasing more. Thank u</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed. Keeps my hair feeling clean, healthy and fresh. That&#x27;s important to me. I encourage you to take a try. You&#x27;ll be HAPPY you did!</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time with shampoo and conditioner.  I have to switch brands often due to my hair becoming oily and the product build up. This is my second purchase from Maple Holistics, the first set was the Winter Blend + Silk 18 which I loved but felt it caused a lot of static so I would only give that set a 4 star rating.  This set leaves my hair squeaky, I mean squeaky clean.  My hair looks shiny and not weighted down at all.  So far, using both set I have managed to get all the way to the bottom of both bottles without having to switch up.  My only disappointment came from reading the label and seeing there was alcohol in the ingredients.  It wasn&#x27;t at the top like most products but it was still present.</li>
            <li> a bottle that I would not forget to use everyday for my hair, even though I have this weird subscription with my favorite brand of shampoo. Giving that subscription to others, though, because this is too good to pass.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly with lots of frizz and can get very dry if I don&#x27;t use the right products, so I chose maple holistics based on the average reviews and the fact that these products are sulfate free!&lt;br /&gt;After using the shampoo, my hair felt very clean! I like the cool mint feeling on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;The silk 18 conditioner is my favorite! It leaves my hair soooo soft and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my curls. It smells sweet but not in an overpowering way. After using the products a couple of times, I noticed my hair had much more shine and body and I would recommend to people who want healthier hair!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner feel great. Particularly, the mint and peppermint. Enjoy supporting products that are made out of natural ingredients. Love it! The only drawback is I have yet to find a shampoo that does not leave my scalp oily. Hopefully I can find a Maple Holisitc product that works well with my hair type.</li>
            <li> Amazing Combo. Loved it! :)</li>
            <li> I recently was given this as a gift and love it.shampoo made my hair soft as i have very damaged hair from being over processed.the conditioner made my hair managable.i will be purchasing again...</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she is very happy with it so far.Her ordeal with dry scalp is over now.She loves the conditioner.</li>
            <li> The office AC stopped working suddenly but these kept my hair cool enough for me not to get irritated enough to shout at my employees.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner! From the first use, my hair was noticeably softer. I love how both the shampoo and conditioner smell. I&#x27;m so very happy with this purchase. And it came SUPER fast...which was a pleasant surprise. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the shampoo and conditioner a few times but so far I&#x27;m really loving both.  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave any build-up and my scalp and hair feel really clean.  The conditioner leaves my hair soft and shinier than before, it doesn&#x27;t make it feel super silky right after rinsing but it does work very well!  Both the shampoo and conditioner smell really nice and neither has an obnoxious or perfume like smell.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m enjoying this blend. I especially like the Silk 18 product. I find the Winter Blend leaves my hair &amp;#34;super clean&amp;#34; which translates to dry, I only wash my hair every few days, but I&#x27;d prefer if it were less harsh. Overall though, with the Silk 18, it seems to replace the dryness and smells wonderfully</li>
            <li> Removed my dandruff well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I have normal hair that gets really dry in the winter. I also have an itchy scalp (no dandruff). I used just the shampoo as it didn&#x27;t come with the conditioner the first purchase and it made a heck of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;When you let it sit in your hair and rinse, it feels as though you&#x27;re rinsing a regular body (bar) soap fro your hair. Don&#x27;t be fooled. Your hair isn&#x27;t fried. I the use a small amount of conditioner because no matter how nice my hair is, it tangles at the ends. I haven&#x27;t cut my hair since late November and only recently my ends began to look frayed.  I am very pleased with the results, and now that the dry winter is over I look forward to trying a new product from Maple Holistics. It&#x27;s worth every penny for beautiful healthy hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner set is just great. I am infatuated with the smell of the mint + vanilla. My hair feels so soft and looks better than it ever has. 10/10 Totally recommend this product! Thanks MapleHolistics!</li>
            <li> I am very upset with this product. It smells like glue and does not get my hair clean. I&#x27;ve used it twice and I am returning it. Don&#x27;t waste your money buy Aveda instead and know what you&#x27;re buying.</li>
            <li> Very good set! You can&#x27;t beat the price for such good products!</li>
            <li> The only hair product I have is this set and some hair wax</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and the shampoo makes my head tingle and you can tell that it removes all the product gunk from your hair.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Whats all the fuss about??  Sure, the peppermint is nice, but I noticed no difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have always had &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; hair until I recently moved to southern California. After getting my hair done with several different beauticians, the comments were obviously true; I no longer had healthy hair. Most said my hair was dry, brittle, and littered with split ends. They all suggested the same thing, get a new brand of shampoo and conditioner! I began the search and stumbled up Maple Holistics. After receiving the Winter Blend set, I eagerly awaited my next hair appointment to get the latest verdict. After about a months use, I visited my beautician again. She was blown away! My hair was back healthy again. No more dry, brittle split end hair! I noticed a huge change myself. Since then, I have continued using this product and absolutely love it. My husband began using it and loves the tingly menthol feel. This is a wonderful product and the best part is, it is safe!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Smaller than expected though. I love the smell of the conditioner! However, the shampoo is a little strong on the peppermit.</li>
            <li> I treated myself to these products and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  The shampoo smells wonderful and it leaves my hair very clean.  The Silk 18 is one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.  It tames my frizz and I don&#x27;t have to put a lot of work into making my hair look good.</li>
            <li> I have been trying the no-poo method of baking soda and ACV for a while when I realized my ends were splitting a lot so I began a search for an all natural alternative. I came across Maple Holistics Silk 18 conditioner &amp; shampoo but didn&#x27;t want to spend $13 on each bottle. I found this pair for around $12 total and decided to try it out, that way if it didn&#x27;t work for me it wouldn&#x27;t bee too much money down the drain. Well, I&#x27;m very happy I did!! My hair already feels softer and it looks healthier. I have pin straight and very fine strands, but thick hair just so you have an idea of what I&#x27;m working with. Needless to say, I will definitely be coming back for more and if you are looking for an all natural shampoo &amp; conditioner, I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really love the Winter Blend Shampoo.  It smells great and gets my hair so nice and clean, without weighing it down or stripping it.  I am not completely sold on the conditioner though.  The smell is way too strong for me and has a musky or woodsy scent. Where I prefer a fruity, minty, or citrus scent.  I also think it leaves my hair looking slightly greasy by the end of the day.  I maybe using too much, so I am going to give it some time.  I just wish the scent was a little different.  It does leave my hair feeling nice and soft though.  It would be wonderful if they started making a Winter Blend Conditioner and sold both year round.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always searching for natural shampoos conditioners and hair products and found this. I love the winter mint and even use it now into spring as I love the minty freshness. this was my second purchase of the winter mint so I would definitely recommend it as I bought it again.</li>
            <li> Shampoo cleans my scalp while the conditioner takes care of my sweaty hair.</li>
            <li> We received this product and my daughter used it right away.  The smell is invigorating!  She has dry hair that frizzes and salons always tell her to use a good conditioner.  This product made her hair feel soft with no frizz, and her curls bounced!  Will reorder again!</li>
            <li> I LOVED this product. But I have long, dark, thick curly hair that sits just above my tailbone. This lasted a week. :(&lt;br /&gt;I would need a gallon of this stuff to sustain me for a reasonable length of time. That would probably run me $250 and I wouldn&#x27;t spend that much for a hair product.</li>
            <li> This is a great family pack. The shampoo works perfect for me and for my wife, too. The natural conditioner is one of her favorites. She started using it a long time ago and she&#x27;s very happy with it. The price for this great.</li>
            <li> I love this pair! I was worried the shampoo would be too drying (thick,dry hair), but it wasn&#x27;t. The conditioner works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to try something other than Pantene, which I&#x27;ve been using for the past 10 years. But after learning about the harmful effects of SLS, I had to find a product that does not pose any health risks. I searched high and low for a safe alternative, and checked every single ingredient. This shampoo and conditioner set was a perfect starter, at a great price. It lathers well, and I like the subtle minty smell. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Okay, first thing to know about this product. It may not work for you right away. For me it was because I had alot of product build up from silicone conditioners, it made my hair feel heavy and unplesant at first but I have it a real nice acv rinse to remove the build up and this product has been working wonders since. My hair used to be silly all the time But lately it&#x27;s been tangled and breaking. This product has thoroughly conditioned my hair and it&#x27;s getting better each time I use it. My hair now has a lovely shine and isn&#x27;t getting greasy super fast, and when it does, it doesn&#x27;t feel or look really gross! This product is bringing my hair back naturally. Again I can not stress enough about removing the build up on you hair first! The only con I can say is their isn&#x27;t a whole lot of product for the price. That&#x27;s why I give it a 4 star. Other wise it would be a 5</li>
            <li> Smells and feels just like another big name brand shampoo starting with a c and ends with an r (I think it&#x27;s pretty clear), but it makes my hair smooth and not coarse. Switched to this immediately.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair soft, clean and smelling wonderful. I am addicted to it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this products because it made my coarse hair soft,and silky and well moisturized especially in this winter months.i also love the fact that it contains natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Great products and I&#x27;ll repurchase.</li>
            <li> My momma always told me to keep my head cool. This 2 in 1 keeps my head cool while keeping my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome. It makes your hair smell minty and nice all day long and it made my hair so soft after years of abuse from dye jobs and bad products. Every time I use it my hair feels so shiny and soft. I hope they offer it in a bigger bottle sometime!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I like the way the shampoo feels when sitting on my scalp. I like the minty smell and cool feel. But other than the way it smells and tingles on my scalp, it did&#x27;t do much for my hair. It&#x27;s not some amazing shampoo and conditioner that I can really feel a difference with. I need to use more than directed for my hair to feel clean and the bottles are so small so I would have to buy often.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  Makes hair very clean so I&#x27;m able to wash every other day.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since two months ago because this is really soothing and relaxing, and it really keeps my hair clean throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I love the way these smell.(Natural smelling mint blend.) My hair is pretty dry and I feel like these do a good job of not drying it out more. I wish they came in bigger bottles because I feel like I&#x27;m going to run out faster than I&#x27;d like but I guess you can&#x27;t have it all. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a leave-in coconut conditioner after I use these in the shower and the smell/added moisture combined is amazing.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo and conditioner set several times I can say that each time I feel my hair really silk.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin and this set is right for me. I also like the other product of Maple Holistics - Natural Hair Gel for Men and Women - Ginseng, Jojoba, Sage Leaf and Bergamot.</li>
            <li> Came about this brand when I was looking for a new shampoo as my old one was seriously killing my hair and the price for this set was pretty reasonable for natural products, so I gave a try. Honestly, it was surprisingly good. I&#x27;ve used other natural shampoos before and they usually leave my hair feeling not quite as clean but this one didn&#x27;t but it didn&#x27;t feel like it was stripping my hair either. Also, one of the things that I really didn&#x27;t like about my previous shampoos was that I can still see some flakes left in my hair after I washed it but this shampoo did a pretty good job with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner was quite nice too. I&#x27;m usually pretty lazy with conditioner since they take forever to rinse out but this one actually rinsed out quite fast and it didn&#x27;t feel like the conditioner was just sitting on top my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep my hair in a ponytail so it&#x27;s kind of disheartening whenever I pull the hair tie off and a lot of hair came off with it. I have only used the set twice but I can see that my hair is improving; it&#x27;s less frizzy and I&#x27;m losing less hair. Also, it seems like it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair when I wash my hair for consecutive days. I should&#x27;ve switched out my shampoo sooner but I didn&#x27;t want to waste it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this set was a really good buy and I&#x27;d love to try out other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course hair, and now that I&#x27;ve been using this combo for a few week I have really noticed a difference.  I only wash my hair every 3 days or so (it took me awhile to make the switch from daily, to ever other day, to every 3rd day).  Usually if I let my hair air dry, it&#x27;s ugly and poofy and frizzy.  After using this, my hair is less ugly and poofy and frizzy...meaning I could potentially get away with walking out the door and not doing anything else to it (no ponytail), which is HUGE for me.  I noticed that normal store shampoos/conditioner made my hair far more dry/frizzy. The only thing I have to say is that by day 3, my hair is a little oilier than it was before...but this could be that it&#x27;s adjusting to the more natural ingredients and will normalize once again.  I would definitely buy this again and I&#x27;ve already recommended it to several friends.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos and conditioners and haven&#x27;t found one that really right for my curly/frizzy, thick hair.  It&#x27;s really made my hair shiny(!!) without being greasy and has made a big difference in my slightly dry scalp.  I really like the scent of the shampoo and wish the conditioner had a similar scent.  Vanilla scent (in the conditioner) isn&#x27;t my favorite, but it isn&#x27;t bad or overpowering.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone! I think it&#x27;s a great every day shampoo and conditioner! Would you consider selling the winter blend shampoo by itself Maple Holistics so I could try a different conditioner????</li>
            <li> As a woman, I treasure my hair, this is very effective in clearing my hair from dirt and hair products, so I can sleep at night with a clean head of hair on me.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a sulfate free shampoo that is healthy for colored hair (I currently have blue hair so it&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make it fade). I decided to give this a try because of all the positive reviews. I can honestly say I will probably buy this forever. The smell is absolutely amazing. Very minty, smells like a spa. I leave the conditioner on until the end of the shower, and it gets very cold and tingly. It even feels cold after you rinse and let it dry. It&#x27;s very nice. My hair has not felt this soft in years. I am glad I found this!</li>
            <li> Tickles the olfactory senses. Smells cool and minty. Feels cool and minty on the scalp. Tastes... well, I don&#x27;t know, yet.</li>
            <li> swell shampoo that smells great, no matter what hair and scalp type you may have.</li>
            <li> The Winter Blend Shampoo has a very pleasant minty fragrance that is so refreshing. It is not overpowering just lite and refreshing. The minty shampoo with the vanilla scent of the conditioner make a wonderful fragrance all day. I tried it because of it having no sulfates and I trust Maple Holistic products and it did not disappoint. Although it is not made for bad dandruff, it works very nicely on dry, winter scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy the Silk 18 conditioner. I have previously tried it and liked it but thought it wasn&#x27;t enough to detangle my very fine hair. However, the more I use it, the softer and more easily manageable my hair has become. I don&#x27;t use anything else now. I have had numerous compliments on how soft and moisturized my hair feels - and I really enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> I just started using both products but I have to say that they really work! I have very dry winter scalp and the Winter Blend Shampoo is refreshing and invigorating while the Silk 18 leaves my hair soft and clean. I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding something that is good for my hair and leaves it feeling smooth. My hair likes to frizz and it hasn&#x27;t done that once so far. I have colored, curly hair that doesn&#x27;t play nice so I am very pleased with what I&#x27;m seeing. I also notice that my hair seems brighter and looks healthier...an added bonus! I give this Winter Blend pack two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product now because of the harsh winters where I live and because my hair has been appearing exceptionally dry.  So far I&#x27;ve been happy with the repair to my hair that seems to be taking place.  It feels softer and is more manageable.  I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use I&#x27;ll see even more results.  There seemed to be improvement right away.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner!  The scent is amazing and they both left my long curly hair feeling so soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing they could change would be to use a softer bottle.  Very hard to squeeze to get product out.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of the shampoo; it goes a long way so the cost isn&#x27;t as bad as you may think. I love the clean scent and my hair loves the conditioner. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have greasy hair. This helps clean the grease.</li>
            <li> I had hoped, from all the reviews, that this would do the trick for my dried out winter hair.  Did NOTHING for my hair.  In fact, it made it even drier and more unmanageable.  Not a good deal for me.</li>
            <li> This was the first product I have tried from mapleholistic, but I have also purchased the silk18 conditioner. Both the shampoo and conditioner are amazing. I have dry Caucasian hair and my daughter has kinky 4c hair. The shampoo isnt too harsh and I love the natural tingle from the mint. The conditioner has great slip, for de-tangling my daughters 4c hair. Both products leave our hair soft, shiny and tangle free. This is definitely a great product for all types of dry hair.</li>
            <li> These feel great on my scalp, and they smell good! The natural ingredients are always a plus.</li>
            <li> For a while now, I have been looking for a shampoo/conditioner that meets the highest ethical standards and does well with my hair.  I have thin, wavy hair that can get pretty unruly if not styled properly.  Most shampoos and conditioners weigh down my hair and make it look crunchy when combined with styling product.  This set worked wonders, smells great and is a good value.  You don&#x27;t need much in order to do the trick!</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to write this review to experience the effectiveness. This cleans and conditions better than any brand I&#x27;ve tried (I tend to use better brands from Sephora). Coming off of using Wen, I wasn&#x27;t used to the lather so I used a tad too much. My hair is more manageable and looks like I just was at the salon.</li>
            <li> Love the mint smell and it makes my hair smell great!</li>
            <li> This was my most favorite shampoo and conditioner to use, how it had my hair soft silky and smelling good, I could never find it in Walmart. I recommend for anyone to use it. It treated my damaged and hair.</li>
            <li> This thing smells good and the mint is cool.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about some of these reviews when I read them.  I thought it seemed a little crazy to be THAT excited about shampoo and conditioner, but I figured I&#x27;d try it out.  Well, now I am one of those crazies obsessed with this shampoo and conditioner.  I have wavy, coarse hair that I curl and flat iron too much, leaving it kind of frizzy and fried looking a lot of the time.  After using this shampoo and conditioner, my hair looks sleek and smooth and so much better than it has in years! Very impressed by this stuff, and it smells amazing to boot.</li>
            <li> A pleasurable smell. At times I zone out just smelling the fragrant mint wafting to my nose</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find a shampoo that uses all natural ingredients. With most shampoos and conditioners, my scalp breaks out. Not with Maple Holistics. I am so pleased with their products.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner 2 pack is AWESOME!! I have tried many different NATURAL shampoos but they all left my hair feeling dry and dull, almost like I never even washed my hair.  I am so happy that I decided to give this product a try!  They both smell yummy, my hair feels so clean and refreshed and it looks so much healthier than it has in a long, long time. I will be buying all of my hair care products from Maple Holistics from now until forever!</li>
            <li> A great shampoo and conditioner treatment for my and my family&#x27;s hair (We have sensitive scalps so...). The cool feeling is a plus</li>
            <li> Better shampoo than most brands. Chilly</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner set because it is an all natural product containing no harmful ingredients, etc. My girlfriend is extremely sensitive to a lot of different ingredients and many can give her allergic reactions. This shampoo and conditioner is perfect. It does not bother her at all and on top of that it smells good and feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might also think you don&#x27;t get very much since it is only 8oz. I&#x27;m a guy with a bit longer than average hair and this stuff has lasted me nearly 3 months of using it regularly. Well worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> I Love  that shampoo. I have already ordered another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also ordered and used the winter special shampoo. That is my favorite as you can feel all the mints cooling your scalp as you use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had searched Amazon for organic shampoos and found the Degreaser shampoo, after reading other reviews, I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly it could use a better name, it sounds like a laundry product, lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good thing it works well, it cleaned my hair well, but did  not strip out all the moisture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all great products, keep up the natural work!</li>
            <li> Kind of dried my hair out. Made it softer than before, but still slightly drying.</li>
            <li> Really fantastic product, I just wish they made larger sizes. With my super thick hair I went through this stuff in no time, especially the conditioner which is not very thick. I think the best part about it was a the fabulous scent of the conditioner, though. Clearly high quality stuff.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using the winter blend for a couple weeks and love it.  It&#x27;s been hard to get her to kick the toxic products as she claims only they make her hair feel light, conditioned, and smelling good.  Not anymore, will be purchasing more before the winter blend isn&#x27;t available.  Feels great, smells great, and love the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> I received this set as a gift and loved it.  The mint smells wonderful and the conditioner works wonders.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is the best one I&#x27;ve tried in my life. Beats other brands. The sheen, the brilliance, the smooth and silky hair, it&#x27;s just, amazing. Shampoo was good too</li>
            <li> This shampoo was great for fixing my damaged hair. It&#x27;s safe for colored hair.</li>
            <li> This is the shampoo that I&#x27;ve been looking for since I moved to DC from Boston a year ago! Since it&#x27;s very humid here, I found myself showering more and more often. As a result, my scalp began producing more natural oils to combat me washing the oil away... and I could not break the cycle of washing my hair every day. :( It&#x27;s only been a week since I began using this shampoo set but I find my hair A LOT less oily. I am now able to wash my hair every other day if I prep my hair with a bit of baby shower the morning of the second day. It also smells very refreshing but not overwhelmingly minty. I love it!</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine, too early to tell. But love the timely shipping.</li>
            <li> For the last few years I have had itchy, flakey, and dry scalp. I also had red patches from my scalp being so irritated. I have tried other products and nothing helped. I also found out that most organic shampoo and conditioners irritated my scalp. So, once again I began searching for something to relieve my symptoms. I found this product on Amazon.com and read all of the great reviews and had to try it. I am happy I did. My scalp felt better in just a few days. The red patches are gone. I like the tingling feeling from the mint. My hair feels the same as before. But, my scalp feels so much better. I can&#x27;t wait to try a few other products by Maple Holistics. I only gave a 4 out of 5 because I want to use the product for a period of time to see if it continues to work well with my scalp and hair. I will try to remember to update my review in a month or so.</li>
            <li> Make your hair feel good</li>
            <li> Love this!  Just wished it came in a bigger bottle.  Our hair is super soft.  I have super thick hair but my daughter&#x27;s is thin:  it works for the both types.</li>
            <li> Just tried the shampoo conditioner after looking at some of the reviews. Used it only once so far, and can already see the shine in the hair. My hair looks healthier. I think I am going to switch my organic shampoo to Maple.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using this product for about 1 week.  When I first opened it my first impression was how wonderful the scent of the shampoo was.  It is not a unnatural perfume scent you get with many shampoos, it smells minty. I also really like the way my hair feel safer shampoo and conditioner use.  The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because after showering I no longer smell that wonderful scent on my hair.  I would love it if it would leave a subtle hint of mint on my hair until my next shampoo. Great product!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think I liked the shampoo. I had been using Aveda for years because my sister works at an Aveda salon. But since I moved out of town, I decided to look to Amazon for an easy way to obtain quality shampoo. I&#x27;m halfway through the bottle now and I&#x27;m definitely glad I continued using this product. Not only is the smell amazing, but I leaves my hair feeling so incredibly soft! And I love how well it rinses clean. Definitely my new shampoo and conditioner choice</li>
            <li> this is really a good product.&lt;br /&gt;my hair has become really soft after using the product.smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;even my kid like this better.hers is a dry hair but after this hair is very soft and silky.definitely recommend this product !&lt;br /&gt;will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this set for about two weeks. I have fine thin, permanently colored hair, and it has never felt or looked better!</li>
            <li> I like both products but I like the conditioner more than the shampoo. It makes and keeps my hair soft and manageable all day. I think I will buy just the conditioner next time. I don;t shampoo a lot so I might have some shampoo left when that time comes.</li>
            <li> I have long  , wavy hair that tends to frizz and the shampoo does a good job cleaning my hair but it leaves it very dry. The conditioner on the other hand it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic. Hair is squeaky clean. Smells great!</li>
            <li> I recently bought the Winter Blend Shampoo &amp; Conditioner as my co-worker uses it and loves it.  I love the smell and the way my hair feels silky soft after using it.  I also recently went to a color specialist in our area, she said that she has never seen such shine on a blonde before.  I took that as a compliment to your product.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> The reviews were great but were they written by friends and family or....anyway, it smells weird, didn&#x27;t work on oily hair like it said it would.  tried their other products too.  I don&#x27;t like any of them</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> made my hair look and smell nice. winter blend really good on this one</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner smells wonderful. I love anything mint so decided to try these for the first time. This is a Winter Blend but I have been enjoying them in July! I bought one set and then immediately bought two more....one to take to our cabin. They not only smell good, but the consistency of the products and they way they make my hair feel and smell is wonderful as well.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I absolutely LOVE this set! I just purchased a second set. I have a pretty healthy hair (straight long black hair), but my scalp gets a bit itchy and I have a super sensitive eczema skin, so I am all about natural products. I&#x27;ve spent so much time and money researching for a great shampoo and conditioner, but I always get disappointed. This one is truly amazing! Shampoo lathers beautifully, it has almost like a gel-like texture, and the conditioner is very light but effective. It says winter blend, but I use it all-year round. I got compliments from my friends and even from my hair dresser who&#x27;s been dealing with my hair for almost 10 years. I want to try other products from Maple Holistics, but I am going to stick with this one since I&#x27;m so happy with it. If you&#x27;re hesitating and reading this review, JUST GET IT!!</li>
            <li> I guess I would describe my hair as rough before using these. It&#x27;s better now, I wish I could&#x27;ve known about this  earlier.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair looking and feeling healthy. Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> My hair got dry and flaky after a lot of treatments. Well, some of the treatments were supposed to lessen the damage, but still, my hair has gone through hair hell. These two bottles has undid most of the damage in just under two weeks. In addition, it didn&#x27;t affect my hair color at all!</li>
            <li> i brought these for my kids. the shampoo and conditioner smells so good. today is the 2nd day they are using it and i can already see the shine. the size is perfect to bring for out of town travel.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo to help with my thick, frizzy, hair &amp; also itchy scalp. So I gave Winter Blend a try. I&#x27;ve been using for a few weeks &amp; I am really liking it (both shampoo and conditioner). My hair looks and feels smoother &amp; I love the scent. I plan on purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I love this shampoo and conditioner, but I do like it. I have fairly normal hair and my hair is doing just fine with this. I haven&#x27;t had any miraculous thing happen to my hair. Something that is really nice though is that the conditioner actually detangles my hair. I have tried my fair share of natural conditioners, and a lot of them just leave my hair super tangled and super hard to comb through. So that is definitely a plus! After doing some research on some of the ingredients in the shampoo and conditioner, I do wish a few were omitted. But, this is definitely better than a lot of traditional shampoo and conditioners that are on the shelves at target, etc. Smell is nice! Not too overpowering. Light and minty :)</li>
            <li> Awesome sale! Smells delish and keeps dandruff at bay!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this shampoo and conditioner set. It gives my head that cool feeling when applied. It doesn&#x27;t ruin my hair by removing even the color that I just applied. I am so happy about my sister&#x27;s discovery of this brand.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good. Definite improvements (healthier, feels less harsh) than regular products on the store shelf. Hairs feels much better after use. No  hair clump ups and no waxy residue and build-up. Very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small gripe is that the peppery spearmint smell is a a bit too overpowering for my liking though. Not that big of a deal though.</li>
            <li> I have never used shampoo and conditioner like this before. It smells absolutely wonderful! I feel engergized by the scent as I wash and condition my hair. I have very wavy almost curly hair that is fairly coarse and gets tangled easily.  I often times dread washing my hair but not anymore. It leaves my hair feeling softer, more managable, and less tangled than with any other product I have used. I highly recommend Maple Holistics Winter Blend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good natural, sulfate-free, shampoo and conditioner for a while. I trusted the reviews on this product and went for it - I&#x27;m really glad I did. In fact, I like it so much I bought a backup for my gym bag. I&#x27;m a guy with fairly curly hair and most products make my hair coarse and &#x27;poofy&#x27; instead of soft and relaxed. This blend is perfect for my hair type and has made my hair look great and a lot more manageable. My fiancé even noticed and has commented on it. Really appreciate this wholesome product.</li>
            <li> I really love the winter blend shampoo. It has a refreshing and uplifting mint fragrance, and feels soft and silky when you lather it into your hair. I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free, and I love how it feels in my hair. I&#x27;ve enjoyed each Maple Holistics product that I&#x27;ve tried, and I also love how dedicated to customer service the company is. If you&#x27;re not satisfied with something, they will make it right--quickly. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I spent lots of time searching the internet for a &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; shampoo to fix my dry, breaking hair. I went from coloring my hair, to not coloring it, to shampooing only 2x a week and I was still seeing drying. After a process of elimination, I came to realize that it was my shampoo and conditioner that was damaging my hair. I was using John Frieda, and I thought it was good shampoo. I searched amazon for a silkening conditioner and came across this product. I thought it was a deal in comparison to the pretty expensive Kerastase I was about to buy. I bought it, and after the first shampoo/conditioner session I saw a difference. FOR REAL. I am so glad I bought these products. The winterblend isn&#x27;t overly minty, so you don&#x27;t get that weird menthol sensation I was expecting (I&#x27;m glad), and the silk 18 smells of the sweetest vanilla. I can smell the vanilla all day long and it is very soothing. Overall, this product gets 5stars from me, I will continue to buy for years to come!</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this set randomly while shopping for something else. My hair has given me problems for ages, so I thought I would give these a try. I love them.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used them was when I bleached my hair, and the results were amazing.  Immediately after bleaching, my hair was awful - just the feeling of it was terrible.  I shampooed, and soaked it with the conditioner for several minutes.  I was astonished when I rinsed it out and it felt like normal hair again, even better than before! Also, they both smell lovely, and I like how the shampoo gives a little bit of a tingling feeling on my scalp. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great products. My hair has never looked so healthy.</li>
            <li> Love both products. I use the conditioner on my little ones as well. Smells great and my hair stays healthy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try sulfate-free because I heard it&#x27;s not good for your hair. What a crock. This product made my hair feel like straw. My scalp burned, and it caused flakes. Sulfate-free products are purely market-driven to get consumers to purchase the product. Do research on what the ingredients in this product is, and you will find it&#x27;s just as harmful. I don&#x27;t believe sulfate-free is as bad as what experts are saying. After all, haven&#x27;t we been using all kinds of products with that ingredient?</li>
            <li> Set was purchased for guests. When received, opened and enjoyed the scent we chose to, instead, use it ourselves. Very happy with the product and price, as it is replacing our &amp;#34;Its a 10&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The smell is really enjoyable, the shampoo works great on sensitive skin. The conditioner really straightens my hair.</li>
            <li> The mint feeling on my scalp feels great! I love the condition this leaves my hair in. With many shampoos my hair is left so fine that it floats with the slightest breeze. This makes it feel clean but not overly stripped.</li>
            <li> A very natural and soothing shampoo and conditioner for my scalp and hair. Recommended to my friends.</li>
            <li> Shampoo that makes my hair feeling and smelling clean. And Conditioner that makes me feel the reparations are working well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner set is amazing! I&#x27;m Korean and Italian so I have long thick hair and it&#x27;s hard to find a conditioner that will detangle my hair but this stuff does! I don&#x27;t ever have to use a comb, just run my fingers through my hair and it&#x27;s detangled! These are perfect and the minty smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great! It smells amazing, makes your scalp tingle and makes your hair feel so clean yet soft at the same time! I will be definitely be looking into more of these products!</li>
            <li> I really liked this shampoo and conditioner set. I did find my hair to be softer and have less frizz and I have tried everything and usually get no different result. The smell is sensational and left my scalp tingly. I would definitely buy again -- but only as a set -- as I gave this a four out of five stars because the price is high.</li>
            <li> This shampoo feels nice on the scalp and the conditioner makes my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> I tried these products simply because of the promotions. I wasn&#x27;t certain if winter blends really made a noticeable difference or change in my hair texture. I&#x27;m still not positive; however, what I can state is this product smells incredibly fresh and wonderful. My hair is also thicker and looks healthier than prior to my initial usage, which was over 45 days ago. If you cleanse daily or more than once a day, your hair won&#x27;t feel brittle.</li>
            <li> i use this with some of my customers. really helpful</li>
            <li> The mint varieties really lend a large part in the amazing feeling this leaves on my scalp and the scent is truly cooling.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner along with the shampoo. It is great for dry hair. It cleans and softens without weighing your hair down</li>
            <li> This emulsifies easily and leaves a good feeling on my scalp and hair and it lasts a long time. A good hair care product</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the shampoo and conditioner left the ends of my chemically processed hair super frizzy and brittle.I tried putting coconut oil on the ends after my shower but it didn&#x27;t help, my hair took up as much oil as it could and then left it still brittle (and now also greasy). I&#x27;m currently deep conditioning to get it back to normal. My roots on the other hand are nice and soft, and I love the scent. . I am going to give Silk 18 a try as I see that people with dry hair have good experiences with it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner smells wonderful, not overwhelming, and leaves hair light and silky smooth. It&#x27;s an amazing product! My dry, itchy scalp was thankful for relief. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This has actually helped my thinning hair. I was using Nioxin and that helped a little. This stuff is way better!!</li>
            <li> Just received my 2 pack in the mail--I have purchased the silk 18 in a previous order and this made me want to try the winter blend with the silk 18.  I love the smell of the winter blend shampoo.  My hair feels squeaky clean with it.  My ABSOLUTE favorite is the Silk 18.  I have natural &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; hair that is past my shoulders.  Due to my &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; (late 40&#x27;s), my hair is &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34;.  This makes my hair very soft, takes out the knots, and feel like it did when I was in my 20&#x27;s.  I have tried a lot of different sulfate free shampoos--I have found my keeper!  It also keeps my &amp;#34;wiry&amp;#34; silver hair under control!!</li>
            <li> Excellent products! I have very fine, thin hair. Was concerned it might weigh it down or make it too soft to stle, but neither one was an issue. Highly recommend if your looking for a healthy alternative to chemical laden shampoos/conditioners. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is great,  but conditioner lacks the oils that make your hair smooth. I have been using Sulfate free products for about a year and most have this issue. I find using organic unrefined cocout oil with this conditioner give me the desired end result.</li>
            <li> I love the way the mint flavor feels on my scalp. It makes my hair feel so clean. It does a great job of not stripping my hair. Can&#x27;t wait to try out other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> the winter blend is one of the most memorable bottles of hair care that i have used. it&#x27;s here wherein i found the best feeling in the world.</li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant about the mint- I didn&#x27;t want my hair smelling like toothpaste. I opted to try it anyway because of all the great reviews and descent pricing. I also tried it because the scents of mint &amp; eucalyptus helps to calm my migraines at times. I have to say that I Love Love Love the mint! I see a huge difference in my hair! My hair is so much softer and easier to brush with the combination of these two products. I do use the products every time I wash my hair and do not find that it dries my hair out like some of the other reviews said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish that you could purchase larger bottles and that the bottles were easier to get the product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love for them to come out with a mint version of the silk 18 conditioner!</li>
            <li> a very good blend for a shampoo product. the conditioner is especially comfortable on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I purchased these products hoping to replace the Wen shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve been using. Not even close! &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner, it really helps my scalp even in the summer</li>
            <li> What a great product!  I have fine straight hair and this combination of shampoo and conditioner was meant for me.  It smells great and leaves my hair soft and manageable.  Some conditioners make my hair static and untamed.  This is by far the best shampoo I have used.  The icing on the cake is that it is natural and with out all the chemicals that plague so many hair products on the market.  I will definitely be purchasing this again. P.S. I bought this under my husband&#x27;s name so it is not the review of a guy, but is a review from his classy wife.</li>
            <li> Wow! What a difference it did for my hair...recommend it</li>
            <li> After washing my hair with the shampoo, there was significant residue.  The smell was nice, but that is where the cons end.  The conditioner didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; at all.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel soft after using it.  Although it&#x27;s nice that the product is holistic and environmentally friendly, I know there are other products out there which perform much better, but still qualify for those descriptions.</li>
            <li> Excellent products and my hair has not looked this good for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Maple Holistics for a year.  It&#x27;s the best sulfate-free shampoo I&#x27;ve found.  Leaves my hair clean and soft.  At first I used Silk 18.  It worked well, but I didn&#x27;t love the fragrance (vanilla, a little musky). The winter blend seems to work just as well, but with a refreshing minty smell I really like.  The fragrance is hardly noticeable once my hair is dry, but it&#x27;s invigorating in the shower.  The bottles are small, but it&#x27;s very concentrated and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> I currently use Aveda rosemary mint shampoo and conditioner, but wanted to try something sulfate free (honestly, I used it for the smell).  Maple Holistics worked much better for my thick, coarse, curly hair!  Left it soft and the mint smell was wonderful-even better smelling mint.  The winter blend for being sulfate free, surprisingly had a nice lather to it.  I also love that the price is pretty reasonable too compared to so many overpriced products out there.  Thank you for the great product, I will definitely be buying your products from now on!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cool on the head and is everything I&#x27;ve ever expected from a shampoo and conditioner set. love this!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It has a great smell but not overwhelming. My hair feels great after using this, esp especially in combo with the silk 18 conditioner. Great products!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is really gentle and has no harsh ingredients. I was nervous about the ingredients at first because there was not a full list of them on Amazon or the Maple Holistics website, but I took their word for it and purchased. I am so glad I did! Most of the main ingredients are coconut derivatives and the scent comes from 100% mint essential oils. I am so happy that I finally found a product that is natural and healthy for my hair!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great. The conditioner is great too. i really like these two things.</li>
            <li> My hair has straightened that it feels like I&#x27;m one of those commercial models</li>
            <li> For those of you who have seen the Breakfast Club, I was that weird girl in detention who could make it snow dandruff by simply rubbing my scalp. I had so many problems with scabbing, itching and flaking I thought the only logical explanation could be psoriasis. I tried all sorts of natural remedies such as the vinegar, baking soda and water solution to coconut and tea tree oils and all kinds of &#x27;miracle shamoos&#x27; that simply did not work 100%. Maple Holistics has been god sent. The winter duo is my absolute favorite. Yes, you will smell like spearmint fresh out of the shower but once it dries, it quickly subsides so do not be concerned about that. I can get away with washing once every 3 days easily, well my hair that is anyways. I also highly recommend the dead sea mud mask and the silk 18 conditioner works just as well and has a lovely vanilla scent. I can now successfully mock the herbal essence commercials with execution thanks to Maple Holistics. Oh and did I mention the cost for this magic in a bottle can be all yours for about just $12. That equates to about $6 and some change each! What have you got to lose, dandruff?</li>
            <li> Does get my hair softer but i don&#x27;t like the smell all that much. Outside of the smell, the product works well.</li>
            <li> I started highlighting my hair a few years ago when it started getting gray. Then, my hair began to look fake and over-processed, so I colored it medium brown. It then became brittle and dry, so I had salon treatments to soften it. However, the salon treatments didn&#x27;t last, so I&#x27;ve been looking for a good shampoo and conditioner that would leave my hair soft and clean. I&#x27;ve tried many, and usually the conditioner makes my hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, I was pleasantly surprised after using this product. Firstly, the shampoo is very light, minty and sudsy. It left my scalp so clean and refreshed--I had an ahhh feeling. I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hair felt so clean. At that point it was a little dry, but when I put on the&lt;br /&gt;conditioner, the tangles started coming undone. The conditioner isn&#x27;t greasy or thick--it&#x27;s creamy. Now, my hair feels light and soft.  Plus, it has movement. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Removes the &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; quality of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp. This doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all. And it&#x27;s the arctic feel I love.</li>
            <li> A good deal for the price. It gives my hair its smooth texture.</li>
            <li> this set is just not for me, my hair felt dried out and tangled.</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve purchased this item because I love it so much! Repeat  and very satisfied customer here!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and smooth. I love the feeling.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair feel so soft. I love the beautiful sent. I look forward to using these products often. I would order them again.</li>
            <li> It smelled great but left my hair oily and i didn&#x27;t use the conditioner at the roots.  Maybe good for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I just bought the Maple Holistics winter blend shampoo and conditioner and I love it! My hair is so soft I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of it. Normally my hair is frizzy and hard to manage but now it&#x27;s soft. I also just purchased the Argan oil shampoo and conditioner and I can&#x27;t wait to get it and try it out. I&#x27;m so thankful for this product.</li>
            <li> I delayed to write this review in order to get familiar with the product and how reliable it is. I have it for one and half months already. Hence, I am very satisfied with the shampoo and conditioner for what it does to my hair: makes them shiny and soft. Both products have delicate scent.  Moreover, I do not have to wash my hair for two days. Before I had to wash my hair every single day. Somehow this combination of these two products makes it last. I love it. I have long hair and the bottles are not even close to be empty, as I was initially hesitant having in mind price and amount. Well, it seems than finally I found a good quality hair products. I will definitely get it and/or experiment with other products from the Maple Holistics brand.</li>
            <li> Really liked this stuff. The shampoo does not tingle all that much for me, but I can smell the mint, which is refreshing.  The conditioner is very moisturizing AND it detangles.  I could actually get a comb through my long hair!</li>
            <li> I loved them!!!!!  I probably wash my hair way too much, but have very strong hot flashes where I end up drenched, so always feel the need to wash my hair.  I loved the soft minty scent of the shampoo, but it was a little drying for my already dry hair.  I am absolutely in love with the conditioner.  My hair was soft and smooth after using the conditioner, really did feel &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; and definitely not dry.  I would love to try other shampoos, too, but you cannot pry my hands off of the conditioner.  You will have to kill me to get it back!</li>
            <li> Coming across products that actually work as promised is very rare nowadays, let alone products that are &amp;#34;unbranded&amp;#34; so to speak. This is one of those products. The whole family uses it and we are all satisfied with the results. Shiny, Silky and soft hair all day long.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  The minty smell is mild, and this works the same as the regular shampoo I buy from Maple Holistics and the conditioner is basically the same thing as the Silk 18.  Well worth it to save lots of money by purchasing the set!</li>
            <li> Wow, this is the best shampoo I have ever used. It lathers with just a small amount. It clarifies and moisturizes. My hair is so shiny and the mint really helps my scalp. The conditioner is great too. It doesn&#x27;t take much . It is the first time I haven&#x27;t had tangles after shampooing. My husband tried it and he loves it. He is very particular about shampoo but he loves this. I will be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!  I have naturally curly hair that&#x27;s very out of control and this stuff helps keep it under control. Makes my hair soft and shine. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Great product, affordable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many brands of shampoo from least to most expensive and they have always disappointed me. Maybe not in every way, but they&#x27;ve always fallen short in one of: smell, feel, lather and finishing qualities of shine, bounce, and hydrating my hair. On a whim I bought this set. I thought,  &amp;#34;mmmmm, winter blend, mint. Sounds nice!&amp;#34; Well it IS nice. It&#x27;s a home run in all the above, and it even passes the multiple times shampoo test. You know, where the shampoo seemed pretty good for the first use but subsequently makes your hair heavy or something. I love this shampoo and conditioner. Too bad it&#x27;s a limited edition--who wants to wait for winter? Looking forward to trying other products from this company and hope they are as good!</li>
            <li> This is honestly (and I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews!) the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  You only need to use a small amount, the shampoo lathers nicely and leaves hair feeling squeaky clean (unlike other natural products I have tried) and the conditioner leaves hair unbelievably soft and comb-able.  My nieces came to visit and I used it on their hair at bath time.  I received a call from my sister in law later that night saying, &amp;#34;What did you use on their hair??  I need to get some!&amp;#34;.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> smelled wonderful and left my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I love this dynamic duo!  Both products are quite luxurious feeling, meaning a little bit goes a long way!  I get lots of lather with the shampoo, and the conditioner really moisturizes my hair well!  I love the tingly feeling on my scalp while I&#x27;m shampooing, which is a great feeling in the summer!  I have very long, VERY fine, straight hair, which I perm once a year for body and curl.  I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner every day now for about 2 weeks, and I&#x27;m so happy with the shine in my hair!  Also, I&#x27;m thrilled that the conditioner is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t way my expensive curls down!  Best of all, there are no harmful chemicals in it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair product junkie so this review is not written lightly.  This product is awesome.  After my first use my hair is soft and full of body.  What a deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  I actually use it in the summer but will also love it in the winter.  It leaves my hair smelling amazing and so smooth.  It&#x27;s my favorite shampoo and conditioner!  I will continue to order this.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is the best ive used so far!! it leaves my hair super soft after 1 use only!!! i would definetly recommend this duo to anyone who wants to see immediate change in just one use.</li>
            <li> I love these 2 products. My only complaint is that I wish they came in bigger bottles with a pump...My hair has so much shine and body...I will be back for more...&lt;br /&gt;Best, snowhugs</li>
            <li> good for my hair, really like the blend maple holistics made for the hair.</li>
            <li> These have a very aromatherapeutic, refreshing mint scent. It&#x27;s especially great for it&#x27;s &#x27;cooling&#x27; effect on the 90 plus degree summer days; it helps keep you from overheating. The only con is that I use TONS of conditioner for my very long hair, and it&#x27;ll be gone before I know it. Recommend for those with shorter hair, or that don&#x27;t use that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good sulfate free shampoo and conditioner combo for a while, and when I first used this product I can say that my search is over. My hair has never felt so clean and soft after using this. The smell is absolutely amazing, the mint extracts leave your hair and scalp smelling and feeling refreshed. I would definitely purchase this product again and I hope that this limited edition shampoo and conditioner does not go away anytime soon!</li>
            <li> Very nice shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve used many that work well but leave me feeling a little oily. I have oily hair so need something with a little suds to help wash out the oil and give me a clean feeling. This does the job with just a little lather so that you aren&#x27;t drying out your hair. Has a nice minty smell. Overall, Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I really love the scent of both the shampoo and the conditioner. Sweetly minty fresh scent. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to be effective so the bottles will last awhile.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is softer, shinier, and had better body after first use. The minty scent is great. This is an update to my review. I have now used the Maple Holistics Winter Blend Shampoo and Conditioner set for a full week. I have very fine and thinning hair and every time I shampoo my hair immediately feels thicker and as soon as I apply the conditioner my hair is silky soft. I love these products and will continue to use the Maple Holistics products. It doesn&#x27;t take much product to get great results. I highly recommend trying the Maple Holistics line of products.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, no itch, smells cold and very minty.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Really moisturizes hair. My first use and my hair felt so soft. I have naturally frizzy wavy hair. Without product my hair is a mess. I let my hair air dry no product after using this shampoo conditioner and it dried quite nicely and minimal frizz. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never smelled a better product! And it works so well. I love it so much, I use it all year round, not just in the winter!</li>
            <li> A BIG HELP TO MY SCALP. Good product, really nice execution.</li>
            <li> The mint shampoo makes your hair very clean. It leaves a cooling sensation. The conditioner is also great. It makes you hair very soft. I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Sure I bought this product in Summer, but I rarely turn down any peppermint themed product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always looking for products to use that are on the more natural end of the spectrum. In this case, I have fairly long hair and only wash my hair a few times a week. So I need something that works well, but not overly heavy of a product. I have been very pleased with this product. The minty smell is lovely, the feeling is a light but not overwhelming refreshing sensation. The hair brushes out easy after washing. The smell when dry is pleasant but not over whelming. My hair lasts 3-4 days without washing after using this product combo. So not only does this product meet my needs, it meets my budget. The price point is friendly and you get a lot of bang for your buck. I will not only buy this product again, but try other products this company offers. I was not compensated for this review and did pay the Amazon listed price.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite shampoo/conditioner. First of all, I love the mint - the smell, the tingle.. all of it.&lt;br /&gt;Second, my hair looks amazing. I always used products that I purchased from my stylist at the salon, but those days are over. This is my new favorite brand. I want to try them all!</li>
            <li> I still love using this! A magnificent shampoo and conditioner set that has helped me repair my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> This Winter Blend set is a smart purchase.  I  like the fresh mint smell which is not over bearing, it  leaves hair soft, shinny,  and less frizzy. A small amount is all it takes to lather up. My order came well packed and sooner than expected. I would not recommend  this product for every day use, it seems to over dry  scalp when used every day but now knowing that  I use it 2 to 3 times a week and am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE:  Since this 1st review I have reordered (1-1-16) this product and it is so good, smells so great,  that you can bet I will order it again in the future. Try it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> great shampoo and conditioner for hair and scalp</li>
            <li> I really liked this combination--you get really clean hair as well as a nice, light, and effective condition. Separately, the shampoo smells wonderful and helped alleviate some irritation on my scalp (I suffer from light dandruff at the base of my scalp) but I think I need something a little bit stronger to eradicate the dryness altogether.  The conditioner truly makes your hair feel wonderful. For me in particular, it did not act as a &amp;#34;detangler&amp;#34; once out of the shower so I use a little bit of Johnson &amp; Johnson No More Tears Detangler to help comb out my hair. This is not the case for the majority of users/reviewers so it really depends on the person &amp; type of hair. I am a Caucasian female with blonde hair down to the middle of my back and it is a combination of frizzy/kinky and wavy hair. Definitely prone to tangling! That being said, I love the way the conditioner makes my hair feel after I blowdry it. It is soft, clean, and LIGHT which is incredibly important considering the length of my hair. I typically cut my hair before it gets to this length from the sheer weight of it but I am able to let it continue to grow because of this conditioner. I recommend both shampoo and conditioner for their individual and combined properties and will definitely be purchasing the conditioner again!</li>
            <li> Been getting this almost every two months because this is the only shampoo that my husband and I will use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  Made my hair silky and left a faint minty scent.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I really like this set it left my hair very clean and it smells amazing</li>
            <li> Was kind of unsure of buying this set but was blown away at how soft it made my damaged hair feel...I love it and can&#x27;t wait to try other products.</li>
            <li> This company has a great conditioner.  It turns my &amp;#34;hay&amp;#34; (you know, that dry and frizzy tangled mess) into hair again. However, I have seen quite a rise in price since I started buying this brand. So, I have switched to their winter blend to save money.  I am concerned that they will continue to raise the price.  My loyalty to this company will remain if they can retain the quality along with the price.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner set works great on my curls. I&#x27;ve been trying a few different sulfate-free hair products over the past few months with little success, as the products I tried left my hair feeling dry. This shampoo is gentle and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dried out, and the oils in the conditioner make my hair feel silky - I run my fingers through my hair a lot more than I used to just because my hair feels so nice!</li>
            <li> this is very useful for repairing damaged hair., I am fond of the conditioner and the way that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too smooth.</li>
            <li> This has helped me deal with my rough hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner work great together!  The shampoo does dry my hair out a little but it still works much better than the shampoo I used to use. I also love the smell of both the conditioner and shampoo and I love that the smell lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this products because of all the great reviews on it. I have to say I am very happy that I bought this! I love the shampoo it literally leaves your hair squeaky clean! As for the condition I love it, my hair is less tangled after using it and it gives my hair so much more body. I wish it came in a bigger bottle but I definitely  will continue to purchase from Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> First time user and very impressed!</li>
            <li> Products arrived in perfect condition. Upon first using them, I have to say... The shampoo really deep cleanses your hair with all the mint ingredients which give a good clean feel to the hair. I have thick wavy frizzy oily hair and the shampoo really gets the job done. No messy residue or weird film was left in hair after wash. The conditioner smells amazing and goes on very smooth. I left it on for a good 10 mins and then rinsed it out. My hair felt soft, looked shiny, and smelled like minty vanilla! Wonderful purchase. Love it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the smell but the worst part was it made my hair dry</li>
            <li> Wonderful minty smell and leaves hair feeling fresh and clean! Definitely would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing. The smell is wonderful, and quite refreshing. My hair feels soft, smells good, and looks really good. I was worried it would be like washing my hair in mouth wash or tooth paste, but it&#x27;s a quite pleasant mint. My skin feels kind of tingly, or it sort of has that stimulated feeling like when you chew minty gum or when you just brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Will probably be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This is the first &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; shampoo I&#x27;ve tried that lathered and made my hair feel truly clean...The first time I used it I thought to myself I need to order more so that I never run out! I love it,  it smells great, and my hair loves it too!</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner!!  Makes my hair very healthy.</li>
            <li> Amazing smelling, both the shampoo and conditioner! I love the fresh feel the shampoo gives my scalp when applying. When rinsing out, it feels my hair is &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;. After a few more applications, I will decide if I will use this as my daily shampoo, or as more of a clarifying shampoo. I can see it will work well for my dry, flaky scalp. The conditioner left my hair feeling soft and seems to give it good volume. I needed to use a little more than I would my normal conditioner. I love that these are sulfate free, natural products!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a couple of months and they work nicely. My hair feels different while washing it with this. Kind of like its clarifying. Leaves my hair VERY shiny, light and bouncy. I only use the conditioner on the ends not the root (by habit) and it seems to work well in this manner. The shampoo has a nice peppermint scent and a soft warm vanilla conditioner. Very pleasant. I plan to stick with this brand on my next purchase. I like the idea of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great product. I gave to my little sister because her exzema is worse than mine and it cleared her itchy head right up. I wI&#x27;ll definitely be buying/ using this brand again</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products that makes my hair feel healthy again. It does exactly what it says; there is not much to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not picky with my shampoo as long as it smells great and this fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> My wife and I are big into all natural shampoo, soap, and conditioner.  If I don&#x27;t use a natural product I get a very itchy scalp and flaky scalp.  This is the 2nd time we purchased this and we both really love the quality.  It smells very good too (very minty) and we will continue to use.  Very good price too compared to similar brands at health food stores.</li>
            <li> These smell wonderful and leave my hair amazing. I just wish they came in 16oz size.</li>
            <li> The winter blend shampoo and conditioner are just what I had hoped for. I can easily go three or four days without washing and still feel clean! It&#x27;s a tingly and fresh blend of mints (especially helpful during colds...opens up the sinuses and relieves headaches) my hair is beautiful, full and shines! This company never ceases to amaze me!</li>
            <li> I have used Maple Holistics Argan Oil Shampoo and the Silk 18 conditioner and I love them both. They leave my hair soft and the conditioner never leaves my hair oily like some other products do. Lately I have been obsessed with using my peppermint essential oil in everything so when I went to order some more shampoo I saw this set and decided to give it a try. We have eliminated using toxins and dangerous chemicals in our household and try to look for the most natural choice available in any product. Yes this product does have a long ingredient list and some of the ingredients have a low toxicity rating on EWG but it certainly has gentler ingredients and more plant-based ingredients than most of the hair/beauty products out there (no sulfates, no parabens, no artificial scent). I have tried almost every brand of hair care products carried by Whole Foods and Sprouts in search of something safe and that actually works. Many of the ones I have tried have shorter ingredient lists or easily identifiable ingredients but they left my hair a dried-out, tangled nightmare. The shampoo and conditioners from Maple Holistics are my happy medium. They are safe, natural and they work wonders on my hair. The Winter Blend shampoo and conditioner set also smells amazing. I cannot stand fake scents and have a sensitivity to any kind of artificial perfume/scent. Both the conditioner and shampoo smell like natural mint and they don&#x27;t leave your scalp feeling overly tingly. They just fill your shower with a delicious, happy, minty smell. Both products leave my hair feeling clean, soft, and moisturized and I feel better knowing it has no carcinogenic or animal ingredients. I honestly have loved every product I have purchased from them and will continue to support Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> I felt that it dried out my fine, curly hair, but the smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Unlike other sulfate-free shampoos, this shampoo from Maple Holistics washed my hair thoroughly. I often treat my hair with hair oils, and the shampoo was strong enough to properly wash my hair. The conditioner is nice, not as rich as the conditioner I am used to (which contains silicons), but richer than the silicone-free conditioner from V05. I have very dry lengths which I haven&#x27;t cut in years, and was pleased to see the conditioner makes them very soft. I like the minty scent and tingling effect it has on my scalp. Cannot wait to try out more of their hair products!</li>
            <li> winter blend is such an awesome feeling on the head. I might just buy another one of this!</li>
            <li> Makes for an excellent hair care product. I stay directly under sunlight every weekend because of my mountain hiking trips. I have reversed sun damage just using this set.</li>
            <li> After wanting to switch common shampoo and conditioner I started a research I was convinced from all the positives reviews and you know what.&lt;br /&gt;It´s better thank I expected my hair looks great after using it for 2 weeks I would recommend you to try it.&lt;br /&gt;100% natural&lt;br /&gt;100% great for my hair</li>
            <li> I can not say better words about this set of shampoo, they are small, I know, but compare to regular shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;ve used before, you only need to use about 1/2-1/3 of regular amount per time, and you get rich foam already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the smell of this product is THE BEST. My hair stays with fresh minty smell even at the 2nd day (I wash my hair every other day). I have thin, dry and colored hair, this product gives a soft, but not greasy, not flat but a bit puffy look of my hair. I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> I really liked the shampoo and conditioner blend.  I recently had a Brazilian Blowout, which require that I maintain the style using sulfate-free shampoo.  I wanted to try something different than just buying the sulfate free shampoo sold by Brazilian Blowout or other popular brand name.  Dime-sized shampoo is all I needed to clean my hair, and I feel very comfortable with only washing my hair once a week.  I did have a bit of a problem with dandruff, but it went away after regular use of the shampoo and conditioner.  I would definitely try other products by Maple Holistics.  It was a pleasant find.</li>
            <li> I  have been &amp;#34;poo-free&amp;#34; for two years. After trying the bk soda and vinegar, honey ,and other no poo options my hair was like straw. I decided to try the maple holistics line after reading all the reviews and l am so glad I did! The winter blend shampoo was wonderful but what I was really thrilled with was the conditioner. I have wavy below shoulder length hair that was very dry and frizzy. After using the silk conditioner my hair was sooooo soft and bouncy. My hair is thin so I was afraid the conditioner would weight it down but it didn&#x27;t! My hair has never looked this good. I am so happy to find a natural shampoo that is safe to use and makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li> I recieved this combo last christmas from my mother , she has always liked the quality of the maple holistics line , I have very dry limp hair , the shampoo made my hair feel very clean and the conditioner made my hair extremely soft and managable , I was amazed by the way my hair felt that I have never gotten from any other shampoo and conditioner , I would reccomend this product to anyone experiencing the winter blues on their hair ....Great products! I will be buying again in the near future!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner, makes my hair smell like minty vanilla. The mint shampoo also clean really well and top it off with Silk 18, your hair will feel silky smooth. Great winter scent and I definitely recommend this product for those winter scent lover out there or for anyone who just want a good shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love the product! Smell is good and not overwhelming. My hair definitely feels softer after using this for a week and a half. The only downfall in my opinion is the size of the bottles. Great for traveling for a week or two, but I like to buy in bulk so I don&#x27;t have to shop as often. I will buy again but I will probably use this as a once a week treat rather than everyday. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This combination is unbeatable. It contains ingredients you can actually pronounce. It is natural and real, I too am a natural women and we all deserve this much help to feel beautiful. Thank you for making an incredible product Maple Holistics! It works anytime of the year but I found it most helpful during cold months when my hair took a beating from being outside! It lathers rich and the conditioner is great! When you blow dry, if you&#x27;re looking for volume, you&#x27;ll need to add another product as this will not produce large chemical like hair like the salon will.</li>
            <li> Great set, would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like the products as they seems to do a good job for being holistic. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect so I was happy. The shampoo is very minty and maybe a touch too strong for me as I&#x27;m not much of a mint person but I think others will like the product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the shampoo and it cleans my hair well. The conditioner also has a great smell and is super creamy. It leaves my hair super soft and not greasy. Love the ingredients of both, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I stayed up late surfing Amazon for dandruff shampoos and treatments. It&#x27;s August in Memphis, which equates to hot as hell, yet there&#x27;s snow on my shoulders. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, because yes, I want to build a snowman, but I&#x27;d prefer it to be, oh say...winter? But I digress. Like the chick from the Breakfast Club, I tried baking soda, vinegar, tea tree oil, Head and Shoulders, and the permanent pony tail. It&#x27;s just disheartening to always have your hair pulled up. It&#x27;s also saddening when you can&#x27;t sneeze without peeing on yourself or causing a blizzard. Sorry, not sorry for the TMI. I&#x27;m a mom, I get to overshare. So...late night Amazon shopping, found this shampoo, bought it, and it arrived today. I couldn&#x27;t wait to take a shower. Of course, as mentioned, I&#x27;m a mom so that&#x27;s not really anything new. BUT...I had my new shampoo that promised me a refreshing minty scent, and a tingly scalp (I&#x27;ll take tingly anywhere these days). It was like taking a shower with a York peppermint patty. Cool, refreshing, but no guilt. I love the smell; it&#x27;s just refreshing and clean, unlike my home. Usually all my hard earned money quickly disappears with &amp;#34;responsibilities&amp;#34; (boring), but this may become one of my selfish purchases. I want my snow days to be over. I want to expand my wardrobe from light colored tops to what has always been impossible...black!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I love this set. It&#x27;s only been one day, and I&#x27;m ready to commit like a love-crazed teenager.</li>
            <li> This was cheap and this is really something that helps me in my everyday toils with wax on my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this combo, i have less hair falling out using this. Plus the smell and feel of your hair is unbelieveable when using it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, by far the best shampoo I have used. My hair is really thick and coarse and I love how smooth it makes my hair look and feel:)</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it makes your hair feel!</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner for my dry scalp, chemically and colored treated hair when I came upon the Maple Holistics Wintery Blend shampoo and conditioner.  To say the least the shampoo and conditioner combo works as described and the scent is very intoxicating!  They do wonders for my itchy dry scalp and brittle hair throughout the wintery blister cold during this time of year.  I will definitely be on the lookout for other shampoos and conditioners offered by this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I have used this set a few times now.  I really like it.  This leaves my hair feeling clean and like hair.  There is no product build up, my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped, my hair feels like hair.  The shampoo smells minty and fresh. My hair was frizzy and unmanageable.  I would use  a smoothing serum just to battle the frizz. I do not need that serum after using the Silk 18 conditioner.  I can also go one to two days without having to wash my hair.  I would recommend these products.</li>
            <li> Great product and keeps my hair soft even in the dead of winter! LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I TRY TO USED NATURAL AND ORGANIC PRODUCTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCTS AND I HAVE USED IT TWICE. I LOVE HOW SOFT, MANAGEABLE AND SILKY MY HAIR IS AFTER USING IT. I WILL RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE TO TRY THESE PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> I bought this because everyone said it was amazing, and unfortunately it made my hair dry. I had to also use a leave in conditioner just to make it manageable.</li>
            <li> The mint shampoo is very refreshing with a smell that is multi-layered and deeper than the average mint scent. It&#x27;s very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have frizzy/curly/dry hair so I was curious to see what the silk, vanilla conditioner would do for me. It works wonderfully! It makes my hair look and feel far less dry. My one problem is with the vanilla scent, to me it smells like a combination of vanilla, flowers, and a sickly sweet perfume. However, I will continue to use this product because it works so well.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my mother. She said she is very happy with this combination.</li>
            <li> Just started using this and so far I like it fine.  Bought this to try as soon as I finish the name brand Im currently using.  My hair was soft and manageable.  Will update if problems arise but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I like it, I don&#x27;t love it.  I&#x27;ve always been very particular about my hair products - Always sulfate/paraben free.  I was a regular user of Purology but wanted to see if less expensive products stood up to the test.  Sadly, so far, not so good.  I have highlighted hair so I need extra moisture.  This shampoo doesn&#x27;t moisturize nearly as much as Purology Hydrate or Joico Moisture Recovery.  The other thing I noticed is that my hair isn&#x27;t as shiny - it&#x27;s a matte looking clean.  Meh.  I love that it&#x27;s all natural and the smell is nice (the mint shampoo smells like Spearmint flavored Extra gum and the Silk 18 conditioner smells like marshmallow), but it&#x27;s not quite enough for me to repurchase.  I would still recommend to anyone that&#x27;s looking for an inexpensive natural shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  A little goes a long way and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li> We received this pack as a gift. Both the shampoo and conditioner are of good quality. What&#x27;s even more impressive is the very good price that is displayed on this website. Will certainly order this pack from here in the nearest future</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner. I ordered it because it was sulfate free and for the mint in the shampoo. The shampoo is super minty but not too intense and feels great on your scalp. The conditioner has a pleasant scent from the vanilla and does a great job of smoothing out typically fuzzy hair. I would buy this product again. I hope they keep this around all year.</li>
            <li> Excellent packing! Arrived on time and the shampoo and conditioner are both great, very minty feel on the scalp which is soothing for anytime not just winter in my opinion. Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> the best shampoo and conditioner set. this is like a good vinyl album for those music junkies or a killer car engine for the car lovers.</li>
            <li> Recently, my hair stylist told me she could tell I was using drugstore shampoo.  She said most of the store shampoos are filled with chemicals that strip the hair and waxes that continually build up.  So I started hunting for a natural shampoo.  I began by looking through the name-brands carried by many hair salons but I found that many of them had the exact same ingredients as my cheap shampoo.  Then, I happened to find this set and loved the natural ingredient list!  I have naturally curly hair (that has a big problem with frizz in the summer), which I often style with heat.  When I began using this set, I quickly noticed a change in my hair.  First off, my strands of hair actually felt cleaner.  The shampoo in this set really does leave the hair &amp;#34;squeaky clean,&amp;#34; as one reviewer remarked, however, it has never left my hair feeling dried out or stiff.  The conditioner is also very moisturizing.  The best part about this set is the scent!  My husband said he can smell the mint just walking by the bathroom when I&#x27;m in the shower.  Even though this is a &amp;#34;winter blend,&amp;#34; it is perfectly cooling for the summer, and it feels great after a workout.  The shampoo and conditioner consistently leave my hair and scalp feeling clean and moisturized, and my hair is now super-soft!  I plan to order more products from Maple Holistics in the future!</li>
            <li> I am a little too obsessed with my hair and ever since losing it all with Lupus I take extremely good care of it (and myself!). I&#x27;ve tried soo many natural brands over the last 8 years: Aubrey Organics (Rose Hip line), Acure (Moroccan Argan Stem Cell + Argan Oil line), Alaffia Dry Coconut line, Pure peppermint soaps, etc I&#x27;ve spent lots finding something I really love. Nothing gets my hair so CLEAN on my scalp and conditions so well my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle.  I was super impressed with the smell and the lathering of the shampoo.  I get a dry scalp and hair SO quickly. I LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for almost 2 weeks now.  The shampoo is great and has pleasant light minty scent; however, I have used many other conditioners better than this one.  My have greasy scalp but dry hair, the shampoo does a great job getting the oil and grease out of my scalp leaves my hair feeling soft and clean.  However, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t do much.  That&#x27;s why I am giving this set a 4 not 5.</li>
            <li> Good product. All natural and organic.</li>
            <li> didnt really work for my thick hair but smells good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the winter blend shampoo for a while now, and I must say, it&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair and scalp feel incredibly clean, and there is no build up whatsoever (I problem I&#x27;ve had with most other shampoos). This means I can go without washing my hair for an additional day, meaning I only need to shampoo once every other day. My hair also feels smooth and soft, which is doubly difficult for my color treated and heat styled hair. But the best part is the smell. I have a real love of mint, and most soaps and lotions I buy are mint scented. This has a wonderful, bright crisp mint scent, but it&#x27;s also a little sweet. It&#x27;s a bit like washing my hair with mint ice cream, delicious! The only negative I can find is that the product isn&#x27;t available year round. Right now I&#x27;m alternating using the winter blend with the tea tree oil shampoo (also from Maple Holistics) to make it last longer. Please MH, consider making this permanent and not limited edition!</li>
            <li> Great set! I love the smell and clean feel after use! I would especially recommend it to folks who have oily hair.</li>
            <li> makes your hair frizzy if you have any type of thick or curly hair</li>
            <li> Trying the read the labels of most hair products brings flashbacks to organic chemistry class.  These labels are much more straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-natural is what I wanted, to reduce the amount of chemicals that could be potentially endocrine-disrupting (messing with your hormones).  I&#x27;m not a tree-hugger, either; I need something to clean and condition my hair.  This stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon purchase, I was worried that I&#x27;d smell like a candy cane, but that smell is fleeting -- great to open the sinuses in the shower, but then rinses away as you&#x27;d expect.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast..This is a great product. Smells amazing i have dry frizzy hair &amp;tried so many products. .This is the ONE !!!!! I Saw a difference after 1use...No need to look further! !!</li>
            <li> My mother ordered some of this because I have deader than dead hair.</li>
            <li> My aging hair is cleaner and softer than it has been in a long while!</li>
            <li> I have a sweaty scalp but this helps prevent that. Like deo for hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this shampoo and conditioner because of the smell.  I was expecting something more minty, cooling or refreshing instead it smelled like I&#x27;d opened a couple of packs of mint gum and applied them to my hair.  I have wavy/curly hair that tends to frizz easily and this product didn&#x27;t really help with the frizz. The curls looked decent but again I didn&#x27;t like that I spent the day smelling like gum.  If you don&#x27;t mind the smell of mint gum this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this product was the smell. It smells like Doublemint chewing gum in my opinion. I love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I noticed was that when I poured the shampoo into my hand, it was thick and luxurious feeling. It lathered beautifully, much better than other organic type shampoos I have used in the past. The only issue I had with it was that my hair felt a little dry once I was done rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then used the conditioner based on previous experience with conditioners, as there were no directions on the bottle. It rinsed well, and my hair no longer felt dry. I am happy so far with this product based on one use alone. Will update if further usage changes that opinion.</li>
            <li> Product was received late due to weather. Love the product so far. Have only been using for a couple of weeks but I do notice a difference in the appearance of my hair. My hair is long and coarse,  w/ this combo it feels much softer to the touch w/out me having to spend forever and a day blow drying it out. I can let air dry and it still feels soft. Both shampoo and conditioner  are very fragrant which is also a huge plus for me. Who knew peppermint and vanilla would smell so lovely together.</li>
            <li> These Winter Blend products arrived at my house on the first day of spring (when it was still pretty chilly where I live), and I&#x27;ve been using them for a week now. I&#x27;ve become sensitive to artificial fragrances, but these products have a cheerful, minty fragrance that doesn&#x27;t give me a headaches. Both products are thicker and more concentrated than my usual shampoo and conditioner, so I use only about half as much as other products require. Although expensive, I think this shampoo and conditioner may be worth the cost.  The shampoo leaves my hair squeaky clean and shiny. I don&#x27;t know if it controls dandruff, because I alternate this Winter Blend shampoo with a dandruff shampoo.  I have fine hair that goes wild in cold weather. This conditioner alleviates static cling (flyaway hair) and adds body and volume without weighing my hair down. (I use just a small amount and leave it in rather than rinse it out.)  [Maple Holistics gave me a free bottle of conditioner as a reward for writing this review. They didn&#x27;t require that the review to be positive, just sincere. Revised 3/28/15.]</li>
            <li> This product smells so good &amp; makes my hair feel clean and health, I suggest it if you don&#x27;t want harsh chemicals in your hair or on your scalp. The description does however mention a third conditioner called Silk 18 and from what I understood I thought that came along with the order, it&#x27;s somewhat confusing because I did not receive the 3rd product so I can only assume it does not come with the order, maybe the vendor is just advertising. All in all its a great product, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love mint. I bought this because of the good ingredients and the fact that mint wakes me up in the morning.  It has a nice lather and the conditioner didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. It seemed to help smooth frizzy hair and it was safe for my color treated hair. Even though it states winter blend, I know from using it that it won&#x27;t be a problem in warmer weather.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo and conditioner for the first time, my hair already felt muck silkier than ever before. I also love the smell of these products--the shampoo has a lovely minty scent and the conditioner smells like vanilla. The shampoo also has a bit of a cooling sensation that feels great. These products are a bit on the pricey side but I think it&#x27;s worth it for how nice they made my hair feel. I would highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> Amazing, have been struggling with goopy dry hair and have tried many shampoos, this really made a difference finally. Love the winter blend shampoo smells great and the conditioner really seems to help.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo with a mint fragrance that wouldn&#x27;t wash out my red hair color so quickly.  I bought this because it was sulfate free &amp; that&#x27;s what washes the color out.  This is FABULOUS shampoo &amp; conditioner.  On the plus side also, it made me so hungry smelling it...lol.  I love the mint fragrance...even had my hubby come smell it.  I will definitely use this from now on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews for most products that I order. However, this shampoo + conditioner combo went above and beyond any other hair product that I&#x27;ve previously used. I&#x27;m a guy that had dry, brittle hair and every product that I&#x27;ve tried in the past seems to contribute to the dryness. After seeing all of the positive reviews from other buyers, I decided to give this product a try. After a week of using both the shampoo and conditioner, I noticed a major improvement in my hair. It became softer and more manageable. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and I will most likely buy it again once I run out.</li>
            <li> Just received and have used it once. Hair is very soft - and - no sulfites.&lt;br /&gt;Very fragrant. Shampoo smells like peppermint and the conditioner like cookies.</li>
            <li> I have joked with a friend that I should have a garage sale with all the hair products I own that I&#x27;ve used once or twice and never again.&lt;br /&gt;My shampoo and conditioner (by a well known company) were leaving my hair dry and nasty.  I have color treated hair and was pretty desperate when I did an Amazon search for yet another shampoo for my hair. After finding this shampoo and reading the reviews AND the companies guarantee, I ordered the Winter Blend and conditioner Silk 18 combo and waited for it to arrive.  I have used it about 4 times now and didn&#x27;t want to review it until I had used it a bit.  I LOVE IT!  I am shocked at how good my hair looks after using it and the shine that it has.  I have extremely thick, but fine short hair and I can get away with just blowing it dry, but if I go over it a bit with a curling iron- OHMYGOSH- the shine is amazing.  Have already recommended this to my &amp;#34;garage sale friend&amp;#34; and she just got hers.  I am anxious to see how she likes it! :-)</li>
            <li> I thought these were fairly pricy but just had a keratin treatment and needed to purchase phosphate free prpducts. The reviews for these were good so I tried. I was very satisfied, although they do not lather too well but I learned to use smaller amount, to make it last, and add water.  The product lasted as long spas other products, I was very satisfied.  I had another keratin treatment and decide to try a strore bought, cheaper sulfate free product. HUGE MISTAKE.  My hair felt thick abd course abd I worried it ruined the keratin treatment. That night I reordered these products and am now a dedicated customer.  Best ever.</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells and makes my hair feel, will be purchasing more when mine runs out :)</li>
            <li> I was researching hair products and found these, bought them on a whim.  It has 5 mint essential oils, so I was a little afraid it would be super minty, but the mint is not so strong.  It says &amp;#34;winter blend&amp;#34; but it is very refreshing, really perfect for spring and summer, or after sports when I really want to refresh my scalp!  I was surprised how gentle these are, and they are sulfate free - these would be great for people who exercise often and have to wash hair a lot, but don&#x27;t want to damage hair with too much shampooing.  I used them together, and it left my hair clean yet very soft and not weighed down!  I am very happy with the performance and results these gave me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I am not happy about is the price- $20 for 8 oz each shampoo and conditioner is definitely on a pricey side for me, so I will use them sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This is NOT a sponsored post, I have purchased these on my own, with my personal funds.*</li>
            <li> Good for the scalp. The pair seem to bring life back to drab hair. I use it in summer also</li>
            <li> I bought the winter blend shampoo/silk 18 conditioner a couple of months ago and ended up loving it! I have a greasy scalp but dry hair, and had been endlessly looking for a conditioner that moisturized my hair but didn&#x27;t add to the grease on my scalp. Just after a couple of days of using these 2 products together my hair was immediately silkier and felt soft. I would definitely recommend the silk 18 conditioner for people who have dry, course hair. I would also recommend the winter blend shampoo to people with a greasy scalp, it cleanses and degreases the scalp very well. I learned of Maple Holistics Degreaser shampoo after I bought this set, so I am really hoping to try that one next. Based on my satisfaction with this shampoo and conditioner, I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful.  I feel like I should put it in Hot Chocolate and drink it (don&#x27;t do that).  I will definitely buy their shampoos again.</li>
            <li> These two products are absolutely amazing. They smell GREAT and make my hair feel amazing. I will continue to buy this as long as its available.</li>
            <li> Ladies,&lt;br /&gt;If you have hard water and can&#x27;t afford a water softener, then buy this set! I&#x27;ve spent so much money on shampoos and conditioners trying to find the miracle worker. This is it! And wonderful customer service too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! The winter blend smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and I liked the idea of these products being sulfate free and all-natural. The shampoo has a great minty fragrance, very invigorating for the winter. It has a nice lather despite being sulfate free. The shampoo didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me as other reviewers have noted, but I did like it, it just seemed my hair was kind of tangled initially after rinsing it out. Not really a big deal since I was going to follow up with the conditioner anyway. The Silk 18 conditioner is great! I like the way it makes my hair smooth without weighing it down, which has been an issue with other conditioners. I try to only wash my hair every other day or every third day, but with other shampoos and conditioners I have had to use dry shampoo on non wash days due to the oiliness the next day. However, with this the next day it is not greasy at all and still smooth, and it looks clean as though it was washed the same day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll most definitely keep using the Silk 18 when this bottle is gone. I may try one of the other shampoo formulas when the Winter Blend is gone.</li>
            <li> I didnt buy this myself, but was a gift to me because I have dry and damaged hair! I was having a hard time find a combo that actually worked for me...so a friend of mine, gave me this. She swears by it, and after using it, i do too! Thank you for making a product that actually works! Doesnt weigh hair down at all!</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this product to me due to my very dry, aging, colored, medication affected hair. Yes, I have that all going on...and some hair loss as well! I have been using this for just one week and I LOVE how my hair feels-soft and bouncy!! I enjoy the tingling clean feeling while waiting the 2-3 minutes of allowing the shampoo to do its work on my scalp. The conditioner is really helping with the dryness of my hair! Added bonus - my curls are springing back to life!! I strongly recommend this product. There is a money back guarantee so you have no reason to not try it, but I do not believe you will seek a refund. I have purchased a pack for each of my daughters to place in their Christmas stockings this year!!</li>
            <li> Right after I used the shampoo and conditioner I felt an immediate difference in my hair. I was tired of having dry fluffy hair, I&#x27;ve been using pert 2 in one forever. You have to give this a try if you&#x27;re curious, they work great together. My hair is nice and silky smooth. I will be buying from now on. Side note, you don&#x27;t have to use much of the shampoo to get your head lathered up, so this will last as long as my pert bottle that was twice the size.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and both products were properly sealed. Both bottles were full to the brim with the products - no rip off there. The shampoo has a nice tingly effect, especially while leaving it in for 2-3 min as recommended. I&#x27;m a huge fan of peppermint oil because it has helped clear my jaw acne (I put a dab on my jaw every night after washing my face) and so I really like this in a shampoo. I have noticed more softness and strength in my hair and I believe this is the conditioner&#x27;s work - particularly the argan oil in it. I appreciate that this company does their hair research and uses good, natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Maple Holistics has done it again. I love this shampoo and conditioner. It was delivered on time. It does stop the static electricity. I can tell the difference. The more I use it the better it gets. I love all their products!!</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely damaged from bleaching it for years. I finally decided to go to the salon to dye my hair for the last time, back to my natural color and let it grow out. I have very average hair, it&#x27;s not too thick it&#x27;s not thin. It&#x27;s straight as well. I received this as a Christmas gift and I love it! The shampoo smells so delightful and it awakings my scalp in the morning, and the conditioner is perfect, not oily and I only have to use a dime size amount. And the funny thing is, friends and coworkers noticed how healthy and shiny my hair is now. On top of that its full volume these have no chemicals weighing my hair down. I definitely will be purchasing again. A million times better then wen!</li>
            <li> Very very good products from these guys I recommend everyone try these out! They work awesome!!</li>
            <li> I was using a much more expensive salon product but my scalp began to itch after shampooing and conditioning.  I was constantly scratching and was very uncomfortable.  I read about Maple Holistics and decided to try the winter Blend because of other reviews and because the mint and eucalyptus sounded like it would be very soothing.  My scalp stopped itching after the very first washing and the shampoo and the condition smell great and leave my scalp feeling fresh and Clean.  I have ordered this set three times and I am a convert.  These are amazing products!</li>
            <li> This product was o-k. I can say that I will not be purchasing this shampoo combo again. During the winter months my hair tends to be dry and it sheds more. I have pretty thick, curly 3b hair. I bought this shampoo because of the ingredients listed. It seemed to contain great essential oils, but it did not do my hair justice. My hair has felt more dry and lost its sheen. I think that the &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; edition maybe too harsh and strip my hair of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> I look for pure ingredients that offer clean fresh scents as well as making my hair feel healthy and look great. These products gave me that and more. I live in the Northeast where the winters are cold and indoors are dry. My hair truly benefited from these and the scent was devine.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for my scalp and conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and Conditioner not only smell wonderful, but work great! I&#x27;ve used other all natural shampoo and conditioner in the past and it left my hair feeling gross and I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through it after my shower. The Maple Holistics set left my hair feeling soft, shiny and it was very easy to comb through. I would definitely recommend these products to anyone looking for an all natural solution that works well. My hair is fairly fine, shoulder length and straight.</li>
            <li> you know what shampoo brand smells better than this one? this one.</li>
            <li> if you want the best for your hair and not those cheap knock-offs somewhere else that pose as something that it&#x27;s not, then this is the product that you should buy! :))</li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair from bleaching blonde.  After doing research on these, I would really like to try them to fix the damage I have done.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for awhile! They are AMAZING and currently the ONLY products I will use. I had damaged, unmanageable hair and NOW IT&#x27;S GORGEOUS!</li>
            <li> I was researching sulfate-free shampoo after noticing my usual shampoos weren&#x27;t doing anything for my hair anymore. I noticed that Maple Holistics had a lot of great reviews so I decided to give this a try. When I initially received the shampoo and conditioner I thought the bottles were a little smaller than expected but I kept in mind that maybe I won&#x27;t have to use a lot of product (I have long hair that goes just past the middle of my back).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for almost two weeks and am very impressed! I was right about not having to use a lot of product, all I really need is about a tablespoon. The shampoo has a nice smell and keeps my hair very clean much longer than previous shampoos I&#x27;ve used (my hair is normally very oily). As far as the conditioner goes I feel like my hair is a lot shinier and softer which is a great improvement from what it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this shampoo and conditioner and would recommend for anyone to try it. If there are any changes I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make the change to a more natural and sulfate-free shampoo so I choose this based on the reviews. Let me tell you they were all right! My hair is fine, fragile and gets super greasy in just a days time if I don&#x27;t wash it. No more :) I waited a full month to see how this would transform my hair and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. It is stronger, smooth and shiny. The shampoo and conditioner have a wonderful soft smell which I appreciate, I hate being enveloped in strong smells. I was also impressed with the customer service. After about a week from my purchase they contacted to asked how I was liking the product and offered me a coupon. I did not expect them to reach out and be so courteous without being prompted. Between that and the product they have got me hooked.</li>
            <li> I waited a month to write this review so I had a really good idea of how these worked for me.  I am in love with these products!  They have absolutely transformed my hair.  I have thick, wavy, frizzy hair.  Not anymore...my hair is smooth, silky soft and very shiny.  I&#x27;ve been getting compliments from my friends about how great it looks!  I have been using natural shampoos/conditioners for awhile now and they always left a build up that required a weekly ACV rinse.  I have found the Maple Holistics products don&#x27;t leave a build up at all.  Love the scent on both the shampoo and conditioner.  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely dry, and brittle, I am pleased with there product.</li>
            <li> I bought this set hopeful it would add some shine to my dull, lifeless hair secondary to pregnancy.  Most people get fabulous hair while pregnant....not this girl.  Anyway, let me start with the shampoo.  It smells heavenly!! I love, love, love the scent!!  I leave it on my hair just a bit longer than necessary to enjoy the scent!  The conditioner is amazing!  My hair is soft and manageable and has its shine back!!  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for almost a month now. I love them, they leave my hair soft and easy to manage. I have much less frizz since I started using maple products. Also, just a small amount of shampoo is enough for my mid-length hair. Finally, they smell really good. The minty scent of shampoo is amazing. I&#x27;ll keep using them...</li>
            <li> absolutely love the shampoo and conditioner. I was using another common&lt;br /&gt;brand that was stripping my hair. I noticed a difference within one wash&lt;br /&gt;and am extremely happy. This doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily and can wash my hair&lt;br /&gt;every other day without it looking greasy. I am extremely happy and looking&lt;br /&gt;forward to continue using your products :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt more clean and refreshed after getting out the shower before using the shampoo and conditioner. I can literally feel the combination of all the various mints massaging my scalp. I&#x27;ll just keep rubbing the shampoo through my hair for longer than I should, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. Definitely worth investing into.</li>
            <li> whether thin or thick hair, this blend would be the best for your scalp&#x27;s needs!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time for me to purchase a set, simply because the container is cute. Honestly, I just received the shampoo and conditioner, the flavor is good, and I&#x27;ll have a try immediately.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!!!  The shampoo makes my hair feel clean without stripping it. The conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and silky without weighing it down or leaving a buildup on my scalp. Prior to using these products, my hair had damage from coloring and felt like straw. Now, it feels clean, soft, and silky. I threw all my other products away. Yes, it&#x27;s that good!  Thanks Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> so far so good. the shampoo feels like a clarifying one - leaves my hair feeling weightless and free of residue. I would prefer the conditioner to be more creamy but it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down either so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> The shampoo keeps my scalp cool, while the conditioner makes my hair, severely treated with colors and hair products, feel smoother, not greasy  and nicer altogether.</li>
            <li> Invigorating, cleansing and made my hair feel soft and healthy! I will continue purchasing this great duo of products!</li>
            <li> Just bought this duo and couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did!  My hair felt light and clean after I showered and the smell of the Mint oils woke me and my brain up.  Can&#x27;t wait to try some other products.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good shampoo and conditioner for my fine, dry, limp hair.  I stumbled across this and saw some good reviews and decided to try it.  I am so glad I did!  The smell of the shampoo and conditioner is divine and the smell lingers in your hair for a long time after washing.  Secondly, it works great! After the first wash I definitely noticed a difference as my hair was softer and shinier.  I will continue to buy this as I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Great value and very nice shampoo &amp; conditioner. Scent is great!</li>
            <li> Just used this one time and the difference I can tell already!!! I have tried so many shampoos and conditioners for years, this one is the best by far better than any name brand!!! It smells good, tingle feeling of coolness on the scalp is awesome....leaves no build up behind...I have had the dryest scalp and dandruff and this stuff wiped it out..I don&#x27;t feel the need to itch it anymore I feel a cooling sensation even after my hair was so dry and now it actually looks and feels so much better not frizzy at all....totally unbelievable... You have got to try this you will never use anything else!!!! I am so glad someone has finally made a product worth every penny thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> Gives that very thorough cleaning and leaves a wonderful scent on my hair. I have shown this to my mother and asked her to use this too because I know she likes mint on everything.</li>
            <li> Everything is all right with this shampoo and conditioner pack. Cool feeling, clean head.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo/conditioner. Very fresh feeling. It is so nice treating my hair and scalp to healthy ingredients. Great too that it is made in the USA. This will definitely be reordered especially since my scalp tends to get dry in the winter months.</li>
            <li> Good conditioner that helps my hair grow back without the old, bad things clinging to it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work on my aging hair.  Need a combo that is more moisturizing.  Tough to find when opting for more natural products.  If any one out there has a suggestion for dry, aging and curly hair, luv to hear.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are a perfect pair. I works wonderfully for those that have thin, delicate or dyed hair because it hydrates so well. I have been using a variety of scents from Maple Holistics for about 6 months and I really can&#x60;t use anything else anymore. My son, 8 years old, likes the scents and it is so gentle on his eyes. It is the best for us! Thank you.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of mint shampoo and conditioner, and this stuff hit it on the head. I&#x27;ll be buying from then again! :)</li>
            <li> I would give this product a 5, if it weren&#x27;t so pricy for the small (8oz.) amount of product. Smells good, makes hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> Great product, gives my hair an amazing texture and an incredible perfume!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult to find shampoo with NO SLS. This is it! It smells really nice and fresh. If you&#x27;re contrmplating the size, it will last a while. The good thing is that it cleans so well you really only have to wash your hair every 2-3 days (as you should). Add a little bit of water to lather the shampoo, because it is thick.</li>
            <li> A Little goes a long way;shampoo really lathered.  Love the smell,tingles and hair was full and bouncy.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found!  I have color treated hair and it&#x27;s hard to find a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair brittle and dry. This did not dry my hair out at all and it makes your hair smell so good!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. After years of highlighting, straightening, and curling, I was looking for a gentle sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to help my hair feel silky and look smooth. Not only does this product do that, it also smells wonderful. It works wonders on my thick, wavy hair. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> i never knew shampoo could be this good. referring all my friends to this product. it really works :)</li>
            <li> It leaves a good feeling after drying my hair. Smells like winter in summer</li>
            <li> I recently found out about this during my amazon browsing last month. It is much better than my other shampoos in keeping my hair silky. My husband likes it too because of the mint.  Now, my husband and I use only this set and it allows a lot of space because we only have one hair product for the both of us now.</li>
            <li> I love Maple Holistics!  Great product and Fast Shipping.  Helpful EMails!  The whole package!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I randomly bought it looking for a nicer shampoo to use. I had no idea it would actually make my hair healthier and stronger. The smell is great, nothing powerful, but just fresh. I will certainly purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this didn&#x27;t quite work for me. It made my hair too soft and limp and it wouldn&#x27;t hold the curl. However, as a former hairdresser, I feel this would be a very good choice for somebody with coarser hair or somebody who wears their hair completely straight..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. These products made my dry ends even dryer and more brittle! I only used it twice and Never again!!!!! Thinking of sending it back!!!!!</li>
            <li> THE MINT SHAMPOO IS AMAZING AND SMELLS GOOD TOO</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells devine in all senses mint. The scent is fairly powerful in the bottle but a suggestion once used in the hair. I love the smell and the shampoo itself left my hair feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s the conditioner that sold it for me. I didn&#x27;t expect much in the way of scent but was pleasantly surprised to be greeted with a smell reminiscent of cupcakes. Not strong but prominent. After using the conditioner it left my hair smelling delicious and feeling soft. Throughout the day I sniffed my hair and could still smell the conditioner and my long hair still feels soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big user of acure organics shampoo and conditioner but I wanted to try others for smell variety and experience. I would definitely recommend giving this one a chance.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell and hair feels and looks healthy!!</li>
            <li> This is awesome!  My hair has never felt so soft or smelled so amazing!  Great combination and I can feel good about supporting products that don&#x27;t contribute to the eutrophication of our water systems!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The silk 18 conditioner is wonderful. The shampoo cleans well with a very small amount of product, plus it smells great. My highlighted hair is so soft and silky, it is hard to keep a scrunchie in the first day.</li>
            <li> I received these a few days ago I had tried them at my daughters while visiting her. And had to get my own. they are fantastic . my hair feels soft and looks great ant it has made my scalp feel so much better from the cold dryness winter brings . They are natural products which are great! My new shampoo and conditioner for life</li>
            <li> I love the conditioner and have ordered it alone so I thought the shampoo would be a favorite of mine as well. Turns out I don&#x27;t like the scent of the shampoo and I don&#x27;t think my hair liked the results.</li>
            <li> The shampoo completely dried out my hair. The conditioner is nice and smells great but doesn&#x27;t balance out the complete dryness wrought by the shampoo.  Didn&#x27;t help my itchy scalp at all.</li>
            <li> I like it but it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> washes away all the impurities from my hair and establishes my good looks pretty well.</li>
            <li> The shampoo conditioner set is AWESOME! I actually just used it and my hair is extremely smooth. There is a very nice natural scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. The texture is perfect and you can tell that it is made with high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this shampoo and conditioner. I love it, and my daughter loved it so much when she smelled it on me that I had to order her a set as well. This stuff does a great job and smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li> I thought this shampoo was a little overpriced when I bought it, but thought I would try it anyway. I&#x27;m always looking to diversify my experiences, and appreciate variety. To make this review concise: I really liked this product. I would buy it again, and think it was worth the money. I liked the feeling of my hair after using it. Some organic and all-natural shampoos leave my hair feeling coarse and dry, but this did an excellent job with moisturizing. I also liked the smell, which is often also off-putting in many organic/natural hair products.</li>
            <li> Took a few days for the conditioner to make my hair soft. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s because my hair was that dry/damaged.  Other than that, great smell and product.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo combo. I have long, fine, highlighted hair &amp; dandruff. So I need moisture, but also can&#x27;t have products that are too heavy or my hair gets weighed down. I typically wash my hair every other day. This works perfectly with this blend, but I couldn&#x27;t ever stretch it an extra day with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter Blend Shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the scent of this shampoo. It gets my hair very clean, though I do not use any product in it. I wouldn&#x27;t use this shampoo without conditioner though, because it strips my hair of all the natural oils also - like I said, very clean. It lathers nicely and I don&#x27;t have to use too much either.  When used with the Silk 18 conditioner (if I use enough) my hair is really clean and feels nice and light. It smells like real mint rather than the fake peppermint you&#x27;d normally get with regular shampoos. Pleasant and not at all overwhelming. I did think from some of the reviews that it would help with my dandruff, however it really doesn&#x27;t. I seem to have a lot of dandruff this year, small flakes but not itchy. The minty shampoo is soothing, and while it might help a bit it&#x27;s just not enough. I would like to try the sage or tea tree oil shampoo instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silk 18 Conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;I would call this a light-to-medium strength conditioner. I have to use twice as much as I would using my usual (Tre seme) but the upside is that my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down at all. It&#x27;s soft but not over-conditioned. Regarding the smell... it&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s a bit strong. It&#x27;s a real vanilla smell (which unfortunately smells like my natural dog shampoo) and it&#x27;s nice once I rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy from this company again but I&#x27;d like to try other shampoos to see if there is something better for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is very finicky when it comes to shampoos and conditioners. I came across this product and purchased it based on all of the great reviews. After using it for the first time, I am pleasantly surprised. The smell is heavenly and the texture of my hair is noticeably softer. The shampoo lathered extremely well despite being sulfate free. I&#x27;m so glad that I found this product! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Me and my daughters all use this and like the smell of both the shampoo and the conditioner and feel they both are good products at a good price.  The shampoo has sort of a tingly feeling and seems to clean well without being too harsh.  The conditioner seems to make hair softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Very much a Spearmint odor to that I like. Suitable for everyday use as well. If you are trying to reduce the amount of chemicals used in the shower (soaps and such) then this is a natural progression. Lathers up nicely just like any other shampoo as well. So no worries on that front either.</li>
            <li> very drying, my hair was full of statics, and I don&#x27;t even blow-dry it. Returned</li>
            <li> This is my first natural shampoo and conditioner.  I had originally used a more well known, cheap shampoo and conditioner for years until I wanted to try a change.  I read some reviews before purchasing these product.  Price were decent for combo and the smell was good.  I like the peppermint smell along with the silky fine conditioner.  At first, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference as I had long straight hair and my hair cont. to fall out normally.  Then I had a shorter haircut and notice that my hair didn&#x27;t fall out as much but wasn&#x27;t sure if it was due to the cut or products or combination of both.  Anyways, it felt good, fresh and silky.  It didn&#x27;t feel dry.  I just ordered the same winter blend shampoo but it came with the winter blend conditioner instead of silk conditioner.  I am going to try this conditioner and see how it works.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo. Really silky hair which is usually dry and fuzzy due to over processing. Shame I can&#x27;t get it in the UK, but I gladly pay the international postage. There are no chemical free hair products here that work so well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful these products are. I&#x27;m used to the cheap $3 shampoos and conditioners in the big bottles that you have to use A TON of in order to get it to lather. The shampoo put what felt like a gel-like substance feeling in my hair using only a quarter size like the instructions said, after letting my hair sit the recommended 3 minutes I couldn&#x27;t believe how squeeky clean my hair was (this was after I hadn&#x27;t used shampoo or conditioner in a little over half a week), so much so that I didn&#x27;t think I should even do it a second time contrary to their recommendations. So after the shampoo I applied the conditioner and I&#x27;m used to conditioners that don&#x27;t spread very well at all, but I used the same amount of conditioner as I did shampoo and it encompassed all of my hair (which is past my neck). When I was done rinsing off the conditioner my scalp felt renewed and kind of cold-hot and frosty. I think this is an amazing product to have made my hair feel so great after I hadn&#x27;t used any shampoo or conditioner in almost a week and my hair was getting scraggly and my scalp was itching before I used this. Definitely on my buy again list.</li>
            <li> Aroma therapy in a bottle! A vibrant, fresh scent with no harsh chemicals. I bought this specifically for my husband. It is not easy to find a scent that is also appealing to men. This is it. The set works well together and leaves hair soft and shiny and does not seem to leave a waxy build-up. My only comment to those who ear glasses... the shampoo &amp; conditioner bottles look very similar. I have added a large rubber band around one of the bottles so he can tell which is which. The products arrived quickly, and I appreciated the tracking update e-mail, also. I have included photos of the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I have very oily hair.  I nee to wash my hair every 2 days or else im a grease bucket..  BUUUUT, with this 2 pack im able to last 4 days without washing my hair.   I know sounds gross, i usually dont do it... but still, its awesome not to have to deal with nasty oil hair every 2 days... LOVE THIS STUFF :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a week now and I love it!.  It does exactly what is says and I&#x27;m extremely pleased.  It leaves my hair and scalp feeling great, along with smelly very fresh, due to the mint and spearmint. I would recommend this product to my friends and family!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, it smells amazing and leaves my hair so soft and shiny. Bought one set and then turned around and bought another, just in case the winter blend runs out of stock!</li>
            <li> Definitely helped my colored treated hair bounce back to life after a few uses. The first time I used the shampoo and conditioner I felt my hair was still dry but after using both a few more times I now notice a big difference in the silkiness and softness in my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these products!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner duo is simply wonderful.  I have been struggling for years with itchy scalp and after trying tons of different products I feel I have finally found something that works for me.  The smell is great!  Minty but not overpowering.  Maple Holistics gets it right with this product.  Most shampoos containing any kind of mint fragrance or ingredients are way to strong and that tingling sensation eventually turns to dry and itchy.  I would say this just has a very nice cooling sensation and is hydrating to the scalp.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to get the job done.  I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free and uses good quality ingredients conducive to a healthier scalp.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is what I use for baths. The scent is great. The conditioner does not get much use from me but it is useful too.</li>
            <li> The conditioner helped make my hair which felt bristly and harsh develop a better texture. I was not really needing this but after seeing the effects, I am glad I purchased this</li>
            <li> This blend of shampoo and conditioner filled with mint has cleaned my hair of dandruff and my wife uses it to make her hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> such a wonderful scent! Also made my hair soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s alright . I saw that the ingredients contained lots of varieties of mint and I was really excited to try this out.</li>
            <li> Coming from a dude, this is a great shampoo and a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> Due to my unbelievably dry hair and the urges of people around me, I decided to have this treatment shampoo and conditioner which apparently, works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the minty shampoo and the vanilla conditioner for two weeks now and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. The shampoo is very good at degreasing and afterwards the conditioner does a great job to make it soft again. The scent on the conditioner is a little strong for my taste but I&#x27;m a guy so that&#x27;s understandable.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the super cool sensation on the scalp!!!</li>
            <li> These guys make an awesome product.  I love the natural ingredients.  The shampoo and conditioner both have an amazing aroma that isn&#x27;t over-powering.  My hair feels great afterwards and has a great glow to it.  I am giving it four stars because I HATE how small the bottles are.  I understand profit margins.  Just figure it out.  Maximize your efficiency and reduce the price.  Otherwise I will be gone.</li>
            <li> I tried these based on the reviews and wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I&#x27;ve been looking for a more &#x27;natural&#x27; shampoo, but have struggled to find one that has the right consistency for my long hair. The shampoo is great and really lathers well. I leave the conditioner on for several minutes and like the cool/tingly feeling on my scalp. Very nice!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Works great.</li>
            <li> I used the products once but I already felt the difference after the first use. My hair felt silky and I am very happy with the initial results. I will update this review as I use the product more times but so far I am very happy with them and would recommend to everybody.</li>
            <li> I really want to like this. I am still using, but the Winter Blend was not as invigorating as it claims. We&#x27;ll see. The Silk 18 smells and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I just started using the winter blend shampoo and silk conditioner. The shampoo smells great and so far works great on my hair (fine , straight, highlights). The silk conditioner leaves my hair pretty smooth and easier to comb but not greasy which is usually what happens when I use a heavier conditioner on my hair. This one seems light but still gives just the right moisture for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product !!  Makes my hair soft and shiny&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t panic it&#x27;s organic</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Maple Holistics shampoo.  I tried the Hydrate and Degrease.  The winter blend smells the nicest out of the three although when it comes to essential oils it is the benefits that the focus should be on. I&#x27;ve used the Winter Blend about 4 times and it actually works the best on me.  My girlfriend uses the conditioner and she stated that it is super light and doesn&#x27;t weigh her hair down.</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for alternative sulfate free hair products, and I highly pleased with your products! I purchased the Winter Blend with Silk Conditioner along with the Argan shampoo to rotate, and my hair looks and feels amazing. I have only used the product for one day now, and I am looking forward to seeing how extended use of these products with help the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  It is even better than I expected.  I unexpectedly had family at my house for a week and every one of them wanted to know where to get this shampoo and conditioner.  It is fabulous!  Nothing has ever made my hair feel so soft.  I have extremely curly hair.  With this shampoo it is manageable with no tangles.  Still lots of curls - just not the tangled knots that I normally get.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the shampoo. I dye my hair a lot so I like it being sulfate free! I love the way it makes my hair feel and smell!</li>
            <li> The mint shampoo smells wonderful. The shampoo and conditioners have made my hair so much silkier and smoother. I am amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> I accidentally found this brand while searching for something else and decided based on the positive reviews to try this combo out seeing as how it&#x27;s winter and all. :-) Note: I have long, fine, color-treated hair, so not only do I need color protection and moisture, I also can&#x27;t have products that are too heavy or my hair gets weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter Blend Shampoo:&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer states, this particular shampoo gets your hair squeaky clean...I&#x27;d call it a clarifying shampoo, really. This is great for say, a once a week deep clean if you use a lot of hair products, but I found it to be too much for frequent use. So I have decided to use it a couple of times a month rather than every time I wash my hair because otherwise it would dry my hair out. When used with the Silk 18 conditioner (if I use enough) my hair is really clean and feels so light, like when I leave the salon (because your hair stylist will always use less product than you do at home). I love the smell of this blend...it smells like real mint(s) rather than the fake peppermint you&#x27;d normally get with regular shampoos. Pleasant and not at all overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silk 18 Conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;I would call this a light-to-medium strength conditioner. I was using the Acure brand conditioner (lemongrass) and it was just too heavy for my hair, even when I would use a tiny amount. This conditioner is definitely lighter and compared to the Acure I have to use twice as much but the upside is that my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down at all. It&#x27;s soft but not over-conditioned. I do wish that it would make my hair a tad softer, though. I am going to experiment with adding a tiny drop of coconut or argan oil to the conditioner to see if that helps. Regarding the smell...I love it...like the shampoo, it&#x27;s a real vanilla smell versus the fake scent you get from regular conditioners but I agree with other reviewers that it&#x27;s pretty strong. Since I just had a baby I can say that if I had tried to use this conditioner in my first trimester (when you have the nose of a werewolf) there is no way I could have handled it. So if you&#x27;re pregnant, hold off on this until you have the baby. :-) On the plus side, it ensures your hair smells really good for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy from this company again but I&#x27;d like to try other shampoos to see if there&#x27;s one that is not as clarifying as the Winter Blend. If you need a clarifying shampoo then definitely get this combo. Vanilla Mint is a lovely smell. :)</li>
            <li> I figured I should try this since the reviews are great.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of this shampoo for it to work, it doesn&#x27;t lather like other shampoos.  My hair felt a lot more clean than it typically does after using this.  This used in conjunction with the smoothing conditioner and I guarantee your hair will feel softer and smoother than it ever has!  Great smell too of course! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product. I have very long hair and my boyfriend has longer hair as well as a beard. We have been looking for an organic.natural product that truly works. This is by far the very best! It smells great and leaves our hair feel silky and smooth all day long! I would recommend it to anyone. Thanks for providing us with such a fabulous product. I will definitely be purchasing from you guys again soon:)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the conflicting reviews. This is the 1st no sulfates, no parabens, vegan-friendly, safe for color treated hair combo I have ever used. I found the Winter Blend Shampoo to be invigorating and pleasant smelling. Not overwhelming at all. My hair type is normal to oily. My scalp is usually tight, itchy, and flakes fairly easily. I am happy to say the Winter Blend Shampoo had a stimulating effect without irritation. I absolutely fell in love with the Silk18 Conditioner. It has a lusciousness that feels like it envelopes every hair follicle. Both are very aromatic without being overpowering. After blow-drying, my hair was left feeling smooth and had a wonderful healthy shine. Looking forward to trying more Maple Holistics products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an extremely picky person when it comes to hair product, usually opting for low cost, but I wanted to treat myself for once and chose this product based on reviews. I received the 8 oz mint shampoo and 8 oz silk conditioner in my 2 pack. The mint smells heavenly and has a pretty thick consistency. It lathers nicely, cleans and rinses off well. It did leave my hair feeling a little on the dry side, which is where the silk conditioner comes in handy. All in all, my hair is left feeling clean and smooth but not waxy or oily, and smells great to boot! My two wishes for this product: it was also available in 16 oz (or other larger size) and it was more affordable. That being said, I will be purchasing this again and just alternating between this and another cheaper product.</li>
            <li> After some medications left me loosing my hair, I was desperate for anything that might help. I decided to give this set a try based on some reviews here, but... This set was a big disappointment. The shampoo completely stripped my hair of all moisture, and no it wasn&#x27;t just product removal - I don&#x27;t use any gel/mousse/hairspray/rootlifter/etc. This was alarming but I had hopes that the conditioner would restore the moisture - not a chance. The conditioner is very thin and light, it took a LOT to coat my long hair, and did almost nothing to condition and moisturize my poor stripped locks. It&#x27;s taken over a week of deep conditioning to rescue my hair from feeling like hay. Because of the stripping/poor conditioning, combing was rough and I actually lost MORE hair than has been usual of late. Super bummed about this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the 100% Money Back Guarantee was simple to use, and as disappointed as I am with the product, I have to applaud Maple Holistics/Amazon on the customer service.</li>
            <li> Shampoo- works good, smells good but does dry up your hair a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Silk18 conditioner- works really well, left my hair very soft so it made up for the shampoo and it smells great! A very clean  but light sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I love the conditioner, but the shampoo is just not for me.  I think it depends on your hair type.  The shampoo makes my hair feel like straw, I may need more of a hydrating shampoo.  The Conditioner is wonderful.  My hair has not felt this good in years!</li>
            <li> After this winter, my hair has been extremely dry and brittle. After getting a trim thinking I just needed to remove some of my split ends, I was still dealing with frizzy, dry strands.  I&#x27;ve only used the Winter Blend Shampoo and Conditioner one time and I have noticed an immediate difference.  My hair feels extremely soft, and I can tell it looks healthier already, especially toward the bottom where I was experiencing the most trouble. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the effects after a few more uses! It smells great too.</li>
            <li> Bought it to try it out, the minty smell is pretty nice but maybe a little too minty. Overall it works well to clean my hair and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> Thanks great product (:</li>
            <li> Finally!&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from a very dry scalp during the winter months and this year has been brutal. I came across this while looking for a sulfate-free shampoo to try out and so glad I did. After ONE wash (no lie!) the flakes practically disappeared and my scalp was left feeling cool and refreshed. I am on day 3 now and my hair still feels very clean!&lt;br /&gt;I will come back after a month with a better review but seriously... one time... and I&#x27;m already in love</li>
