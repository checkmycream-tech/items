            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>Construction feels a bit cheap, but you get what you pay for, and it does not affect the performance.</li>
            <li>everylightand comfortable and smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Steamer...</li>
            <li>WHEN I MOVE IT AROUND, OTHER THAN THAT, ITS A GREAT PRODUCT, REALLY ENJOYING MY FACIALS.</li>
            <li>Very light weight, easy to roll around and maneuver, heats up fast, dense blast of steam, plastic cup</li>
            <li>Only used it once so far, but it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I finally after reading reviews made this purchase and have been very happy with this facial steamer.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and arrived on time.  </li>
            <li>That is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, easy to assemble, and works fabulous so far.  </li>
            <li>Great products still working after a few months.</li>
            <li>Right now it is all duck taped so it will stand up and for the clients safety.</li>
            <li>The jar is not glass but rather a sturdy plastic which makes me happy because I have seen glass break if over filled or left running dry</li>
            <li>shipping very fast</li>
            <li>Tons of steam and far better than my old one, for which I paid far more.</li>
            <li>it works fine, not as high quality as the more expensive ones, but a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>I wish there was a place to put essential oil in it, but nevertheless, I&#x27;m still satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The first one I purchased it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My skin looks fantastic, I am in my sixties have been seeing a skin care professional for years...</li>
            <li>(but not mine, of course ;-) )  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I noticed when I first started using the steamer, I could see the steamer stream..</li>
            <li>The bottom is extremely flimsy, the adjustment valve fell apart immediately the whole bottom is made of plastic and aluminum and completely fell apart immediately, the steamer is great</li>
            <li>My issue is always how long thiey last, but so far, so good!  </li>
            <li>Good for small spaces.</li>
            <li>so your not messing around with glass, simple and easy functions.</li>
            <li>Heated up in under ten minutes and was easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>Assembly was simple, easy.  </li>
            <li>A rather large, rectangular picture frame.</li>
            <li>I am really like this.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Was delivered VERY promptly.</li>
            <li>and this stand makes it so much easier.  </li>
            <li>I just lounge back and enjoy the steam.  </li>
            <li>I have been an aesthetician for nearly 20 years and have used many different steamers.</li>
            <li>Strong steam but height adjustment is limited</li>
            <li>I highly reccomed.</li>
            <li>They bottom is completely wobbly.</li>
            <li>Works well with no issues so far.</li>
            <li>Warms up in less than 5 minutes and has a powerful stream of steam.</li>
            <li>will see what happens further, but so far no less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li>After u few times of using the steamer it does not work it turns on but it won&#x27;t get hot trying g to see if I can contact manufacturer to either get a new one or my money back</li>
            <li>Only a few minutes to start steaming, and delivers the steam powerfully with no spurting or dripping.  </li>
            <li>I do see the moisture appearing on the client&#x27;s face, however, pointing the steamer in the right direction proves to be difficult as I can see the steam any longer.  </li>

            <li> In the last year I have purchased 3 other steamers from other suppliers and have had problems</li>
            <li> The legs seem a little low quality, but otherwise performs the function well.</li>
            <li> I went back and forth between a few options</li>
            <li> I recently purchased, a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I should have heeded the other warning reviews.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> Had to run water through it a few times to get the plastic smell gone, but that is to be expected when it has a plastic water resevoir.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, no dripping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reached out -- to no avail nobody around to help me trouble shoot</li>
            <li> got this for my wife a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I however, can no longer see it, not sure why.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why this is, but I don&#x27;t care for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is the worst thing that I ever buy, don&#x27;t please Don&#x27;t buy anything from jocasta, after you buy it yiu can returned but you have to pay for that</li>

            <li> In the last year I have purchased 3 other steamers from other suppliers and have had problems I finally after reading reviews made this purchase and have been very happy with this facial steamer. Works well with no issues so far.</li>

            <li> Look s like it&#x27;s used and it does not stay up</li>
            <li> got this for my wife a few months ago. works like a charm. surprise. i think it&#x27;s better than many $200 models out there. will see what happens further, but so far no less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using yet&lt;br /&gt;Just use first time to see how is working look really good . shipping very fast</li>
            <li> I went back and forth between a few options and I&#x27;m glad I chose this steamer. Heated up in under ten minutes and was easy to assemble. Would be easy to de assemble for storage.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Steamer...I use it twice a week after cleansing my face throughly and follow with a toner then steam for 10 minutes with ozone turned on.  It heats up quickly, no dripping and this stand makes it so much easier.  I just lounge back and enjoy the steam.  It is so great on my sinuses so using this gives me double the benefits.  It was shipped quickly and arrived on time.  My skin looks fantastic, I am in my sixties have been seeing a skin care professional for years...she recommended me doing this glad she did, I see her once a month and this keeps my skin radiant between sessions.  I may not need her anymore because it works GREAT!</li>
            <li> works great, has even steam and NO clicking timer</li>
            <li> This is a review after only a couple weeks of use, but it works great!  My issue is always how long thiey last, but so far, so good!  It was easy to put together.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed Esthetician.  I wanted a steamer to use at home for friends and family.  This is PERFECT!  Heated up in 6 min (from max line) and ran for almost 20 min before automatically shutting off when the water got to low.  It had a nice even flow of steam with no drips.  The jar is not glass but rather a sturdy plastic which makes me happy because I have seen glass break if over filled or left running dry (but not mine, of course ;-) )  Assembly was simple, easy.  I would recommend buying this steamer and buying it from SalonGuys.  Their price was unbeatable and I had it on my door step in 3 days (California to PA!!) - LOVE Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> Worked great twice, then stopped working.  The guy who fixes my machines said it would cost more to fix than I paid for it.  I should have heeded the other warning reviews.</li>
            <li> Works fine i think the extended arm should be flexible.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a spa, and it works great so far.</li>
            <li> this is the worst thing that I ever buy, don&#x27;t please Don&#x27;t buy anything from jocasta, after you buy it yiu can returned but you have to pay for that and nobody&#x27;s give you yhe money so, in the end you are loosing 50.00 dls sending the product, when the cost it was 100.00 dlsor wherever price the put in offer, IF YOU WANT TO LOOSE YOUR MONEY, BUY IN &amp;#34; JOCASTA&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to post a review to see how well it really works.  It works great, you can adjust height and angle of the arm where the steam comes out.  Great seller!  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Seems sufficient for the price</li>
            <li> I recently purchased, a few weeks ago.  I noticed when I first started using the steamer, I could see the steamer stream.. I however, can no longer see it, not sure why.  I do see the moisture appearing on the client&#x27;s face, however, pointing the steamer in the right direction proves to be difficult as I can see the steam any longer.  Not sure why this is, but I don&#x27;t care for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kimberly,&lt;br /&gt;Esthetician, Seattle, wA</li>
