            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>I am recovering from an operation and this helps more than I can say!  </li>
            <li>Always loved using scented Epsom salts, and this particular brand is excellent...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite of all of the Dr Teal&#x27;s scents, but it&#x27;s still pleasant and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works great as bath salts but was hoping for a more aromatic experience.  </li>

            <li>I am pleased with this product and how effective it works.</li>
            <li>Not too over powering of a scent, the smell isn&#x27;t cheap, good for relaxing muscles.</li>
            <li>I picked it up because I liked the smell, but I&#x27;ve continued to pick it up because I feel so much better when I climb out of the bath.</li>
            <li>BUT I LOVE GIVING GIFTS</li>
            <li>OFTEN LOVE</li>
            <li>I JUST LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>i love the scent too</li>
            <li>I ride my bike for more than 2 hours and after that when I have time I take a bath and the salts help.</li>
            <li>I love epsom salt.</li>
            <li>fragrance of the Therapeutic salts is more minty than rosemary scented.  </li>
            <li>Used this many times.</li>
            <li>I love these salts.  </li>
            <li>but my husband got this for me as one of my Christmas gifts and I am highly satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I put 1 cup in my bath water and it made my muscles feel a lot better.  </li>
            <li>Just choose your scent and enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love all the bath salts by Dr. Teal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use again. :)</li>
            <li>Fallen in love with Dr. Teal&#x27;s epson salt.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love Dr. Teal&#x27;s Therapeutic soaking solution.  </li>
            <li>Could not be more of a fan on these products.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the cooling sensation on my legs.  </li>
            <li>They smell wonderful &amp; take away the swelling in my feet after a long shift at the restaurant I manage.</li>
            <li>PERFECT after a long day at work and the gym.</li>
            <li>Epsom salts are wonderful to soothe sore muscles; I use them after long hikes, and I&#x27;m so grateful they exist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s aroma is wonderful after a long day.</li>
            <li>I love inhaling this strong minty smell.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly didn&#x27;t have much of a rosemary scent.  </li>
            <li>I loved this salt, very calming effect..</li>
            <li>I got this for my daughter to use in her footspa and it smells soooooo good, the peppermint smell fills the whole house.  </li>
            <li>What a find: the price is right at $5.99 for 48 oz., and the salts themselves are wonderfully soothing -- the infusion of oils definitely helps take the edge off of muscle kinks, and the minty scent is invigorating.</li>
            <li>The overall effect of good old Epsom Salts infused with Rosemary and Mint is incredibly soothing and seems to even lessen the swelling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>they do the job just fine.  </li>
            <li>OH, SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT IS A CHEAP PRICE FOR A GIFT</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t decide if I like the calm soak by Dr. Teal better though...  </li>
            <li>It helps with sore muscles just as well, but obviously doesn&#x27;t smell just as great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price. :)</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s fantastic,</li>
            <li>works great for easing tension in muscles and overall relaxation to sleep.</li>
            <li>They dissolve well when added to the tub water and my skin feels smooth afterward.</li>
            <li>All the different varieties are great.  </li>
            <li>These bath salts make for a great treat after a long workout or sporting event.</li>
            <li>Recommend this product if you are looking for a relaxing and clean experience.</li>
            <li>The fragrance makes it special.</li>
            <li>Good for a relaxing bath, especially after I tore my acl and have to rehab it.</li>
            <li>UNLESS THE PRODUCT ENDS UP AFFECTING THE FEMALE ANATOMY WITH DRYNESS; OTHERWISE, ITS GOOD TO GO.  </li>
            <li>I love these salts so much.</li>
            <li>it is superior to similar products.  </li>
            <li>Very relaxing and soothing and love the mint smell.</li>
            <li>You will have to soak for at least  20-30 mins to get best results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You can get these at walmart, sent right to your door if you want, for super cheap.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and works better than I expected!</li>
            <li>Great to take an Epsom salt bath after heavy exercising.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for the Bath, Foot soak or tired aching joints.</li>
            <li>This is worth the $5-$6 every month because of how my feet feel at the end.</li>
            <li>I love to soak in a bath filled with essential oils and Epsom salts.  </li>
            <li>I liken the fragrance to that of a freshly made mojito.</li>
            <li>First of all, the bag is FULL.  </li>
            <li>I find it superior to other products I have used and will continue to us this one</li>
            <li>A much bigger difference than plain Epsom salt (which I always thought was awesome).  </li>
            <li>Soothing and very fragrantly fresh.</li>
            <li>FROM THE FIRST WHIFF I WAS HOOKED.  </li>
            <li>These are among the first ones I tried, and I do like them -</li>
            <li>It smells nice too, and with a hot, or icy bath it&#x27;ll help take away aches and pains.</li>
            <li>This Dr Teal&#x27;s Epsom salt does exactly what it claimed, soothing and therapeutic.</li>
            <li>I recovered much faster!</li>
            <li>It relaxes mind and body and dissolves very easily in hot water.</li>
            <li>I have several of Dr. Teal&#x27;s bath salts &amp; bubble bath &amp; they are all fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different brands &amp; these</li>
            <li>I love to use these salts after taking long hikes.  </li>
            <li>The good news is, this particular brand doesn&#x27;t overcharge for flavors (actually I paid the same price for unscented Epsom salts as I paid for Dr. Teal&#x27;s salts).</li>
            <li>I use this product when I am very sore, need to soak, or detoxify.</li>
            <li>It really works on sore muscles and muscle fatigue.</li>
            <li>I have sciatica, and epsom bath soaks really seem to help with the pain.  </li>
            <li>I am an endurance athlete and really needed it.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery - which was awesome as I desperately needed it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other therapeutic bath soak products, but this one is the most effective I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried other epsom and sea bathing salts and enjoyed them, so when I saw this I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>but I will be trying it as a full body soak in the future.</li>
            <li>Before you buy, please read the full following articles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bag arrived quickly via Prime two day shipping, however the bag was open in the box upon arrival.</li>
            <li>The reason I bought this on Amazon is because Walmart doesn&#x27;t offer this particular one</li>
            <li>Aside from the fact that the bag arrived with a puncture which resulted in a HUGE mess in the box, it&#x27;s hard to tell how effective a product like this really is.</li>
            <li>This scent was a new option for me to get my hands on</li>
            <li>I use these with the Hot Spa Ultimate Foot Bath.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first bag at a local retail store and used it in the bath, not just for the ladies.</li>
            <li>I usually prefer my lavender scented salts but this variety is a nice occasional switch up.</li>
            <li>They also leave my skin soooo soft.</li>
            <li>Old and/ or expired product...</li>
            <li>Though Epsom salt is dirt-cheap, no research supports any direct effect on injury recovery, and none of the theories forwarded about how Epsom salt might help in indirect ways</li>
            <li>Plus, it helps to leave your feet feeling so soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Good product, but to expensive for me considering how often I use them.</li>
            <li>Folk remedies are often generally neglected by researchers, but not usually so completely.&amp;#34; -- Paul Ingraham</li>
            <li>and it is only half full.  </li>
            <li>You only need a little bit in a footspa, so this huge bag will last forever.</li>
            <li>Of course, the secret was that I made him take a bath in which I poured 1-2 cups of Epsom salts :)</li>
            <li>After several attempts to clear the track, I ended up pouring the entire bag into a Rubbermaid container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely love soaking my legs in a bathtub with this Epsom salt after a long and strenuous day at work on my feet all day or after a tough workout.</li>

            <li> Fallen in love with Dr. Teal&#x27;s epson salt.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love Dr. Teal&#x27;s Therapeutic soaking solution.  </li>
            <li> Could not be more of a fan on these products.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the cooling sensation on my legs.  </li>
            <li> They smell wonderful &amp; take away the swelling in my feet after a long shift at the restaurant I manage.</li>
            <li> PERFECT after a long day at work and the gym.</li>

            <li> I love inhaling this strong minty smell.  </li>

            <li> What a find: the price is right at $5.99 for 48 oz., and the salts themselves are wonderfully soothing -- the infusion of oils definitely helps take the edge off of muscle kinks, and the minty scent is invigorating.</li>
            <li> The overall effect of good old Epsom Salts infused with Rosemary and Mint is incredibly soothing and seems to even lessen the swelling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> they do the job just fine.  </li>
            <li> OH, SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT IS A CHEAP PRICE FOR A GIFT</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t decide if I like the calm soak by Dr. Teal better though...  </li>
            <li> It helps with sore muscles just as well, but obviously doesn&#x27;t smell just as great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price. :)</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s fantastic,</li>
            <li> works great for easing tension in muscles and overall relaxation to sleep.</li>
            <li> They dissolve well when added to the tub water and my skin feels smooth afterward.</li>
            <li> All the different varieties are great.  </li>
            <li> These bath salts make for a great treat after a long workout or sporting event.</li>
            <li> Recommend this product if you are looking for a relaxing and clean experience.</li>
            <li> The fragrance makes it special.</li>
            <li> Good for a relaxing bath, especially after I tore my acl and have to rehab it.</li>
            <li> UNLESS THE PRODUCT ENDS UP AFFECTING THE FEMALE ANATOMY WITH DRYNESS; OTHERWISE, ITS GOOD TO GO.  </li>
            <li> I love these salts so much.</li>
            <li> it is superior to similar products.  </li>
            <li> Very relaxing and soothing and love the mint smell.</li>
            <li> You will have to soak for at least  20-30 mins to get best results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You can get these at walmart, sent right to your door if you want, for super cheap.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and works better than I expected!</li>
            <li> Great to take an Epsom salt bath after heavy exercising.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for the Bath, Foot soak or tired aching joints.</li>
            <li> This is worth the $5-$6 every month because of how my feet feel at the end.</li>
            <li> I love to soak in a bath filled with essential oils and Epsom salts.  </li>
            <li> I liken the fragrance to that of a freshly made mojito.</li>
            <li> First of all, the bag is FULL.  </li>
            <li> I find it superior to other products I have used and will continue to us this one</li>
            <li> A much bigger difference than plain Epsom salt (which I always thought was awesome).  </li>
            <li> Soothing and very fragrantly fresh.</li>
            <li> FROM THE FIRST WHIFF I WAS HOOKED.  </li>
            <li> These are among the first ones I tried, and I do like them -</li>
            <li> It smells nice too, and with a hot, or icy bath it&#x27;ll help take away aches and pains.</li>
            <li> This Dr Teal&#x27;s Epsom salt does exactly what it claimed, soothing and therapeutic.</li>
            <li> I recovered much faster!</li>
            <li> It relaxes mind and body and dissolves very easily in hot water.</li>
            <li> I have several of Dr. Teal&#x27;s bath salts &amp; bubble bath &amp; they are all fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands &amp; these</li>
            <li> I love to use these salts after taking long hikes.  </li>
            <li> The good news is, this particular brand doesn&#x27;t overcharge for flavors (actually I paid the same price for unscented Epsom salts as I paid for Dr. Teal&#x27;s salts).</li>
            <li> I use this product when I am very sore, need to soak, or detoxify.</li>
            <li> It really works on sore muscles and muscle fatigue.</li>
            <li> I have sciatica, and epsom bath soaks really seem to help with the pain.  </li>
            <li> I am an endurance athlete and really needed it.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery - which was awesome as I desperately needed it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other therapeutic bath soak products, but this one is the most effective I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried other epsom and sea bathing salts and enjoyed them, so when I saw this I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> but I will be trying it as a full body soak in the future.</li>

            <li> Of course, the secret was that I made him take a bath in which I poured 1-2 cups of Epsom salts :)</li>
            <li> After several attempts to clear the track, I ended up pouring the entire bag into a Rubbermaid container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely love soaking my legs in a bathtub with this Epsom salt after a long and strenuous day at work on my feet all day or after a tough workout.</li>
            <li> However, I have found that regular old epsom salts you can get at the dollar store work just as well - if I want a little scent I just add some rosemary, tea tree, or peppermint essential oil and voila, scented salts.  </li>
            <li> THAT LAST A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> Barring future research, it&#x27;s very hard to justify an Epsom salt bath over a traditional ice bath or hot water bath for treating an injury.</li>
            <li> I love Dr Teal&#x27;s products, but found this to be too expensive for the same size that I can buy locally for half the price.</li>
            <li> and once I started getting minimal mobility back</li>
            <li> Plan on a long soak in the tub the your skin and body feels after a soak with this product will make you a believer, you will be hooked.</li>
            <li> I will definitely try the other scents/aids they have.</li>

            <li> I hurt my back a few months ago, and a co-worker recommended epsom salt baths.</li>
            <li> This has spearmint or some weird mint in it that made it smell funny.  </li>
            <li> for the past year to help soothe aches and pains from regular workouts, and though they are also quality salts, a 12 oz.</li>
            <li> I purchased this salt in hopes of relieving sore muscles due to my profession as a massage therapist.</li>
            <li> B000VUWX8G Tired Old Ass Soak / Bath Salts / 12 oz.]</li>
            <li> Found at Walmart for over half the price.</li>
            <li> was looking for an alternative other than plain Epsom salts when I came across Dr. Teal&#x27;s here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I lead a very active life.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I had a little spa experience.</li>
            <li> Pour them into little fancy bags</li>
            <li> Considering the price difference between salt+EO and these pre-scented salts, I had to knock off a few stars.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting regular mint and rosemary, but alas no.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other salts I have previously used, this product does not leave my skin feeling oily or like I have a thin layer of wax covering me.</li>
            <li> I usually just buy plain Epsom salt</li>
            <li> jar is nearly $23, which just got too expensive (I actually started cutting them with plain Epsom salts to make them go farther, but even that was pricey).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past</li>
            <li> Not sure if it &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34; in my case</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something herbal, and I&#x27;ve used scented bathsalts in the past, but this is a smack-you-in-the-head scent.</li>

            <li> Too Expensive.  </li>
            <li> search for scientific evidence concerning Epsom salt baths was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Way too fragrant, with unpleasant undertones.</li>
            <li> I purposefully chose eucalyptus, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got it a lot sooner than I expected, the product meets &amp; exceeds the standards of what I was expecting. Relaxes my feet!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells delicious</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and worked great!</li>
            <li> Good for a relaxing bath, especially after I tore my acl and have to rehab it. Soothing and very fragrantly fresh.</li>
            <li> FROM THE FIRST WHIFF I WAS HOOKED.  I LATER BOUGHT ANOTHER BRAND OF FOAMING BATH AND SO I GOT A BUBBLE BATH WITH DR. TEAL&#x27;S FANCY FRAGRANT EPSON SALT.  OH, SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT IS A CHEAP PRICE FOR A GIFT BUT I LOVE GIVING GIFTS THAT LAST A LONG TIME AND THAT NURTURES THE SPIRIT NO MATTER THE COST.  OFTEN LOVE DOES NOT ENCOMPASS PRICE LIKE IT DOES SENTIMENT.  I&#x27;M BUYING THESE BAGS OF SALTS AND GIVING THEM AS WRAPPED GIFTS. I JUST LOVE IT.  I BOUGHT EUCALYTUS &amp; SPEARMINT. (I WILL TRY THEM ALL.) DON&#x27;T FORGET TO GET YOURSELF A WONDERFUL BODY MOISTURIZING LOTION TO COMPLETE THIS WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.    NOW I RATE IT A FIVE UNLESS THE PRODUCT ENDS UP AFFECTING THE FEMALE ANATOMY WITH DRYNESS; OTHERWISE, ITS GOOD TO GO.  --MARGARET OPINE</li>
            <li> After a 1/2 marathon these are the best ever in a tub.</li>
            <li> I use it and it was great after getting rest but u have to rinse it off cause it dries with a white residue on ur skin</li>
            <li> Always loved using scented Epsom salts, and this particular brand is excellent...dissolves easily, works on aching joints and muscles, and smells great!</li>
            <li> I love these salts so much. As does my husband. We both use it to treat sore or aching muscles for physical activities. It smells amazing and works better than I expected!</li>
            <li> I purposefully chose eucalyptus, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  I love inhaling this strong minty smell.  It opens up the cavities - thank you.</li>
            <li> smells great and helps to relax</li>
            <li> This product was great for soothing my muscles and the scent was great. I felt like I had a little spa experience.</li>
            <li> I use this product when I am very sore, need to soak, or detoxify. It is not as herbal as you think and is good for the sinus.</li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that the bag arrived with a puncture which resulted in a HUGE mess in the box, it&#x27;s hard to tell how effective a product like this really is. The scent is pleasant but soon dissipates.</li>
            <li> Epsom salt is great for post-workout baths to relax your muscles. This product is especially nice because of the rosemary &amp; mint to provide a pleasant smell as well.</li>
            <li> very nice epsom salts i love the scent too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fooling around with Dr. Teal&#x27;s aromatic Epsom Salt since they started carrying them at the local health food store. I broke my arm in three places a few months back and once I started getting minimal mobility back so I could take a good soaking bath, I have been using this faithfully in warm water. The overall effect of good old Epsom Salts infused with Rosemary and Mint is incredibly soothing and seems to even lessen the swelling.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> the smell of these salts are great, also the effect that has in my body. I ride my bike for more than 2 hours and after that when I have time I take a bath and the salts help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried other epsom and sea bathing salts and enjoyed them, so when I saw this I decided to give it a try. It really works on sore muscles and muscle fatigue. I now have all of the scents.</li>
            <li> I have sciatica, and epsom bath soaks really seem to help with the pain.  My husband also uses these after hard workouts to help ease stiffness and soreness in his muscles.  These are among the first ones I tried, and I do like them - they do the job just fine.  However, I have found that regular old epsom salts you can get at the dollar store work just as well - if I want a little scent I just add some rosemary, tea tree, or peppermint essential oil and voila, scented salts.  Considering the price difference between salt+EO and these pre-scented salts, I had to knock off a few stars.  Good product, but to expensive for me considering how often I use them.</li>
            <li> I bought these on the recommendation of my doc after I sprained my abductor muscles. I needed something to ease my aches and pains. This therapeutic soaking formula works great and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> This has spearmint or some weird mint in it that made it smell funny.  I was expecting regular mint and rosemary, but alas no.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this, second bag, she is a cancer survivor and she loves a soak in this, with the aroma</li>
            <li> What wonderful salts. I had been using [[ASIN:B000VUWX8G Tired Old Ass Soak / Bath Salts / 12 oz.]] for the past year to help soothe aches and pains from regular workouts, and though they are also quality salts, a 12 oz. jar is nearly $23, which just got too expensive (I actually started cutting them with plain Epsom salts to make them go farther, but even that was pricey).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for an alternative other than plain Epsom salts when I came across Dr. Teal&#x27;s here on Amazon. What a find: the price is right at $5.99 for 48 oz., and the salts themselves are wonderfully soothing -- the infusion of oils definitely helps take the edge off of muscle kinks, and the minty scent is invigorating. Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past it is superior to similar products.  I find it superior to other products I have used and will continue to us this one</li>
            <li> Wonderful for the Bath, Foot soak or tired aching joints.</li>
            <li> Love!  I can&#x27;t decide if I like the calm soak by Dr. Teal better though...  They are all great!  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> These bath salts make for a great treat after a long workout or sporting event. Soothing and helpful in muscle recovery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works great as bath salts but was hoping for a more aromatic experience.  Surprisingly didn&#x27;t have much of a rosemary scent.  I prefer the Eucalyptus Spearmint.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the auto-delivery but am going to now. I use these with the Hot Spa Ultimate Foot Bath. They smell wonderful &amp; take away the swelling in my feet after a long shift at the restaurant I manage. They also leave my skin soooo soft. The aches &amp; pains melt away. I will definitely try the other scents/aids they have. This is worth the $5-$6 every month because of how my feet feel at the end.</li>
            <li> I love to soak in a bath filled with essential oils and Epsom salts.  They do the job.</li>
            <li> PERFECT after a long day at work and the gym. I absolutely love it!!!!!! It smells nice too, and with a hot, or icy bath it&#x27;ll help take away aches and pains. (dissolve it in warm water before you put the ice in when taking a cold bath though, it&#x27;s difficult to dissolve in cold water.)</li>
            <li> I had tried the lavender one before, and I then ordered this one cos it was cheaper. It helps with sore muscles just as well, but obviously doesn&#x27;t smell just as great. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price. :)</li>
            <li> Dont be fooled, has fragrance, a synthetic smell</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as a foot soak for some inflammation from running. Very relaxing and soothing and love the mint smell. Not sure if it &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34; in my case but I will be trying it as a full body soak in the future. Refreshing!</li>
            <li> I loved this salt, very calming effect..,the only downside is people with diabetes and blood pressure can&#x27;t take salt baths. Otherwise it&#x27;s fantastic,</li>
            <li> I love epsom salt. Dr Teals is the best and Amazon has the best prices..</li>
            <li> I love to use these salts after taking long hikes.  They are great for soothing sore muscles and the fragrance helps relax you even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance of the Therapeutic salts is more minty than rosemary scented.  I liken the fragrance to that of a freshly made mojito.</li>
            <li> works great for easing tension in muscles and overall relaxation to sleep.</li>
            <li> Old and/ or expired product... Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery - which was awesome as I desperately needed it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love soaking my legs in a bathtub with this Epsom salt after a long and strenuous day at work on my feet all day or after a tough workout.</li>
            <li> Used this many times. Great to take an Epsom salt bath after heavy exercising. The fragrance makes it special.</li>
            <li> This Dr Teal&#x27;s Epsom salt does exactly what it claimed, soothing and therapeutic. I followed the instruction and soaked my feet for 20 min.</li>
            <li> I love these salts.  I usually just buy plain Epsom salt but my husband got this for me as one of my Christmas gifts and I am highly satisfied.  First of all, the bag is FULL.  Not like when you open a bag of chips and it is only half full.  They do not skimp you at all.  I put 1 cup in my bath water and it made my muscles feel a lot better.  I am an endurance athlete and really needed it.  A much bigger difference than plain Epsom salt (which I always thought was awesome).  I am a massage therapist and I will recommend this brand to them now.  Highly satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> Epsom salts are wonderful to soothe sore muscles; I use them after long hikes, and I&#x27;m so grateful they exist. My husband couldn&#x27;t believe he had no sore muscles after biking 100 miles! Of course, the secret was that I made him take a bath in which I poured 1-2 cups of Epsom salts :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use unscented Epsom salts, unscented Epsom salts and essential oils, and scented Epsom salts. Their effect is equally soothing, and the scent is just a matter of personal taste. The good news is, this particular brand doesn&#x27;t overcharge for flavors (actually I paid the same price for unscented Epsom salts as I paid for Dr. Teal&#x27;s salts). Just choose your scent and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I hurt my back a few months ago, and a co-worker recommended epsom salt baths. I have to say they worked incredibly well. I recovered much faster!</li>
            <li> I am famous for taking aleve after working 12 hour shifts BUT after soaking in this i was ache FREE!!</li>
            <li> This scent was a new option for me to get my hands on and I loved it.  I am a fragrance driven person.  All scents change my mood and this is a nose opener.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love all the bath salts by Dr. Teal. This one is one of my favorites. It is a good way to relax your joints and muscles. You also absorb magnesium which we do not find in our foods like we used to. Good product.</li>
            <li> These are great for the price.  Pour them into little fancy bags and you can fool yourself that you&#x27;re getting a luxury $100 buck soak!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s aroma is wonderful after a long day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this salt in hopes of relieving sore muscles due to my profession as a massage therapist. The bag arrived quickly via Prime two day shipping, however the bag was open in the box upon arrival. There was not enough damage or product lost to require a return or exchange. After inspection, I noticed that the salt had gotten into the track of the zipper closure. After several attempts to clear the track, I ended up pouring the entire bag into a Rubbermaid container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salts themselves smell wondrous. I usually prefer my lavender scented salts but this variety is a nice occasional switch up. They dissolve well when added to the tub water and my skin feels smooth afterward. Unlike some other salts I have previously used, this product does not leave my skin feeling oily or like I have a thin layer of wax covering me. Recommend this product if you are looking for a relaxing and clean experience.</li>
            <li> Found at Walmart for over half the price. Good product though</li>
            <li> Makes for a great relaxing bath.</li>
            <li> Too Expensive.  I love Dr Teal&#x27;s products, but found this to be too expensive for the same size that I can buy locally for half the price.</li>
            <li> This salt soak is awesome for soothing away your aches and pains. I use it to ensure a great nights sleep.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful and it really relieves sore muscles. It relaxes mind and body and dissolves very easily in hot water.</li>
            <li> Tried this one over a brand I use all the time. I actually liked it better. I&#x27;ll use again. :)</li>
            <li> Honestly, this stuff works great at relieving joint muscle pain. Great to have as part of your pain management arsenal.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first bag at a local retail store and used it in the bath, not just for the ladies. I can not use bubble bath so this is very different than that. Plan on a long soak in the tub the your skin and body feels after a soak with this product will make you a believer, you will be hooked.</li>
            <li> There is no scientific evidence to support Epsom Salt relieving muscle pain or speeding healing.

            <li> I have several of Dr. Teal&#x27;s bath salts &amp; bubble bath &amp; they are all fantastic! I&#x27;ve used many different brands &amp; these are the best.&lt;br /&gt;Downfall about buying these on Amazon is the price. You can get these at walmart, sent right to your door if you want, for super cheap. The reason I bought this on Amazon is because Walmart doesn&#x27;t offer this particular one &amp; I wanted to try it out. I&#x27;m glad I did! It&#x27;s just as good as the rest &amp; I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I brought this product for my sore muscles after a run. I am pleased with this product and how effective it works. I add 1 drop of eucalyptus oil for extra strength. You will have to soak for at least  20-30 mins to get best results.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter to use in her footspa and it smells soooooo good, the peppermint smell fills the whole house.  Plus, it helps to leave your feet feeling so soft and refreshed.  You only need a little bit in a footspa, so this huge bag will last forever.</li>
            <li> Fallen in love with Dr. Teal&#x27;s epson salt.  Not too over powering of a scent, the smell isn&#x27;t cheap, good for relaxing muscles.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Dr. Teal&#x27;s Therapeutic soaking solution.  I have a job where I&#x27;m on my feet for 10 hours a day, bending, crouching, lifting, twisting, you name it.  I come home with my muscles WRECKED.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other therapeutic bath soak products, but this one is the most effective I&#x27;ve used.  I picked it up because I liked the smell, but I&#x27;ve continued to pick it up because I feel so much better when I climb out of the bath.</li>
            <li> Way too fragrant, with unpleasant undertones. I was hoping for something herbal, and I&#x27;ve used scented bathsalts in the past, but this is a smack-you-in-the-head scent. Kind of makes me itch.</li>
            <li> This, and all of the rest, practically melt away sore muscles. It&#x27;s not my favorite of all of the Dr Teal&#x27;s scents, but it&#x27;s still pleasant and relaxing.</li>
            <li> Bag was busted open when received.</li>
            <li> I lead a very active life.  As a former college athlete, I am used to having massage therapy, muscle stim, ice baths, etc.  following games and practices.  This is for those looking for post workout relief, this is an inexpensive in home remedy to help keep you on the field, refreshed, and revitalized to recover and get back out there quicker.  My wife loves these as well to have a spa day at home.  All the different varieties are great.  Could not be more of a fan on these products.</li>
            <li> Great!  I love the scent and the cooling sensation on my legs.  I am recovering from an operation and this helps more than I can say!  I use it every night.</li>
            <li> The salts are wonderful but it was puncture in the bag and for over everything</li>
