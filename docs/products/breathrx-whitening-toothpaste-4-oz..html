            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Excellent!  </li>
            <li>The mints also are great.</li>
            <li>I found the best prices available for this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Good taste and no aftertaste.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Best toothpaste for keeping your mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>and I believe this will remain my favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>I get top marks from my dentist on every visit...-M-</li>
            <li>So glad we can get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a top product that dentists use in their offices</li>
            <li>but with this which I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 wks now whitens my teeth more and more as time goes on.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love BreathRx toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
            <li>and I do like it a lot although I do wish it would do a BETTER job of whitening my teeth...</li>
            <li>but I use this toothpaste in conjunction with Arm &amp; Hammer Whitening toothpaste and they do an excellent job of working together to keep my teeth white, so if I use both they seem to have the intended effect</li>
            <li>Excellent toothpaste that truly refreshes your breath for long periods.</li>
            <li>It is a very mild paste and doesn&#x27;t whiten any better than the others</li>
            <li>Not from the natural family industry I am proud to be supportive of but for those who don&#x27;t care about this</li>
            <li>I have a dry mouth and needed a really good toothpaste that is good for the teeth and mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the best results when I go to get my teeth cleaned than in the past.</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t dry my mouth.</li>
            <li>On the plus side it keeps my mouth TOTALLY CLEAN</li>
            <li>I Love this toothpaste; this is the toothpaste my dentist has in the office and my whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>The vendors here ship them quickly, the products are often priced at a discount, and I can get bulk.</li>
            <li>Everyone in our family agrees that is it worth ordering it.</li>
            <li>This product is worth it because it truly whitens teeth.  </li>
            <li>, it rinses clean and gives you a mouth that feels TOTALLY MINTY FRESH and in conjunction with the mouthwash your teeth will be CLEAN, PROTECTED, and PEARLY WHITE!</li>
            <li>Well, I really feel cleaner, clearer, fresher than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Cleans and whitens and very affordable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Most often, I hate rating the product I like, because the more stars a product gets, the higher it is likely to increase its price.&lt;br /&gt;However, I loved this, and I have no way to thank this product.  </li>
            <li>I get numerous compliments on my teeth and my smile!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>It came highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>First tried these back in 2002!</li>
            <li>For awhile it was available at Walgreen, but now they no longer carry it (or at least it has not been in the stores I&#x27;ve visited).</li>
            <li>While this is advertised for breath freshening, it is also terrific sensitive gums and teeth.  </li>

            <li> For the price of this Tooth Paste, it&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s odd.  </li>
            <li> I believe the anti-bacterial ingredients have given me less cavities than ever before</li>
            <li> A little pricey but a little paste every time you brush</li>
            <li> And one of the only ones out that that contains the key ingredients for fighting bad breath.</li>
            <li> That is, it is not okay to brush with this toothpaste while you intend to rinse with a Colgate or Crest mouth wash liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I usually switch tooth paste up.</li>
            <li> and I brush at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have been using Breath RX products since 2002, but have found that they are increasingly difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> and I no longer have bad breath.</li>

            <li> This is the very best for plaque.</li>
            <li> I Love this toothpaste; this is the toothpaste my dentist has in the office and my whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> Most often, I hate rating the product I like, because the more stars a product gets, the higher it is likely to increase its price.&lt;br /&gt;However, I loved this, and I have no way to thank this product.  So, I am writing a review on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for two months and I believe this will remain my favorite toothpaste.  One thing I discovered is that it doesn&#x27;t work well when I use a rinse liquid (mouth wash) of a different brand. That is, it is not okay to brush with this toothpaste while you intend to rinse with a Colgate or Crest mouth wash liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to that discovery, I purchased the liquid of the same brand.  Now I can&#x27;t tell how my teeth seem to have crystal in them.  Diamond? Well, I really feel cleaner, clearer, fresher than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> I noticed upper teeth are slightly yellow and bottom teeth is whitening.  That&#x27;s odd.  I really like it.  I will recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Like the taste, I have not used it long enough to see the difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I have been using Breath RX products since 2002, but have found that they are increasingly difficult to find in stores. The vendors here ship them quickly, the products are often priced at a discount, and I can get bulk. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothpaste! I have been using it for the past 5 years and will never go back to the more commonly used brands.  I found the best prices available for this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using BreathRX for years and it is exemplary! I get top marks from my dentist on every visit...-M-</li>
            <li> A dental hygienist recommend this toothpaste. For awhile it was available at Walgreen, but now they no longer carry it (or at least it has not been in the stores I&#x27;ve visited). So glad we can get it through Amazon. Everyone in our family agrees that is it worth ordering it. The mints also are great.</li>
            <li> Not from the natural family industry I am proud to be supportive of but for those who don&#x27;t care about this it&#x27;s a top product that dentists use in their offices</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. Works great and doesn&#x27;t dry my mouth.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This product is worth it because it truly whitens teeth.  I was using the whitening strips that you use for 30 min. in a.m. and p.m. but was using them only in a.m. and they worked well, but with this which I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 wks now whitens my teeth more and more as time goes on.  A little pricey but a little paste every time you brush is all you need and I brush at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> First tried these back in 2002! WHOA! Minty! Bought one a few years back. Havent bought one recently. Yes its a bit expensive but cheaper than getting a filling that is for sure. I usually switch tooth paste up. I highly recommend this one. Likely getting one soon again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love BreathRx toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I have a dry mouth and needed a really good toothpaste that is good for the teeth and mouth. I chose the &#x27;whiten&#x27; blend as my teeth have begun to turn yellow with age. I use BreathRx mouthwash, tongue spray and tongue scraper as well. I&#x27;ve had the best results when I go to get my teeth cleaned than in the past. My dentist is very happy with the result as well. I believe the anti-bacterial ingredients have given me less cavities than ever before and I no longer have bad breath.</li>
            <li> For the price of this Tooth Paste, it&#x27;s not worth it.  It is a very mild paste and doesn&#x27;t whiten any better than the others</li>
            <li> I started getting these from my dentist. Soon after I found RX products on Amazon,  I decided I may as well save some money and buy here. Wonderful product. Cleans and whitens and very affordable.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY brand of mouthwash that helps my husband!  Have tried everything else out there.  This stuff WORKS!</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste off and on for over a year now and I do like it a lot although I do wish it would do a BETTER job of whitening my teeth... I eat a lot of chocolate and drink a lot of soda ( cola, especially ) so I don&#x27;t know if that is what is keeping my teeth looking like a shade brighter of mother-of-pearl but I use this toothpaste in conjunction with Arm &amp; Hammer Whitening toothpaste and they do an excellent job of working together to keep my teeth white, so if I use both they seem to have the intended effect but if I just use this one it does not.  On the plus side it keeps my mouth TOTALLY CLEAN and it has no gunky, grainy, filmy residue when you brush with it, it rinses clean and gives you a mouth that feels TOTALLY MINTY FRESH and in conjunction with the mouthwash your teeth will be CLEAN, PROTECTED, and PEARLY WHITE!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I have been using for awhile.  I get numerous compliments on my teeth and my smile!</li>
            <li> It works like any other toothpaste...I don&#x27;t see much difference in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste that truly refreshes your breath for long periods. Although expensive, the benefits of the toothpaste is well worth it, especially for those with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> While this is advertised for breath freshening, it is also terrific sensitive gums and teeth.  It came highly recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste for keeping your mouth feeling fresh and clean.  Can&#x27;t beat the price here even when it is on sale in the stores, which is not very often!</li>
            <li> And one of the only ones out that that contains the key ingredients for fighting bad breath. Good taste and no aftertaste. Was recommended by my dentist. Use the mouthwash, too.</li>
