            <li>it also smells good.</li>
            <li>I can no longer support the &amp;#34;really good product&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I use it for twist and braid outs and it provides good definition and moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really loved the application process because your hair feels like silk when it is applied.</li>

            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced that, but I will say don&#x27;t use too much</li>

            <li>I got this at Duane Reades/Walgreen.... not to many stores care it</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>It looked much better...</li>
            <li>more silky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I felt better about my look.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product for type 4 hair.</li>
            <li>Many of the reviews I read said that they did not like the light weight feeling of this cream so based on many reviews</li>
            <li>As I Am Twist Defining crean added good coil definition using 2-strand twists and allowed my natural hairstyle to have more style and definition.  </li>
            <li>this actually does what it claims, it defines curls and is great for twistouts and braidouts, bantu, roller sets, etc.  </li>
            <li>When I initially started using this product, it worked great.  </li>
            <li>and I am told it is available at some Walgreens</li>
            <li>No more to add, excellent!</li>
            <li>And the fact that is a natural product, it is safe to use it!</li>
            <li>My twists are defined, soft, they have a nice sheen and a nice hold (not stiff).</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who is into natural hair for nice coils and twists.</li>
            <li>One of the points of this journey is to stop using so much heat on my hair, use healthy products and reduce my time in the salon.</li>
            <li>but I was lucky</li>
            <li>Love this product for my and my daughters natural hair.</li>
            <li>but this is totally worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This pomade is soft, smells nice, light, non-greasy, and doesn&#x27;t build up with daily use.</li>
            <li>This product makes the hair very soft and really smooth as well as reduces the frizz.</li>
            <li>Bottom line I love it and will definitely continue to buy it along with the co wash, leave in and the hydration elation.</li>
            <li>Turns out it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this on at first.</li>
            <li>I think I still apprecate the double butter more</li>
            <li>I coated my hair sections first with a homemade hair butter..</li>
            <li>the As I am Double butter cream or their Hair milk I will like it even more.</li>
            <li>I finally had a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li>I like these products much better when I was transitioning, especially the Butter Cr&amp;egrave;me...love it.</li>
            <li>I suddenly felt better about spending the $22.&lt;br /&gt;+  </li>
            <li>i used more of the leave in than i did the twisting cream and my hair still came out dry.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and is very strong, only a little bit is enough to apply in the hair.</li>
            <li>Since I have a large jar of the stuff I will probably use it again.</li>
            <li>My 2nd day at work with my new look was better.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions using the &amp;#34;hair really wet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Works very well to define curl.</li>
            <li>It really hydrates my hair and defines my curls</li>
            <li>This product works really well on my 3c/4b/4c hair.  </li>
            <li>This was very dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to spend $22</li>
            <li>As an African American woman, with three different hair types (kinky, curly, and straight), this product really makes my twist outs look very nice.  </li>
            <li>At first, I clearly used too much.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a well balanced view at this point, but I have trialled it on my TWA doing finger coils, and it is certainly ha good hold and is a better alternative to gels which really makes my hard dry and hard.</li>
            <li>When you pay so much for a daily hair product, it&#x27;s normal to expect it to change something--</li>
            <li>I tried this twist defining cream after hearing several positive comments (purchased elsewhere).</li>
            <li>After several applications of this product, my hair is doing something really &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; as though it doesn&#x27;t like water, heat, etc.  </li>
            <li>result was ultra defined, glossy, moisturized, natural looking curls.  </li>
            <li>I washed my hair that night and used the Kera Care Natural Textures product line...</li>
            <li>It gave you full definition with tight twists/curls in place for up to two days.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick coarse and dry (4a) , so if your hair is like mine, use this product wisely you will need extra moisture!!&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li>It is naturally very soft not coarse at all.</li>
            <li>It is quite expensive, but I feel that if I find the right combination of products that does wonders for my hair and make me feel good to go out, then I&#x27;ll pay a little extra to have that feeling.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because I like products that weigh my hair down a little more.</li>
            <li>I have newly gone natuaral and was looking for a product to add texture and definition to my dry strands.  </li>
            <li>overall I think its a good product, expensive but that 16oz jar will last a long time (you dont need a lot).</li>
            <li>while applying (to wet hair), i saw a lot of buildup (but i could not really see it as i was taking the twists down, i will pay more attention next time).  </li>
            <li>have really thick, soft natural curls and it doesn&#x27;t take much to moisturize and curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>First off I will say that I have used few products to twist my hair</li>
            <li>The first time I used it , I used it on dry hair that had other products in it.</li>

            <li> The first time I used it , I used it on dry hair that had other products in it.</li>
            <li> My only (somewhat) negative comment is that I don&#x27;t see any major difference in my hair texture given the high price of the product.</li>
            <li> flat ironed it and curled it.</li>
            <li> Im not the type to write reviews, But after using this product for my flat twist on my 4b/c curls i was amazed with the result.</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t as crunchy or dry; but the desired results simple were not there.  </li>
            <li> I allow it to dry slightly before using soft rods and the next day when I take my hair out.</li>
            <li> cons are that the buildup of the product is heavy and if you use too much product your hair will have pink flakes.</li>
            <li> The second and third time I used it, I used considerably less.  </li>
            <li> The key to this, I think ,is to use it with the other</li>
            <li> I always air dry my twists after shampooing by sleeping on the overnight.  </li>
            <li> On wet hair I had a lot of shrinkage, but once it dried I had soft defined coils.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine how well it would have looked if I had taken it down a day or so after twisting.</li>
            <li> i did not apply any moisturizer in the morning while taking the twists down because i was already at work, but next time I will bring some moisturizer with me.</li>
            <li> Also this cream makes the hair somewhat stiff (not hard, but stiff) and its not moisturizing, like some stylers.  </li>
            <li> I have peppermint oil in my spray bottle, I wet my hair</li>
            <li> I have tried this on damp and wet hair for a two strand twist.</li>
            <li> It seems expensive but it is worth it because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have thick 4c hair and long dreadlocs and a week later it is holding up well.</li>
            <li> It left my hair dry, hard and nothing to be desired.  </li>
            <li> In an attempt to get rid of some of the other product I have on hand, I used missJ&#x27;s curly pudding to twist my hair one week.  </li>
            <li> This past weekend my stylist cut all of the relaxer out of my hair and left me with about 2 inches.</li>
            <li> The product does not weigh the hair down and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> My twists were hard, and my hair and scalp were EXTREMELY dry.  </li>
            <li> A lot of other products that I&#x27;ve tried in the past defined my curls for a day, but this does the job for days.</li>
            <li> I was a little off put by the price which was around $21.00 at Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Some reviews for this product mention buildup and flaking after a few months</li>
            <li> So in an unfamiliar city I went to a few stores in search of something I could use.</li>
            <li> I received a recommendation from a friend and read the few reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> In the past I invested in Kera Care twist cream and usually use gels other than that product.  </li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t like the results.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what my hair type is.</li>
            <li> This cream has something added to give it a hard, gel like consistency, which my hair frowns upon.  </li>
            <li> Some other people have complained about it being sticky or smelling weird .</li>
            <li> But when I washed my hair with their coconut cowash and put in the leave in , I sealed my ends with oil and then added a very small amount of the twist defining cream</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this, and loves the way her twists turn out, Does not feel sticky or hard at all, this is the answer!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not needed and maybe those who said it smelled strange in their hair got a bad batch or something.</li>
            <li> I twisted my hair and used this product.</li>
            <li> Plus, the smell is horrible (not like their other products at all).  </li>
            <li> Leaves white crap all through the hair awful stuff</li>
            <li> but this isn&#x27;t a bad prodcut.</li>
            <li> I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am shocked!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very good product! I recommend it to anyone who is into natural hair for nice coils and twists. It smells good and is very strong, only a little bit is enough to apply in the hair. And the fact that is a natural product, it is safe to use it!</li>
            <li> This twist defining cream is lovely. It seems expensive but it is worth it because a little goes a long way. The key to this, I think ,is to use it with the other As I Am products. The first time I used it , I used it on dry hair that had other products in it. Even then it worked ok. Although instructions say to use it on damp or soaked hair.  But when I washed my hair with their coconut cowash and put in the leave in , I sealed my ends with oil and then added a very small amount of the twist defining cream and it wasn&#x27;t sticky at all. I never took out my hair until a week later for wash day and my hair was so defined and bouncy even after a week. I can only imagine how well it would have looked if I had taken it down a day or so after twisting. Some other people have complained about it being sticky or smelling weird . I haven&#x27;t experienced that, but I will say don&#x27;t use too much it&#x27;s not needed and maybe those who said it smelled strange in their hair got a bad batch or something. Idk. Bottom line I love it and will definitely continue to buy it along with the co wash, leave in and the hydration elation.</li>
            <li> I tried this twist defining cream after hearing several positive comments (purchased elsewhere). I LOVE IT! My twists are defined, soft, they have a nice sheen and a nice hold (not stiff). Some reviews for this product mention buildup and flaking after a few months - I think that&#x27;s a possibility for all twist creams, but I use a clarifying shampoo once per month, so I haven&#x27;t had this problem.  In an attempt to get rid of some of the other product I have on hand, I used missJ&#x27;s curly pudding to twist my hair one week.  My twists were hard, and my hair and scalp were EXTREMELY dry.  I promptly switched back to As I Am the following week.</li>
            <li> So I was on travel and I needed to do loc maintenance and I forgot to bring my hair products. So in an unfamiliar city I went to a few stores in search of something I could use. I found products that I have used before but I knew I did not like so all so all I was left with were &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; creams (No loc products) I had never used before. I found this on sale so I crossed my fingers and picked up a jar. Turns out it works pretty well. I am shocked! I have thick 4c hair and long dreadlocs and a week later it is holding up well. I thought it would have no hold at all. Since I have a large jar of the stuff I will probably use it again.</li>
            <li> this actually does what it claims, it defines curls and is great for twistouts and braidouts, bantu, roller sets, etc.  while applying (to wet hair), i saw a lot of buildup (but i could not really see it as i was taking the twists down, i will pay more attention next time).  Also this cream makes the hair somewhat stiff (not hard, but stiff) and its not moisturizing, like some stylers.  My hair is thick coarse and dry (4a) , so if your hair is like mine, use this product wisely you will need extra moisture!!&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I used this with the as i am leave in conditioner (and some oil for sealing), i used more of the leave in than i did the twisting cream and my hair still came out dry.  i did not apply any moisturizer in the morning while taking the twists down because i was already at work, but next time I will bring some moisturizer with me. overall I think its a good product, expensive but that 16oz jar will last a long time (you dont need a lot). it also smells good.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my and my daughters natural hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair product for a couple of weeks now; I&#x27;m still patiently waiting to see the difference. This pomade is soft, smells nice, light, non-greasy, and doesn&#x27;t build up with daily use. My only (somewhat) negative comment is that I don&#x27;t see any major difference in my hair texture given the high price of the product. When you pay so much for a daily hair product, it&#x27;s normal to expect it to change something--well, I&#x27;m still waiting...</li>
            <li> When I initially started using this product, it worked great.  However, along with the greatness, comes this buildup.  I ended up with flakes the size of cornflakes.  I followed the instructions using the &amp;#34;hair really wet&amp;#34; application.  I can no longer support the &amp;#34;really good product&amp;#34; review that I initially cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really thick, soft natural curls and it doesn&#x27;t take much to moisturize and curl my hair.  After several applications of this product, my hair is doing something really &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; as though it doesn&#x27;t like water, heat, etc.  It had this hardness about it that could NOT be explained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use this product again!</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks after using this creme.  Nice definition and hold without feeling sticky or flaky.  Lots of shine  which can sometimes be a challenge for my kinky curl pattern.</li>
            <li> My 4C hair responds well to this product. I use it for twist and braid outs and it provides good definition and moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are that the buildup of the product is heavy and if you use too much product your hair will have pink flakes.</li>
            <li> A+A+A+A+A+  Great product</li>
            <li> Works very well to define curl. Smells very good too!</li>
            <li> I love As I Am products.  However, this is not for my hair.  I had run out of my Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie and the curl and style milk (also by Shea Moisture) and decided to try something different.  At first, I clearly used too much.  It left my hair dry, hard and nothing to be desired.  The second and third time I used it, I used considerably less.  My hair wasn&#x27;t as crunchy or dry; but the desired results simple were not there.  This cream has something added to give it a hard, gel like consistency, which my hair frowns upon.  Maybe if I use it as a wash and go...I don&#x27;t know.  Plus, the smell is horrible (not like their other products at all).  If I decide to try this again--maybe as a wash and go, and I like it, I will do an update.  Otherwise, I will have to throw it out.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this, and loves the way her twists turn out, Does not feel sticky or hard at all, this is the answer!  I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> leaves flakes in my hair</li>
            <li> On time! Perfect Condition, great service! Very satisfied as a costumer. No more to add, excellent! I would strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with this product. I  had been looking for a solution for a while. Will definitely order again in the future.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It really hydrates my hair and defines my curls and I have 4c hair type. A lot of other products that I&#x27;ve tried in the past defined my curls for a day, but this does the job for days. It is quite expensive, but I feel that if I find the right combination of products that does wonders for my hair and make me feel good to go out, then I&#x27;ll pay a little extra to have that feeling. It&#x27;s heaven in a jar.</li>
            <li> I like about 4 of the AS I Am hair products. I didn&#x27;t like this on at first. It has since grown on my.  I have peppermint oil in my spray bottle, I wet my hair and I use this along with the double butter I cornrow my hair. I allow it to dry slightly before using soft rods and the next day when I take my hair out.Ihave well defined \\&quot;braid\\&quot; outs.... I think I still apprecate the double butter more but this isn&#x27;t a bad prodcut. I didn&#x27;t get this here. I got this at Duane Reades/Walgreen.... not to many stores care it but I was lucky I found these products there.</li>
            <li> First off I will say that I have used few products to twist my hair and I usually don&#x27;t like the results.  I finally have enough hair to obtain the look of the twistout that I like and a friend recommended this cream.  In the past I invested in Kera Care twist cream and usually use gels other than that product.  This cream is the bomb.  I received a recommendation from a friend and read the few reviews on Amazon.  This product works really well on my 3c/4b/4c hair.  I have about 3 textures in my head I believe.  Many of the reviews I read said that they did not like the light weight feeling of this cream so based on many reviews I coated my hair sections first with a homemade hair butter..then used this cream on each section.  I also did a braid out instead of a twist out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result was ultra defined, glossy, moisturized, natural looking curls.  I also use flexi rods after i braid or twist.  This was my best result ever.  I was a little off put by the price which was around $21.00 at Sally&#x27;s and I am told it is available at some Walgreens but this is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a denman brush after applying to each section to work the product into your hair before twisting/braiding.  I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I also used the kimmaytube leavein which also adds tons of moisture to the hair.  Recipe can be found on the web.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product for type 4 hair. I have tried this on damp and wet hair for a two strand twist. On wet hair I had a lot of shrinkage, but once it dried I had soft defined coils. I found that on damp hair I had the best results. My hair was shiner and had no shrinkage. This product makes the hair very soft and really smooth as well as reduces the frizz. I really loved the application process because your hair feels like silk when it is applied. It does an excellent job at smoothing out the hair strands. The product does not weigh the hair down and is not greasy. I gave it 4 stars because I like products that weigh my hair down a little more. However, I think if I use it along with the As I am Double butter cream or their Hair milk I will like it even more. Nonetheless, I will continue to purchase this product because the ingrediants are great and you get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li> As an African American woman, with three different hair types (kinky, curly, and straight), this product really makes my twist outs look very nice.  I always air dry my twists after shampooing by sleeping on the overnight.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I am African American. I am not sure what my hair type is. It is naturally very soft not coarse at all. I have not had a relaxer in 6 months. This past weekend my stylist cut all of the relaxer out of my hair and left me with about 2 inches. This was very dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;She flat ironed it and curled it. It looked very nice while I was in the salon. One of the points of this journey is to stop using so much heat on my hair, use healthy products and reduce my time in the salon. I finally had a healthy head of hair. I was soooo happy.  I washed my hair that night and used the Kera Care Natural Textures product line...the cleansing wash, leave-in conditioner, twist cr&amp;egrave;me and butter cr&amp;egrave;me. The results were so so. I like these products much better when I was transitioning, especially the Butter Cr&amp;egrave;me...love it. I went to Sally&#x27;s looking for some QP Mango Moisturizer. They didn&#x27;t have it on the shelf, but I saw this product. I really didn&#x27;t want to spend $22 but I read the reviews on my iPad while in the store. I purchased it and tried it that night. Please note. I am not a hair person. All of this is an experiment for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ I was very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;+ I twisted my hair and used this product. It looked much better... more silky.&lt;br /&gt;+ I had a cleaner look than the Kera Care Twist Cr&amp;egrave;me.&lt;br /&gt;+ I suddenly felt better about spending the $22.&lt;br /&gt;+  My 2nd day at work with my new look was better. I felt better about my look. My husband hasn&#x27;t said anything. He is still in shock that I cut my hair off.&lt;br /&gt;+ I must say this product has a great start with me. I think I am going to order the As I am butter cr&amp;egrave;me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- The  Price</li>
            <li> I have newly gone natuaral and was looking for a product to add texture and definition to my dry strands.  As I Am Twist Defining crean added good coil definition using 2-strand twists and allowed my natural hairstyle to have more style and definition.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a well balanced view at this point, but I have trialled it on my TWA doing finger coils, and it is certainly ha good hold and is a better alternative to gels which really makes my hard dry and hard.</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle! Im not the type to write reviews, But after using this product for my flat twist on my 4b/c curls i was amazed with the result. It gave you full definition with tight twists/curls in place for up to two days. I use this after i co-wash with AS I AM co-washer.</li>
            <li> Leaves white crap all through the hair awful stuff</li>
