            <li>I don&#x27;t know where that guy is coming from, but these brushes are the best you can buy.  </li>
            <li>They are the best!</li>
            <li>but it is still a wonderful bath brush.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>Best Bath Brush ever!  </li>
            <li>He is very happy with it!</li>
            <li>There is a great curve to the handle to increase leverage when you need it.</li>
            <li>When I needed a replacement,  I didn&#x27;t know where to find the Fuller Brush man, and was so happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is a great bath brush and a staple in my home.</li>
            <li>To each his own, of course!</li>
            <li>I have bought them as Christmas presents and have had good commnents about them.  </li>
            <li>I was to delighted to find out I could still get this brush.</li>
            <li>1 was for my daughter who is also a delighted user.  </li>
            <li>Always loved Fuller Brush products and now I have a place to purchase them.</li>
            <li>Good length, too.</li>
            <li>Great product, quick shipping.  AAA+++!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Fuller Brush products and will continue to purchase them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this brush that is why I bought another one for me.</li>
            <li>Bought much better brush at drug store for $5.00.  </li>
            <li>Without any gripping material, he drops it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item to anyone and will be ordering a couple more this year for gifting.</li>
            <li>brush measures just under 21&amp;#34; from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>Think they need more water protection to prevent the metal turning the bristles browm.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the reviews--I&#x27;d been searching for a strong brush for my husband, who has not been able to replace his favorite that broke.</li>
            <li>My mother had this identical brush 40 years ago and when I had my own home, I went right out and bought one also.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but it was not the Fuller brush that I thought I ordered.</li>
            <li>Both are very good, what I expected.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think it is as fantastic as some reviewers have made it out to be.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the longer brush length.</li>
            <li>This brush looks like a toilet brush but its great for the body.</li>
            <li>This brush is just right!  </li>
            <li>packaging was very protective, it came in a few days and in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>It seems to rust rather quickly, too.</li>
            <li>Super bath brush.</li>
            <li>More appropriate to use on your toilet, NOT your body</li>
            <li>Just as good as the one we had, when I was a teen-ager, long ago!</li>
            <li>Most body brushes are natural fiber that doesn&#x27;t stand up very well in the shower because they get mold easily.  </li>
            <li>and he is able to scujb his back just fine with this brush.  </li>
            <li>The bristles of this brush are more soft than the foot and body one.</li>
            <li>Oh and by the way it is easy to clean after use, because the bristles are not porous like many other scrub brushes it rinses right off.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the right size for me.</li>
            <li>This brush has just the right sturdiness</li>
            <li>They clean easily and dry quickly without having to worry about mold.  </li>
            <li>Soft enough for a good scrub.  </li>
            <li>Initially, he thought it was ok.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I have been looking for.  </li>
            <li>The Fuller bath brush is great, though different from what I had expected.</li>
            <li>Doesn,t slip on hand &amp; not too stiff nor too soft,  also great for scrubing feet in shower.</li>
            <li>He had used Fuller brushes in the past and thought this would be a good one</li>
            <li>the one i remember from my youth was much softer.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates and cleans really well.</li>
            <li>Very functional shape.</li>
            <li>For the bottom of your feet and back of the legs, for a soft scrub turn it one way and for a more invigorating scrub.</li>
            <li>These brushes are strong enough to exfoliate and soft enough to get in the most sensitive places without any ouch.  </li>
            <li>While references are made to Original fuller brush, this brush is not the same as the &amp;#34;original fuller brush&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but it is so much better in quality than any other retail store-bought brushes.</li>
            <li>Handle broke cleanly in two on second use.  </li>
            <li>Much too soft!!</li>
            <li>most likely Chinese.</li>
            <li>and it is like new.  </li>
            <li>And while my back doesn&#x27;t itch as much now that I have this to scrub with instead of the wimpier ones, I would still prefer a much stiffer bristle.</li>
            <li>I have owned the original, and noticed straight away, that the bristles&lt;br /&gt;were inferior, and would not last long.</li>
            <li>I expect it will last much longer!</li>
            <li>i had a simple bath brush, not  expensive, plastic handle and nylon bristles etc which i used for 20 years-TWENTY.</li>
            <li>Long brush head with soft bristles and a long, easy to hold handle.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift, but it replaced a worn out brush of similar type and was much appreciated.</li>
            <li>1 Day old and</li>
            <li>It has the soft bristles needed for skin use but the handle is flimsy and breaks off at about the 8 week point.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of these since I can&#x27;t find the soft bristles I need, but it breaks off too soon</li>
            <li>I am now 74 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>brush has soft bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too Soft .</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft, they collapse completely during use.  </li>
            <li>The handle does not allow you to reach your whole back.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are too soft.  </li>
            <li>very disappointing-handle  too thin  and needs a rounded shape, but better than the rest of those i tried.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft enough for the more tender areas but firm enough for all over (not the scrub brush type of bristles).  </li>
            <li>Love the long handles on both to reach hard to get areas.</li>
            <li>Too soft and bristles not close enough together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the natural bristle brushes in wooden frames over the years.  </li>
            <li>The brush is exactly as I remember it, except that the bristles seem a little softer.  </li>
            <li>It is shaped differently than the generic brand one I had that fell apart, so it&#x27;s taking me a little while to get used to, but it&#x27;s a very sturdy brush.</li>

            <li> Only drawback is it looks like a toilet brush, guess you can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
            <li> The spiraled brush design also allows cleaning between toes and in crevices vs. the flat or one sided brushes.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband because he wanted a long back brush to replace the one he has been using for years.  </li>
            <li> this brush is a poor excuse compared to the original one .</li>
            <li> Maybe the brush is a toilet brush?</li>
            <li> I think this must be a toilet brush.</li>
            <li> The handle is just a tad long</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> long handle takes a bit of getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Handle too long.  </li>
            <li> It is soft enough for everyday use but bristly enough to keep all those dead skin cells coming off.</li>
            <li> while I am using one of the sharp metal ends pulls out of the end of the handle and put a 9 scratch across my back...</li>
            <li> Quality is going down as they do not last as long.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on the current one are not as stiff as the last ones I bought</li>
            <li> The long handle allows one to wash lower legs, feet, and back with much less bending and twisting than a hand held item.  </li>
            <li> Quality of the bristles is not the same as previous Fuller Brush bath brushes of this style.</li>
            <li> They are - but only slightly.</li>
            <li> Especially your back and hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> i would say its chinese junk not fit for fullers name</li>
            <li> Something that actually makes it feel like you&#x27;re getting dead skin off and preventing bacne.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected in a bath brush.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have listened to the other comments.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed  to see what was a good name brand end up making this rubbish..</li>
            <li> The bristles are so hard they scratched my back!</li>
            <li> Described as &amp;#34;medium-stiff&amp;#34; brush but bristles are thin, softer than the bristles of a soft toothbrush, &amp; flatten when you apply pressure--there is no scrub in this brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just junk - I bought one which lasted less than two years.  </li>
            <li> We had the previous Fuller brush for over 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are so stiff and sharp that they literally almost cut your skin.  </li>
            <li> The brush is EXTREMELY sharp and stiff.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little softer than my previous brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was replacing a Fuller brush I purchased about 20 years ago, and the design changed a little.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Fuller brushes since I was a little boy.  </li>
            <li> But within a few weeks, it started losing bristles.</li>
            <li> and the handle is narrow and made of a shiny, slippery plastic.</li>
            <li> : Look elsewhere for your brushes before you waste your money on Fuller brushes.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are so stiff they hurt.</li>
            <li> was too stiff.</li>
            <li> you prefer STIFF bristles ...</li>
            <li> these brushes are not very good, I have had mine for just a few months and it already broke,,,</li>
            <li> The bristles were so hard I couldn&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> Have had this brush in my shower at least two years now and will get another if it ever wears out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid it would make my back bleed.</li>
            <li> the bristles started to turn brown shortly after use from the metal turning rusty, made the brush look rather bad.</li>
            <li> Bristles are so soft this brush is absolutely worthless.  </li>
            <li> He said he was unable to get a lather up on the brush.  </li>
            <li> It was so bad we threw it out.</li>
            <li> ever since i have been appalled at the quality of the stuff on offer.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very bad product!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely awful.</li>
            <li> frankly i am disgusted.</li>

            <li> Too soft and bristles not close enough together.</li>
            <li> I love this brush that is why I bought another one for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where that guy is coming from, but these brushes are the best you can buy.  Most body brushes are natural fiber that doesn&#x27;t stand up very well in the shower because they get mold easily.  These brushes are strong enough to exfoliate and soft enough to get in the most sensitive places without any ouch.  They clean easily and dry quickly without having to worry about mold.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about four years and it is like new.  I have bought them as Christmas presents and have had good commnents about them.  They are the best!</li>
            <li> The Fuller bath brush is great, though different from what I had expected. I was replacing a Fuller brush I purchased about 20 years ago, and the design changed a little. I hope it is still a quality product. The bristles are a little softer than my previous brush.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was very protective, it came in a few days and in excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was to delighted to find out I could still get this brush. It has been a staple in our shower for years. The bristles on the current one are not as stiff as the last ones I bought but it is still a wonderful bath brush. I hope the company never stops producing them.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, but it replaced a worn out brush of similar type and was much appreciated.</li>
            <li> While references are made to Original fuller brush, this brush is not the same as the &amp;#34;original fuller brush&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; most likely Chinese. All Legit fuller products, have their logo embossed somewhere&lt;br /&gt;on the product, something this brush lacks. I have owned the original, and noticed straight away, that the bristles&lt;br /&gt;were inferior, and would not last long. After a month of use they were, and it didn&#x27;t. know what you are buying here!</li>
            <li> I like the quality of this brush. It is shaped differently than the generic brand one I had that fell apart, so it&#x27;s taking me a little while to get used to, but it&#x27;s a very sturdy brush. The handle is just a tad long but it is so much better in quality than any other retail store-bought brushes. I expect it will last much longer!</li>
            <li> Only bath brush I use, my husband uses his every day.  They last about a year and then I use them to scrub my bath &amp; shower.  Wonderful product.  Have to update my review, the last brush I bought wasn&#x27;t glued properly and the wires pulled out the second time it was used.  Quality is going down as they do not last as long.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> 1 Day old and while I am using one of the sharp metal ends pulls out of the end of the handle and put a 9 scratch across my back...Very disappointed  to see what was a good name brand end up making this rubbish..</li>
            <li> Handle broke cleanly in two on second use.  Very bad product!  Bought much better brush at drug store for $5.00.  By all means, save your money!</li>
            <li> It works fine, but it was not the Fuller brush that I thought I ordered.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews--I&#x27;d been searching for a strong brush for my husband, who has not been able to replace his favorite that broke. On the advice of reviewers, I went with this. Initially, he thought it was ok. But within a few weeks, it started losing bristles. It also didn&#x27;t stay soaped up to his liking. ...and the handle is narrow and made of a shiny, slippery plastic. Without any gripping material, he drops it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our teenager is using it now, and though he doesn&#x27;t rave about it, has no complaints. I just don&#x27;t think it is as fantastic as some reviewers have made it out to be. To each his own, of course!</li>
            <li> I also ordered the Fuller foot and body brush. Both are very good, what I expected. Reminds me of the Fuller brushes we had growing up. They were sold by door sales persons. I recommend. The bristles of this brush are more soft than the foot and body one. Love the long handles on both to reach hard to get areas.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just junk - I bought one which lasted less than two years.  Fuller brushes used to last forever.  And forget any of the &#x27;satisfaction  guarantees&#x27; they talk about on their web site - they only guarantee their brushes for one year.    Net: Look elsewhere for your brushes before you waste your money on Fuller brushes.  The company that is called Fuller Brush today is not even close to the company that made Fuller Brushes  20 years ago.</li>
            <li> Yes.Did meet all expectations.</li>
            <li> It has the soft bristles needed for skin use but the handle is flimsy and breaks off at about the 8 week point.  I&#x27;ve used a number of these since I can&#x27;t find the soft bristles I need, but it breaks off too soon and then the brush is too short to reach your back.  It seems to rust rather quickly, too.</li>
            <li> Have had this brush in my shower at least two years now and will get another if it ever wears out.  The long handle allows one to wash lower legs, feet, and back with much less bending and twisting than a hand held item.  The spiraled brush design also allows cleaning between toes and in crevices vs. the flat or one sided brushes.  The bristles are soft enough for the more tender areas but firm enough for all over (not the scrub brush type of bristles).  I would recommend this item to anyone and will be ordering a couple more this year for gifting.</li>
            <li> Best Bath Brush ever!  Long brush head with soft bristles and a long, easy to hold handle.  Exactly what I have been looking for.  I just ordered another for the beach house!</li>
            <li> I have been using these Fuller brushes since I was a little boy.  I am now 74 yrs old.  I bought 3 of them. 1 was for my daughter who is also a delighted user.  I&#x27;ll keep using them till I die.</li>
            <li> I am returning this &amp;#34;bath&amp;#34; brush. The bristles are so hard they scratched my back! Maybe the brush is a toilet brush?</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband because he wanted a long back brush to replace the one he has been using for years.  He said he was unable to get a lather up on the brush.  He had used Fuller brushes in the past and thought this would be a good one but it did not turn out that way.</li>
            <li> The bristles need to be somewhat firmer.  Much too soft!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely awful. Bristles are so stiff they hurt. More appropriate to use on your toilet, NOT your body</li>
            <li> Bristles are so soft this brush is absolutely worthless.  A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> was too stiff. would have torn my back to shreds. the one i remember from my youth was much softer.</li>
            <li> this brush is a poor excuse compared to the original one . i would say its chinese junk not fit for fullers name</li>
            <li> This is the second Fuller Brush Bath Brush I have purchased through the years. I&#x27;ve always liked Fuller Brush products and will continue to purchase them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This brush has soft bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you prefer STIFF bristles ... this is NOT the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This brush measures just under 21&amp;#34; from top to bottom. I&#x27;m a  5&#x27;4&amp;#34; female and it&#x27;s the right size for me. I wear a 7 glove and the feel of the handle and the back reach is prefect.</li>
            <li> The bristles were so hard I couldn&#x27;t even use it. I had to return it asap.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are so stiff and sharp that they literally almost cut your skin.  I can not stand to use it.</li>
            <li> Always loved Fuller Brush products and now I have a place to purchase them.</li>
            <li> I think this must be a toilet brush. I wish I would have listened to the other comments. I&#x27;m afraid it would make my back bleed. The brush is EXTREMELY sharp and stiff. Buyer BEWARE!</li>
            <li> We had the previous Fuller brush for over 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;The long handle takes a bit of getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;This one is almost identical and aids in scrubbing one&#x27;s feet.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.</li>
            <li> My husband also bought this for himself.  He is 6 ft tall and he is able to scujb his back just fine with this brush.  He is very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Quality of the bristles is not the same as previous Fuller Brush bath brushes of this style.</li>
            <li> Too Soft . Handle too long.  Not the same as I remember from the 60&#x27;s .</li>
            <li> This brush looks like a toilet brush but its great for the body. It exfoliates and cleans really well. Especially your back and hard to reach places. It is soft enough for everyday use but bristly enough to keep all those dead skin cells coming off. There is a great curve to the handle to increase leverage when you need it. For the bottom of your feet and back of the legs, for a soft scrub turn it one way and for a more invigorating scrub. Oh and by the way it is easy to clean after use, because the bristles are not porous like many other scrub brushes it rinses right off.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the one we had, when I was a teen-ager, long ago!</li>
            <li> brush shape is fabulous; bristles however are thin and the  wire is already  showing and there&#x27;s been  a lot of shedding of bristles- very disappointing-handle  too thin  and needs a rounded shape, but better than the rest of those i tried. i had a simple bath brush, not  expensive, plastic handle and nylon bristles etc which i used for 20 years-TWENTY. it finally gave out. ever since i have been appalled at the quality of the stuff on offer. frankly i am disgusted.</li>
            <li> Super bath brush. Very functional shape. Only drawback is it looks like a toilet brush, guess you can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping.  AAA+++!</li>
            <li> these brushes are not very good, I have had mine for just a few months and it already broke,,, the bristles started to turn brown shortly after use from the metal turning rusty, made the brush look rather bad. Have to keep bleaching, but rust keeps changing it. Think they need more water protection to prevent the metal turning the bristles browm.</li>
            <li> Described as &amp;#34;medium-stiff&amp;#34; brush but bristles are thin, softer than the bristles of a soft toothbrush, &amp; flatten when you apply pressure--there is no scrub in this brush. Amazon reimbursed me without any hastle.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft, they collapse completely during use.  The handle does not allow you to reach your whole back.  It was so bad we threw it out.</li>
            <li> Had this brush before for years.  Can reach every place on back in shower.  Doesn,t slip on hand &amp; not too stiff nor too soft,  also great for scrubing feet in shower.</li>
            <li> This brush is just right!  I&#x27;ve used the natural bristle brushes in wooden frames over the years.  They always break and mildew.  This brush has just the right sturdiness and I enjoy the longer brush length.</li>
            <li> My mother had this identical brush 40 years ago and when I had my own home, I went right out and bought one also. When I needed a replacement,  I didn&#x27;t know where to find the Fuller Brush man, and was so happy to find it on Amazon.  The brush is exactly as I remember it, except that the bristles seem a little softer.  If not for that, this would be a 5-star purchase.</li>
            <li> The bristles are too soft.  This functions like a washcloth on a stick.</li>
            <li> Suits the purposes I needed for the bath.</li>
            <li> I had hoped this brush would have stiffer bristles than the ones in the stores. They are - but only slightly. And while my back doesn&#x27;t itch as much now that I have this to scrub with instead of the wimpier ones, I would still prefer a much stiffer bristle. Something that actually makes it feel like you&#x27;re getting dead skin off and preventing bacne. (Back acne for those unfamiliar with the term.) This does not feel like it&#x27;s doing that. Makes me wish that the days of the door to door Fuller Brush salesman still existed so I could&#x27;ve tested it before buying it.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected in a bath brush.  Soft enough for a good scrub.  Good length, too.</li>
            <li> This is a great bath brush and a staple in my home.</li>
