            <li>Honestly i dont realy like this product ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying to try this kind of product</li>
            <li>It does have a nice effect.</li>
            <li>Also, if they seem to get clumpy, use a high-quality eyelash comb (preferably the metal kind) to comb out the clumps.  </li>
            <li>The mascara does wash off with warm water.</li>
            <li>Soooo now I have to get my own.</li>
            <li>I do not use this every day just because it is kind of a process to apply it</li>
            <li>I had been reading about this kind of product all over the Internet.  </li>
            <li>You put on a coat of your own, then you use the gel and fiber combo to build your own lashes.  </li>
            <li>I really think this is a wonderful product, I even ordered one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT, worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Its just like the original but cheaper!!</li>
            <li>and I have been super happy with it.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews for this product I decided to give it a try,  and am so glad that I did!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>is best) when your done applying as to fan out lashes for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>First time trying fiber lashes and these worked great.</li>
            <li>I experienced some of the fibers falling off the first time</li>
            <li>I had so many compliments on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Everyone wanted to know what I was doing or using on my lashes...  Love it...</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll love it yourself.</li>
            <li>Comes in a cute sunglass holder case.</li>
            <li>Then once I was able to apply the fiber they would fall out in my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>Does take a bit of practice, and some extra time, but the finished look is excellent.</li>
            <li>Really opens my eyes up and looks great.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff it works just like it says.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>I love Vixen Fiber Lash.  </li>
            <li>IT WORKS:))</li>
            <li>Works well.the gel tube could have more product in it</li>
            <li>I will be accused of having extensions for sure.</li>
            <li>It is important to apply the transplanting gel and then IMMEDIATELY apply the fibers before the gel has any time to dryâ€¦at all!  </li>
            <li>The more gel/mascara you apply, the longer it will get.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product..</li>
            <li>I had purchased a cheaper brand and had better results with the cheaper brand than this Vixen.</li>
            <li>and i love that they are just a one time application</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>im glad I found Lash Factory.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I love the fiber idea as mascara</li>
            <li>and I will keep buying more.</li>
            <li>OK for the price,</li>
            <li>Love the product at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the case it comes in also.</li>
            <li>and it take way more time.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more:)</li>
            <li>Was looking a name brand and came across lash factory..very pleased</li>
            <li>This mascara was okay.  </li>
            <li>It did give me slightly more volume and length.  </li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Glad I chose this product instead.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;transplanting&amp;#34; gel doesn&#x27;t seem to attract the fibers at all, and after one coat, the bristles don&#x27;t seem to want to add any more to your lashes.</li>
            <li>Love love it, and ladies</li>
            <li>I love the 3D fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>Ive been getting so many compliments.</li>
            <li>this works a lot better than the $30</li>
            <li>They look great, but the fibers flake off pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and washes off easily with warm water.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the product it looked good.</li>
            <li>but it falls off and builds up under your eye , not good,and I&#x27;m pretty good at this trust me.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and looking forward to using more often to make my eyes stand out.</li>
            <li>I love it...makes my lashes longer and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Makes your lashes look very full, and stays on until you remove them.</li>
            <li>The results she posted about looked pretty nice, so I wanted to see what was on the market at a better price.</li>
            <li>I am hooked, I love it, I have big beautiful lashes, and I will order again from this company.</li>
            <li>I have heard many horror stories from all of these knock off&#x27;s of younique&#x27;s original 3D mascara.  </li>
            <li>The fibers and gel are easy to use and it comes off just as easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>The price is good, and the lashes really look great, especially when you follow the tips, if you don&#x27;t then they look clumpy.</li>
            <li>I use my own mascara first, light coat, then gel, fiber, gel.</li>
            <li>I put on 2 applications and it was a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>And you only have to use one coat to get that great look.  </li>
            <li>This product is great but always apply regular mascara after applying this mascara.</li>
            <li>Looks great and last all day.</li>
            <li>I wear contacts lenses and still comfortable.</li>
            <li>Hers ran out in 2 weeks, I am on my 3rd week and its still great.</li>
            <li>A great product that I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing again!!</li>
            <li>LOVE how it makes my lashes look sooooo much longer :)</li>
            <li>Thanks! !!</li>
            <li>super easy to use.</li>
            <li>the shipment was very fast, the product it self was ok.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more very soon for friends and family!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited and would recommend it to friends and family....</li>
            <li>These take a while to learn to apply correctly so that the fibers don&#x27;t fall in your eyes, but it is SO worth it!  </li>
            <li>Worth every cent!</li>
            <li>Make sure you separate your lashes pretty well before applying</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>So far love this mascara better than others I have tried</li>
            <li>They are a pain to clean off at the end of the night.1</li>
            <li>There was a similar product in a local store that was charging $45.00 for the same thing (different brand), this product was worth every penny and this is the one time that I am happy to say that you get what you paid for, great product, great rice!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it for it not being the real product.</li>
            <li>Lots of flaking but a full look</li>
            <li>are very sparkly and feminine which I love.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and</li>
            <li>you have to be quick or the glue will set .</li>
            <li>Very easy and not messy.</li>
            <li>i have tried some other types of this product but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes are now long and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I own 3 different brands and this is my favorite because it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t clump up. :)</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this for just going out on weekends but loved it so much I wear it daily...</li>
            <li>my new favorite mascara</li>
            <li>This product really does give me fuller and longer looking lashes and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This totally worked out so much better than what they were selling at the in house parties!</li>
            <li>Works exactly the way it is suppose to!  </li>
            <li>I tried it a few times and still nnot happy with it.</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;ve wasted $23 on this and still need to buy Younique which is a great product.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it, and be so glad you spent the $.</li>
            <li>With the cost of the product and shipping lower than Younique, I thought it was worth a gamble.</li>
            <li>Like my Lil sister said wow its magic.</li>
            <li>However, I think the end result is much more natural.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>, I look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes, great results!</li>
            <li>It washes right off and leaves no residue or damages your eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use with very specific helpful tips.</li>
            <li>The fibers lashes are great but the hole in the top of the mascara type product is a little big.</li>
            <li>Sure, it takes a little more times than just using mascara alone, but it is totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>by the way, I live in Hawaii and with the humidity and sweating I do, the mascara held up just fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several and this is the best hands down!</li>
            <li>I generally never have too many issues with &amp;#34;generics&amp;#34;, but this isn&#x27;t worth the time or money.</li>
            <li>First time user of this 2 part lash product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve attempted to apply this many different ways and it just clumps and the fibers fall all on my face through out the day.</li>
            <li>Although it was better than regular mascara, you get what you pay for, in this case.</li>
            <li>I contacted the shipper and they had one sent to my home ;-).  </li>
            <li>And my lashes look sooo much longer when using this mascara!</li>
            <li>It was my first 3d fiber mascara</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different expendive stuff from sephora and other stores, and this mascara is the best so far!</li>
            <li>This is my first 3D purchase ever.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>I used a primer first, not a mascara.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I accidentally did that the first time i used it</li>
            <li>Really recommend it!</li>
            <li>My rep is at youniqueproducts.com/fastlash if you are interested in finding one.</li>
            <li>Other than that I am satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>I saw the reviews on the other brand that can cost way more!</li>
            <li>My regular mascara does way better and its way cheaper as well</li>
            <li>Case is a little cheap otherwise ok.</li>
            <li>For me, this product is just as good as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the more expensive options out there.</li>
            <li>If this product works, great for you, but beware they are NOT good to deal with when it comes to returning the item.  </li>
            <li>As long as you follow the directions you will love the outcome.</li>
            <li>and I have full natural lashes,</li>
            <li>They make my lashes look super long and full.</li>
            <li>Goes on fast and washes off easily with water and your regular face wash!</li>
            <li>It looks decent for the first couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sparse lashes that were damaged by extensions, so this product didn&#x27;t work very well for me, as I have gaps in my real lashes that did not fill in.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>They do work really well.</li>
            <li>really improves looks of lashes as longer, thicker.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fast applying</li>
            <li>so I tend not to use it so much.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really see a difference between this and the lloreal fiber lash.</li>
            <li>I have very this lashes</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to have glam lashes every day haha.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Lash Factory !</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t add the gel after the application of the fibers which is an important final step.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem that fibers are really coming off that much...</li>
            <li>I fully understand that sometimes products are defective, and so I reached out to them, to find they dont really want to do anything for you.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very picky.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 3d fiber mascara by Lash Factory because my eye lashes are light and short and I can&#x27;t apply falsies to save my life.</li>
            <li>Also, the gel brush is different, but again, I think this brand does a better job of lengthening the lashes and still looking natural.</li>
            <li>No clumping, No flaking, long wearing, washes off easily.</li>
            <li>It takes a few coats to get a great result as with any other mascaras but with practice it adds the right length</li>
            <li>No irritation like most other brands  </li>
            <li>other than that they are ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many other mascara that promise fuller longer looking lashes with no results.</li>
            <li>I tried other products that had better applicators.</li>
            <li>I already have long lashes but they arent very thick but with this theyre perfect!</li>
            <li>The arrived in a cute pink &amp;#34;eyeglass&amp;#34; case with clear to follow instructions and they really work</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t imagine that the more expensive brands work better.  </li>
            <li>I have tiny eye lashes and these really do make them look lush and full.</li>
            <li>All I can say is  Wow!!</li>
            <li>It has lasted me months and the fibers look so natural and really stay in place.  </li>
            <li>Two coats of Dior Show pretty much gives me the same volume &amp; length.</li>
            <li>It seemed like it was more dried up and caked on my eyes causing flakes that irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li>but overall I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look so long and full.  </li>
            <li>get the extra fibers right off from under my eye</li>
            <li>You can do as many layers as you want for as dramatic a look as you wantâ€¦just be sure the last coat seals in the fibers</li>
            <li>The only negative that I have is, and if you follow the directions properly, you shouldn&#x27;t have this problem, when applying the fibers, be sure to just apply it to the top half of your lashes, other wise you will get it too close to your eye and will end up with fibers in there</li>
            <li>Everyone noticed that I did something new.</li>
            <li>I have very short and thin lashes and this adds great length and volume.</li>
            <li>My lashes look so full and natural and long</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t a WOW factor!  </li>
            <li>(my eyes are sensitive too) &amp; and the easiest to use!</li>
            <li>This was not any better than any other competitors regular mascara.  </li>
            <li>This is WELL worth the money - it makes my lashes SOO long and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that IT WORKS!</li>
            <li>I may just have to figure out a new technique, but thus far I&#x27;ve used it 3 or four times</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this version from Lash Factory as well as some of the others (such as Younique) because the gel is not as thick.</li>
            <li>Works just as good if not better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Gives them a little extra length and a lot more thickness.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are so light and few</li>
            <li>and after I used the 3D fiber mascara, wow.  </li>
            <li>old daughter</li>
            <li>it really works, i have really short eyelashes</li>
            <li>They look so long and pretty.</li>
            <li>300% lashes and all i can say is WOW, just follow the instructions</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would make my lashes look longer and natural and</li>
            <li>Just tried 3D Fiber Lashes this morning and wow</li>
            <li>My lashes are pretty long to begin.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive eyes do not try this product.</li>
            <li>I also have extremely sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>A few friends of mine have the more expensive ones, but to be honest</li>
            <li>In the pic: left eye is the lash factory mascara and the right eye is regular mascara with no fibers.</li>
            <li>and my became very irritated other than that it worked very well</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions read other Consumers comments and did not have success.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this item to first time users as it is easy to apply and works as a dramatic mascara.</li>
            <li>, the next times I followed the instructions and only did the top half and no problems.  </li>
            <li>Seriously major difference in length!</li>
            <li>They seriously do look very full and natural.</li>
            <li>Much more natural looking than false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say its complete waste, its good for people with no lashes but other than that not worth the 15$.</li>
            <li>I had very thin eye lashes and this gave them a nice boost, definitely worth the money I spent!</li>
            <li>I originally ordered a cheaper brand but the instructions were in Chinese and gel tube dried out, so I returned them and found these</li>
            <li>I still use my regular mascara for everyday use and I whip this out for a special occasion because I&#x27;ll already have time set aside to use the 3d lashes.</li>
            <li>but generally 3-4 coats does the trick</li>
            <li>Just after I&#x27;d ordered it, we moved back home unexpectedly.</li>
            <li>Makes a big difference without the worry of ruining your natural lashes.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look so long and thick, way better than drug store brands.</li>
            <li>Like some of the others,  I have used the false eyelashes which had taken most of my eyelashes away.  </li>
            <li>The Transplant gel formula is much creamier and the natural fibers are less flaky than the Younique brand.</li>
            <li>But this mascara makes them look like i have fake lashes on and make my eyes seem bigger which i love!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really compare to other fiber mascara, but seems to work well.  </li>
            <li>Goes on so much easier than I expected,  and lasts all day too!</li>
            <li>Works just as good as the expensive one!</li>
            <li>Tends to go on a bit thick and goopy, not as clean as the Benefit mascara</li>
            <li>If you are used to &amp;#34;too faced ; better than false lashes&amp;#34; it isn&#x27;t quite the same formula.</li>
            <li>;) just this little miracle.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I didnt give 5 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t seem like there is much product in  the tubes and for rhe price you&#x27;d want it to last a while, but I guess we&#x27;ll see how long it does last with me using it almost everday.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are other similar products that cost over twice as much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend as a &#x27;cheaper&#x27; alternative to other fiber lash mascaras.</li>
            <li>You can do a little or go really bold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brand new out of the packaging it was at the point where I would throw any other mascara away.</li>

            <li> Honestly i dont realy like this product ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying to try this kind of product</li>
            <li> It does have a nice effect.</li>
            <li> Also, if they seem to get clumpy, use a high-quality eyelash comb (preferably the metal kind) to comb out the clumps.  </li>
            <li> The mascara does wash off with warm water.</li>
            <li> Soooo now I have to get my own.</li>
            <li> I do not use this every day just because it is kind of a process to apply it</li>
            <li> I had been reading about this kind of product all over the Internet.  </li>
            <li> You put on a coat of your own, then you use the gel and fiber combo to build your own lashes.  </li>
            <li> I really think this is a wonderful product, I even ordered one for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Its just like the original but cheaper!!</li>
            <li> and I have been super happy with it.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews for this product I decided to give it a try,  and am so glad that I did!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> is best) when your done applying as to fan out lashes for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> First time trying fiber lashes and these worked great.</li>
            <li> I experienced some of the fibers falling off the first time</li>
            <li> I had so many compliments on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Everyone wanted to know what I was doing or using on my lashes...  Love it...</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll love it yourself.</li>
            <li> Comes in a cute sunglass holder case.</li>
            <li> Then once I was able to apply the fiber they would fall out in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> Does take a bit of practice, and some extra time, but the finished look is excellent.</li>
            <li> Really opens my eyes up and looks great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it works just like it says.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> I love Vixen Fiber Lash.  </li>
            <li> IT WORKS:))</li>
            <li> Works well.the gel tube could have more product in it</li>
            <li> I will be accused of having extensions for sure.</li>
            <li> It is important to apply the transplanting gel and then IMMEDIATELY apply the fibers before the gel has any time to dryâ€¦at all!  </li>
            <li> The more gel/mascara you apply, the longer it will get.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product..</li>
            <li> I had purchased a cheaper brand and had better results with the cheaper brand than this Vixen.</li>
            <li> and i love that they are just a one time application</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> im glad I found Lash Factory.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the fiber idea as mascara</li>
            <li> and I will keep buying more.</li>
            <li> OK for the price,</li>
            <li> Love the product at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the case it comes in also.</li>
            <li> and it take way more time.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more:)</li>
            <li> Was looking a name brand and came across lash factory..very pleased</li>
            <li> This mascara was okay.  </li>
            <li> It did give me slightly more volume and length.  </li>
            <li> I am more than pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Glad I chose this product instead.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;transplanting&amp;#34; gel doesn&#x27;t seem to attract the fibers at all, and after one coat, the bristles don&#x27;t seem to want to add any more to your lashes.</li>
            <li> Love love it, and ladies</li>
            <li> I love the 3D fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> Ive been getting so many compliments.</li>
            <li> this works a lot better than the $30</li>
            <li> They look great, but the fibers flake off pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and washes off easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product it looked good.</li>
            <li> but it falls off and builds up under your eye , not good,and I&#x27;m pretty good at this trust me.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looking forward to using more often to make my eyes stand out.</li>
            <li> I love it...makes my lashes longer and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Makes your lashes look very full, and stays on until you remove them.</li>
            <li> The results she posted about looked pretty nice, so I wanted to see what was on the market at a better price.</li>
            <li> I am hooked, I love it, I have big beautiful lashes, and I will order again from this company.</li>
            <li> I have heard many horror stories from all of these knock off&#x27;s of younique&#x27;s original 3D mascara.  </li>
            <li> The fibers and gel are easy to use and it comes off just as easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> The price is good, and the lashes really look great, especially when you follow the tips, if you don&#x27;t then they look clumpy.</li>
            <li> I use my own mascara first, light coat, then gel, fiber, gel.</li>
            <li> I put on 2 applications and it was a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> And you only have to use one coat to get that great look.  </li>
            <li> This product is great but always apply regular mascara after applying this mascara.</li>
            <li> Looks great and last all day.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts lenses and still comfortable.</li>
            <li> Hers ran out in 2 weeks, I am on my 3rd week and its still great.</li>
            <li> A great product that I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing again!!</li>
            <li> LOVE how it makes my lashes look sooooo much longer :)</li>
            <li> Thanks! !!</li>
            <li> super easy to use.</li>
            <li> the shipment was very fast, the product it self was ok.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more very soon for friends and family!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited and would recommend it to friends and family....</li>
            <li> These take a while to learn to apply correctly so that the fibers don&#x27;t fall in your eyes, but it is SO worth it!  </li>
            <li> Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> Make sure you separate your lashes pretty well before applying</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> So far love this mascara better than others I have tried</li>
            <li> They are a pain to clean off at the end of the night.1</li>
            <li> There was a similar product in a local store that was charging $45.00 for the same thing (different brand), this product was worth every penny and this is the one time that I am happy to say that you get what you paid for, great product, great rice!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it for it not being the real product.</li>
            <li> Lots of flaking but a full look</li>
            <li> are very sparkly and feminine which I love.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery and</li>
            <li> you have to be quick or the glue will set .</li>
            <li> Very easy and not messy.</li>
            <li> i have tried some other types of this product but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes are now long and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> I own 3 different brands and this is my favorite because it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t clump up. :)</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this for just going out on weekends but loved it so much I wear it daily...</li>
            <li> my new favorite mascara</li>
            <li> This product really does give me fuller and longer looking lashes and is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This totally worked out so much better than what they were selling at the in house parties!</li>
            <li> Works exactly the way it is suppose to!  </li>
            <li> I tried it a few times and still nnot happy with it.</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;ve wasted $23 on this and still need to buy Younique which is a great product.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it, and be so glad you spent the $.</li>
            <li> With the cost of the product and shipping lower than Younique, I thought it was worth a gamble.</li>
            <li> Like my Lil sister said wow its magic.</li>
            <li> However, I think the end result is much more natural.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> , I look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes, great results!</li>
            <li> It washes right off and leaves no residue or damages your eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use with very specific helpful tips.</li>
            <li> The fibers lashes are great but the hole in the top of the mascara type product is a little big.</li>
            <li> Sure, it takes a little more times than just using mascara alone, but it is totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> by the way, I live in Hawaii and with the humidity and sweating I do, the mascara held up just fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several and this is the best hands down!</li>
            <li> I generally never have too many issues with &amp;#34;generics&amp;#34;, but this isn&#x27;t worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> First time user of this 2 part lash product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attempted to apply this many different ways and it just clumps and the fibers fall all on my face through out the day.</li>
            <li> Although it was better than regular mascara, you get what you pay for, in this case.</li>
            <li> I contacted the shipper and they had one sent to my home ;-).  </li>
            <li> And my lashes look sooo much longer when using this mascara!</li>
            <li> It was my first 3d fiber mascara</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different expendive stuff from sephora and other stores, and this mascara is the best so far!</li>
            <li> This is my first 3D purchase ever.</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> I used a primer first, not a mascara.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I accidentally did that the first time i used it</li>
            <li> Really recommend it!</li>
            <li> My rep is at youniqueproducts.com/fastlash if you are interested in finding one.</li>
            <li> Other than that I am satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews on the other brand that can cost way more!</li>
            <li> My regular mascara does way better and its way cheaper as well</li>
            <li> Case is a little cheap otherwise ok.</li>
            <li> For me, this product is just as good as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the more expensive options out there.</li>
            <li> If this product works, great for you, but beware they are NOT good to deal with when it comes to returning the item.  </li>
            <li> As long as you follow the directions you will love the outcome.</li>
            <li> and I have full natural lashes,</li>
            <li> They make my lashes look super long and full.</li>
            <li> Goes on fast and washes off easily with water and your regular face wash!</li>
            <li> It looks decent for the first couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sparse lashes that were damaged by extensions, so this product didn&#x27;t work very well for me, as I have gaps in my real lashes that did not fill in.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> They do work really well.</li>
            <li> really improves looks of lashes as longer, thicker.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fast applying</li>
            <li> so I tend not to use it so much.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really see a difference between this and the lloreal fiber lash.</li>
            <li> I have very this lashes</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to have glam lashes every day haha.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Lash Factory !</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t add the gel after the application of the fibers which is an important final step.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem that fibers are really coming off that much...</li>
            <li> I fully understand that sometimes products are defective, and so I reached out to them, to find they dont really want to do anything for you.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very picky.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3d fiber mascara by Lash Factory because my eye lashes are light and short and I can&#x27;t apply falsies to save my life.</li>
            <li> Also, the gel brush is different, but again, I think this brand does a better job of lengthening the lashes and still looking natural.</li>
            <li> No clumping, No flaking, long wearing, washes off easily.</li>
            <li> It takes a few coats to get a great result as with any other mascaras but with practice it adds the right length</li>
            <li> No irritation like most other brands  </li>
            <li> other than that they are ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many other mascara that promise fuller longer looking lashes with no results.</li>
            <li> I tried other products that had better applicators.</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes but they arent very thick but with this theyre perfect!</li>
            <li> The arrived in a cute pink &amp;#34;eyeglass&amp;#34; case with clear to follow instructions and they really work</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine that the more expensive brands work better.  </li>
            <li> I have tiny eye lashes and these really do make them look lush and full.</li>
            <li> All I can say is  Wow!!</li>
            <li> It has lasted me months and the fibers look so natural and really stay in place.  </li>
            <li> Two coats of Dior Show pretty much gives me the same volume &amp; length.</li>
            <li> It seemed like it was more dried up and caked on my eyes causing flakes that irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> but overall I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look so long and full.  </li>
            <li> get the extra fibers right off from under my eye</li>
            <li> You can do as many layers as you want for as dramatic a look as you wantâ€¦just be sure the last coat seals in the fibers</li>
            <li> The only negative that I have is, and if you follow the directions properly, you shouldn&#x27;t have this problem, when applying the fibers, be sure to just apply it to the top half of your lashes, other wise you will get it too close to your eye and will end up with fibers in there</li>
            <li> Everyone noticed that I did something new.</li>
            <li> I have very short and thin lashes and this adds great length and volume.</li>
            <li> My lashes look so full and natural and long</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t a WOW factor!  </li>
            <li> (my eyes are sensitive too) &amp; and the easiest to use!</li>
            <li> This was not any better than any other competitors regular mascara.  </li>
            <li> This is WELL worth the money - it makes my lashes SOO long and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> I may just have to figure out a new technique, but thus far I&#x27;ve used it 3 or four times</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this version from Lash Factory as well as some of the others (such as Younique) because the gel is not as thick.</li>
            <li> Works just as good if not better than the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Gives them a little extra length and a lot more thickness.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are so light and few</li>
            <li> and after I used the 3D fiber mascara, wow.  </li>
            <li> old daughter</li>
            <li> it really works, i have really short eyelashes</li>
            <li> They look so long and pretty.</li>
            <li> 300% lashes and all i can say is WOW, just follow the instructions</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would make my lashes look longer and natural and</li>
            <li> Just tried 3D Fiber Lashes this morning and wow</li>
            <li> My lashes are pretty long to begin.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive eyes do not try this product.</li>
            <li> I also have extremely sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> A few friends of mine have the more expensive ones, but to be honest</li>
            <li> In the pic: left eye is the lash factory mascara and the right eye is regular mascara with no fibers.</li>
            <li> and my became very irritated other than that it worked very well</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions read other Consumers comments and did not have success.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this item to first time users as it is easy to apply and works as a dramatic mascara.</li>
            <li> , the next times I followed the instructions and only did the top half and no problems.  </li>
            <li> Seriously major difference in length!</li>
            <li> They seriously do look very full and natural.</li>
            <li> Much more natural looking than false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say its complete waste, its good for people with no lashes but other than that not worth the 15$.</li>
            <li> I had very thin eye lashes and this gave them a nice boost, definitely worth the money I spent!</li>
            <li> I originally ordered a cheaper brand but the instructions were in Chinese and gel tube dried out, so I returned them and found these</li>
            <li> I still use my regular mascara for everyday use and I whip this out for a special occasion because I&#x27;ll already have time set aside to use the 3d lashes.</li>
            <li> but generally 3-4 coats does the trick</li>
            <li> Just after I&#x27;d ordered it, we moved back home unexpectedly.</li>
            <li> Makes a big difference without the worry of ruining your natural lashes.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look so long and thick, way better than drug store brands.</li>
            <li> Like some of the others,  I have used the false eyelashes which had taken most of my eyelashes away.  </li>
            <li> The Transplant gel formula is much creamier and the natural fibers are less flaky than the Younique brand.</li>
            <li> But this mascara makes them look like i have fake lashes on and make my eyes seem bigger which i love!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really compare to other fiber mascara, but seems to work well.  </li>
            <li> Goes on so much easier than I expected,  and lasts all day too!</li>
            <li> Works just as good as the expensive one!</li>
            <li> Tends to go on a bit thick and goopy, not as clean as the Benefit mascara</li>
            <li> If you are used to &amp;#34;too faced ; better than false lashes&amp;#34; it isn&#x27;t quite the same formula.</li>
            <li> ;) just this little miracle.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didnt give 5 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t seem like there is much product in  the tubes and for rhe price you&#x27;d want it to last a while, but I guess we&#x27;ll see how long it does last with me using it almost everday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are other similar products that cost over twice as much.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend as a &#x27;cheaper&#x27; alternative to other fiber lash mascaras.</li>
            <li> You can do a little or go really bold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brand new out of the packaging it was at the point where I would throw any other mascara away.</li>
            <li> Even brand new, the fibers don&#x27;t stick to the primer and just make a mess.</li>
            <li> , I wear it practically everyday when I have time in the morning to apply, but it worth the few extra minutes it takes to apply in comparison to regular mascara.</li>
            <li> I did not use the eye lash curler either, my lashes we long and shown enough.</li>
            <li> My sister had recently purchased a more expensive brand of the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara, and I purchased this for half the price</li>
            <li> Arrived today  much earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> but so minor compares to how long my lashes look.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a long lash affect and thats not what I got, the mascara came off easly and it was all over my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want long eye lashes..</li>
            <li> I have long lashes but this along with my mascara works wonder.</li>
            <li> Only downfall is you have to be careful when applying the fibers.</li>
            <li> Long time to get the effect</li>
            <li> I put on my regular mascara as directed, let it dry, applied the gel and then the fiber mascara when the gel was still wet....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other product from loreal and it gave me the same look with out falling into my eyes.</li>
            <li> I used 2 applications on the one eye and mascara only on the other</li>
            <li> no different then other mascaras</li>
            <li> The liquid, or transplanting gel is so dry.</li>
            <li> Too dry gets in my eye</li>
            <li> My gel brush was just as dry as the fiber brush.</li>
            <li> let dry</li>
            <li> and then the gel and fiber mascara again, let dry..</li>
            <li> The worst part was that I had older product from a different manufacturer that had more product left in the tube, than this one had when I received it.</li>
            <li> Normally I do not return items</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara and not too bad of a price!</li>
            <li> The fibers are tiny black fibers that at times get into my eyes causing them to water.</li>
            <li> Really only like the mascara not the fibers you have black fibers under your eyes all day .</li>
            <li> This brand is considerably less than similar products</li>
            <li> It did gave the extra length to my lashes however its a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent 185+ to get eyelashes extensions ...</li>
            <li> It will clump if you are careful, it takes some trial and error in learning how to avoid that spider leg look.</li>
            <li> When I didn&#x27;t get the results I expected, I reversed and that didn&#x27;t work either.  </li>
            <li> I spent over $32 on the Younique 3D Fiber Lashes from a girl that I&#x27;d have to go to a salon to meet with her in order to avoid shipping.</li>
            <li> it was empty</li>
            <li> My thin, short lashes look better than if I had applied false lashes using 3D Fiber Lash Mascara!  </li>
            <li> I have unsuccessfully tried and failed to apply false lashes on my own, but have wound up gluing my eyes shut or pulling out the sparse lashes I already have, so when I heard about these fiber lashes I wanted to try them.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to plain mascara again.</li>
            <li> The containers have a strong, unpleasant metallic smell...</li>
            <li> I have gotten several complements and was asked it I was wearing fake lashes, so I would highly recommend these</li>
            <li> little flakes all over my face after applied and all day long.</li>
            <li> They are everything I expected!</li>
            <li> Does not work as expected!</li>
            <li> The lashes did not irritate my eyes, or cause any other problems.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t clump up as much as other mascaras.</li>
            <li> When I ran out, I wanted to look at other options</li>
            <li> I tried other 3D mascara</li>
            <li> and unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work as well, However, this mascara system is better than the ones you&#x27;d find for a similar price point and is a lot less difficult to remove than my $37 dollar one (which is a pain to remove at night).</li>
            <li> little brush has so much loose hairs they got in my eye every time!</li>
            <li> Leaving extra product on the wand and making it hard to not leave clumps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the hassle of all of these steps.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth retail price.</li>
            <li> The one down side is the fibers that fall on my cheek bones</li>
            <li> If everyone knew about this, other mascaras would be in jeopardy!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a replacement to the one I typically buy for $37 dollars</li>
            <li> I have extremely long lashes and finding a mascara I like has been hard.</li>
            <li> I am not blessed with long luxurious lashes and I am blonde, so what pitiful lashes I have are difficult to see even with mascara.  </li>
            <li> and it just takes a little practice to apply it correctly</li>
            <li> This mascara is no better than any other store bought mascara I have used.</li>
            <li> If you get those little fibers in your eyes forget it all is lost.</li>
            <li> AT ALL WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> The few times that I have used it I can see the difference and like the look and duration.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> I  have short thin eye lashes</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Package came dried out.</li>
            <li> Very weird to use at first, takes some adjusting to get used to.</li>
            <li> really dried out my lashes and it was flaky and I will not order this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not tried the expensive one, but these work very well for thin lashes.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve used it very little since I got it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> When you open the box it has this weird smell like chemical .</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical before actually trying it ,  So as soon as it arrived ( two days )</li>
            <li> and it takes forever to get the results you want usually</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday and can&#x27;t imagine my lashes without!</li>
            <li> I have no more problems after.  </li>
            <li> and it works JUST as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> not sure of quality of brush</li>
            <li> Waste of time, and ouch!</li>
            <li> The only thing that I will advise is to put on an extra coat of your base mascara after applying the lashes to seal in the fibers and prevent fallout.</li>
            <li> Not  a very good quality of fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> Its hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Hard to take off as well.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting the gel out of the container.</li>
            <li> (perhaps gel base starts to dry out) and irritating them, so I would only use it if I were going to dinner or something where it&#x27;s just for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> This just made them thick.  </li>
            <li> And not as expensive as other brands.</li>
            <li> I tried this one because it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the fibers seem to be getting into my eyes a few hours after applying</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD.</li>
            <li> Just hate that fiber flakes off, even after applying on the final coat of liquid gel/mascara.  </li>
            <li> She used it and was not happy.</li>
            <li> Burns your eyes and is poor quality.  </li>
            <li> I think I will stick to applying false lashes.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are non existent from years of taking off false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> A little annoying for contact lens wearers.</li>
            <li> I had people ask me all day where i got my fake eyelashes and</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical</li>
            <li> sorry I will no recomended this product to anyone</li>
            <li> The fiber was going into her eyes and felt uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give it a try, since the Younique is so expensive.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> One false move and you have cat lady eyes with clumps!</li>
            <li> I have very thin lashes and appreciate the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.</li>
            <li> Make a dramatic difference in the appearance of my lashes!</li>
            <li> If you want a dramatic and fuller set of lashes this is the product to use!  </li>
            <li> Yikes it was annoying to say the least.</li>
            <li> I have seen the craze on Facebook but didn&#x27;t want to pay crazy money for the mascara.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> I read the ONE review that was posted on this product and decided to go with it, although I was skeptical!</li>
            <li> so i advise  everyone this is a scam an im mad aboyt it</li>
            <li> It comes in black, no flaking no clumps!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So So So Bad.</li>
            <li> Irritated my eyes badly.</li>
            <li> Plus, this gel doesn&#x27;t clump nearly as bad as the brands that have a thicker gel.</li>
            <li> fibers flake really bad.</li>
            <li> Thesr don&#x27;t lengthen at all and flake into my eyes so bad</li>
            <li> I bought this and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> and they are rather annoying.  </li>
            <li> It flakes very bad.</li>
            <li> and it has been a horrible experience.</li>
            <li> and i hate them!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this product because my eyes burn terribly with it.</li>
            <li> Worst mascara</li>
            <li> Terrible odor.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> DIDN&#x27; WORK AT ALL WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> It does what it say it does..luv it</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are so light and few and after I used the 3D fiber mascara, wow.  I had so many compliments on my eyes.  Everyone wanted to know what I was doing or using on my lashes...  Love it...</li>
            <li> I am surprisingly happy with it. The fibers tend to get into my eyes, so I have to squint while I apply the product is the only drawback. I will be reordering!</li>
            <li> Arrived today  much earlier than I expected.Product works as advertised. ..my lashes are longer and fuller!!!</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes but they arent very thick but with this theyre perfect! Gives them a little extra length and a lot more thickness. I had people ask me all day where i got my fake eyelashes and how i got them on so perfect! Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Works very well. I was checking this out when I saw that a friend was hosting a party with a much more expensive mascara. The results she posted about looked pretty nice, so I wanted to see what was on the market at a better price. This totally worked out so much better than what they were selling at the in house parties!</li>
            <li> They are everything I expected! Makes your lashes look very full, and stays on until you remove them. I have very thin lashes and appreciate the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.</li>
            <li> They do work really well. I have tiny eye lashes and these really do make them look lush and full. I did notice 6 hours or so after I&#x27;ve done them my lashes begin to lose some of their oomph. Never noticed any flaking or anything. I will def be buying again.</li>
            <li> Its hard to apply. One false move and you have cat lady eyes with clumps! Hard to take off as well. It irritates your eyes as well. Wouldnt recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Its alright. The fibers are tiny black fibers that at times get into my eyes causing them to water. Not sure if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Honestly i dont realy like this product ... When you open the box it has this weird smell like chemical . And then the mascara and the fiber are not the best it clumps up realy nasty and they dont even look the best</li>
            <li> Does not work as expected!</li>
            <li> First time user of this 2 part lash product and I have been super happy with it. Very easy to use with very specific helpful tips. Now I don&#x27;t even think about it, just 5 minutes and I have full natural lashes, like I used to. Much more natural looking than false eyelashes. I&#x27;ve recommended this brand to my daughters and they like it too.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I&#x27;ve been dying to try this kind of product and I am now in love! Everyone noticed that I did something new. Great product. Great quality. Love it! Just follow the directions they give yout and you&#x27;ll love it yourself. Comes in a cute sunglass holder case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attempted to apply this many different ways and it just clumps and the fibers fall all on my face through out the day.</li>
            <li> Love it!! No clumping, No flaking, long wearing, washes off easily. Great product</li>
            <li> will not recommend.  had to return product.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  Made my eyelashes look longer &amp; fuller.</li>
            <li> Not  a very good quality of fiber mascara. I had a hard time getting the gel out of the container. Then once I was able to apply the fiber they would fall out in my eyes. Yikes it was annoying to say the least. I would not recommend. I&#x27;ve used other product from loreal and it gave me the same look with out falling into my eyes.</li>
            <li> The liquid, or transplanting gel is so dry. Brand new out of the packaging it was at the point where I would throw any other mascara away. So So So Bad. I was so excited to try this and it has been a horrible experience. Try a different brand!</li>
            <li> Irritated my eyes badly.</li>
            <li> little flakes all over my face after applied and all day long.</li>
            <li> Loved this item!!! I bought this mascara for my 14 yr. old daughter and she loves it!!  Its just like the original but cheaper!!</li>
            <li> I have unsuccessfully tried and failed to apply false lashes on my own, but have wound up gluing my eyes shut or pulling out the sparse lashes I already have, so when I heard about these fiber lashes I wanted to try them. I originally ordered a cheaper brand but the instructions were in Chinese and gel tube dried out, so I returned them and found these and I am so glad I did!. The arrived in a cute pink &amp;#34;eyeglass&amp;#34; case with clear to follow instructions and they really work, I wear it practically everyday when I have time in the morning to apply, but it worth the few extra minutes it takes to apply in comparison to regular mascara. I have gotten several complements and was asked it I was wearing fake lashes, so I would highly recommend these and it just takes a little practice to apply it correctly but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product it looked good. Easy to use and looking forward to using more often to make my eyes stand out.</li>
            <li> Constantly get compliments.</li>
            <li> First time trying fiber lashes and these worked great. I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this only if you have a normal/decent amount of lases to begin with.  I have VERY sparse lashes that were damaged by extensions, so this product didn&#x27;t work very well for me, as I have gaps in my real lashes that did not fill in.  I gave this to my daughter who says it works great for her.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing. I love it... it really works, i have really short eyelashes and i hate them! Lol. But this mascara makes them look like i have fake lashes on and make my eyes seem bigger which i love! Awesome product, i would recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried this one because it was less expensive. Although it was better than regular mascara, you get what you pay for, in this case. I&#x27;m going back to the Younique brand.</li>
            <li> It looks decent for the first couple of hours. The fiber falls off after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im the type of person that hates clumps.. And thats all you get with this.</li>
            <li> Too dry gets in my eye</li>
            <li> So far love this mascara better than others I have tried</li>
            <li> Good seller. Product great, as described. Good ship time. Product is great. really improves looks of lashes as longer, thicker.</li>
            <li> I like it but the fibers constantly shed under your eyes so you constantly need to check your makeup so you dont look like u had a makeup malfunction.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long lashes and finding a mascara I like has been hard.I&#x27;ve been searching for a mascara I like. I think I found it. Couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work, but it&#x27;s great. Does take a bit of practice, and some extra time, but the finished look is excellent. I wear contacts and work 12 hour shifts. The lashes did not irritate my eyes, or cause any other problems. Lashes did not flake off during wear. I&#x27;ve attached some pics with one layer of lash factory vixen 3d lashes.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for about 2 weeks. It deffinately makes a big difference in my eyelashes. They look so long and pretty. The only reason why I didnt give 5 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t seem like there is much product in  the tubes and for rhe price you&#x27;d want it to last a while, but I guess we&#x27;ll see how long it does last with me using it almost everday.</li>
            <li> I ordered this while we were living in Alabama taking care of a family member. Just after I&#x27;d ordered it, we moved back home unexpectedly. I contacted the shipper and they had one sent to my home ;-).  It took a lil bit to get to me but they were great!! And my lashes look sooo much longer when using this mascara! Love it!</li>
            <li> Put this on my wish list and just tried it out. My new favorite mascara and not too bad of a price! If everyone knew about this, other mascaras would be in jeopardy!</li>
            <li> Saw the difference but it wasn&#x27;t a WOW factor!  My gel brush was just as dry as the fiber brush. I think I will stick to applying false lashes.</li>
            <li> The fibers fall into my eyes.  I suggest attaching them starting from the back not the front of the lash.</li>
            <li> i must say this product is excellent!! And for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! I will be ordering more very soon for friends and family!</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Quick delivery and the product is beyond awesome! Thanks! !!</li>
            <li> It was my first 3d fiber mascara and I loooove it! It makes my lashes times bigger and nicer! I have tried a lot of different expendive stuff from sephora and other stores, and this mascara is the best so far! I&#x27;m very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my first 3D purchase ever. I don&#x27;t wear makeup during the week so I&#x27;ve used it very little since I got it. The few times that I have used it I can see the difference and like the look and duration. The one down side is the fibers that fall on my cheek bones but so minor compares to how long my lashes look.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it for it not being the real product. Just follow directions and it&#x27;ll look great!</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY WOULD BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> Really opens my eyes up and looks great.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite mascara! I&#x27;ve tried several and this is the best hands down! I get asked all the time if I&#x27;m wearing extensions ... nope ;) just this little miracle. No irritation like most other brands  (my eyes are sensitive too) &amp; and the easiest to use! Lifetime user!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it works just like it says. :)</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It makes my lashes look so long and thick, way better than drug store brands. It doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes look clumpy or spidery. The fibers and gel are easy to use and it comes off just as easily. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Had them for about a week and I&#x27;m in love. Works just like the Younique lashes. ðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li> Loved the this makes my eyes look. As long as you follow the directions you will love the outcome.</li>
            <li> It works really good my new favorite mascara even though I don&#x27;t use it every day</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really compare to other fiber mascara, but seems to work well.  Just hate that fiber flakes off, even after applying on the final coat of liquid gel/mascara.  I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> This mascara is no better than any other store bought mascara I have used.I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! This mascara is awesome. I have very short and thin lashes and this adds great length and volume. Easy to apply and I love the comb!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this for my daughter, her friends are always asking her what mascara she uses.</li>
            <li> I love Vixen Fiber Lash.  My daughter had me try hers and I was skeptical but I was wrong!  It really works!  And you only have to use one coat to get that great look.  I will be refilling my order when I am out.</li>
            <li> The containers have a strong, unpleasant metallic smell...other than that they are ok.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! Adds lots and lots of extra length to your lashes!! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a long lash affect and thats not what I got, the mascara came off easly and it was all over my eyes.  sorry I will no recomended this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I got my 3D fiber lash today and I tried it out and oh my God a miracle,because my lashes are very short,  when I used this product it gives me the look 300% lashes and all i can say is WOW, just follow the instructions and you will have lashes. I&#x27;m so excited and would recommend it to friends and family....this a.five star product.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used!</li>
            <li> this product for sure makes your lashes thicker and longer!  I have used it 3x now.  unfortunately the fibers seem to be getting into my eyes a few hours after applying (perhaps gel base starts to dry out) and irritating them, so I would only use it if I were going to dinner or something where it&#x27;s just for a few hours.  It does have a nice effect.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great for the cost. I used 2 applications on the one eye and mascara only on the other so you could see the difference. The take off process is as simple as using a make up remover cloth (which I do anyway). Makes a big difference without the worry of ruining your natural lashes.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are non existent from years of taking off false eyelashes. This product works ...I&#x27;ve spent 185+ to get eyelashes extensions ...this product gave the same results.</li>
            <li> Inside of brush was bent but works amazing</li>
            <li> Really only like the mascara not the fibers you have black fibers under your eyes all day .</li>
            <li> Saw co-worker&#x27;s Younique 3D Fiber Lashes. Went to Amazon to find some and discovered these at lower cost. rder arrived promptly in two days.  Tried and tested...and...IT WORKS:))</li>
            <li> Goes on so much easier than I expected,  and lasts all day too! Also the packaging is beautiful.</li>
            <li> This product is great but always apply regular mascara after applying this mascara.</li>
            <li> Works well.the gel tube could have more product in it but generally 3-4 coats does the trick and it&#x27;s fast applying</li>
            <li> Tends to go on a bit thick and goopy, not as clean as the Benefit mascara so I tend not to use it so much.</li>
            <li> I literally have next to no eyelashes. I couldn&#x27;t believe when I applied how I magically now had eyelashes!! The price was great, and very easy to use. I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> Make a dramatic difference in the appearance of my lashes! It will clump if you are careful, it takes some trial and error in learning how to avoid that spider leg look. I highly recommend as a &#x27;cheaper&#x27; alternative to other fiber lash mascaras.</li>
            <li> I heard about Younique moodstruck 3D fiber lashes from a friend and decided to do some research. I saw these, read some reviews and decided to try since they were not as costly. They came and I tried on one eye, love them! I will be accused of having extensions for sure. I used a primer first, not a mascara. I wish I could post a picture so you could see the results. I will post on Twitter @missmiss78.</li>
            <li> I LOVE MY FIBER LASHES!  These take a while to learn to apply correctly so that the fibers don&#x27;t fall in your eyes, but it is SO worth it!  My thin, short lashes look better than if I had applied false lashes using 3D Fiber Lash Mascara!  It is important to apply the transplanting gel and then IMMEDIATELY apply the fibers before the gel has any time to dryâ€¦at all!  Then, cover the fibers with a sealing coat of the transplanting gel so that they can&#x27;t fall off.  You can do as many layers as you want for as dramatic a look as you wantâ€¦just be sure the last coat seals in the fibers well.  Also, if they seem to get clumpy, use a high-quality eyelash comb (preferably the metal kind) to comb out the clumps.  I will never go back to plain mascara again.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time yesterday. I  have short thin eye lashes and oh boy does it work! I put on my regular mascara as directed, let it dry, applied the gel and then the fiber mascara when the gel was still wet.... let dry and then the gel and fiber mascara again, let dry.. I put on 2 applications and it was a huge difference.  The mascara does wash off with warm water. I did not need make up remover. The more gel/mascara you apply, the longer it will get.  I will buy again.  Who doesn&#x27;t want long eye lashes..Oh! by the way, I live in Hawaii and with the humidity and sweating I do, the mascara held up just fine.  I did not use the eye lash curler either, my lashes we long and shown enough.</li>
            <li> This product works great!! I recommend you give yourself extra time for all the steps....it doesnâ€™t work as great when you are rushing. I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a Fan of this mascara!I feel like I just Paid for the Pretty Case!The product inside wasnt the Best!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not overly impressed by this product. Two coats of Dior Show pretty much gives me the same volume &amp; length. It&#x27;s not worth the hassle of all of these steps. I&#x27;ll stick with my Dior!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It defiently magnifies my lashes.  Looks great and last all day. Would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Lashes are longer and fuller. I originally ordered this for just going out on weekends but loved it so much I wear it daily...just ordered my second kit...super easy to use.</li>
            <li> This was not any better than any other competitors regular mascara.  The directions are not in English; however, a diagram showing larger/longer one 1 and the smaller/shorter one 2.  When I didn&#x27;t get the results I expected, I reversed and that didn&#x27;t work either.  Not worth the money</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! My daughter and I heard about this product throygh a fb friend. I was a bit skeptical before actually trying it ,  So as soon as it arrived ( two days ) we were both in front of the mirror... All I can say is  Wow!! If used CORRECTLY the results are incredible! Soooo now I have to get my own. ;-)</li>
            <li> i have tried some other types of this product but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.. It&#x27;s a good buy!</li>
            <li> Love this product, I use to use fake lashes all the time now all I need it this mascara and I&#x27;m set. They make my lashes look super long and full.</li>
            <li> so having not such short lashes this mascara hasn&#x27;t done anything different from my regular mascara... and it takes forever to get the results you want usually it takes me 10 minutes to do my lashes with this its ore like 30 minutes. I wouldn&#x27;t say its complete waste, its good for people with no lashes but other than that not worth the 15$.</li>
            <li> I will never go another day without! And not as expensive as other brands.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I bought this and was disappointed. It seemed like it was more dried up and caked on my eyes causing flakes that irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is WELL worth the money - it makes my lashes SOO long and lasts forever. You&#x27;ll love it, and be so glad you spent the $. Worth every cent!</li>
            <li> i use this every day - you have to be quick or the glue will set . wait 5min then dust off all the excess.&lt;br /&gt;and then bam great lashes</li>
            <li> I had very thin eye lashes and this gave them a nice boost, definitely worth the money I spent!</li>
            <li> It takes a few coats to get a great result as with any other mascaras but with practice it adds the right length and it doesn&#x27;t clump up as much as other mascaras. I own 3 different brands and this is my favorite because it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t clump up. :)</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! For the money its just as good as the Younique! Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Does not do the job. makes mascars smudgy</li>
            <li> Love this! Lashes look great and not flaking</li>
            <li> I love it...makes my lashes longer and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and i tried it as well! Works just as good as the expensive one! Fibers did not get in her eyes or mine! Great Stuff for sure! Makes your eyes look Fantastic!! Would reccomend and buy again!!</li>
            <li> I use Younique fiber lashes and thought I would try out this product and compare. There is no comparison. Even brand new, the fibers don&#x27;t stick to the primer and just make a mess. I&#x27;m going back to Younique. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase this again.  I had purchased a cheaper brand and had better results with the cheaper brand than this Vixen.</li>
            <li> I did A LOT of research and testing. This by far is the best product for the best PRICE. I&#x27;m a happy camper. Just remember to use a Lash Brush(metal is best) when your done applying as to fan out lashes for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> I spent over $32 on the Younique 3D Fiber Lashes from a girl that I&#x27;d have to go to a salon to meet with her in order to avoid shipping. When I ran out, I wanted to look at other options and I came across this gem. With the cost of the product and shipping lower than Younique, I thought it was worth a gamble. I got it today and tried it out and absolutely love it! The Transplant gel formula is much creamier and the natural fibers are less flaky than the Younique brand. You have a customer for life for this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  Totally a fan!!!</li>
            <li> I love these! They work great!!!  My lashes look so full and natural and long and i love that they are just a one time application and you can where whenever.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really see a difference between this and the lloreal fiber lash. you can even add the butterfly mascara and looks great.</li>
            <li> Like my Lil sister said wow its magic. Love it</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  Works exactly the way it is suppose to!  The item arrived in a timely manner and the prie was great!  There was a similar product in a local store that was charging $45.00 for the same thing (different brand), this product was worth every penny and this is the one time that I am happy to say that you get what you paid for, great product, great rice!!</li>
            <li> Not as good as Yonique BUT for the price this product can&#x27;t be beat! I&#x27;ve bought this product 3 times and it lasts quite a while. I wear it everyday and can&#x27;t imagine my lashes without!</li>
            <li> I have used similar products that cost twice the price. Some reviewers have said this one is just as good as those, but I think it&#x27;s better! At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like this version from Lash Factory as well as some of the others (such as Younique) because the gel is not as thick. However, I think the end result is much more natural. Also, the gel brush is different, but again, I think this brand does a better job of lengthening the lashes and still looking natural. Plus, this gel doesn&#x27;t clump nearly as bad as the brands that have a thicker gel.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I tried other 3D mascara but Nothing like this one. Some of the fiber dose come off about hour or two after but what I do is carry a q tip n eye make up remover in my purse n just put the Q tip n the eye make up remover n get the extra fibers right off from under my eye n I have no more problems after.  Those probably r just the extra ones that did not stick on.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have very this lashes and this makes my eyes look wonderful!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product - I&#x27;ve already purchased two!</li>
            <li> Definately will buy again!  It quadruples the size of my lashes!  I do not use this every day just because it is kind of a process to apply it and I don&#x27;t need to have glam lashes every day haha.  If you want a dramatic and fuller set of lashes this is the product to use!  It washes right off and leaves no residue or damages your eyelashes.  The only negative that I have is, and if you follow the directions properly, you shouldn&#x27;t have this problem, when applying the fibers, be sure to just apply it to the top half of your lashes, other wise you will get it too close to your eye and will end up with fibers in there and they are rather annoying.  I accidentally did that the first time i used it and it bothered me all day, the next times I followed the instructions and only did the top half and no problems.  They seriously do look very full and natural.</li>
            <li> Great product! I was looking for something that would make my lashes look longer and natural and im glad I found Lash Factory. As you can see the difference on the picture left eye is without lash factory.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT and will buy again.</li>
            <li> For me, this product is just as good as the more expensive brands. I would order again!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Just tried 3D Fiber Lashes this morning and wow what it differences it makes vs just using regular mascara. I have seen the craze on Facebook but didn&#x27;t want to pay crazy money for the mascara. I am very pleased that I ordered from this company. I am hooked, I love it, I have big beautiful lashes, and I will order again from this company.</li>
            <li> this is wonderful! It works great, love it!</li>
            <li> I love the fiber idea as mascara but it falls off and builds up under your eye , not good,and I&#x27;m pretty good at this trust me. Maybe they should make it with smaller fibers if possible. But I still like it.  I just don&#x27;t use every time I put on my eye makeup</li>
            <li> Ordered them to try them out.  I had been reading about this kind of product all over the Internet.  My lashes are pretty long to begin.  This just made them thick.  Downfall? They are a pain to clean off at the end of the night.1</li>
            <li> I have short lashes. I&#x27;ve used so many other mascara that promise fuller longer looking lashes with no results. This works great! Not only do I get instant length, but my lashes don&#x27;t fall out when I&#x27;m taking it off. I am truly happy with this purchase &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Perfect literally the lash fibers stay on they won&#x27;t fall off until u wipe them out with even baby wipes. I bout several mascaras and I will keep buying more. I wear contacts lenses and still comfortable. I recomended these pair to my friends and family now to you Girls who r looking for thicker lashes.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference.  I tried it a few times and still nnot happy with it.</li>
            <li> Came in way before delivery date ... and i love it! Really recommend it!</li>
            <li> the shipment was very fast, the product it self was ok.  It did gave the extra length to my lashes however its a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> This definitely boosts your lashes, but the fibers flake quite a bit so I have to check in the mirror throughout the day and brush them off under my eyes.  OK for the price, but I think I&#x27;d stick with the Younique next time I think.</li>
            <li> Love the product at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my lashes longer and they look great. Great product and price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> My sister had recently purchased a more expensive brand of the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara, and I purchased this for half the price and it works JUST as well, if not better. Hers ran out in 2 weeks, I am on my 3rd week and its still great. GREAT PRODUCT, worth the purchase! Love the case it comes in also.</li>
            <li> Not worth retail price. The gel is gloopy and does not seperate the lashes.</li>
            <li> Package came dried out. Horrible.</li>
            <li> Case is a little cheap otherwise ok.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive eyes do not try this product. I followed the instructions read other Consumers comments and did not have success. If you get those little fibers in your eyes forget it all is lost. I really wanted to like it but overall I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price no different then other mascaras and it take way more time. Normally I do not return items I just take it as lesson learned but because my eyes were so irritated and red I decided to return them. Thank-you Amazon for allowing me to return makeup.</li>
            <li> not sure of quality of brush</li>
            <li> Very weird to use at first, takes some adjusting to get used to. It&#x27;s not like using regular mascara and the fibers look like fuzz, but it does the job. I still use my regular mascara for everyday use and I whip this out for a special occasion because I&#x27;ll already have time set aside to use the 3d lashes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! It&#x27;s works great &amp; makes my lashes longer/thicker.  I will be buying more:)</li>
            <li> I have heard many horror stories from all of these knock off&#x27;s of younique&#x27;s original 3D mascara.  I would recommend just sticking with the original and best and get the guarantee. I&#x27;ve been using it for months without any issues.  My rep is at youniqueproducts.com/fastlash if you are interested in finding one.</li>
            <li> fibers flake really bad.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this! Was looking a name brand and came across lash factory..very pleased</li>
            <li> The fibers lashes are great but the hole in the top of the mascara type product is a little big. Leaving extra product on the wand and making it hard to not leave clumps.</li>
            <li> The fibers come off and go all over my face. It works and looks good until they all fall off.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t care for these.&lt;br /&gt;it really dried out my lashes and it was flaky and I will not order this again.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a replacement to the one I typically buy for $37 dollars and unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work as well, However, this mascara system is better than the ones you&#x27;d find for a similar price point and is a lot less difficult to remove than my $37 dollar one (which is a pain to remove at night). I would recommend this item to first time users as it is easy to apply and works as a dramatic mascara. If you are used to &amp;#34;too faced ; better than false lashes&amp;#34; it isn&#x27;t quite the same formula. I may just have to figure out a new technique, but thus far I&#x27;ve used it 3 or four times and I&#x27;m still getting used to it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this twice. I use it all the time. I wear contacts and it doesn&#x27;t bother them. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Like some of the others,  I have used the false eyelashes which had taken most of my eyelashes away.  After reading the reviews I took a chance a ordered these. As soon as they arrived I tried it. Would totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing !!! I have long lashes but this along with my mascara works wonder. I will order again !!!</li>
            <li> Thesr don&#x27;t lengthen at all and flake into my eyes so bad that by the end of the day they are blood shot. I wanted to save money instead of getting Younique but now I&#x27;ve wasted $23 on this and still need to buy Younique which is a great product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this product because my eyes burn terribly with it. I need to contact the product company, I just haven&#x27;t had the tome</li>
            <li> Best 3D fiber mascara ever!!</li>
            <li> Good just itchy if gets in eyes</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! I&#x27;m so happy that this worked!!! Fiber lashes are definitely the way to go. Make sure you separate your lashes pretty well before applying and BAM you will have awesome eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It works so well. Seriously major difference in length! Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> Lots of flaking but a full look</li>
            <li> Works just as well as more expensive alternatives. A great product that I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing again!!</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is it falls on your face if not applied correctly !</li>
            <li> works just like it says, but take your time applying... nice product!</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews for this product I decided to give it a try,  and am so glad that I did! It work great and my eyelashes look fuller and longer. I highly recommend Lash Factory !</li>
            <li> I like it it!! I&#x27;ve never tried the younique brand so I was just trying this one (cuz it&#x27;s cheaper) before investing. However, I&#x27;m really impressed with this one! I got really good results from this one. I will definitely consider ordering again. I&#x27;ll just wait to see how the fibers act with my contacts. I experienced some of the fibers falling off the first time but I didn&#x27;t add the gel after the application of the fibers which is an important final step. In the pic: left eye is the lash factory mascara and the right eye is regular mascara with no fibers.</li>
            <li> I tried other products that had better applicators. The worst part was that I had older product from a different manufacturer that had more product left in the tube, than this one had when I received it.</li>
            <li> They look great, but the fibers flake off pretty easily.  A little annoying for contact lens wearers.</li>
            <li> Like the gel. Doesn&#x27;t seem that fibers are really coming off that much...</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great price. Took me about 3 applications before I got the hang of it. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I fully understand that sometimes products are defective, and so I reached out to them, to find they dont really want to do anything for you.  4 days of foolish emails back and forth, wanting me to take pictures of the product, then I ship it back, and I HAD TO PAY FOR THE SHIPPING.  I should have kept the defective product, it would have saved me money. If this product works, great for you, but beware they are NOT good to deal with when it comes to returning the item.  It came from China and I shipped it back to a personal apartment in California...  NOT GOOD.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It makes my lashes look so long and full.  Sure, it takes a little more times than just using mascara alone, but it is totally worth it.  Be advised, you still need your regular mascara.  You put on a coat of your own, then you use the gel and fiber combo to build your own lashes.  You can do a little or go really bold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other similar products that cost over twice as much.  This stuff does just as well.  A great bargain!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I was impressed and I&#x27;m very picky.</li>
            <li> This mascara was okay.  It did give me slightly more volume and length.  I would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> Very easy and not messy. Very impressed. Reasonable price. Will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> My package came in great time!! just follow the instructions and you will have that great &amp;#34;false&amp;#34; lash look. Goes on fast and washes off easily with water and your regular face wash! One thing is the eyelash brush is needed to de-clump them! Other than that I am satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3d fiber mascara by Lash Factory because my eye lashes are light and short and I can&#x27;t apply falsies to save my life. I am more than pleased with my purchase. It has lasted me months and the fibers look so natural and really stay in place.  My eye lashes are now long and gorgeous.  I also have extremely sensitive eyes and I have not had any problems with irritation (just apply the mascara and fibers to the middle/ end of your lashes).  I will definitely order again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I read the ONE review that was posted on this product and decided to go with it, although I was skeptical! I was pleasantly surprised that IT WORKS! Just follow the directions! I saw the reviews on the other brand that can cost way more! Glad I chose this product instead. It comes in black, no flaking no clumps!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very good mascara (and fibers too). But used it up within a month, so be prepared to order it often. LOVE how it makes my lashes look sooooo much longer :)</li>
            <li> Love it ! It works awesome the length is remarkable</li>
            <li> It flakes very bad. I would send it back if I could.</li>
            <li> It did extend your lashes, but the fibers flake off.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the more expensive options out there. Save your money and buy this.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t recall ever reviewing a product on Amazon before but 3D Fiber Lashes are so great that I felt I had to do one!  I am not blessed with long luxurious lashes and I am blonde, so what pitiful lashes I have are difficult to see even with mascara.  This product really does give me fuller and longer looking lashes and is so easy to use.  I am also always concerned about removing mascara becuase I don&#x27;t want to scrub at my eyes thus pulling out eyelashes.  The fiber lashes come off very easily with a good makeup remover and a cotton pad.  No scrubbing at all!  Bonus girly girl treat is the case and packaging are very sparkly and feminine which I love.  This brand is considerably less than similar products and I can&#x27;t imagine that the more expensive brands work better.  I will buy this product again and again.</li>
            <li> My regular mascara does way better and its way cheaper as well</li>
            <li> Great for a fuller eyelash look</li>
            <li> works phenomenally! A few friends of mine have the more expensive ones, but to be honest this works just as well. The only thing that I will advise is to put on an extra coat of your base mascara after applying the lashes to seal in the fibers and prevent fallout.</li>
            <li> I used this product and I did not like it at all. The fibers kept falling off and irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> I used the product twice since receiving. I do like the look of my lashes. I had a problem the second time as I must of not removed all the fibers throughly and some got into my eye and my became very irritated other than that it worked very well</li>
            <li> I really think this is a wonderful product, I even ordered one for my daughter.  The price is good, and the lashes really look great, especially when you follow the tips, if you don&#x27;t then they look clumpy. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and washes off easily with warm water. Works just as good if not better than the more expensive brands. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not tried the expensive one, but these work very well for thin lashes.</li>
            <li> Worst mascara ever!&lt;br /&gt;The little brush has so much loose hairs they got in my eye every time!</li>
            <li> Surprise my wife the 3d fiber lashes. She used it and was not happy. The fiber was going into her eyes and felt uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My lashes look amazing! I would definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;m in the beauty industry and see a lot of products like this one! It works just as well as the $30 fiber lash! Only downfall is you have to be careful when applying the fibers. They tend to fall into eyes!</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give it a try, since the Younique is so expensive. I generally never have too many issues with &amp;#34;generics&amp;#34;, but this isn&#x27;t worth the time or money. The &amp;#34;transplanting&amp;#34; gel doesn&#x27;t seem to attract the fibers at all, and after one coat, the bristles don&#x27;t seem to want to add any more to your lashes. Stick with Younique if you MUST have one; I get the same results just from using 3 different drug store brand mascaras together</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Terrible odor.  I do not notice ANY plus from the fibers.  I&#x27;ll stick with Dior.</li>
            <li> When i got this tha applicator  only had mascara  the 2nd applicator did not have any gel in it  it was empty so i advise  everyone this is a scam an im mad aboyt it i will never ever buy this again i eish yall can reimburse  me my damn money</li>
            <li> like it I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Great product and love it. My lashes have never looked so good.</li>
            <li> Great mascara, been using younique and honestly, this mascara is much better, price is great. I will use this from now on. Love love it, and ladies if you use it correctly, there is no issues. I never have fibers falling in my eyes. I use my own mascara first, light coat, then gel, fiber, gel. My lashes are blonde, short, and sparse, I look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes, great results!</li>
            <li> I love the 3D fiber lashes. Definitely worth the money. Ive been getting so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Burns your eyes and is poor quality.  I emailed them and told them and they said , well you have to return it.  Waste of time, and ouch!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift, to me this works a lot better than the $30 Younique 3D one</li>
            <li> I could not wait to try this product. Absolutely love it!!!! Simply amazing is what it is! Very simple to apply and he results are seen instantly. Totally satisfied!!!</li>
