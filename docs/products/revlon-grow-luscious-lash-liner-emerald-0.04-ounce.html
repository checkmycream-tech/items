            <li>What more do you want in an eyeliner?</li>

            <li>Excellent product and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>I will probably just order it online from now on because it&#x27;s so much easier and cost effective!</li>
            <li>Smooth and easy!</li>
            <li>and I received it very quickly with free shipping!</li>
            <li>My favorite eyeliner, glides on smoothly and makes me feel better about putting something on</li>
            <li>and Amazon has it fairly cheap..</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t even need to wear mascara, since it gives to my eyes that full lashes illusion.  </li>
            <li>Goes on great with dark even line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this eye liner long before it became discontinued by Revlon.</li>
            <li>I really like how this goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product because it&#x27;s easy to use and glides on effortlessly with just the right amount of coverage and color.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this liner, it&#x27;s soft enough to glide on real easy but not too soft</li>
            <li>and after I got the black chunk like spectacles out of my eye it would look good, but I am not going to risk getting an infection or something from it.</li>
            <li>This is never in stock at my local store, so i&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s on here.</li>
            <li>this one lasts the whole darn day (even through my kickboxing classes where I sweat like no ones business!).</li>
            <li>My lashes seemed fuller, longer and didn&#x27;t fall out as much!</li>
            <li>I love this product so much I would totally do a commercial if I was asked to!</li>
            <li>Very creamy texture.</li>
            <li>I really like this eyeliner but can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li>The color is a dream one line is all you need and it really stays put.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, the color is nice and dark and it STAYS all day long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super dark and glides on smoothly, then stays all day.  </li>
            <li>This eye liner applies well; it is soft and velvety smooth, and has a very nice dark, black color.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Normally I would of gave it to my sister since she isn&#x27;t as picky about makeup as I am, but</li>
            <li>I think this must be very old, it smells kinda like lead</li>
            <li>Long lasting and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Some pencil lash liners can be too soft and end up smudging all over, while others practically scratch during application.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes .</li>
            <li>Soft enough to easily apply but doesn&#x27;t smudge throughout the day so that I end up with dark circles under my eye!</li>
            <li>This eyeliner goes on the eyelid very easily and smoothly, even in cold dry temperatures.</li>
            <li>I actually fell asleep with it on, once ( bad I know lol )</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s dark, very dark, easy to apply, and it stays on forever.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s my new go to everyday liner.</li>
            <li> one and only con is that if you lose the lid, the eyeliner will dry out and become unusable.</li>
            <li> It is the darkest black and the smoothest pencil I could find so far, when I wear it</li>
            <li> Deep luscious black.</li>
            <li> It is soft, gentle and very dramatic.</li>

            <li> That may sound crazy, but then the black isn&#x27;t so stark.</li>
            <li> The onyx color is really black.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding it though, it seems the company discountinued it (at least in my area) which is such a shame...</li>
            <li> Stays on all day with little smudging.  </li>
            <li> Arrived in even less time than it said!</li>
            <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find this product in the store I usually buy it from, I knew I had to order it online!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Goes on great with dark even line. Very creamy texture. Long lasting and easy to use. Would highly recommend. Need separate sharpener.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyeliner and was so depressed when Revlon stopped making it. I am so glad I found it on here!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product because it&#x27;s easy to use and glides on effortlessly with just the right amount of coverage and color.

            <li> I have been using this liner since it came out....stays on all day...wonderful....very hard to find in stores...always sold out thanks to amazon its a touch away....</li>
            <li> This is the best eye liner in the world!!, i just bought another 4 pack.  it&#x27;s dark, very dark, easy to apply, and it stays on forever.</li>
            <li> Some of the best affordable eyeliner I&#x27;ve used.  Stays on all day with little smudging.  Great for allergy season.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes . This eyeliner goes on the eyelid very easily and smoothly, even in cold dry temperatures.</li>
            <li> This does the trick. Its thick and stays put! What can I say I love this eye liner! And a great price at that! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner a few months ago and only used it a few times because every single time I would go to use it, little black chunks would fall off into my eye. The color was great and after I got the black chunk like spectacles out of my eye it would look good, but I am not going to risk getting an infection or something from it. Normally I would of gave it to my sister since she isn&#x27;t as picky about makeup as I am, but this eyeliner I wouldn&#x27;t even give to her, instead I donated it to the trash can. It may have been just the one I bought, but I am not going to give it another chance to see if it was.</li>
            <li> its okay but I have an olive skin tone it would have helped if it were darker</li>
            <li> Love it!  Happy to find the original! Use this on my waterline better than any others and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Why did this get discontinued.  It&#x27;s super dark and glides on smoothly, then stays all day.  What more do you want in an eyeliner?</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner but can&#x27;t find it in stores. I think this must be very old, it smells kinda like lead and I have to push harder to put it on. I still like it though</li>
            <li> I liked the way another reviewer put it when they said that this eyeliner glides on effortlessly. It&#x27;s smooth, the color is nice and dark and it STAYS all day long. I have oily skin so I have always struggled with eyeliner that I take time to put on in the morning and it has wiped off by lunchtime. Not this liner- this one lasts the whole darn day (even through my kickboxing classes where I sweat like no ones business!). I absolutely LOVE this eyeliner!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one and only con is that if you lose the lid, the eyeliner will dry out and become unusable. I made that mistake only once- never again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Why did I not find this sooner?  I absolutely love this! It&#x27;s my new go to everyday liner. It stays on. It is soft, gentle and very dramatic. Highly recommend and that&#x27;s why it has five stars. No faults at all. Just don&#x27;t apply an oily cream before you apply your liner. Deep luscious black. Love.</li>
            <li> I really like how this goes on so smoothly. The onyx color is really black. I actually like to put it on the night before and wash it off some to give me a softer look. That may sound crazy, but then the black isn&#x27;t so stark. It&#x27;s softer that way.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this liner, it&#x27;s soft enough to glide on real easy but not too soft you smear it everywhere. The color is a dream one line is all you need and it really stays put. I actually fell asleep with it on, once ( bad I know lol ) and it was still in place the next morning, no smears, no crumbles. Does not feel cakey, either, unlike some that are like crayon, you can&#x27;t even feel that it&#x27;s there. My very favorite !</li>
            <li> This eye liner applies well; it is soft and velvety smooth, and has a very nice dark, black color. I cannot speak of its growth abilities just yet, but as far as application goes, it is perfect. I will definitely purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li> My Favorite eye liner. It stays on all day, even with tears :) This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found, doesn&#x27;t smudge or clump.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner...can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore! Great Product...Love It, my favorite! Arrived in even less time than it said!</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner, glides on smoothly and makes me feel better about putting something on that&#x27;s actually good for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Love this liner! Smooth and easy!</li>
            <li> I loved this product from the first time I used it! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now. It goes on so smooth, making it easier to get a nice clean line! And it sharpens perfectly! I noticed an improvement in the condition of my lashes after using it for about 2 weeks! My lashes seemed fuller, longer and didn&#x27;t fall out as much! I&#x27;m 52, so I need all the help I can get with the fullness and length of my lashes! When I couldn&#x27;t find this product in the store I usually buy it from, I knew I had to order it online! It was a great price and I received it very quickly with free shipping! I will probably just order it online from now on because it&#x27;s so much easier and cost effective!</li>
            <li> Because this is my favorite eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;It works so well and stays on for a length of time.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely get this item</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this eye liner long before it became discontinued by Revlon. Now i have to come to amazon to order it. Great Liner.. and Amazon has it fairly cheap.. i bought 2 this time for under 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  It is the darkest black and the smoothest pencil I could find so far, when I wear it, I don&#x27;t even need to wear mascara, since it gives to my eyes that full lashes illusion.  I have trouble finding it though, it seems the company discountinued it (at least in my area) which is such a shame...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and it is just easier and cheaper ordering it online.&lt;br /&gt;great liner no smudge even if my eyes water</li>
            <li> I love this product so much I would totally do a commercial if I was asked to! I am a Revlon girl for life and Onyx eyeliner is my color. Thank you Amazon for carrying this product! I don&#x27;t know why stores took it off the shelf, this is a great eyeliner &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li> Soft enough to easily apply but doesn&#x27;t smudge throughout the day so that I end up with dark circles under my eye! I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and I do feel like my lashes (which, with age, seem to have thinned out) are thicker and fuller.</li>
