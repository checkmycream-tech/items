    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>It sent our cats&#x27; fleas on the run off of our bedding and clothing in a flash - plus it smells great!!</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>I especially enjoyed that fact that the Pennyroyal came in an easy-to-use bottle.</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Diluted pennyroyal solution is great for fire ant mounds as well as spiders.</li>
            <li>Though the product was good quality and all, I do recommend that they somehow seal the bottle.</li>
            <li>Now has the BEST essential oils at a great price!</li>
            <li>I have never used Pennyroyal in my Aromatherapy business, but I am doing so for now on, I love it and service was great</li>
            <li>We LOVE pennyroyal oil for getting rid of spiders!</li>
            <li>This is an incredably effective repellant for mosquitoes, flies and bees.  </li>
            <li>She is thrilled.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful fresh mint scent with rich undertones.</li>
            <li>It is helping but need to stay on top of the task.</li>
            <li>My neighbors all have dogs, and I love them, but don&#x27;t want fleas.  </li>
            <li>I could not find one site that said how to use it safely even for keeping fleas away.  </li>
            <li>The bottle says it is safe for aromatherapy.  </li>
            <li>Her cat had flees, but after using this oil, the cat is doing so much better.</li>
            <li>Spiders LOVE to enter our home uninvited.</li>
            <li>It will irritate your skin for 2 or more days.</li>
            <li>has a wonderful scent and does not bother my allergies like other so called air fresheners.</li>
            <li>A couple of drops on my shoes and maybe the cuff of my pants make working in the yard flea free.</li>
            <li>I needed this for a special Iranian Recipe our dinner club assigned me.  </li>
            <li>This is so easy to use and very efficient.</li>
            <li>Product works fine, thanks for your Business.</li>
            <li>Bought it from the foods section, right on the bottle</li>
            <li>Would do business again, nice vial of pennyroyal came quickly and just as expected.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what they stated and pictured.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s exactly what it says it is, which is why I gave it 4 instead of 3 stars.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is to make sure to label the bottle as TOXIC and keep out of reach of animals and children, as ingesting this stuff can be lethal.</li>
            <li>I like this size as it&#x27;s bigger than most but not too much.</li>
            <li>It is strong and takes just a little in my tea light oil warmer to fill the room.</li>
            <li>The Post Office gave me a note attached to it stating that something had leaked and they could really smell it.</li>
            <li>It is very pungent.</li>
            <li>received this rapidly and on time, price was reasonable, I recommend this supplier.</li>
            <li>I got this for a friend that really wanted it.</li>
            <li>The mint and pine mix smell just like the forest and are very uplifting.</li>
            <li>how very toxic this oil is.  </li>
            <li>Really???</li>
            <li>It really, really works.</li>
            <li>it WILL eat the top skin layers until it reaches bone so be careful!</li>
            <li>Now Foods oils are high quality reasonably priced true essential oils.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not blaming this particular oil alone, Just that the combination of oils didn&#x27;t work to kill fleas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oli can be toxic in high doses, thus the warning (see 1 star evaluation)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used the oil, but have extensive experience using the fresh herb while hiking, camping or outdoors.  </li>
            <li>I like to mix a few drops of pennyroyal with balsam fir needle, another favorite from Now Foods.</li>
            <li>It will not kill spiders--but they do not like the smell of the oil and steer clear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an old wives tale.</li>
            <li>It was a suggestion from a friend to use Pennyroyal as a &#x27;natural&#x27; treatment.  </li>
            <li>We live in a rural area and our back patio is surrounded by beds of rocks.</li>

            <li> We live in a rural area and our back patio is surrounded by beds of rocks.</li>
            <li> Pennyroyal is a great flea repellent.</li>
            <li> I bought this Oil and several other oils to mix together to apply to my cat for killing fleas.</li>
            <li> It arrived loose and had leaked.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly in small children, as you would other repellants, as they may be sensitive to toxic effects.  </li>
            <li> this is hard to find ,but amazon has it.use it for natural flea control and air freshener.</li>
            <li> I am careful to wash it off my hands before I touch my cat however since it is quite toxic to felines.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get the oil on your skin when applying it to bug entry points around the home.  </li>
            <li> Watch out, a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> and now I wonder if the toxicity is what made me sick, when I thought it was just the strong odor.  </li>
            <li> Works as flea repellent (use sparingly) and otherwise a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I lost half of the bottle to the leak.  </li>
            <li> It saved no one during the Black Death, and it will save no one now.</li>
            <li> I use it in a few drop in a spray on the dog pillows and around the house.</li>
            <li> It is deadly in minute amounts.</li>
            <li> USE The Pennyroyal Herbal Tea made from the dried plant instead.  </li>
            <li> This is so much better than using those nasty chemical sprays.  </li>
            <li> This oil is difficult to find because it can be used to abort babies, not recommended and NOT safe for the mother as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t know if it was broken or not.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the fleas were resistant to it.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I am deathly afraid of spiders.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil &amp; have not seen another one of those ugly creatures again.</li>
            <li> But man, no wonder bugs hate this stuff.</li>
            <li> I HATE the smell and feel of DEET oil, and was esctatic to find an alternative product, that I feel works</li>
            <li> I use this to mix with castor oil and pine tar to make a bug repellent.</li>

            <li> I needed this for a special Iranian Recipe our dinner club assigned me.  Bought it from the foods section, right on the bottle it says not to be ingested or swallowed.  CAUTION  DO NOT USE FOR FOOD! ! !</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It sent our cats&#x27; fleas on the run off of our bedding and clothing in a flash - plus it smells great!! We&#x27;ll be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> Used this in a recipe to develop some ant killer, that would be safer to use than raid on my countertops!</li>
            <li> Though the product was good quality and all, I do recommend that they somehow seal the bottle. It arrived loose and had leaked. The Post Office gave me a note attached to it stating that something had leaked and they could really smell it. Pennyroyal is NOT an oil that you want to leak. It is very pungent. They didn&#x27;t know if it was broken or not. I lost half of the bottle to the leak.  Thank you.  Claire McDowell</li>
            <li> Whenever I run into &amp;#34;growths&amp;#34; that can resist Tea Tree Oil, I try Pennyroyal next.  Pennyroyal is literally the ACID of oils.  BE CAREFUL not to use this on sensitive skin and only use it once, give it a day to react, and then check the area again before using Pennyroyal twice in the same area ... it WILL eat the top skin layers until it reaches bone so be careful! This oil is difficult to find because it can be used to abort babies, not recommended and NOT safe for the mother as well.&lt;br /&gt;I received this rapidly and on time, price was reasonable, I recommend this supplier.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and very efficient. A couple of drops on my shoes and maybe the cuff of my pants make working in the yard flea free.</li>
            <li> Pennyroyal is a great flea repellent. I use it in a few drop in a spray on the dog pillows and around the house.</li>
            <li> Was trying to make a non toxic spray to get rid of spiders.It is helping but need to stay on top of the task.</li>
            <li> Perfect. I have never used Pennyroyal in my Aromatherapy business, but I am doing so for now on, I love it and service was great</li>
            <li> put a drop of this on a dogs collar to keep fleas away.  just a drop</li>
            <li> Purchased to use on our dogs for ticks. Came on time looked just like picture. Was exactly what they stated and pictured.</li>
            <li> Only a three-star rating because it did not work for my intended purpose of flea and dust mite control.</li>
            <li> if you think this will discourage fleas, think again. It&#x27;s an old wives tale. It saved no one during the Black Death, and it will save no one now.</li>
            <li> great product. will work with again!</li>
            <li> this is hard to find ,but amazon has it.use it for natural flea control and air freshener. has a wonderful scent and does not bother my allergies like other so called air fresheners.</li>
            <li> Product works fine, thanks for your Business.</li>
            <li> I bought this Oil and several other oils to mix together to apply to my cat for killing fleas. The mixture did not work but I&#x27;m not blaming this particular oil alone, Just that the combination of oils didn&#x27;t work to kill fleas.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend that really wanted it. I as shire she loves it. But I have not herd from her</li>
            <li> I bought this to deter fleas.  It was a suggestion from a friend to use Pennyroyal as a &#x27;natural&#x27; treatment.  Unfortunately, the fleas were resistant to it.  I still put it out around the house to deter in hopes that it will work over time.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I needed. I especially enjoyed that fact that the Pennyroyal came in an easy-to-use bottle. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Would do business again, nice vial of pennyroyal came quickly and just as expected. I like this size as it&#x27;s bigger than most but not too much.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Works as flea repellent (use sparingly) and otherwise a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s exactly what it says it is, which is why I gave it 4 instead of 3 stars. But man, no wonder bugs hate this stuff. It smells like nature&#x27;s DEET. Watch out, a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I use this to mix with castor oil and pine tar to make a bug repellent. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the oil, but have extensive experience using the fresh herb while hiking, camping or outdoors.  This is an incredably effective repellant for mosquitoes, flies and bees.  I HATE the smell and feel of DEET oil, and was esctatic to find an alternative product, that I feel works better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oli can be toxic in high doses, thus the warning (see 1 star evaluation) so of course the distributor will state not for food use.  Use sparingly in small children, as you would other repellants, as they may be sensitive to toxic effects.  Note citronella oil contains the same warnings.</li>
            <li> Now Foods oils are high quality reasonably priced true essential oils. Pennyroyal is one of my favorites. It has a wonderful fresh mint scent with rich undertones. It is strong and takes just a little in my tea light oil warmer to fill the room. I am careful to wash it off my hands before I touch my cat however since it is quite toxic to felines. I like to mix a few drops of pennyroyal with balsam fir needle, another favorite from Now Foods. The mint and pine mix smell just like the forest and are very uplifting.</li>
            <li> After I received my bottle of Pennyroyal, I checked the internet to see how to use it to keep fleas out of my back yard.  My neighbors all have dogs, and I love them, but don&#x27;t want fleas.  I had no idea how very toxic this oil is.  One website said the essential oil should never be used for anything, at all.  I could not find one site that said how to use it safely even for keeping fleas away.  I have used this before and now I wonder if the toxicity is what made me sick, when I thought it was just the strong odor.  (I can&#x27;t blame the oil, it may have been a coincidence.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also could not find any recipe for diluting this oil.  The bottle says it is safe for aromatherapy.  Really???</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mother. Her cat had flees, but after using this oil, the cat is doing so much better. She is thrilled.</li>
            <li> We LOVE pennyroyal oil for getting rid of spiders! We live in a rural area and our back patio is surrounded by beds of rocks. Spiders LOVE to enter our home uninvited. We dilute the oil with water in a spray bottle and spray around doorways and windows. It will not kill spiders--but they do not like the smell of the oil and steer clear. It really, really works. My only suggestion is to make sure to label the bottle as TOXIC and keep out of reach of animals and children, as ingesting this stuff can be lethal.</li>
            <li> Diluted pennyroyal solution is great for fire ant mounds as well as spiders.</li>
            <li> To any ladies or ladies looking at this product as an abortificant: DO NOT USE To Terminate Pregnancy!!! It is deadly in minute amounts. USE The Pennyroyal Herbal Tea made from the dried plant instead.  That being said, I am deathly afraid of spiders. I bought this oil &amp; have not seen another one of those ugly creatures again. YES!!!! This is so much better than using those nasty chemical sprays.  Just be careful not to get the oil on your skin when applying it to bug entry points around the home.  It will irritate your skin for 2 or more days. That&#x27;s my experience.</li>
            <li> Now has the BEST essential oils at a great price!</li>
