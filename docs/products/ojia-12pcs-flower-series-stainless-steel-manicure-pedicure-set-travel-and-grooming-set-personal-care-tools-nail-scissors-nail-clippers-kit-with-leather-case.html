            <li>The most upsetting thing about this purchase was the fact that I didn&#x27;t get it when I was supposed to for my Mom&#x27;s birthday!</li>
            <li>Really nice.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is one of the cheapest manicure kits I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li>Nice quality instruments.</li>

            <li>This is a nice set.</li>

            <li>nice online,</li>

            <li>so I am sure she will be thrilled.</li>

            <li>This kit has everything that I need and it also comes with a cute cover.</li>
            <li>I would have given this product all five stars if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that the most used product in the set is the one that is of the lowest quality.</li>
            <li>case is quite TTRACTIVE AND MUCH MORE IN THIS COMBINATION THAN YOU CAN FIND IN A RETAIL STORE</li>
            <li>, it is compact it would fit nice in your pocket book.</li>
            <li>But in all I am pleased with what I got for the price.  </li>
            <li>Better than I thought.</li>
            <li>ruff looking ,cuts Ok</li>
            <li>Seems well made and has many tools for most uses.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a better solution.</li>
            <li>well worth it, my girlfriend loved it for her nails.</li>
            <li>It is a cute case…</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s not terrible.  </li>
            <li>Love this set.</li>
            <li>I love this set.  </li>
            <li>I have are much better.</li>
            <li>She likes them and should get many years of use from them.</li>
            <li>Beautiful... all tools appear to be professional grade.</li>
            <li>Nicely wrapped looks great love the style, my own little set.</li>
            <li>came fast and look good</li>
            <li>Outside of case is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Super cute case it comes in.</li>
            <li>It is super cute</li>
            <li>I really just wanted the cuticle trimmers, but the rest of it is really nice too.</li>
            <li>The set looks cheap.</li>
            <li>and it is important for efficiency of use.</li>
            <li>Some stuff looks a bit cheap</li>
            <li>I think this set is great, and it helps with my manicures immensely.  </li>
            <li>This product is SO CHEAP.  </li>
            <li>Everything inside feels cheap too.</li>
            <li>Some of the tools, one could tell, was rather cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>This set was equipped with several really great tools.  </li>
            <li>I really like the case it is of nice quality..</li>
            <li>love the pretty case, the quality of the items, and the variety of items.</li>
            <li>buying a high end product like this in stainless steel you know you can clean it and it will withstand a good cleaning as to prevent the spread of germs.  </li>
            <li>good quality, giving as gift to teen</li>
            <li>Was honestly not too terribly impressed by this set.  </li>
            <li>Love it and case is very organzized</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find better, but not sure you will find better for the price.</li>
            <li>worth the price though.</li>
            <li>I love the antique styled soft leather case.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>so this was right up her alley.</li>
            <li>Nice little kit very nicely made, heavy not flimsy and cheap</li>
            <li>Love this cute little kit!</li>
            <li>The designated straps are too big for most of the tools.</li>
            <li>There are lots of instruments in the set, however, I didn&#x27;t know what most of them were for; a simple set of instructions would be helpful.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s already used it several times for nail care and can&#x27;t wait to use it more.</li>
            <li>waste of good money</li>
            <li>made cheap  less tools  better quality</li>
            <li>All the other tools are really nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>The stainless steel is of good quality, not cheap.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it had come with a description of what certain items were for and how to use them.</li>
            <li>I also recommend this seller very highly.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my little sister and I had to buy one for myself after seeing how nice it is in person.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very large and it holds the correct amount of items, and the design on the outside is very pretty</li>
            <li>but I was expecting something much nicer.</li>
            <li>built better than expected</li>
            <li>So much stuff</li>
            <li>I really it</li>
            <li>The nail clippers don&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>I gave this as a gift to my daughter and she was very pleased.sk</li>
            <li>tools are all decent and work well</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t particularly care for the oriental writing on the tools, but it&#x27;s imported.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend either for yourself or as a gift.</li>
            <li>The package is well organized and the tools are high quality&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some of the tools are great but others are cheap and worthless.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very lovely, small enough to throw into your handbook and equipped with every tool you could need.</li>
            <li>Overall, I like it and it was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I was able to print a list from the description page, but I still not sure what a pealing knife is for or why I would use a metal ear pick?</li>
            <li>It comes with more tools that any other set I&#x27;ve seen and is compact enough to carry on trips..</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars but the little loops that hold the tools and clippers in place tear easy and</li>
            <li>My only complaint with it (and the reason not 5 stars) is that the holder pulls seem to stretch easy and don&#x27;t retract at all, meaning the first time you use it they won&#x27;t hold well after that, dealer breaker for some, but so far it ain&#x27;t much of a problem.</li>
            <li>Clippers, scissors are heavy duty and work fine.  </li>
            <li>However, the large toenail clippers broke after only one use.  </li>
            <li>the tools are old and dont work.</li>
            <li>For example, the cuticle trimmer is completely rounded and will not trim anything.</li>
            <li>Really, the nail clippers are the only things that actually work in the whole set.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely her style and she loves the size as she travels often.</li>
            <li>So far is has met my expectation of what manicure/pedicure set is suppose to accomplish.  </li>
            <li>Professional.</li>
            <li>Not good, but not terrible.</li>
            <li>They are flimsy, hard to grip with and bend out of shape easily.</li>
            <li>Looks nice but the tools that should be sharp are dull.</li>
            <li>The product came exactly as describe, but all of the tools are much too dull for my liking.</li>
            <li>but my dad has really bad nails and these habe held up 100% great deal</li>
            <li>So far I have had this since mid February</li>
            <li>It sticks and barely cuts.</li>
            <li>The clippers and scissors are sharp and able to cut through my hard nails (especially my toe nails).</li>
            <li>I can easily and inexpensively replace the broken toenail clippers.</li>

            <li> Was honestly not too terribly impressed by this set.  </li>
            <li> Love it and case is very organzized</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find better, but not sure you will find better for the price.</li>
            <li> worth the price though.</li>
            <li> I love the antique styled soft leather case.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li> so this was right up her alley.</li>
            <li> Nice little kit very nicely made, heavy not flimsy and cheap</li>
            <li> Love this cute little kit!</li>
            <li> The designated straps are too big for most of the tools.</li>
            <li> There are lots of instruments in the set, however, I didn&#x27;t know what most of them were for; a simple set of instructions would be helpful.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s already used it several times for nail care and can&#x27;t wait to use it more.</li>
            <li> waste of good money</li>
            <li> made cheap  less tools  better quality</li>
            <li> All the other tools are really nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> The stainless steel is of good quality, not cheap.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it had come with a description of what certain items were for and how to use them.</li>
            <li> I also recommend this seller very highly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little sister and I had to buy one for myself after seeing how nice it is in person.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very large and it holds the correct amount of items, and the design on the outside is very pretty</li>
            <li> but I was expecting something much nicer.</li>
            <li> built better than expected</li>
            <li> So much stuff</li>
            <li> I really it</li>
            <li> The nail clippers don&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my daughter and she was very pleased.sk</li>
            <li> tools are all decent and work well</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t particularly care for the oriental writing on the tools, but it&#x27;s imported.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend either for yourself or as a gift.</li>
            <li> The package is well organized and the tools are high quality&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the tools are great but others are cheap and worthless.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very lovely, small enough to throw into your handbook and equipped with every tool you could need.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like it and it was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I was able to print a list from the description page, but I still not sure what a pealing knife is for or why I would use a metal ear pick?</li>
            <li> It comes with more tools that any other set I&#x27;ve seen and is compact enough to carry on trips..</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars but the little loops that hold the tools and clippers in place tear easy and</li>
            <li> My only complaint with it (and the reason not 5 stars) is that the holder pulls seem to stretch easy and don&#x27;t retract at all, meaning the first time you use it they won&#x27;t hold well after that, dealer breaker for some, but so far it ain&#x27;t much of a problem.</li>
            <li> Clippers, scissors are heavy duty and work fine.  </li>
            <li> However, the large toenail clippers broke after only one use.  </li>
            <li> the tools are old and dont work.</li>
            <li> For example, the cuticle trimmer is completely rounded and will not trim anything.</li>
            <li> Really, the nail clippers are the only things that actually work in the whole set.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely her style and she loves the size as she travels often.</li>
            <li> So far is has met my expectation of what manicure/pedicure set is suppose to accomplish.  </li>
            <li> Professional.</li>
            <li> Not good, but not terrible.</li>
            <li> They are flimsy, hard to grip with and bend out of shape easily.</li>
            <li> Looks nice but the tools that should be sharp are dull.</li>
            <li> The product came exactly as describe, but all of the tools are much too dull for my liking.</li>
            <li> but my dad has really bad nails and these habe held up 100% great deal</li>
            <li> So far I have had this since mid February</li>
            <li> It sticks and barely cuts.</li>
            <li> The clippers and scissors are sharp and able to cut through my hard nails (especially my toe nails).</li>
            <li> I can easily and inexpensively replace the broken toenail clippers.</li>
            <li> The clippers were poor quality, i.e. they couldn&#x27;t clip cleanly through a nail.  </li>
            <li> For what you pay this is probably good, but I was disappointed by the overall flimsiness of the items.</li>
            <li> , I just fell like they may not last long.</li>
            <li> Oh well at least the other items are usable and made very well.</li>
            <li> But not worth shipping back.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I was a little skeptical, but I&#x27;m glad I got this.  </li>
            <li> Not to bad seen better but works for what I need</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> but feel a bit rough, like they didn&#x27;t bother smoothing out the edges after mass producing the pieces.</li>
            <li> But got a pink case.</li>
            <li> I am concerned it&#x27;s not stainless steel?</li>
            <li> It takes a few tries to get it close properly.</li>
            <li> The scissors are sharp so that&#x27;s a plus.  </li>
            <li> Tools aren&#x27;t sharp.</li>
            <li> Concern it has very rough edges.</li>
            <li> The clippers are so dull that I just stopped using them, and I have only used them about twice.</li>
            <li> This has all the tools, yes, but most of them were dull enough to make them worthless.</li>
            <li> Not worth te money</li>
            <li> the only complaint I have about it is the quality of the tweezers.</li>
            <li> One of the snaps that  is suppose to hold the clippers down was torn when I opened the case.</li>
            <li> In addition there was a piece of thread between the metal (that seals the latch of the clutch) and the black strip, the product fell apart.</li>
            <li> #4 - Case looks slightly beat up and has thread coming out of the side.  </li>
            <li> The cuticle pushers are all very thick and rounded, so they skim right over the thin cuticle resting on the nail.</li>
            <li> The other tools appear cheap and are worthless.  </li>
            <li> The inside is a little cheaply designed and I was a little bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> case closes a little tight.</li>
            <li> But the case smells a little musty?</li>
            <li> I would pass on this if I were you, and splurge for something a little nicer.</li>
            <li> The cuticle clippers are pointed, but the blade edge is so dull, it partially digs into a hangnail</li>
            <li> Too much trouble to return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to waste my time to return it, I&#x27;ll use what I can</li>
            <li> The one thing missing is a list of what each piece is used for.</li>
            <li> Cheap crap.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my step daughter who requested a small manicure kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tools are a weird metal and don&#x27;t look at all like I expected.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave it a 3 star was because it&#x27;s very hard to close.</li>
            <li> but now all the straps that held everything have broken</li>
            <li> One of the straps for the clippers was broken so those will have to float around.</li>
            <li> Not a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Poor Quality.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s broken, but its not.</li>
            <li> Also, it is difficult to get some of the instruments out of the kit.</li>
            <li> Some of the tools inside are questionable because I&#x27;ve never seen anything like them before</li>
            <li> however, the clippers and everything else in the inside are of very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this unless you are desperate and can&#x27;t afford something decent.&lt;br /&gt;Looks</li>
            <li> This arrived dirty (w/black grease).  </li>
            <li> and then I have to tug-tug-tug like mad to get the skin to pull off.</li>
            <li> bad finishing quality</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The cuticle nipper/cutter is terrible.</li>
            <li> I am so incredibly disgusted that I don&#x27;t even know where to begin.</li>
            <li> That is so beyond disgusting.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I know someone who will just love this.  I bought a similar kit for her last year for Christmas, but it was lost when her bags were stolen.  This one is cuter than the one I got last year so I am sure she will be thrilled.</li>
            <li> Big mistake. Not sanitary too many nail cutters. waste of good money</li>
            <li> It came with everything it said it would. The tools work great. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Really nice. Perfect for home or travel.</li>
            <li> I saved a lot of money by purchasing this set to do my nails myself.</li>
            <li> Nice manicure set in a very nice case</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. None of the implements are any sharper than the ones sold in stores. One of the snaps that  is suppose to hold the clippers down was torn when I opened the case. The case is lovely but I was expecting something much nicer. Too much trouble to return it.</li>
            <li> So far I have had this since mid February and I loved it in the beginning but now all the straps that held everything have broken and some pieces have started to rust.</li>
            <li> built better than expected</li>
            <li> Only came with 9 pieces</li>
            <li> Good quality works well wife has no complaints. Great case also.</li>
            <li> A nice manicure kit for a young woman at an attractive price.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my step daughter who requested a small manicure kit.&lt;br /&gt;It is very lovely, small enough to throw into your handbook and equipped with every tool you could need.</li>
            <li> Super cute case it comes in. Everything is durable and functional. So much stuff I&#x27;m not even sure what it all does! Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is one of the cheapest manicure kits I&#x27;ve ever gotten. It is super cute so if you don&#x27;t mind cheaper quality than this is perfect. One of the straps for the clippers was broken so those will have to float around. The designated straps are too big for most of the tools. The wording on the case didn&#x27;t fully print on. The cuticle nipper/cutter is terrible. It sticks and barely cuts. The scissors are sharp so that&#x27;s a plus.  I&#x27;m not going to waste my time to return it, I&#x27;ll use what I can but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> tools are all decent and work well but feel a bit rough, like they didn&#x27;t bother smoothing out the edges after mass producing the pieces. the case is lovely. worth the price though.</li>
            <li> the tools are old and dont work. Not worth te money</li>
            <li> Nice quality instruments.</li>
            <li> came fast and look good</li>
            <li> Love this cute little kit! It has tools I don&#x27;t even know how to use lol. I really just wanted the cuticle trimmers, but the rest of it is really nice too.</li>
            <li> I do my own gel nails and was looking for a kit with all the tools for a home manicure. This has all the tools, yes, but most of them were dull enough to make them worthless. For example, the cuticle trimmer is completely rounded and will not trim anything. The cuticle clippers are pointed, but the blade edge is so dull, it partially digs into a hangnail and then I have to tug-tug-tug like mad to get the skin to pull off. OUCH! The cuticle pushers are all very thick and rounded, so they skim right over the thin cuticle resting on the nail. Really, the nail clippers are the only things that actually work in the whole set. The case is cute and very handy...but I didn&#x27;t buy the set for the case, I wanted tools that work. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. Tools aren&#x27;t sharp. Instead they rely on brute force to do the job, resulting in cracked nails. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Love this set. Now I can have everything that I need in a beautiful handy case. All the pieces seem to be good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS MANICURE SET. love the pretty case, the quality of the items, and the variety of items. Would highly recommend either for yourself or as a gift.</li>
            <li> I bought this set of nail set to avoid getting my nails done all the time and wasting money. The set looks cheap. The tools are a weird metal and don&#x27;t look at all like I expected. A bit upset about this.</li>
            <li> Perfect! This kit has everything that I need and it also comes with a cute cover.</li>
            <li> Not a great purchase.</li>
            <li> made cheap  less tools  better quality</li>
            <li> There are lots of instruments in the set, however, I didn&#x27;t know what most of them were for; a simple set of instructions would be helpful.  The clippers were poor quality, i.e. they couldn&#x27;t clip cleanly through a nail.  Also, it is difficult to get some of the instruments out of the kit.</li>
            <li> The one thing missing is a list of what each piece is used for. Would be great to have that and it is important for efficiency of use. Oh, well...</li>
            <li> This one I bought to replace the one I bought to replace the one I gave to my sister.  Yes- that&#x27;s right.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Everything in one place with a beautiful cover.  Very sturdy too! I definitely recommend this set! I also recommend this seller very highly.</li>
            <li> All in all this is a nice set. the only complaint I have about it is the quality of the tweezers. They are flimsy, hard to grip with and bend out of shape easily. I would have given this product all five stars if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that the most used product in the set is the one that is of the lowest quality. I threw out the tweezers and replaced them with ones that I bought. All the other tools are really nice and sturdy. Plus the smiley faces are a really happy touch.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product&lt;br /&gt;With buying a high end product like this in stainless steel you know you can clean it and it will withstand a good cleaning as to prevent the spread of germs.  The package is well organized and the tools are high quality&lt;br /&gt;The case is quite TTRACTIVE AND MUCH MORE IN THIS COMBINATION THAN YOU CAN FIND IN A RETAIL STORE</li>
            <li> This is a nice set. I have used it a couple times and it seems to be sturdy. The clipper and things are made of a good mettle. There is a lot of tools included too. I really it, it is compact it would fit nice in your pocket book. It does not take up a lot of room. I would have given it 5 stars but the little loops that hold the tools and clippers in place tear easy and case closes a little tight. I still like the set and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Very very cute, my wife loves it to death. She&#x27;s already used it several times for nail care and can&#x27;t wait to use it more. It&#x27;s completely her style and she loves the size as she travels often. My only complaint with it (and the reason not 5 stars) is that the holder pulls seem to stretch easy and don&#x27;t retract at all, meaning the first time you use it they won&#x27;t hold well after that, dealer breaker for some, but so far it ain&#x27;t much of a problem.</li>
            <li> Nice little kit very nicely made, heavy not flimsy and cheap</li>
            <li> The tools inside are of good quality.  Didn&#x27;t particularly care for the oriental writing on the tools, but it&#x27;s imported.  Some of the tools inside are questionable because I&#x27;ve never seen anything like them before and I didn&#x27;t care for their quality.  But in all I am pleased with what I got for the price.  The most upsetting thing about this purchase was the fact that I didn&#x27;t get it when I was supposed to for my Mom&#x27;s birthday!</li>
            <li> Looks great. Better than I thought. Some stuff looks a bit cheap but my dad has really bad nails and these habe held up 100% great deal</li>
            <li> For what you pay this is probably good, but I was disappointed by the overall flimsiness of the items. The case was nice and the products work well, I just fell like they may not last long.</li>
            <li> ruff looking ,cuts Ok</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this unless you are desperate and can&#x27;t afford something decent.&lt;br /&gt;Looks nice online, but the cover was coming apart when I opened the package and the tools are very low quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a gift basket I&#x27;m putting together for someone.  I bought it over the others because the case is more attractive and it had the most number of pieces for the money.  It seems to be good quality and arrived on time, undamaged.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Good quality item. I am very happy with this product. Price &amp; quality matches.</li>
            <li> great quality nail set.  this is the 3rd set that i have bought as gifts and everyone loves them.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I was a little skeptical, but I&#x27;m glad I got this.  I think this set is great, and it helps with my manicures immensely.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a nail care kit like this.</li>
            <li> good quality, giving as gift to teen</li>
            <li> These were a gift and they were well received. I just wish it had come with a description of what certain items were for and how to use them. I was able to print a list from the description page, but I still not sure what a pealing knife is for or why I would use a metal ear pick? Oh well at least the other items are usable and made very well.</li>
            <li> This product is SO CHEAP.  When it arrived the case was would not latch.  In addition there was a piece of thread between the metal (that seals the latch of the clutch) and the black strip, the product fell apart. It seems that this is what was holding it together.  Everything inside feels cheap too. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have a problem with this product, the nipper is not work and what happen now</li>
            <li> Very nice Christmas presant.</li>
            <li> Cheap crap. Some clippers don&#x27;t line up on the blades so they won&#x27;t cut at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome set!  But the case smells a little musty?</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. Has a lot of gadgets but they don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Good value, no complaints at all.  Seems well made and has many tools for most uses. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find better, but not sure you will find better for the price.</li>
            <li> Poor Quality.  I used the nail clippers once and it fell apart. It looks like everything fits in nicely, but it does not.</li>
            <li> Beautiful for a gift.</li>
            <li> I am so incredibly disgusted that I don&#x27;t even know where to begin. Are you freaking kidding me?!    #1 - The manicure set came inside some kind of cell phone bag.  #2 - The case is NOT as pictured. There is no Eiffel Tower on the case. The brand name on the case is also smeared.  #3 - I open the case to find all the pieces everywhere and falling out of the case.  #4 - Case looks slightly beat up and has thread coming out of the side.  #5 - This is what infuriated me. There was a hair in the case. It looked like this set had been used by someone else. Are you freaking kidding me?! That is so beyond disgusting.    Will be returning this item and never doing business with this company ever again. If I wanted a used product I&#x27;d visit the local thrift store.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  The stainless steel is of good quality, not cheap.  So far is has met my expectation of what manicure/pedicure set is suppose to accomplish.  The clippers and scissors are sharp and able to cut through my hard nails (especially my toe nails).</li>
            <li> Some of the tools are great but others are cheap and worthless.  Clippers, scissors are heavy duty and work fine.  The other tools appear cheap and are worthless.  I would recommend a better solution.</li>
            <li> Beautiful... all tools appear to be professional grade.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little sister and I had to buy one for myself after seeing how nice it is in person.</li>
            <li> Wonderful nail care set.  The case is really nice and sturdy.  It comes with more tools that any other set I&#x27;ve seen and is compact enough to carry on trips..</li>
            <li> well worth it, my girlfriend loved it for her nails.</li>
            <li> This manicure set is gorgeous! It&#x27;s very beautiful and feminine and just what I was looking for. I love the antique styled soft leather case. This is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Yuck!  This arrived dirty (w/black grease).  I returned it.  It is a cute case… so I gave it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my grandchild.  The smiley faces caught my eye for a feminine touch.</li>
            <li> Was honestly not too terribly impressed by this set.  Some of the tools, one could tell, was rather cheaply made.  Since one of them literally popped a screw within a couple of uses.  You get what you pay for.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s not terrible.  Not good, but not terrible.</li>
            <li> Case was very nice.  This set was equipped with several really great tools.  However, the large toenail clippers broke after only one use.  Though I am still very happy with my purchase because of all the useful tools and case.  I can easily and inexpensively replace the broken toenail clippers.</li>
            <li> I wanted the purple case. But got a pink case. But not worth shipping back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very large and it holds the correct amount of items, and the design on the outside is very pretty, I don&#x27;t want to put it in a drawer. The reason why I gave it a 3 star was because it&#x27;s very hard to close. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s broken, but its not. It takes a few tries to get it close properly.</li>
            <li> bad finishing quality</li>
            <li> Love this set. Best mani pedi set I&#x27;ve ever owned. Professional.</li>
            <li> The nail clippers don&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> Looks nice but the tools that should be sharp are dull. I kept it because it does come in handy.</li>
            <li> Concern it has very rough edges. I am concerned it&#x27;s not stainless steel? The nail clipper does not clip? Wth!!!</li>
            <li> Love it and case is very organzized</li>
            <li> I love this set.  I always keep it in my bag. It have all I need for a manicure-pedicure. Definitely will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not to bad seen better but works for what I need</li>
            <li> I bought this item to have something handy for trips.  I really like the case it is of nice quality.. however, the clippers and everything else in the inside are of very poor quality. I can see one using it for an emergency like hangnail or something of that sort while traveling, but not to get a nice manicure done.  I like the case a lot.. I may just buy some good  quality instruments and put them in  the case for traveling.</li>
            <li> The product came exactly as describe, but all of the tools are much too dull for my liking. The clippers are so dull that I just stopped using them, and I have only used them about twice. The $2 clippers from Target I have are much better. I would pass on this if I were you, and splurge for something a little nicer.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this set.  She is all into everything Paris so this was right up her alley.</li>
            <li> Nicely wrapped looks great love the style, my own little set.</li>
            <li> Outside of case is beautiful. The inside is a little cheaply designed and I was a little bit disappointed. Overall, I like it and it was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my daughter and she was very pleased.sk</li>
            <li> These were a gift for my granddaughter and seem to be of good quality.  She likes them and should get many years of use from them.</li>
