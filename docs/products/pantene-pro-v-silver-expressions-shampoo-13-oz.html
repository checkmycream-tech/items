            <li> This shampoo is very rich.  I have noticed a difference with the first washing of my hair, as being more manageable.  I didn&#x27;t even have the matching conditioner yet, which I will be receiving soon.  Its a blue color, but not on your hair.</li>
            <li> This really dried out my hair. I have very thick rather course hair, it is long, almost to my butt. I would not recommend this product, it&#x27;s too drying for me.</li>
            <li> Same as conditioner. I have used it before and like the way it makes my hair shine. I would encourage anyone with silvery white hair to use it. It gives your hair highlights.</li>
            <li> I have a full head of silver- this is my favorite shampoo- no yellow at all. Don&#x27;t be put off by the color- it works exceptionally well!</li>

            <li> My mom loves this shampoo for her white hair.  She has tried other shampoos that are suppose to work for white hair but they always made her hair look yellowish.  This shampoo makes her hair look shiny and white.  This is all she wants to use.</li>
            <li> My mother has gray hair, and since 3 years ago she is using this shampoo and she is really happy because it preserve its gray color and makes it shine. Really good.</li>
            <li> I cannot find Silver Expressions on any store shelves, so I am very glad that Amazon has it.  My hair is brown, gray and silver.  Before I started using this, the silver appeared a bit yellow.  The shampoo brings out the silver highlights. After the first couple of times that I used it I got compliments on the difference.  I also like the fact that it is not necessary to use it every day.  I will continue to use this shampoo as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo for around a month and have enjoyed the results.  I am salt and pepper hair, and it is keeping the yellow out.</li>

            <li> I have a mix of gray and black hair. My gray has grown in streaks, using Pantene shampoo for silver gray hair gives my hair shine and makes the gray pop. The gray now looks like silver with a shimmer. I get compliments on my hair color which is my natural hair color on a consistent basis. Excellent product. I am happy this product is available for people who has hair that dye does not adhere to. So I go natural and my silver gray hair glows and shines beautifully. My hair is exceptionally soft too, Thank you Pantene!!! I have recommended this product to others who now love it too,</li>

            <li> I really like this shampoo.  Been looking for one for salt n pepper hair.  This works really well along with the conditioner to give my hair luster.  I haven&#x27;t been able to locate Pantene Pro V-Silver on store shelves so I&#x27;m happy to be able to order it through Amazon.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This shampoo gives gray hair shine and beauty. It&#x27;s not sold in stores anymore and Amazon was where I found it.</li>
            <li> I looked like I had &amp;#34;ice&amp;#34; hair, and made me frizzy.</li>
