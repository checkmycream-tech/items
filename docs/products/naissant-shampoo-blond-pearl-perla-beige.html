            <li>this is lovely shampoo, I loved it so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost every brand available for color treated hair and none of them have left my hair so beautiful like Naissant!</li>
            <li>It has left my hair with incredible depth and shine and has lasted many shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have tried every single toning shampoo out there and nothing has worked as great as Naissant!!</li>

            <li>I have tried almost every single purple toning shampoo available and Naissant is the best!</li>
            <li>After reading reviews of many fashion bloggers, I was excited to try this toning shampoo on my lack-luster tresses.</li>
            <li>Seller got shampoo out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Hair looks fresh, shiny, bouncy, soft and bright!  </li>
            <li>My hair feels softer, healthier, and is keeping it&#x27;s blonde tone beautifully.</li>
            <li>It takes out the brassiness and makes my blonde hair beautiful.</li>
            <li>a beautiful white blond</li>
            <li>This is Fantastic-</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great to use once  a week to remove brassiness from blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>Liked it so much</li>
            <li>Great for keeping blond blond...not yellow or brassy.  </li>
            <li>Worked Great on my blonde highlights!</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo for my 11 year old daughter and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use a good deep conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li>It leaves a very nice beige blonde color.  </li>
            <li>Love it but don&#x27;t leave it on too long since this gives a great tone FAST and STRONG.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this on a recommendation, and keep repurchasing.</li>
            <li>Really rich purple pigment.  </li>
            <li>worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>The treatment smells really nice and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Makes blonde color-treated hair feel so good.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the Naissant shampoo is that it smells lovely - no weird chemical smell here.</li>
            <li>If you leave on your hair for 30 seconds and do a quick rinse</li>
            <li>The product was shipped and received quickly</li>
            <li>I will def be purchasing some more when I start running low :)</li>
            <li>Her hair looks more vibrant and shiny.</li>
            <li>It does make your hair feel super cleansed afterward.</li>
            <li>Even after my first use I could tell the Naissant shampoo was a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>The product got here very fast!</li>
            <li>A great product to use to tone down brassiness in hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very vibrant and pigmented purple shampoo that really penetrates the hair strands to give it a beautifully toned blonde.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural and I love the results.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it does not make my hair grey or green as most toners will with my hair.</li>
            <li>I used this product and noticed a significant improvement within the first week.</li>
            <li>And even better, it doesn&#x27;t dry the hair out like most purple shampoos have a tendency of doing.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to get brassy pretty quickly and just one quick wash</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair beautifully golden.</li>
            <li>but i expected that, it smelt really good.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair looking salon fresh.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny - love it.</li>
            <li>but I truly believe this product is worth it.</li>
            <li>It deposits a more natural beige blond while vanquishing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now on alternating days, and my hair color still looks salon fresh.</li>
            <li>I love that my hair feels soft and nourished after use.</li>
            <li>I looked for it in many places and finally I ordered it from Amazon and absolutely fell in love with it .</li>
            <li>, I FEEL FRESH</li>
            <li>This shampoo is far better than Shimmer Lights.</li>
            <li>I ran out of my usual ph shampoo, so I decided to try a new one and Naissant is awesome.</li>
            <li>and she was right</li>
            <li>I received the product in two days which is great, the bottle was really small</li>
            <li>my high light were bright and left my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very conditioned and soft :)</li>
            <li>Works great for toning yellow and orange tones in blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do very much for my hair except make it drier.</li>
            <li>It left my hair looking very natural and soft plus it smells great.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo does not really &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34;, which I am fine with, but I felt like I couldn&#x27;t be sure it was really distributing through my hair.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions and done exactly how it said to wash my hair...</li>
            <li>Makes hair so pretty...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I used this product after watching Kelly Strack use it on her golden blonde Bellami hair extensions to change them from gold to more beige to match her real hair.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using the product very long, but from what I can tell so far, it is pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>I love this product is the only one who doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry and at the same time it remove those hideous brassy tones, protecting my color for more time &#x3D;).&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this product has been totally wonderful, and it actually does what it says, and tones my hair back to a silvery blonde (but still isn&#x27;t too ashy or &amp;#34;blueish&amp;#34;, which unfortunately many other toners do).</li>
            <li>Bought this a few months back and loved it!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need a whole lot, so it goes a long way, and even my hair dresser made a comment as to how much more my hair is showing the blond highlights.</li>
            <li>Keeps my color treated  hair light blonde, and really helps to keep my color looking fresh and new in between salon visits!</li>
            <li>and it feels very high quality.</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is fantastic for my treated blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is really responding well to this shampoo and the treatment conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really like the consistency</li>
            <li>Bought this to keep my light blonde highlights from looking brassy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This shampoo worked really well.  </li>
            <li>and it really brightens up my highlights.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really helped take the orange out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Product is very purple.</li>
            <li>Really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and this product keeps the blonde color light without looking brassy or orange</li>
            <li>It has  been very convenient for me to have found this product</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It seems to really brighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivered.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t Sud much, so don&#x27;t freak out</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much either.</li>
            <li>I dislike purple shampoos that leave your hair grey or silver like , as it can age you , and this one leaves your hair a beautiful beige even white tone if left longer with no ashy silver color!</li>
            <li>Also, this is more gentle on the hair than other toning shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I am loving this shampoo and the other products this brand offers.  </li>
            <li>and I can immediately see a huge difference in my blonde tones and how vibrant they looked.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling clean and silky smooth once blow dried.</li>
            <li>I prefer this shampoo over most other toning shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have long, color treated hair that is fine.  </li>
            <li>It helps bring out my best blonde, especially in these dull Northeast winters.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair in better condition that any other brand of shampoo/conditioners!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have come across this because I have given up on finding ways to refresh the blondness, and this cost less than the Aveda line.  </li>
            <li>Wish the cost wasn&#x27;t so high though.</li>
            <li>It works wonders and I highly recommend if you&#x27;re on the fence on whether you should try it or not.</li>
            <li>This review has been a time coming, I received this product with fast shipping, I have very bleached and damaged hair, this product was very good for my hair, it made it soft and feel not so thin and dry.</li>
            <li>She says it helps her retain her color much, much longer than her old shampoo did.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;brassiness, not a dull ashy color.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a shampoo that would keep my blonde hair from dulling over the summer, and this shampoo did more than expected.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and vibrant.</li>
            <li>But, it makes my hair very soft and does give my hair a boost.</li>
            <li>I did notice the shampoo left my hair a little dry, so a good conditioner after is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>When I saw my hair blown out after my first shampoo I could already see that my highlights were less yellow and more platinum blonde.</li>
            <li>It definitely does the job nontheless, it only takes a little, and  I love the smell!</li>
            <li>Not only does it do the job but also leaves my hair feeling super soft and silky following the conditioner treatment.</li>
            <li>It does seem to be a bit drying, but the naissant treatment makes it silky soft again.  </li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t really notice a big difference</li>
            <li>This along with the toner really helped my hair get that blonde</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>It really brings your hair color back to life making it look like you just stepped out of the salon.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, and silky even after being treated with all the chemicals I put in it.</li>
            <li>I did a LOT of research before buying a purple shampoo to offset some brassiness in my blonde hair and this product really lived up to all the other positive reviews!</li>
            <li>I have previously tried Shimmer Lights shampoo and didn&#x27;t like that it would quickly stain my hair lavender and purple</li>
            <li>Does a decent job of toning the brassiness that can sometimes accompany blonde highlights.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for over 6 months now and it is the only shampoo that actually tones my hair to a light white pearl blonde color.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my girlfriend, and it really does seem to keep her blonde from going brassy with regular use.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I use this at least 1-2x a week !</li>
            <li>Recommended for color treated hair that&#x27;s dark blonde to light blonde.</li>
            <li>It definitely tones down the brassy tomes of my color treated light blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you want to achieve that white &amp;#34;pearl&amp;#34; blonde.</li>
            <li>It reasonably priced than other products on the market.</li>
            <li>and I love that it costs less than what my other shampoo did even with shipping!!!</li>
            <li>I waited a few days and tried it again thinking I messed up the first time and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also EXTREMELY drying so use only with a deep conditioning mask, otherwise your hair will become very brittle &amp; start breaking.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the shampoo and tell everyone I know to ditch their other purple bottle toner and to pick this up instead.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and not overly dry.</li>
            <li>I used it the first time the other day, it helped brighten my highlights, did not dry out my hair the way other color enhance products have.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> she asked if I could get more for her.</li>

            <li> Love this shampoo -</li>

            <li> The best shampoo/conditioner for blonde hair on the market, will buy again.</li>
            <li> works better</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT, HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!</li>

            <li> this is lovely shampoo, I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every brand available for color treated hair and none of them have left my hair so beautiful like Naissant!</li>
            <li> It has left my hair with incredible depth and shine and has lasted many shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single toning shampoo out there and nothing has worked as great as Naissant!!</li>
            <li> Leave my hair shiny and just the right amount of tone I love!</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes your hair feels so soft</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every single purple toning shampoo available and Naissant is the best!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews of many fashion bloggers, I was excited to try this toning shampoo on my lack-luster tresses.</li>
            <li> Seller got shampoo out very quickly.</li>
            <li> Hair looks fresh, shiny, bouncy, soft and bright!  </li>
            <li> My hair feels softer, healthier, and is keeping it&#x27;s blonde tone beautifully.</li>
            <li> It takes out the brassiness and makes my blonde hair beautiful.</li>
            <li> a beautiful white blond</li>
            <li> This is Fantastic-</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great to use once  a week to remove brassiness from blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> Liked it so much</li>
            <li> Great for keeping blond blond...not yellow or brassy.  </li>
            <li> Worked Great on my blonde highlights!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my 11 year old daughter and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use a good deep conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> It leaves a very nice beige blonde color.  </li>
            <li> Love it but don&#x27;t leave it on too long since this gives a great tone FAST and STRONG.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this on a recommendation, and keep repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Really rich purple pigment.  </li>
            <li> worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> The treatment smells really nice and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Makes blonde color-treated hair feel so good.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the Naissant shampoo is that it smells lovely - no weird chemical smell here.</li>
            <li> If you leave on your hair for 30 seconds and do a quick rinse</li>
            <li> The product was shipped and received quickly</li>
            <li> I will def be purchasing some more when I start running low :)</li>
            <li> Her hair looks more vibrant and shiny.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair feel super cleansed afterward.</li>
            <li> Even after my first use I could tell the Naissant shampoo was a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> The product got here very fast!</li>
            <li> A great product to use to tone down brassiness in hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very vibrant and pigmented purple shampoo that really penetrates the hair strands to give it a beautifully toned blonde.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural and I love the results.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it does not make my hair grey or green as most toners will with my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this product and noticed a significant improvement within the first week.</li>
            <li> And even better, it doesn&#x27;t dry the hair out like most purple shampoos have a tendency of doing.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to get brassy pretty quickly and just one quick wash</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair beautifully golden.</li>
            <li> but i expected that, it smelt really good.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair looking salon fresh.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny - love it.</li>
            <li> but I truly believe this product is worth it.</li>
            <li> It deposits a more natural beige blond while vanquishing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now on alternating days, and my hair color still looks salon fresh.</li>
            <li> I love that my hair feels soft and nourished after use.</li>
            <li> I looked for it in many places and finally I ordered it from Amazon and absolutely fell in love with it .</li>
            <li> , I FEEL FRESH</li>
            <li> This shampoo is far better than Shimmer Lights.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my usual ph shampoo, so I decided to try a new one and Naissant is awesome.</li>
            <li> and she was right</li>
            <li> I received the product in two days which is great, the bottle was really small</li>
            <li> my high light were bright and left my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very conditioned and soft :)</li>
            <li> Works great for toning yellow and orange tones in blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do very much for my hair except make it drier.</li>
            <li> It left my hair looking very natural and soft plus it smells great.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo does not really &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34;, which I am fine with, but I felt like I couldn&#x27;t be sure it was really distributing through my hair.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and done exactly how it said to wash my hair...</li>
            <li> Makes hair so pretty...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I used this product after watching Kelly Strack use it on her golden blonde Bellami hair extensions to change them from gold to more beige to match her real hair.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product very long, but from what I can tell so far, it is pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> I love this product is the only one who doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry and at the same time it remove those hideous brassy tones, protecting my color for more time &#x3D;).&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this product has been totally wonderful, and it actually does what it says, and tones my hair back to a silvery blonde (but still isn&#x27;t too ashy or &amp;#34;blueish&amp;#34;, which unfortunately many other toners do).</li>
            <li> Bought this a few months back and loved it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need a whole lot, so it goes a long way, and even my hair dresser made a comment as to how much more my hair is showing the blond highlights.</li>
            <li> Keeps my color treated  hair light blonde, and really helps to keep my color looking fresh and new in between salon visits!</li>
            <li> and it feels very high quality.</li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic for my treated blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really responding well to this shampoo and the treatment conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency</li>
            <li> Bought this to keep my light blonde highlights from looking brassy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked really well.  </li>
            <li> and it really brightens up my highlights.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really helped take the orange out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Product is very purple.</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> and this product keeps the blonde color light without looking brassy or orange</li>
            <li> It has  been very convenient for me to have found this product</li>
            <li> so I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It seems to really brighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivered.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t Sud much, so don&#x27;t freak out</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use much either.</li>
            <li> I dislike purple shampoos that leave your hair grey or silver like , as it can age you , and this one leaves your hair a beautiful beige even white tone if left longer with no ashy silver color!</li>
            <li> Also, this is more gentle on the hair than other toning shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I am loving this shampoo and the other products this brand offers.  </li>
            <li> and I can immediately see a huge difference in my blonde tones and how vibrant they looked.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling clean and silky smooth once blow dried.</li>
            <li> I prefer this shampoo over most other toning shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have long, color treated hair that is fine.  </li>
            <li> It helps bring out my best blonde, especially in these dull Northeast winters.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair in better condition that any other brand of shampoo/conditioners!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have come across this because I have given up on finding ways to refresh the blondness, and this cost less than the Aveda line.  </li>
            <li> Wish the cost wasn&#x27;t so high though.</li>
            <li> It works wonders and I highly recommend if you&#x27;re on the fence on whether you should try it or not.</li>
            <li> This review has been a time coming, I received this product with fast shipping, I have very bleached and damaged hair, this product was very good for my hair, it made it soft and feel not so thin and dry.</li>
            <li> She says it helps her retain her color much, much longer than her old shampoo did.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;brassiness, not a dull ashy color.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo that would keep my blonde hair from dulling over the summer, and this shampoo did more than expected.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and vibrant.</li>
            <li> But, it makes my hair very soft and does give my hair a boost.</li>
            <li> I did notice the shampoo left my hair a little dry, so a good conditioner after is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> When I saw my hair blown out after my first shampoo I could already see that my highlights were less yellow and more platinum blonde.</li>
            <li> It definitely does the job nontheless, it only takes a little, and  I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Not only does it do the job but also leaves my hair feeling super soft and silky following the conditioner treatment.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be a bit drying, but the naissant treatment makes it silky soft again.  </li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t really notice a big difference</li>
            <li> This along with the toner really helped my hair get that blonde</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> So far I like it</li>
            <li> It really brings your hair color back to life making it look like you just stepped out of the salon.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, and silky even after being treated with all the chemicals I put in it.</li>
            <li> I did a LOT of research before buying a purple shampoo to offset some brassiness in my blonde hair and this product really lived up to all the other positive reviews!</li>
            <li> I have previously tried Shimmer Lights shampoo and didn&#x27;t like that it would quickly stain my hair lavender and purple</li>
            <li> Does a decent job of toning the brassiness that can sometimes accompany blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for over 6 months now and it is the only shampoo that actually tones my hair to a light white pearl blonde color.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend, and it really does seem to keep her blonde from going brassy with regular use.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I use this at least 1-2x a week !</li>
            <li> Recommended for color treated hair that&#x27;s dark blonde to light blonde.</li>
            <li> It definitely tones down the brassy tomes of my color treated light blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you want to achieve that white &amp;#34;pearl&amp;#34; blonde.</li>
            <li> It reasonably priced than other products on the market.</li>
            <li> and I love that it costs less than what my other shampoo did even with shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I waited a few days and tried it again thinking I messed up the first time and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also EXTREMELY drying so use only with a deep conditioning mask, otherwise your hair will become very brittle &amp; start breaking.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the shampoo and tell everyone I know to ditch their other purple bottle toner and to pick this up instead.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and not overly dry.</li>
            <li> I used it the first time the other day, it helped brighten my highlights, did not dry out my hair the way other color enhance products have.  </li>
            <li> Being a natural blond, it is hard to realize that as you get older, your hair gets darker, but this has made me even feel younger, if that is possible.</li>
            <li> I have gold based hair with beige highlights that are heavy and tend to change brassy quickly, so this renews my hair and looks like I got it redone at the salon without changing my base which I love !</li>
            <li> A lot of other products claim to do both (but only really do one or the other).</li>
            <li> you shouldn&#x27;t get any purple tints however if you leave it on to long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used shimmering lights before, but I felt like it took a long time for it to have any effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> Product is a little pricey for it&#x27;s size (wish they provided a larger option) but overall quality product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going blonder each time I go to the salon and due to the red undertones in my hair</li>
            <li> It does not make hair feel dry or brittle like alot of other blonde shampoos do</li>
            <li> I have very very VERY long hair, so I use about 2 ounces every wash</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or brittle.</li>
            <li> Takes brassiness out of my hair without leaving it dry.</li>
            <li> Due to her age and coloring its been looking pretty dull!</li>
            <li> I typically have to tone my blonde hair every month or so from keeping my highlights looking brassy and this shampoo does it all-</li>
            <li> but my color can fade a little toward the end of my coloring before I go back in and get it colored again.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re really not getting the maximum benefit from the product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my girl friend a few weeks back...</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo and found it similar to a few other blonde shampoo&#x27;s that i have purchased in the past,  the shampoo is purple in color and helps to alleviate brassiness that can sometimes occur when we get our hair highlighted or dyed blond.</li>
            <li> Sadly didn&#x27;t notice much of a differencedifference!?</li>
            <li> For reference, I wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> minus the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is purple in color and thick enough to coat and stay in your hair.</li>
            <li> This did not help what so ever with toning down the yellowish tone of my hair.</li>
            <li> Any less time than this</li>
            <li> I have to use a lot however and do wish that it I could use less to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I went from black to blond in half a year with bleaching and lightening (basically torturing)</li>
            <li> My wife thought it worked well but dried up her hair.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your color looking like you got an expensive professional hair job.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I waited after a few washes before I reviewed this product.</li>
            <li> Other shampoos would make my hair dull and darker.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the bottle was broken but the product really works for me</li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a week to make my hair look less brassy.</li>
            <li> but my roots have been looking a little copper lately</li>
            <li> if not more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for products</li>
            <li> At home we have really  hard  and treated water</li>
            <li> It  does leave your hair hard so get the matching treatment conditioner and use a leave in like matrix instacure after!</li>
            <li> It seems a little crazy to pay $12 for 6.8 ounces.</li>
            <li> The Naissant Treatment really keepy my hair from the brassiness that I HATE!</li>
            <li> because without it id have ugly orange hair sooner than the usual.</li>
            <li> but I wasted $13 :-(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> IT, YOU WONT GO WRONG.</li>
            <li> and it was very difficult...</li>
            <li> I hate when it starts to get orange.</li>
            <li> I hate yellow/gold tones in my blond hair</li>
            <li> lawd it made my roots even worse!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product for anyone with lightened or bleached hair.</li>

            <li> My wife thought it worked well but dried up her hair.</li>
            <li> Another fabulous product from Naissant! I originally bought this on a recommendation, and keep repurchasing. It does an amazing job of conditioning my hair and leaving it silky and in good shape. But it is also a wonderful toner for my color. My heavily lightened blond hair always seemed to get really brassy quickly especially at the roots. But this product has been totally wonderful, and it actually does what it says, and tones my hair back to a silvery blonde (but still isn&#x27;t too ashy or &amp;#34;blueish&amp;#34;, which unfortunately many other toners do). The perfect product for lightened hair that you need to both condition and tone. A lot of other products claim to do both (but only really do one or the other). This one is a totally awesome and excellent conditioner and hair toner in one.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every \\&quot; purple\\&quot; shampoo and this is by far the best ! I dislike purple shampoos that leave your hair grey or silver like , as it can age you , and this one leaves your hair a beautiful beige even white tone if left longer with no ashy silver color! I have gold based hair with beige highlights that are heavy and tend to change brassy quickly, so this renews my hair and looks like I got it redone at the salon without changing my base which I love ! I get so many compliments when I use this at least 1-2x a week ! This product leaves your color looking like you got an expensive professional hair job. It  does leave your hair hard so get the matching treatment conditioner and use a leave in like matrix instacure after! You will love your true beige tone ! Very classy color , without aging your hair color ( I am 32) leave it on for 10-15 minutes for best results ! Love this stuff</li>
            <li> love this product. my high light were bright and left my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Worked very well. I typically have to tone my blonde hair every month or so from keeping my highlights looking brassy and this shampoo does it all- minus the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I used it the first time the other day, it helped brighten my highlights, did not dry out my hair the way other color enhance products have.  Got this recommendation from Sylvia \\&quot;ellebangs\\&quot; on YouTube. I&#x27;m so glad to have come across this because I have given up on finding ways to refresh the blondness, and this cost less than the Aveda line.  Once again, thanks Amazon, for carrying great products!</li>
            <li> I love this as it is the perfect color and the conditioner is great.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product after receiving underwhelming results from using the Ion brand of purple shampoo. So glad I made the switch! Even after my first use I could tell the Naissant shampoo was a huge improvement. My hair feels softer, healthier, and is keeping it&#x27;s blonde tone beautifully. Product is a little pricey for it&#x27;s size (wish they provided a larger option) but overall quality product for the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product very long, but from what I can tell so far, it is pretty good quality. I just wish the bottle was bigger. It seems a little crazy to pay $12 for 6.8 ounces. I have very very VERY long hair, so I use about 2 ounces every wash lol!</li>
            <li> Good for toning any brassiness out of hair without turning it too gray/ashy!</li>
            <li> Great product it works great.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Leaves my hair brass-free!! I will definitely repurchase</li>
            <li> This shampoo works wonders on my blonde hair! It&#x27;s a very vibrant and pigmented purple shampoo that really penetrates the hair strands to give it a beautifully toned blonde. And even better, it doesn&#x27;t dry the hair out like most purple shampoos have a tendency of doing.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I feel my hair is shinier and healthier since using this product. It helps bring out my best blonde, especially in these dull Northeast winters.</li>
            <li> I like the warmer tone this shampoo gives my blonde hair without brassiness.  It does seem to be a bit drying, but the naissant treatment makes it silky soft again.  I prefer this shampoo over most other toning shampoos.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does a good job at toning the hair and it smells great. I use it at least twice a week to make my hair look less brassy. Recommended for color treated hair that&#x27;s dark blonde to light blonde.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo. I have used many purple shampoos and this one is my favorite. It takes out the brassiness and makes my blonde hair beautiful.</li>
            <li> this is lovely shampoo, I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic for my treated blonde hair.  I use it once a week, and each tone I notice a difference in the time of my blonde color.  Takes out brassy tones but helps maintain brightness.  Also, this is more gentle on the hair than other toning shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Sadly didn&#x27;t notice much of a differencedifference!?</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair beautifully golden. My hair stylist recommend it and I&#x27;m glad he did because without it id have ugly orange hair sooner than the usual. Would recommend !</li>
            <li> Really rich purple pigment.  Leaves my hair very conditioned and soft :)</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this shampoo. Seller got shampoo out very quickly. Wish the cost wasn&#x27;t so high though. Would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The absolute BEST purple shampoo on the market, and believe me... I have used a lot! I have platinum blond hair that tends to show brassiness after two weeks of highlights. I use this once a week and my platinum color is restored. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or brittle. Thank you, Thank you for this combo!</li>
            <li> This is Fantastic- My hair is really responding well to this shampoo and the treatment conditioner. I have double processed highted hair and I use the shampoo/conditioner 2x a week to keep the brassy tones at bay until my next hair appointment. Leaves my hair in better condition that any other brand of shampoo/conditioners! My second review.. I can recommend this product enough!! Just wonderful!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews of many fashion bloggers, I was excited to try this toning shampoo on my lack-luster tresses. I have previously tried Shimmer Lights shampoo and didn&#x27;t like that it would quickly stain my hair lavender and purple and it took several washes to come out. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two months and love it. The first thing I noticed about the Naissant shampoo is that it smells lovely - no weird chemical smell here. The consistency is almost like a mix between traditional shampoo and a slippery gel. I really like the consistency and it feels very high quality. The shampoo does not really &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34;, which I am fine with, but I felt like I couldn&#x27;t be sure it was really distributing through my hair. I started adding it with a few drops of real shampoo so I could work up a lather and make sure all the hair was covered. The bottle recommends saturating the hair for 5-10, which I think is crucial. Any less time than this and you won&#x27;t really notice a big difference and you&#x27;re really not getting the maximum benefit from the product.  I don&#x27;t consider this a traditional &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; shampoo, so I use this in addition to my regular shampoo and conditioning routine. I did notice the shampoo left my hair a little dry, so a good conditioner after is highly recommended. With regular use of this product about 1-2 times a week, I&#x27;ve kept away the brassy and yellow tones in my level 9.5 hair. I highly recommend the shampoo and tell everyone I know to ditch their other purple bottle toner and to pick this up instead.</li>
            <li> Great product bit I got more use out of the treatment. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend, and it really does seem to keep her blonde from going brassy with regular use. Will be buying again when she runs out.</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo!! What a difference this makes!  My hair tends to get brassy pretty quickly and just one quick wash and I feel like I made a trip to the salon!  Hair looks fresh, shiny, bouncy, soft and bright!  What else can you want from a shampoo!! I will definitely repurchase this product!</li>
            <li> I have platinum blonde hair but my roots have been looking a little copper lately so I have did my research on how to fix it.  I seen all the awesome reviews on this shampoo and decided to give it a try......my experience wasnt that great. I received the product in two days which is great, the bottle was really small but i expected that, it smelt really good. I read the instructions and done exactly how it said to wash my hair...it turned my ends a beautiful white blond but it turned the roots of my hair a darker copper almost orange...it two toned my hair!!! I waited a few days and tried it again thinking I messed up the first time and lawd it made my roots even worse!!!!! I immediately called my stylist and got some help to fix it! My stylist has no idea why it did my hair that way and neither do I but I wasted $13 :-( maybe your experience will be better.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and the treatment and love them. Together they work great taking away the brassy tones from my hair. Will never be without it:)</li>
            <li> Bought this to keep my light blonde highlights from looking brassy. It does that job well, plus cleanses the hair and scalp. Nice foam and fragrance. It leaves my hair soft and not overly dry. I prefer it to the Jon Freida shampoos. I will repurchase and do recommend.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing..be sure to get the shampoo and the treatment for the best results!  The best purple shampoo n conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  ðŸ’—</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve religiously been using this shampoo to keep my blonde hair from turning brassy/yellow &amp; it&#x27;s been working wonders! It keeps my hair looking salon fresh. I always get compliments. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my replacement for when I don&#x27;t use Shimmer Lights. Don&#x27;t get me wrong Shimmer Lights works wonders but Naissant actually leaves my hair feeling softer and smells better.&lt;br /&gt;Naissant prevents my blonde hair from looking too brassy. It works wonders and I highly recommend if you&#x27;re on the fence on whether you should try it or not. If you love Shimmer Lights or Sally&#x27;s store brand then you&#x27;ll also love Naissant... if not more.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders! i was able to get all the brassy tone out of my hair I was extremely pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I am loving this shampoo and the other products this brand offers.  I have long, color treated hair that is fine.  This shampoo is great to use once  a week to remove brassiness from blonde hair.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny - love it. Also use the Treatment Blonde Pearle with it and the Argan Oil.  Makes hair so pretty... a must have for me.</li>
            <li> This review has been a time coming, I received this product with fast shipping, I have very bleached and damaged hair, this product was very good for my hair, it made it soft and feel not so thin and dry. I had heard about this product from youtubers I watch one is a stylist with blonde hair such as Mine and she raved about it, so I had to give it a go, I am very happy with this product, I have tried all brands of hair product, I love this. The price is great, the shipping is fast and it works. Thumbs up</li>
            <li> A great product to use to tone down brassiness in hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked really well.  I am not platinum blond but my color can fade a little toward the end of my coloring before I go back in and get it colored again.  I can use this shampoo to tide me over until I go back again.  It freshens it up and makes it appear brighter.  The smell is very nice.  I have to use a lot however and do wish that it I could use less to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it! Will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> Love it! Great shampoo and it really brightens up my highlights. Way way better than John Freida.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product. Don&#x27;t need a whole lot, so it goes a long way, and even my hair dresser made a comment as to how much more my hair is showing the blond highlights. Being a natural blond, it is hard to realize that as you get older, your hair gets darker, but this has made me even feel younger, if that is possible.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really helped take the orange out of my hair. I&#x27;ve been going blonder each time I go to the salon and due to the red undertones in my hair my hair always comes out orange at the ends. This along with the toner really helped my hair get that blonde I wanted for the summer.</li>
            <li> Does a decent job of toning the brassiness that can sometimes accompany blonde highlights. Pleasantly scented.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo and found it similar to a few other blonde shampoo&#x27;s that i have purchased in the past,  the shampoo is purple in color and helps to alleviate brassiness that can sometimes occur when we get our hair highlighted or dyed blond.</li>
            <li> This works in one shampoo.  Product is very purple. Leaves my hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best purple toning shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Absolutely amazing and I would definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  It revives and prolongs my color, and makes my hair much more manageable.  I will be definitely continue to use this product,</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every single purple toning shampoo available and Naissant is the best! It left my hair looking very natural and soft plus it smells great.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  Been using it for 3 weeks or so.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just received my bottle of Naissant shampoo today &amp; used it this evening. So far I like it and it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t seem drying. I was using Shimmering Lights by Clairol and I can already tell I am going to like this product much better. I got the suggestion from Elle Bangs, Love Her, &amp; I also purchased the Naissant Coconut Elixir and love it and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I love this product is the only one who doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry and at the same time it remove those hideous brassy tones, protecting my color for more time &#x3D;).&lt;br /&gt;PD. Smell Awesome</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for products but I truly believe this product is worth it. I have been using this shampoo for over 6 months now and it is the only shampoo that actually tones my hair to a light white pearl blonde color. If you leave on your hair for 30 seconds and do a quick rinse you shouldn&#x27;t get any purple tints however if you leave it on to long it will tint purple but that does wash out. Highly recommend if you want to achieve that white &amp;#34;pearl&amp;#34; blonde.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!!! it definitely worked. got most, if not all, brassy color out. I do reccomend :)</li>
            <li> I have used lots of different toner shampoos and in my opinion this is the best to day! Leave my hair shiny and just the right amount of tone I love!</li>
            <li> This is the best toning shampoo I have used.  It deposits a more natural beige blond while vanquishing&lt;br /&gt;brassiness, not a dull ashy color.  It leaves a nice shine to the hair as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my girl friend a few weeks back... she loves it! Liked it so much she asked if I could get more for her. She says it helps her retain her color much, much longer than her old shampoo did. I guess she knows what she is talking about... from my side, all I can say is her hair looks simply amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I dye my hair blond about every two months. I hate when it starts to get orange. This is the best shampoo that I&#x27;ve found to keep my hair blond between dye jobs. I use this shampoo and the treatment about twice a week. I&#x27;m a nurse, so I like to wash my hair every day after work. I don&#x27;t always use this, but I keep it in the rotation.</li>
            <li> Works great for toning yellow and orange tones in blonde hair. Better then AGs silver shampoo and Clairols shimmer lights.</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo. Does what it claims to do,</li>
            <li> Good product. Does work well for blonde hair. It is pricey especially for the size of the bottle. It does not make hair feel dry or brittle like alot of other blonde shampoos do so i appreciate that. The product was shipped and received quickly</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo that would keep my blonde hair from dulling over the summer, and this shampoo did more than expected. I&#x27;d used shimmering lights before, but I felt like it took a long time for it to have any effect on my hair. The Naissant shampoo works instantly. It is purple in color and thick enough to coat and stay in your hair. After the first shampoo, my highlights looked salon bright. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now on alternating days, and my hair color still looks salon fresh. I would definitely recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product is magic! I&#x27;ve tried almost every brand available for color treated hair and none of them have left my hair so beautiful like Naissant! My hair is softer shinier and looks really healthy. I even got compliments at work. I recommend this product for every girl that has has highlights or blonde hair and needs a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip away the color. But it... You won&#x27;t regret it..</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo - I went from black to blond in half a year with bleaching and lightening (basically torturing) my hair and of course the yellow brassy color will start to show once hair dye wears off after several weeks and I use this shampoo to even out the color. The best part is that it does not make my hair grey or green as most toners will with my hair. It looks very natural and I love the results. Sometimes it actually lightens my hair but maybe it&#x27;s just the color difference that I see...either way great product and great quality. worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This product works! I love that my hair feels soft and nourished after use.</li>
            <li> I thought the product did well</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling clean and silky smooth once blow dried. Love the scent, got many compliments on that!  Will definitely buy again.  Wish it came in a larger size!</li>
            <li> Great for keeping blond blond...not yellow or brassy.  Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  I did a LOT of research before buying a purple shampoo to offset some brassiness in my blonde hair and this product really lived up to all the other positive reviews! It has left my hair with incredible depth and shine and has lasted many shampoos. I started off using once a day until i achieved the hue I was going for and now use just once a week to keep optimum color! I will stick with this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried every single toning shampoo out there and nothing has worked as great as Naissant!! Not only does it do the job but also leaves my hair feeling super soft and silky following the conditioner treatment. It really brings your hair color back to life making it look like you just stepped out of the salon. AMAZING PRODUCT, HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I have to start saying that  I pronounce myself as a fan of Naissant products. Its been so convenient for me to find these products via Amazon.&lt;br /&gt; I looked for it in many places and finally I ordered it from Amazon and absolutely fell in love with it . My hair is so beautiful now. It is shinny, silver and feels thicker. Keeps my color treated  hair light blonde, and really helps to keep my color looking fresh and new in between salon visits! At home we have really  hard  and treated water and this product keeps the blonde color light without looking brassy or orange, I spend a lot of money and time looking for a product that would help me with this and it was very difficult...It has  been very convenient for me to have found this product and it has  been equally helpful so I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mom, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice her hair! Due to her age and coloring its been looking pretty dull! So I went ahead and bought it for my as a gift! And let me tell you she&#x27;s loving it! She said she&#x27;s noticed great shine to her hair now! This product made my mom happy! Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. A friend of mine recommended it to me because I have a lot of issues with my blonde colored hair starting to fade after a couple washes. I started using this product and I can immediately see a huge difference in my blonde tones and how vibrant they looked. I also noticed that I don&#x27;t need to bleach my highlights so often either; so in a way the product is actually preventing my hair from additional damage. I will def be purchasing some more when I start running low :)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do very much for my hair except make it drier.</li>
            <li> Makes blonde color-treated hair feel so good.</li>
            <li> Love it but don&#x27;t leave it on too long since this gives a great tone FAST and STRONG.  Smells great and makes your hair feels so soft</li>
            <li> No problems with shipping at all. Arrived in the time frame they said it was. As for the product itself? I have only used it twice. It seems to really brighten my hair.  I was hoping it would deposit a bit more toning and more of a beige hue as it says it does.  But, it makes my hair very soft and does give my hair a boost. If you are wondering if you should try it; i would say yes!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the bottle was broken but the product really works for me</li>
            <li> Best that I have tried yet!  I really like it.  It seems to leave my hair in a conditioned state.</li>
            <li> Fast delivered. Easy to use container, good description, efficient, pleasant smell. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used many purple shampoos and this by far is the best I have used.  It leaves a very nice beige blonde color.  You need to leave in on for 3-5 minutes to get the best result.  I use this about once a week. For reference, I wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and treatment together. It definitely tones down the brassy tomes of my color treated light blonde hair. The treatment smells really nice and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE ITS PROVEN THAT IT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERSONALLY IT REAFFIRMS AND KEEPS MY COLOR FOR WEEKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WITH ALL THE VITAMINES AND OILS, I FEEL FRESH EVERY DAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL DEFIANTLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT, YOU WONT GO WRONG.</li>
            <li> Great shipping and packaging! The product got here very fast! I bought this shampoo for my 11 year old daughter and she loved it. Her hair looks more vibrant and shiny. I would definitely recommend this product and will continue to buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo/conditioner for blonde hair on the market, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because I recently went blonde and I wanted something to make my hair not so brassy in between trips to the salon. This stuff works like a charm. It doesn&#x27;t Sud much, so don&#x27;t freak out and you don&#x27;t have to use much either. It does make your hair feel super cleansed afterward. Just make sure to use a good deep conditioner afterwards. Which you should anyway if you dyed your hair blonde. But. It definitely does the job nontheless, it only takes a little, and  I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I waited after a few washes before I reviewed this product. This shampoo is far better than Shimmer Lights.Makes my hair soft and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I got this after watching a YT video of a hair &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; raving over this product. This did not help what so ever with toning down the yellowish tone of my hair. It&#x27;s also EXTREMELY drying so use only with a deep conditioning mask, otherwise your hair will become very brittle &amp; start breaking. This is a terrible product for anyone with lightened or bleached hair.</li>
            <li> I used this product after watching Kelly Strack use it on her golden blonde Bellami hair extensions to change them from gold to more beige to match her real hair.  I followed her guidance buy ordering this and the moisturizing conditioner treatment and she was right -- this product is awesome and got the job done! Great price, great smell, and wonderful shampoo all around!</li>
            <li> I finally found a shampoo that would maintain my highlights!! Other shampoos would make my hair dull and darker. I used this product and noticed a significant improvement within the first week. I&#x27;ve used numerious products, recommended by my hair stylist and nothing works better that Blond Pearl. My hair is soft, and silky even after being treated with all the chemicals I put in it. i recomended to anyone with treated hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this a few months back and loved it! Worked Great on my blonde highlights!</li>
            <li> The Naissant Treatment really keepy my hair from the brassiness that I HATE! It reasonably priced than other products on the market. I like the smell of this better than the shimmer lights purple shampoo! If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable purple shampoo and treatment, I definitely recommend this one!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Takes brassiness out of my hair without leaving it dry. Leaves hair soft and smelling great!</li>
            <li> Awesome for toning hair! I hate yellow/gold tones in my blond hair and this works great taking those out.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my usual ph shampoo, so I decided to try a new one and Naissant is awesome. When I saw my hair blown out after my first shampoo I could already see that my highlights were less yellow and more platinum blonde. I continue to use it every time I shampoo because my boyfriend told me he loves the smell and I love that it costs less than what my other shampoo did even with shipping!!!</li>
