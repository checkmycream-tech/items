            <li>I purchased these gloves with a great deal of skepticism.  </li>
            <li>These were as described and work great</li>
            <li>These are good gloves for moisturizing your hands overnight.</li>
            <li>Good quality cotton</li>
            <li>so I turned to Amazon, and based on the customer reviews, these seemed like a fairly good item for a fairly good price.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Good stretch and size- on me</li>
            <li>These are good but don&#x27;t wash well.</li>

            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the quality of these cotton gloves.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased</li>
            <li>I use the Thermal Spa Mitts to warm my hands, and I discovered that I can add moisturizer and put these on, then put on the mitts</li>
            <li>to use at night, after putting on lotion, does make my hands nice and moiste in the morning, however, one glove seems to always come off by the morning,but i till like them.</li>
            <li>it is a good idea, didn&#x27;t love the material but it works if you need to keep your hands with some kind of hand cream</li>
            <li>It is very easy to shop on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The weight and size are excellent-wash nicely and I will probably purchase more</li>
            <li>(The kind you would put on your daughter with her cute easter dress).</li>
            <li>I bought these gloves because I urgently needed another pair of moisture gloves: the nice ones I got from Bath &amp; Body Works (years ago, I&#x27;m sure for more than $6)</li>
            <li>Therefore, very comfortable for sleeping.  </li>
            <li>My hands are looking better.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>They are just okay</li>
            <li>Just ok.  </li>
            <li>They do not look like they would hold up to more than a couple of hand washings at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just thought to look more closely today</li>
            <li>OK, but have better gloves to help my health recovery.</li>
            <li>SURE I GOT THE &amp;#34;REAL&amp;#34; SPA SISTER PRODUCT&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off putting socks on your hands.</li>
            <li>Love these guys.</li>
            <li>$2 bucks is a better price for this product.</li>
            <li>So glad I use the gloves.  </li>
            <li>I apply Egyptian Magic cream to my eyes and finger tips.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t completely sure.</li>
            <li>and they are flimsy a sock woudl be better</li>
            <li>In the morning, my hands are so much better.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many of the moisturizers out there.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE these gloves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>How many of us are allergic to spandex????  </li>
            <li>Once the hand cream is applied, they fit nicely.  </li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>These are very comfortable to sleep in and easy to take on and off.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure these don&#x27;t fit most hand sizes.</li>
            <li>These are cheaply made and can not cost more than $.25.  </li>
            <li>I wear them for hours at a time without noticing I have them on, so I imagine they would be easy to sleep in.</li>
            <li>These gloves are lightweight, unobtrusive, and easy to sleep in.</li>
            <li>So, I washed a pair in hot water in the washing machine with towels, underwear etc., and put them in the dryer, as I do with all that kind of clothes.  </li>
            <li>These are wonderful when using my Kindle to keep those prints off the dark screen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fine cotton gloves but $11 for one pair??</li>
            <li>they work fine.  </li>
            <li>and they come out of the laundry just fine.</li>
            <li>just fine.  </li>
            <li>stretch out too quick, and don&#x27;t stay on, ok for sleeping.</li>
            <li>but they are stretch anyway and fit just fine.  </li>
            <li>They fit my fingers</li>
            <li>Cheap material for the price.</li>
            <li>Cheap material, they do not stay on.</li>
            <li>Cheap cotton gloves.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, stretches out.</li>
            <li>I have medium sized hands and they fit well.  </li>
            <li>But, if they fit you, they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li>and my hands are not only warm but nice and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are worth it!</li>
            <li>Clean, neat packaging.  </li>
            <li>I most certainly would.</li>
            <li>I needed them because I want to use them overnight when I put special moisturizer on my hands.</li>
            <li>Overall, good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>gift for christmas, glad for fast arrival.  </li>
            <li>a bit loose after washing, but good cotton and light.</li>
            <li>Use when hands dry out to put on moisturizing cream and leave these on all night and a good price.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I needed to keep my hands moist at night since I suffer from excema on them!</li>
            <li>Very well made and comfortable for overnight use.  </li>
            <li>So on the rare times that I wear hosiery, I worry about pulling snags, etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the time and money to go buy them retail at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all right</li>
            <li>right away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They never seem to really get clean.</li>
            <li>Soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>arrived very fast.  </li>
            <li>These gloves shrunk significantly in the wash, especially between the thumb and index finger and are no longer comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>slightly stretchy material, solid cotton, feel good on my hands,  What more can I say, they are gloves</li>
            <li>The picture and description led me to believe these were of a lot higher quality.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what they describe and it is working.</li>
            <li>They were a gift and my wife has enjoyed  them and when they need replacing, we will be back for more.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and delivered on  time.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy  more.</li>
            <li>theyneeded more obvious packing</li>
            <li>They keep their shape and don&#x27;t make your hands fell hot like gloves with Lycra do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had much better moisture gloves for the same price.</li>
            <li>These gloves are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My son was aware of moisture gloves and socks and sent some.</li>
            <li>One size fits most, if you have tiny hands.</li>
            <li>Only downside is they lose their shape at the wrist after a use or two, but still usable and economical and save your bedding from becoming stained with lotions/oils.</li>
            <li>She has larger than average hands and the fit was good.</li>
            <li>The next morning, my hands had lost much of the roughness and many of the cracks.  </li>
            <li>These glove fit well, I have smaller hands and most gloves are too big.</li>
            <li>I bought these for a gift for my daughter for  Christmas and she loved them since her hands were very dried out.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t have large hands at all.</li>
            <li>I have large hands.  </li>
            <li>For that price I expected more than one pair even though it didn&#x27;t say so.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper at walgreens.</li>
            <li>In the winter I go through them really fast</li>
            <li>so i could see them on the very bottom of the box.</li>
            <li>Much prefer the spa socks from Spa Sister.</li>
            <li>She said they work really well</li>
            <li>She gently hand washed it twice now, and that doesn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li>I am very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>I admit, I don&#x27;t wear them every night like your suppose to, but when I do put lotion on and wear them, I really like them.  </li>
            <li>I have allergies and they are very helpful when I have to avoid allergens.</li>
            <li>OK not what I expected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these gloves!  </li>
            <li>but they are thick and of good quality.  </li>
            <li>Cloth had a funny smell when new</li>
            <li>you first put them on, they seem huge and loose.  </li>
            <li>They do the job but the other ones I bought from ulta were more reliable</li>
            <li>Not white, but clean.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and these are a Godsend!</li>
            <li>Even though I could have gotten less expensive ones, $5 seemed reasonable, and the fit was very good.</li>
            <li>They also are loose around the wrists, when I would prefer a bit of a tighter fit.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Too large for my 13 year old</li>
            <li>The only good thing was the free shipping, the item itself is useless.</li>
            <li>Everyone should own at least one pair.</li>
            <li>I have relatively small hands and these fit great, potentially small though for those with bigger hands.</li>
            <li>With the help of a very thick hand creme and these gloves, I finally have hands I can be proud of.</li>
            <li>I received this item new.</li>
            <li>but they dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to see them.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that they don&#x27;t really fit, they are definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>My hands are average sized and they just fit.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for - 100% cotton white gloves.  </li>
            <li>Soft hands once again!  </li>
            <li>I had someone with a larger hand try them on and they stretched to easily fit those hands too.  </li>
            <li>The gloves came out fine, shrunk a little</li>
            <li>Product came in clear plastic bag, not in packaging shown on Amazon&#x27;s website.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Complete junk.  </li>
            <li>It will help my hands out and get them soft again.</li>
            <li>Buy yourself some cheap $.99 winter gloves from the dollar store before you waste your money on these.</li>
            <li>So far, NO tearing of the fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Helps the old fingers grasp things.  </li>
            <li>So far they protect my  hands well.</li>
            <li>I have a small hand but these work fine.  </li>
            <li>My main concern was that they would be heavy or clumsy, but they fit like a second skin, are lightweight, grip well, and are extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li>After I wash them, I air dry them so they don&#x27;t shrink too much.</li>
            <li>They fit my hands now, but they&#x27;re so short around my wrists that I have trouble keeping them on.</li>
            <li>Wife wore it for a week and the tightness around the wrist became much too loose</li>
            <li>I can easily pick things up with these on, such as coins, small items.  </li>
            <li>Not sure they do anything special for moisturizing purposes though.</li>
            <li>being said, the quality of these particular gloves is not very high in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>They work great, and think I may have overcome my bad habit....</li>
            <li>clear bag the same size as the gloves.</li>
            <li>I only use them 2 or 3 nights a week to maintain soft, moisturized hands.  </li>
            <li>I am 53 years old and my hands and arms are just starting to get brown age spots from the sun.  </li>
            <li>If I had small hands, I would wash them in hot water for some shrinkage as cotton normally shrinks a little when exposed to hot water.  </li>
            <li>Really short fingers and wide but short in the palms,  They don&#x27;t stay on very well at night.  </li>
            <li>The thumb was too short which meant that the entire glove barely covered my palm and the rest of my hand.</li>
            <li>They are way too thin and come apart at the seams easily.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have medium sized hands and they fit well.  </li>
            <li> But, if they fit you, they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li> and my hands are not only warm but nice and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are worth it!</li>
            <li> Clean, neat packaging.  </li>
            <li> I most certainly would.</li>
            <li> I needed them because I want to use them overnight when I put special moisturizer on my hands.</li>
            <li> Overall, good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> gift for christmas, glad for fast arrival.  </li>
            <li> a bit loose after washing, but good cotton and light.</li>
            <li> Use when hands dry out to put on moisturizing cream and leave these on all night and a good price.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I needed to keep my hands moist at night since I suffer from excema on them!</li>
            <li> Very well made and comfortable for overnight use.  </li>
            <li> So on the rare times that I wear hosiery, I worry about pulling snags, etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the time and money to go buy them retail at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right</li>
            <li> right away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They never seem to really get clean.</li>
            <li> Soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> arrived very fast.  </li>
            <li> These gloves shrunk significantly in the wash, especially between the thumb and index finger and are no longer comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> slightly stretchy material, solid cotton, feel good on my hands,  What more can I say, they are gloves</li>
            <li> The picture and description led me to believe these were of a lot higher quality.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what they describe and it is working.</li>
            <li> They were a gift and my wife has enjoyed  them and when they need replacing, we will be back for more.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and delivered on  time.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy  more.</li>
            <li> theyneeded more obvious packing</li>
            <li> They keep their shape and don&#x27;t make your hands fell hot like gloves with Lycra do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had much better moisture gloves for the same price.</li>
            <li> These gloves are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My son was aware of moisture gloves and socks and sent some.</li>
            <li> One size fits most, if you have tiny hands.</li>
            <li> Only downside is they lose their shape at the wrist after a use or two, but still usable and economical and save your bedding from becoming stained with lotions/oils.</li>
            <li> She has larger than average hands and the fit was good.</li>
            <li> The next morning, my hands had lost much of the roughness and many of the cracks.  </li>
            <li> These glove fit well, I have smaller hands and most gloves are too big.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a gift for my daughter for  Christmas and she loved them since her hands were very dried out.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have large hands at all.</li>
            <li> I have large hands.  </li>
            <li> For that price I expected more than one pair even though it didn&#x27;t say so.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper at walgreens.</li>
            <li> In the winter I go through them really fast</li>
            <li> so i could see them on the very bottom of the box.</li>
            <li> Much prefer the spa socks from Spa Sister.</li>
            <li> She said they work really well</li>
            <li> She gently hand washed it twice now, and that doesn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I admit, I don&#x27;t wear them every night like your suppose to, but when I do put lotion on and wear them, I really like them.  </li>
            <li> I have allergies and they are very helpful when I have to avoid allergens.</li>
            <li> OK not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these gloves!  </li>
            <li> but they are thick and of good quality.  </li>
            <li> Cloth had a funny smell when new</li>
            <li> you first put them on, they seem huge and loose.  </li>
            <li> They do the job but the other ones I bought from ulta were more reliable</li>
            <li> Not white, but clean.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and these are a Godsend!</li>
            <li> Even though I could have gotten less expensive ones, $5 seemed reasonable, and the fit was very good.</li>
            <li> They also are loose around the wrists, when I would prefer a bit of a tighter fit.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Too large for my 13 year old</li>
            <li> The only good thing was the free shipping, the item itself is useless.</li>
            <li> Everyone should own at least one pair.</li>
            <li> I have relatively small hands and these fit great, potentially small though for those with bigger hands.</li>
            <li> With the help of a very thick hand creme and these gloves, I finally have hands I can be proud of.</li>
            <li> I received this item new.</li>
            <li> but they dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see them.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that they don&#x27;t really fit, they are definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> My hands are average sized and they just fit.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for - 100% cotton white gloves.  </li>
            <li> Soft hands once again!  </li>
            <li> I had someone with a larger hand try them on and they stretched to easily fit those hands too.  </li>
            <li> The gloves came out fine, shrunk a little</li>
            <li> Product came in clear plastic bag, not in packaging shown on Amazon&#x27;s website.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Complete junk.  </li>
            <li> It will help my hands out and get them soft again.</li>
            <li> Buy yourself some cheap $.99 winter gloves from the dollar store before you waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> So far, NO tearing of the fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps the old fingers grasp things.  </li>
            <li> So far they protect my  hands well.</li>
            <li> I have a small hand but these work fine.  </li>
            <li> My main concern was that they would be heavy or clumsy, but they fit like a second skin, are lightweight, grip well, and are extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li> After I wash them, I air dry them so they don&#x27;t shrink too much.</li>
            <li> They fit my hands now, but they&#x27;re so short around my wrists that I have trouble keeping them on.</li>
            <li> Wife wore it for a week and the tightness around the wrist became much too loose</li>
            <li> I can easily pick things up with these on, such as coins, small items.  </li>
            <li> Not sure they do anything special for moisturizing purposes though.</li>
            <li> being said, the quality of these particular gloves is not very high in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> They work great, and think I may have overcome my bad habit....</li>
            <li> clear bag the same size as the gloves.</li>
            <li> I only use them 2 or 3 nights a week to maintain soft, moisturized hands.  </li>
            <li> I am 53 years old and my hands and arms are just starting to get brown age spots from the sun.  </li>
            <li> If I had small hands, I would wash them in hot water for some shrinkage as cotton normally shrinks a little when exposed to hot water.  </li>
            <li> Really short fingers and wide but short in the palms,  They don&#x27;t stay on very well at night.  </li>
            <li> The thumb was too short which meant that the entire glove barely covered my palm and the rest of my hand.</li>
            <li> They are way too thin and come apart at the seams easily.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine they hold any significant amount of moisture overnight since it seems like they are too thin.</li>
            <li> These gloves were very hard to get on and off with product on your hands and they also seem to get stretched out quickly from the pulling on/off.</li>
            <li> and she wears them every night and notices a difference in her hands, especially during dry winter months.</li>
            <li> These gloves are of low quality, the fabric is very thin and even though they fit my hand they won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> In an effort to try not to look so old, I wear these little gloves while driving.  </li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> They stretched out IMMEDIATELY.  </li>
            <li> after three uses, all stretched out.</li>
            <li> and I normally wear a size small fitted glove.</li>
            <li> Stretched out and have a hole after a week.</li>
            <li> They arrived and were very very thin, and barely fit.</li>
            <li> Every winter I have dry, cracked cuticles that wind up bleeding.</li>
            <li> Helps moisturize dry hands.</li>
            <li> I bought these for NE winter when you house can get dry from the heat and lack of humidity.  </li>
            <li> They machine wash and dry</li>
            <li> My only wish is that they would last longer by being just a little thicker fabric, otherwise exactly as expected</li>
            <li> The gloves were packaged in a clear zip baggie, not appropriate as a gift.</li>
            <li> The minute I put them on, I felt like my joints were constricted and the space between fingers was far too small.</li>
            <li> The wrist part is a bit loose</li>
            <li> The Overnight moisturizing glove did not fit me and they were way to small for my large hands.</li>
            <li> My only criticism of these gloves is that if you are long fingered, they may not fit you.</li>
            <li> My hands are very dry.  </li>
            <li> As with the overnight socks, my hands were so very dry and ruff, I applied lotion, put the gloves on and wore them to bed.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> My only complaint is they are difficult to clean and harbor a residue from whatever lotion your using, so the need to replace often is present.</li>
            <li> The fingers are too tight, the fingers are too short and they do not come to the end of my hand.  </li>
            <li> Just wish they were a little longer and larger.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and they are snug and barely come to my wrists.</li>
            <li> My hands are naturally rough from working around the house and outdoors.  </li>
            <li> This product was not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my 60&#x27;s with extremely rough hands.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I wear them out, so I&#x27;m not sure these will last very long.</li>
            <li> Fits good,though my hands are not large.</li>
            <li> I received a pair of plain white gloves that you could buy anywhere that sells clothing.</li>
            <li> My hands are a little bigger than average</li>
            <li> These were for my wife who has extremely cracked skin on her hands during the winter.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly bad qualit,  actually,  Which I never expected possible with a simple pair of cotton gloves.</li>
            <li> I got a bad allergy on my hands and need to keep Vaseline on them at night and this works fine.</li>
            <li> I was really ticked when the gloves arrived and the washing instructions were to \\&quot;wash in cold water and lay flat to dry\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> and the wrist opening is too large and does not sit snug on the skin/wrist, therefore making these gloves useless to protect the wrists over night wear.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, short, and overall just terrible.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Not true, I am 6&#x27; tall with average hands.  </li>
            <li> I dye them black or brown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them for a few days and already feel the difference on my poor dry hands.</li>
            <li> When his hands are bad, he &amp;#34;lathers up&amp;#34; with his special hand cream and then puts on the gloves for the night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using moisture gloves for at least 15 years and they have never gotten so stretched out that they fell off during sleep.  </li>
            <li> It says &amp;#34;One size fits most&amp;#34;, but these things are too tight even to make a fist with your hands</li>
            <li> The fingers feel tight but stretch a bit.  </li>
            <li> I suppose they need to be tight to do the work.  </li>
            <li> The gloves are as expected, but a little small.  </li>
            <li> One size fits all is a little misleading.</li>
            <li> They were inexpensive and you do need a lot of them if you are serious about getting those dry hands some moisture.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I am missing something.</li>
            <li> TO GIVE SUCH POOR RATING WHEN I AM NOT</li>
            <li> I use them at night when I put heavy ointment on my hands.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, in our opinion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on them at all and maybe try going to a drug store.</li>
            <li> They were thin and the fingers were all the same length.</li>
            <li> They were too thin and do not fit properly.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly, but as soon as I put them on, I was utterly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The gloves are a little small for my hands.  </li>
            <li> I bought them for my 12 year old grandaughter and they were too small and very thin.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased with the quality control.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and these gloves are small.  </li>
            <li> (And I don&#x27;t have small hands).   </li>
            <li> and these are too small.  </li>
            <li> The side runs small.</li>
            <li> Just what we needed and were unable to find locally!</li>
            <li> they are small on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no size option.</li>
            <li> These are small gloves</li>
            <li> Too small for my hand.</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;3 and 135 lbs, and the gloves are way too small for me</li>
            <li> They are snug and I have really small hands.</li>
            <li> However, they were way to small for my hands.</li>
            <li> I used my usual hypo-allergenic hand cream and put on these gloves at bedtime.  </li>
            <li> A bit small for one size fits all</li>
            <li> They are saving my poor fingers from winter&#x27;s dry air!!</li>
            <li> These gloves are thin thin thin, with very long fingers and a very tiny palm.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and the gloves are too big and the material is very thin.  </li>
            <li> These gloves are a little thin</li>
            <li> They were very thin and have loose threads hanging off.</li>
            <li> They are not nearly as nice as the ones pictured either.</li>
            <li> My husband is a diabetic whose fingers and hands dry and crack in cold weather.</li>
            <li> but I imagine it would be uncomfortable to sleep with a tight wrist.  </li>
            <li> So tight!!!</li>
            <li> were all gooky from my eczema hand cream (since my hands are the worst right now that they have ever been)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The gloves are poorly made.</li>
            <li> I put creams on my hands to sleep and the cream immediately comes through because they are so thin.  </li>
            <li> Thin fabric with no elasticity.</li>
            <li> thin, &amp;#34;made out of a cotton t-shirt&amp;#34; material. will not buy again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s irritating since I wear these almost every night with medicine underneath to help with my hand ezcema.</li>
            <li> I wore these at night for approximately 1 week with my hand creme and my hands look like \\&quot;people\\&quot; hands again, not like scratchy alligator skin.  </li>
            <li> , the material is thin.  </li>
            <li> Fits well, but was broken</li>
            <li> They are just too thin....</li>
            <li> I have not worn them yet to see if they stay on all night, as they are useless for what I need them for.</li>
            <li> Sorry I got them.</li>
            <li> Felt silly once I realized that.</li>
            <li> These are lousy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very poor quality, could see threading coming out thru the bag.</li>
            <li> However, the stitches were already coming apart and the material is very thin.</li>
            <li> Very very thin.</li>
            <li> The material is VERY thin to the point of seeing through them.</li>

            <li> Very thin material.</li>
            <li> Very thin.</li>
            <li> When his hands also seemed cold, I suggested gloves.</li>
            <li> It can be painful because you&#x27;re always using your hands.  </li>
            <li> She was really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This is a very bad product and for $7</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ashamed to admit I have a very bad habit of nibbling my fingernails when I drive sometimes, so got these to put on when I drive so that can&#x27;t do it.  </li>
            <li> These gloves are terrible.  </li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t first/stretch correctly. Wouldn&#x27;t even stay on. Amazingly bad qualit,  actually,  Which I never expected possible with a simple pair of cotton gloves. Strange. Maybe I am missing something.</li>
            <li> The picture and description led me to believe these were of a lot higher quality. They arrived and were very very thin, and barely fit. I can&#x27;t imagine they hold any significant amount of moisture overnight since it seems like they are too thin. Despite the fact that they don&#x27;t really fit, they are definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with the quality control. Seams were open in several spots and flimsy material.</li>
            <li> The thumb was too short which meant that the entire glove barely covered my palm and the rest of my hand.</li>
            <li> These glove fit well, I have smaller hands and most gloves are too big. My daughter and I can already notice the difference</li>
            <li> The weight and size are excellent-wash nicely and I will probably purchase more next winter-hope that doesn&#x27;t come for awhile!</li>
            <li> After using for one nite, the wrists rolled and the gloves wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> These are good gloves for moisturizing your hands overnight. I have relatively small hands and these fit great, potentially small though for those with bigger hands. My only complaint is they are difficult to clean and harbor a residue from whatever lotion your using, so the need to replace often is present. Unless that doesn&#x27;t bother you!</li>
            <li> stretch out too quick, and don&#x27;t stay on, ok for sleeping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right and I don&#x27;t use them anymore because I cannot sleep in them.  When I am awake, my hands cannot stop working for a second.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what they describe and it is working. My hands are looking better. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have only worn these gloves 3 times and they are already splitting at the seams in between my fingers.</li>
            <li> I use the gloves to moisturize my hand overnight and I already see a difference. I live in the desert and these are a Godsend!</li>
            <li> fine cotton gloves but $11 for one pair??? For that price I expected more than one pair even though it didn&#x27;t say so. WOW!</li>
            <li> Every winter I have dry, cracked cuticles that wind up bleeding. With the help of a very thick hand creme and these gloves, I finally have hands I can be proud of. My only criticism of these gloves is that if you are long fingered, they may not fit you. My hands are average sized and they just fit. They also are loose around the wrists, when I would prefer a bit of a tighter fit. Overall, good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> These have been great for my hands at night since I have cracked bleeding hands!!</li>
            <li> I have small hands and these gloves are small.  They fit my fingers okay but the fabric doesn&#x27;t cover my entire palm.  They are just okay, wish I had purchased something else though.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for - 100% cotton white gloves.  I moisturize my hands at night and put the gloves on.  After 30 minutes I take them off and my hands feel great!  Helps moisturize dry hands.</li>
            <li> a bit loose after washing, but good cotton and light.</li>
            <li> I have Raynauds syndrome and I use these gloves to help keep my fingers covered. They make great glove liners. I dye them black or brown. These gloves are great while typing.</li>
            <li> Too large for my 13 year old</li>
            <li> Good quality cotton but they stretch out and the length shrunk.</li>
            <li> I bought these gloves because I urgently needed another pair of moisture gloves: the nice ones I got from Bath &amp; Body Works (years ago, I&#x27;m sure for more than $6) were all gooky from my eczema hand cream (since my hands are the worst right now that they have ever been) and I needed another pair in the rotation.  I could not find any moisture gloves in my local drugstore so I turned to Amazon, and based on the customer reviews, these seemed like a fairly good item for a fairly good price.  I bought two pairs.  They arrived quickly, but as soon as I put them on, I was utterly disappointed.  They stretched out IMMEDIATELY.  They have no stretch, no spandex.  They actually FELL off my hands while I slept.  I&#x27;ve been using moisture gloves for at least 15 years and they have never gotten so stretched out that they fell off during sleep.  And for $6 a pop?  Please.  For $2 it might be a different story.  Never again.</li>
            <li> Just ok.  Soaked through and all over my sheets, but I was using coconut oil not lotion</li>
            <li> I was really ticked when the gloves arrived and the washing instructions were to \\&quot;wash in cold water and lay flat to dry\\&quot;.  So, I washed a pair in hot water in the washing machine with towels, underwear etc., and put them in the dryer, as I do with all that kind of clothes.  The gloves came out fine, shrunk a little but they are stretch anyway and fit just fine.  (And I don&#x27;t have small hands).   Peggy</li>
            <li> Will never buy these again. Much cheaper at walgreens. I could still scratch my hands while sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;I was embarrassed giving a pair as a gift</li>
            <li> Fits good,though my hands are not large. slightly stretchy material, solid cotton, feel good on my hands,  What more can I say, they are gloves</li>
            <li> I use the Thermal Spa Mitts to warm my hands, and I discovered that I can add moisturizer and put these on, then put on the mitts and my hands are not only warm but nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty well made for such short money too!</li>
            <li> They were a gift and my wife has enjoyed  them and when they need replacing, we will be back for more.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and delivered on  time.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of these cotton gloves.  Even though I could have gotten less expensive ones, $5 seemed reasonable, and the fit was very good.</li>
            <li> i had ordered these from avon years ago and they dont have them anymore but do they work if you put&lt;br /&gt;hand cream or vaseline on your hands and then wear them overnite</li>
            <li> I purchased these gloves not for moisturizing my hands, but to protect them when I&#x27;m driving or riding my bike in the sun. My main concern was that they would be heavy or clumsy, but they fit like a second skin, are lightweight, grip well, and are extremely comfortable. I wear them for hours at a time without noticing I have them on, so I imagine they would be easy to sleep in. They wash like a dream. Will definitely buy  more.</li>
            <li> These were for my wife who has extremely cracked skin on her hands during the winter.  When she remembers to put these on they improve her skin.  She puts lotion on her hands and then puts these gloves on and the gloves help keep the hands moisturized throughout the nite.  She has larger than average hands and the fit was good.</li>
            <li> These gloves are thin thin thin, with very long fingers and a very tiny palm. The minute I put them on, I felt like my joints were constricted and the space between fingers was far too small. Don&#x27;t bother with them. They wouldn&#x27;t last a washing, either.</li>
            <li> bought this product for my mom, who recently burn her hands.  she needed protection from the weather.  they work fine.  will by again</li>
            <li> These gloves were too short for me, but they do the job.  They were inexpensive and you do need a lot of them if you are serious about getting those dry hands some moisture.  In the winter I go through them really fast and they come out of the laundry just fine.</li>
            <li> The seller is great to work with.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the quality of these particular gloves is not very high in my opinion.  They are thin and cheaply made.  They do not look like they would hold up to more than a couple of hand washings at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the seller the fabric has been changed on the Spa Sister 100% cotton white gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller settled with me in a satisfactory manner.</li>
            <li> I bought these for NE winter when you house can get dry from the heat and lack of humidity.  My finger tips would crack, like a paper cut. It can be painful because you&#x27;re always using your hands.  At night before bed I would put lotion on my hands and then the gloves and sleep with them on.  It was the quickest way to heal dryness of hands and help with those paper cut finger tips.  The gloves are light weight, thin, and 100% cotton.</li>
            <li> I put vaseline on my hands then gloves for the night.  These gloves are a little thin but I think they will work for a while.</li>
            <li> I got a bad allergy on my hands and need to keep Vaseline on them at night and this works fine.</li>
            <li> they arrived in same pkg as boots so they werent noticed under all the package material. theyneeded more obvious packing so i could see them on the very bottom of the box. I just thought to look more closely today and there they were in. clear bag the same size as the gloves. i hope they stretch and soften after they r washed. But i found them so Alls well that ends well. The 3 stars r for the lack of packaging.</li>
            <li> Use when hands dry out to put on moisturizing cream and leave these on all night and a good price.</li>
            <li> Much prefer the spa socks from Spa Sister. These gloves were very hard to get on and off with product on your hands and they also seem to get stretched out quickly from the pulling on/off.</li>
            <li> OK, but have better gloves to help my health recovery. Still will keep them,</li>
            <li> Product came in clear plastic bag, not in packaging shown on Amazon&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;It was very poor quality, could see threading coming out thru the bag. Felt cheated and sent back right away.&lt;br /&gt;UNFAIR TO GIVE SUCH POOR RATING WHEN I AM NOT SURE I GOT THE &amp;#34;REAL&amp;#34; SPA SISTER PRODUCT&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The gloves are as expected, but a little small.  My hands are a little bigger than average and these are too small.  They work well though.</li>
            <li> to use at night, after putting on lotion, does make my hands nice and moiste in the morning, however, one glove seems to always come off by the morning,but i till like them.</li>
            <li> They are just as advertised.  They are nothing exceptional, but they do the job.  I&#x27;d buy them again.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a gift for my daughter for  Christmas and she loved them since her hands were very dried out.</li>
            <li> Cheap material for the price. Cloth had a funny smell when new</li>
            <li> These gloves are wonderful. You will need to rinse them after each use if you use lotion but they dry quickly. They keep their shape and don&#x27;t make your hands fell hot like gloves with Lycra do. I highly recommend them</li>
            <li> Threw them away as soon as I opened the package.. Complete junk.  You&#x27;d be better off putting socks on your hands.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter.  She said they work really well and she wears them every night and notices a difference in her hands, especially during dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I received this item new. However, the stitches were already coming apart and the material is very thin. I&#x27;ve had much better moisture gloves for the same price.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my 12 year old grandaughter and they were too small and very thin.  She was really disappointed.  Would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> The gloves are a little small for my hands.  I wear a size 7 ring.  They do work quite well.  I use them at night when I put heavy ointment on my hands.  Just wish they were a little longer and larger.</li>
            <li> These gloves are exactly what I was looking for. It is very easy to shop on Amazon. It saves me valuable time instead of having to go out and look for the products I want. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My only wish is that they would last longer by being just a little thicker fabric, otherwise exactly as expected</li>
            <li> My husband is a diabetic whose fingers and hands dry and crack in cold weather. When his hands also seemed cold, I suggested gloves. My son was aware of moisture gloves and socks and sent some. When we could not find them in local stores, we found these on Amazon and my husband likes them a lot. When his hands are bad, he &amp;#34;lathers up&amp;#34; with his special hand cream and then puts on the gloves for the night. While they do not cure the dryness and splits, they seem to help.</li>
            <li> The Overnight moisturizing glove did not fit me and they were way to small for my large hands.</li>
            <li> Cheap material, they do not stay on.</li>
            <li> These gloves are terrible.  They are way too thin and come apart at the seams easily.  Terrible product![[ASIN:B0002RYHTQ Spa Sister White Cotton Overnight Moisture Gloves]]</li>
            <li> This is a hugh ripoff.  They say one size fits all.  Not true, I am 6&#x27; tall with average hands.  The fingers are too tight, the fingers are too short and they do not come to the end of my hand.  These are cheaply made and can not cost more than $.25.  I am amazed that Amazon would represent this product.  Not with the effort to return them</li>
            <li> I would have given this item no stars at all, but there&#x27;s no option for that. The only good thing was the free shipping, the item itself is useless. This is a very bad product and for $7 it&#x27;s totally not worth the money. It says &amp;#34;One size fits most&amp;#34;, but these things are too tight even to make a fist with your hands and I&#x27;m sure these don&#x27;t fit most hand sizes. Don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li> These gloves were bought for treatment for eczema, so I could put an abundance of cream on wrists and hands then go to bed.  The wrist length is way too short  and the wrist opening is too large and does not sit snug on the skin/wrist, therefore making these gloves useless to protect the wrists over night wear.  Maybe if you just want cream on your finger tips and palms of the hands they might work for you, but you will not have any protection at all for your wrists.  I have not worn them yet to see if they stay on all night, as they are useless for what I need them for.</li>
            <li> These gloves shrunk significantly in the wash, especially between the thumb and index finger and are no longer comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, my husband likes these.</li>
            <li> The side runs small. I have small hands and they are snug and barely come to my wrists. I don&#x27;t recommend them if your hands are very big.</li>
            <li> My hands are very dry.  I put salve on before bed with these glove.  Helps the salve sink in to moisturize and heal. I feel you need to use these a lot to get the salve into and saturated by the gloves, before they are &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; moisturizing gloves.</li>
            <li> Not at all a quality glove. Wife wore it for a week and the tightness around the wrist became much too loose and it now comes off her at night. She gently hand washed it twice now, and that doesn&#x27;t help at all. We regret wasting outer money and have found similar at the Dollar Tree that have lasted for weeks now. Don&#x27;t waste your money, in our opinion.</li>
            <li> it is a good idea, didn&#x27;t love the material but it works if you need to keep your hands with some kind of hand cream</li>
            <li> They were too thin and do not fit properly.</li>
            <li> Just what we needed and were unable to find locally!</li>
            <li> I have a small hand but these work fine.  I had someone with a larger hand try them on and they stretched to easily fit those hands too.  The fingers feel tight but stretch a bit.  I suppose they need to be tight to do the work.  The wrist part is a bit loose but I imagine it would be uncomfortable to sleep with a tight wrist.  These are very comfortable to sleep in and easy to take on and off.  They machine wash and dry just fine.  I&#x27;ve only used them for a few days and already feel the difference on my poor dry hands.</li>
            <li> My gloves did not come in a Spa Sister sealed bag. They came folded up in a zip lock bag without any identifying label whatsoever. Cheaply made, short, and overall just terrible. I am very dissatisfied. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I tried these gloves for several nights. Each night I lathered with a moisturizer lotion and then put on the gloves- they did not work.&lt;br /&gt;The gloves are poorly made.</li>
            <li> These are the glove I was looking for. It will help my hands out and get them soft again. I wear them to bed every night</li>
            <li> Love these guys. They are saving my poor fingers from winter&#x27;s dry air!!</li>
            <li> The seam on one of the gloves was ripped when they arrived and they stretch....after three uses, all stretched out. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> My hands are naturally rough from working around the house and outdoors.  So on the rare times that I wear hosiery, I worry about pulling snags, etc.  With these gloves, that is not a problem.</li>
            <li> I bought these gloves for my wife. She doesn&#x27;t have large hands at all. Quite normal-sized hands for a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they are small on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no size option. Under &#x27;Sizes&#x27; it says, \\&quot;One size fits most.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That should have been a warning. One size never fits all. It&#x27;s always a lie. These are small gloves and I can&#x27;t return them for a larger size. We&#x27;re stuck.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and the gloves are too big and the material is very thin.  I wear gloves at night all the time &amp; I wear them out, so I&#x27;m not sure these will last very long.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.  Cheap cotton gloves.  Too small for my hand. I put creams on my hands to sleep and the cream immediately comes through because they are so thin.  $2 bucks is a better price for this product.</li>
            <li> They were NOT what I read.  They are basic white gloves that are very short and had NOTHING to do with moisture.  They did NOT work as promised.  Sorry I got them.</li>
            <li> Cheap, stretches out. Save your $</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Soft and easy to use. Hope it wholes up to use.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Thin fabric with no elasticity. So short that they do not reach my wrists. Continually pulling them up to no avail.</li>
            <li> Great gloves for smoothing hands</li>
            <li> I received a pair of plain white gloves that you could buy anywhere that sells clothing. These are not specifically moisture gloves, they are regular white gloves. (The kind you would put on your daughter with her cute easter dress). One size fits most, if you have tiny hands. I am 5&#x27;3 and 135 lbs, and the gloves are way too small for me and I normally wear a size small fitted glove. The gloves were packaged in a clear zip baggie, not appropriate as a gift.</li>
            <li> These work well for nighttime applications and are breathable cotton.  Only downside is they lose their shape at the wrist after a use or two, but still usable and economical and save your bedding from becoming stained with lotions/oils.</li>
            <li> These work as great as the cotton socks!! For people like myself with eczema on fingers and on the hand, it works really great!!!</li>
            <li> These gloves are of low quality, the fabric is very thin and even though they fit my hand they won&#x27;t stay on. I am returning them for credit and I have to pay the return postage.</li>
            <li> I admit, I don&#x27;t wear them every night like your suppose to, but when I do put lotion on and wear them, I really like them.  They stay on well at night and seem to work great.</li>
            <li> These gloves have shrunk with washing.  They fit my hands now, but they&#x27;re so short around my wrists that I have trouble keeping them on.</li>
            <li> Stretched out and have a hole after a week. Very very thin. Horrible quality.</li>
            <li> As with the overnight socks, my hands were so very dry and ruff, I applied lotion, put the gloves on and wore them to bed.&lt;br /&gt;Also they do well in the laundry. Very pleased</li>
            <li> The fabric is not that great. They do the job but the other ones I bought from ulta were more reliable</li>
            <li> If I could give this a 0 I most certainly would. This is the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon. I have bought ALOT on Amazon. The material is horrible. Not to mention the gloves were already falling apart when I opened up the package. The material is VERY thin to the point of seeing through them. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on them at all and maybe try going to a drug store. The quality is horrible. What a rip off.</li>
            <li> Purchased as recommended by my doctor after applying ointment to my hands that won&#x27;t get everywhere. I put the ointment on, wear the gloves and even when I&#x27;m sleeping to hold in the moisture of the medicine. I&#x27;ve washed them and they come out of the wash and dryer just as I bought them without shrinking.</li>
            <li> nothing in these gloves says &amp;#34;moisture gloves&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34;. thin, &amp;#34;made out of a cotton t-shirt&amp;#34; material. will not buy again</li>
            <li> These gloves are great.  I load up on the hand lotion, put on the gloves and the next day my hands are just like velvet.  I only use them 2 or 3 nights a week to maintain soft, moisturized hands.  So glad I use the gloves.  Everyone should own at least one pair.</li>
            <li> i got these gloves for my wife , she use them at night with her hand cream the cracking of her hands has improved greatly,&lt;br /&gt;i thank they are great.</li>
            <li> These gloves are more expensive than others I have bought but they are thick and of good quality.  I have allergies and they are very helpful when I have to avoid allergens. I have medium sized hands and they fit well.  After I wash them, I air dry them so they don&#x27;t shrink too much.</li>
            <li> OK not what I expected. Didn&#x27;t stay on hands well.</li>
            <li> I apply Egyptian Magic cream to my eyes and finger tips.  the gloves work perfectly to help my finger tips retain moisture</li>
            <li> Basic cotton material. Good stretch and size- on me they end about an inch below the pad of the thumb. Not sure they do anything special for moisturizing purposes though.</li>
            <li> One size fits all is a little misleading. They are snug and I have really small hands. But, if they fit you, they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li> arrived very fast.  Clean, neat packaging.  gift for christmas, glad for fast arrival.  Would recommend vendor.&lt;br /&gt;The gloves are great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ashamed to admit I have a very bad habit of nibbling my fingernails when I drive sometimes, so got these to put on when I drive so that can&#x27;t do it.  They work great, and think I may have overcome my bad habit....we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> This product was not at all what I expected. The description was very poor so I wasn&#x27;t completely sure. However, they were way to small for my hands. Buy yourself some cheap $.99 winter gloves from the dollar store before you waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> these are not made from a abosrbent or moisturinzing material --they pick up dirt and they are flimsy a sock woudl be better</li>
            <li> Go to Fred Meyer, they have the equivalent for $4! Felt silly once I realized that. These are good but don&#x27;t wash well. They never seem to really get clean. Not white, but clean. It&#x27;s irritating since I wear these almost every night with medicine underneath to help with my hand ezcema. Oh well, won&#x27;t buy them here again I&#x27;ll just get them at Fred Meyer or a local drug store.</li>
            <li> A perfect solution for me. My rat terrier licks any and all lotion or cream off my hands, so I can only apply it when I&#x27;m out of the house. These gloves are lightweight, unobtrusive, and easy to sleep in. In the morning, my hands are so much better. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002RYHTQ Spa Sister White Cotton Overnight Moisture Gloves]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my 60&#x27;s with extremely rough hands.  I am allergic to many of the moisturizers out there.  In the winters, my hands will often reach the point of bleeding because of cracked skin and allergies to various hand soaps.  I purchased these gloves with a great deal of skepticism.  I used my usual hypo-allergenic hand cream and put on these gloves at bedtime.  The next morning, my hands had lost much of the roughness and many of the cracks.  I wore these at night for approximately 1 week with my hand creme and my hands look like \\&quot;people\\&quot; hands again, not like scratchy alligator skin.  Soft hands once again!  I LOVE these gloves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes.  There is no spandex in these gloves.  How many of us are allergic to spandex????  Me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the material is thin.  It feels, as one reviewer stated, \\&quot;like a second skin.\\&quot;  Therefore, very comfortable for sleeping.  They did NOT slip off at night. So far, NO tearing of the fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first put them on, they seem huge and loose.  Once the hand cream is applied, they fit nicely.  I have large hands.  If I had small hands, I would wash them in hot water for some shrinkage as cotton normally shrinks a little when exposed to hot water.  Never-the-less, the hand cream should help to keep them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added benefit, I also wear these when working at my computer.  Keeps body oil off the keys and screen.  I can easily pick things up with these on, such as coins, small items.  Helps the old fingers grasp things.  These are wonderful when using my Kindle to keep those prints off the dark screen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES!  I highly recommend these gloves!  They are worth it!</li>
            <li> I use these gloves to protect my hands from the sun during driving.  I am 53 years old and my hands and arms are just starting to get brown age spots from the sun.  In an effort to try not to look so old, I wear these little gloves while driving.  So far they protect my  hands well.</li>
            <li> Purchased to use overnight with a homemade shea butter lotion.  Very well made and comfortable for overnight use.  Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> So tight!!! Remove all my hand cream((</li>
            <li> Very thin material. When pulling them on they almost rip!</li>
            <li> Fits well, but was broken</li>
            <li> Instead of the posted picture, the gloves came in an sketchy, unmarked, unsealed ziplock type bag. They were very thin and have loose threads hanging off. It looked too sketchy to even include in a present of spa items.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see them. Very thin. I needed them because I want to use them overnight when I put special moisturizer on my hands. They are just too thin....</li>
            <li> Really short fingers and wide but short in the palms,  They don&#x27;t stay on very well at night.  I won&#x27;t be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> These are lousy. They are not nearly as nice as the ones pictured either. Initially I thought, &amp;#34;oh it doesn&#x27;t matter if they come in different packaging.&amp;#34; It wasn&#x27;t like I was buying them based on how they were displayed at a store. They were thin and the fingers were all the same length. Although there wasn&#x27;t a label to the contrary, I would contend they were not cotten based on how coarse they were. It&#x27;s worth the time and money to go buy them retail at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.</li>
            <li> These were as described and work great</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I needed to keep my hands moist at night since I suffer from excema on them!</li>
            <li> A bit small for one size fits all</li>
    </ol>
