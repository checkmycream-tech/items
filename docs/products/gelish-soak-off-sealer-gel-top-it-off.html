            <li>Off, they&#x27;re both great products, I&#x27;ve started using the Konad Stamping System, and I have to say that it makes a great difference when applying it after the Top It Off.  </li>
            <li>Good coverage, goes on even, well made brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I also loved the fact that once I set the time on the lamp it automatically started when I placed my hand in to cure.</li>
            <li>Package looked good.</li>
            <li>Really a good product.</li>
            <li>just is good to know how to applied the product just as its needed</li>
            <li>I will be buying the Shellac top coat as is superior in every way!</li>
            <li>Nothing I&#x27;ve tried shines as beautifully as Gelish top it off, and keeps its shine til I decide to soak off.  </li>
            <li>AND ERROR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited to write this review until I had tried MANY of the tips from MANY of the wonderful reviewers on Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li>Wat can I say is the best sealer gel top, I love it</li>

            <li>but once that was done it was amazing.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and works great.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails for years ..</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.  </li>
            <li>Nail Strengthener,  REALLY HANDY FOR ACETONE &amp; ALCHOHOL-</li>
            <li>so this was really nice.  </li>
            <li>Really - this system is awesome.  </li>
            <li>But this does seal and gives a nice shine.</li>
            <li>It seals the polish and adds in a nice and glossy finish to the nail&#x27;s surface.  </li>
            <li>There are lots of YouTube videos to show you how to use this product and do your own gel manicures.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice shiny finish.</li>

            <li>Nice amount.</li>
            <li>seals nicely.</li>
            <li>I recommend it if you&#x27;re doing your own shellac nails at home.  </li>
            <li>The top coat keeps my polish from chipping a good 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Love love love!!</li>
            <li>Beautiful top coat keeps a gorgeous shine and makes my nails look so pretty.  </li>
            <li>Itâ€™s so very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This is amazing better than using acrylic  </li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use and keeps me from having to spend $30 at the nail salon!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quite good!  </li>

            <li>:) Nice and work fine :)</li>
            <li>the bottle is huge!</li>
            <li>I have both the foundation and top it off.</li>
            <li>and then the Top it off then wiped.</li>
            <li>but just I just filed it and put on a uv top coat to seal edge</li>
            <li>Lot of 2 one bottle Foundation one bottle Top Coat</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The top coat has an awesome shine, that has lasted through an entire weekend of cleaning my house.</li>
            <li>I will surely be purchasing this product for client use as well.</li>
            <li>This is the last part to your perfect manicure!</li>
            <li>I now love Ibd sealer.</li>
            <li>After curing the Top Coat, make sure to finish your nails off with 70-99% alcohol or they will be tacky.</li>

            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I just love this top cop</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use rubbing alcohol or something to remove the tacky surface after UV or LED drying.</li>
            <li>WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL</li>
            <li>Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  </li>
            <li>Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.)</li>
            <li>Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER).</li>
            <li>TOP LED Nail Gel Polish Cure Lamp Harmony Shellac UV Dryer Timer Control New&lt;</li>

            <li>Absolutely love the Gelish products.  </li>

            <li>it&#x27;s own to give you that prefectly smooth look.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to wipe the top coat (after being cured) off with alcohol to get the tacky off and make sure it is set well.</li>
            <li>but I just HAVE to write that I LOVE LOVE LOVE Gelish.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;A couple of tips: make sure to SHAKE WELL.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think about  a top coat</li>
            <li>I love this gel top coat.</li>
            <li>No matter how bumpy your nails appear, once you put this on, they appear smooth and glossy!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the shine it gives as well as the added strength it provides my nails.  </li>
            <li>I have always used CND&#x27;s top coat</li>
            <li>I do not have any yellowing with CND&#x27;s top coat.</li>
            <li>I just apply a drop of Top It</li>
            <li>I often use non-gel nail polish under Top It</li>
            <li>I only wear Harmony Gelish nail polish because its the best!!  </li>
            <li>but gelish is perfect over regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I love how this leaves your nails shiny until you take it off.</li>
            <li>Gotta have top it off, don&#x27;t skip on this.  </li>
            <li>This top coat is shiny,</li>
            <li>I wear two coats on top of my gel mani</li>
            <li>I do my nails at home and love the Gelish Harmony product.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the sally hansen brand top coat and my color</li>
            <li>I use whatever color I like from my polish stash and then apply the top coat.</li>
            <li>Top</li>
            <li>I cover this with the Top</li>
            <li>I bought the Foundation Gel and the Top</li>
            <li>After reading reviews, I decided to try this brand for my top coat.  </li>
            <li>Gelish soak off sealer gel top it off</li>
            <li>Its thinner does not chip and bristles seem to be better.</li>
            <li>But I do love the product and will continue using this brand for my no chip manicures.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I love my gels</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product as my top coat since I started using the gelish polishes.  </li>
            <li>this is a great top coat for gel polish, truly prevent cracks and chipping,  highly recommend gelish products.  </li>
            <li>Love the Gelish Products, they&#x27;re worth it every Penney!!</li>
            <li>My manicure turned out beautiful, be very careful not to get the polish on your skin or cuticle, that seemed to be the best advice I heard, it looks very neat and clean (and doesn&#x27;t lift or peel) if you keep it off the skin!</li>
            <li>an it looks just as good as the first day I put the polish on.  </li>
            <li>but well worth the results!!</li>
            <li>This top coat will smooth it</li>
            <li>i found a great product and don&#x27;t want to part with it till it&#x27;s completely gone or unusable</li>
            <li>An LED light is required to set the Top</li>
            <li>Just be sure to cure with LED or ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>A good wattage lamp is imperative to set, (I bought a 36-watt for a good price here too), and as long as you cure well between coats, you&#x27;re all set!</li>
            <li>I am excited to see that as a nail tech, I have more than one choice of soak off systems.</li>
            <li>(As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li>(As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also, this seller was very quick with shipping.</li>
            <li>then comes off easily after buffing the surface.</li>
            <li>that I don&#x27;t know how strong the bulb is</li>
            <li>I just wipe a strong alcohol (90%) on and that&#x27;s sufficient.</li>
            <li>Yes, you do have to soak it off, but to keep your nails strong and from chipping, breaking, splitting or peeling, this product cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>This is a good gell clear top coat</li>
            <li>The TOP IT OFF gives your nails that great shine that lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>If nail drier am able to do my own nails at home and put a fresh top coat on a manicure to extend the time between a new one.  </li>
            <li>So any light can affect it.</li>
            <li>If you get this too close to your uv light it will start to cure in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Place hand in the LED Light for 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  </li>
            <li>Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.  </li>
            <li>Curing Nail Dryer Light Timer</li>
            <li>They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.  </li>
            <li>The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It Off then wipe your nail lightly with an alcohol swab to remove any uncured polish or</li>
            <li>When you cure this under the light, it will spread so and case the polish to go on your skin and it will lift off your nail.</li>
            <li>No ridges, just smooth and shiny nails.</li>
            <li>Off to the chip and seal it under the LED light for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone who wants to save money and has the time and the talent to paint their own nails.</li>
            <li>These lamps are available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>it stays glossy for days and has a smooth finish</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fantastic consistency and doesn&#x27;t get a lot of bubbles.</li>
            <li>I have found it is much easier and more economical to purchase acrylic (water-base) paints and mix my own color of choice for my nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I use a gel color cure it with light, then sealer cure it with light, wipe all nails with cotton ball dipped in alcohol and done.  </li>
            <li>Of course, an LED light is needed.</li>
            <li>Product goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>and then you get wrinkles in your polish after exposing it to the light.  </li>
            <li>Reviewers complain about it being tacking after they&#x27;re done using the UV light.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, gelish is a cheap, good quality brand.</li>
            <li>super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick and sticky, goes on nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually great for pedicures because it lasts a month or more down on the toes without chipping or peeling.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to try all of my colors</li>
            <li>True clear coat that is easy to use and cures nicely.</li>
            <li>Shiny and super smooth surface.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased Gelish Foundation, Top Coat, and color polishes to start doing my own gel nails at home.</li>
            <li>Clean up as needed.  </li>
            <li>Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  </li>
            <li>Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol.</li>
            <li>this is called a clean up brush.</li>
            <li>You really have to make sure to *lightly</li>
            <li>This is also a full ounce compared to a half ounce of CND brand, so it&#x27;s a very good deal.  </li>
            <li>Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Good top coat, a little runny but very shiny and lasts a good amount of time, cures fast</li>
            <li>i try to put a good layer on, sometimes even double layer it, curing it twice.</li>
            <li>My nails look gorgeous and last 2 weeks minimum.</li>
            <li>This top sealer works really well.</li>
            <li>This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.</li>
            <li>I am in love with Gelish and their whole brand of nail polish.</li>
            <li>Using this, I can get a full 10-12 days out of my gel nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i tried using ibd intense seal top coat</li>
            <li>I really like this Gelish top coat by Hand and Nail Harmony.</li>
            <li>My nails grow quickly</li>
            <li>I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light ..</li>
            <li>Super shiny and my friends at work want to come over and do theirs too.</li>
            <li>First, seal the free edge of the nail.</li>
            <li>First seal the free edge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to keep my nails long for more than a week.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty runny, so use caution when applying it!</li>
            <li>This product description states clearly that this is a lot of 2, one bottle Foundation and one bottle of Top Coat, which I though was a super deal.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product - I cure this over my regular dry polish...</li>
            <li>Large bottles (bigger than CND) and good prices.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try and cram your whole hand in the light-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smoother than CND&#x27;s Shellac top coat, and has the same cure time too (in a UV light).</li>
            <li>That one works without having to cleanse it and is more professional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing gel nails for awhile and this isn&#x27;t worth putting on.</li>
            <li>I had bought a mini just to try out first then bought full size</li>
            <li>I use many different brands of colored gel nail polish, but I always use Gelish top coat because it is long-lasting and very shiny.  </li>
            <li>Now I can do my own nails and have them look professionally done, at a much reduced price.</li>
            <li>I love Gelish products but this clear coat just isnt for me.</li>
            <li>Made polish last much longer and super shiny!!!</li>
            <li>It will even up your French manicure very easily.</li>
            <li>Using this product as directed in the Harmony Gelish You Tube Video  has caused ZERO damage to my nails, which is great because i have always had damage to them in the past whenever I had gel or acrylic overlay.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before the Foundation, make sure your nails are clean and DRY.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super shiny and very durable.</li>
            <li>Turns out not so much as I only received the Top</li>
            <li>Make sure to follow the You Tube video by the Harmony Gelish company on how to properly apply the product</li>
            <li>Both looked great, but the big difference is in how long it lasted.  </li>
            <li>it will last better.  </li>
            <li>Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li>then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  </li>
            <li>I had a big problem with the foundation and the top it off.  </li>
            <li>I use all of Gelish&#x27;s products and especially the top coat.</li>
            <li>You get more out of the product when you use all the same brand polishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently purchased the gelish top coat to use for work and myself.</li>
            <li>but it is so sensitive to light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;good product, easy to use, dry fast under any type of uv light.</li>
            <li>pretty much everything you&#x27;d want in a basic gel top coat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;a hard time making the white perfect on myself.</li>
            <li>The price was definetly better than CND, so Ill give this a fair chance.</li>
            <li>Shellac chips within a week for me, and opi gel color is good, but a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now.</li>
            <li>Shellac lasted between two and three weeks on my nails and would probably have lasted longer, but my nails grow incredibly fast and it looks funny having no product on the growth area.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty much guessing on cure times.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this over other gel polish and traditional polishes with great results.</li>
            <li>but since the polish lasts so long I have to wait! :)</li>
            <li>I prefer to use my regular gel brushes when applying these products-they dont harden and you can wipe them easily.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly under UV lamp and makes the manicure look professional.</li>
            <li>nice and shimmery, and it has a slight shimmer to it which I think is what helps make your nails so shiny.  </li>
            <li>I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks ..</li>
            <li>You must let the nail polish dry before sealing it with Top</li>
            <li>This polish holds up to two weeks,  or more, of mistreatment every single time.</li>
            <li>I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  </li>
            <li>I use it over my regular polish (not special, gel polish) and it works great to keep my mani shiny and from chipping.  </li>
            <li>My nails look amazingly shiny, I used it over regular nail polish to make it last over two weeks!!</li>
            <li>I love how my polish doesn&#x27;t chip, and they are harder than ever.  </li>
            <li>This one peels off and lifts too much.</li>
            <li>apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  </li>
            <li>I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  </li>
            <li>Various helpful supplies I got from Amazon.com:  magnifying glasses, lint free cloth, brush for Structure Gel,  </li>
            <li>so it is very forgiving</li>
            <li>I really want this Gelish to work out for us.  </li>
            <li>Gelish is So much cheaper than Acrylic nails at the salon.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased Top it Off and wasnt surprised to find it \\&quot;runny\\&quot; compared to CND.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  </li>
            <li>I use it over my NORMAL (NOT GEL) nail polish, then wait for that to dry, and top it with my Gelish topcoat.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find another that wears as long and as strong.</li>
            <li>Great gel top coat, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, high gloss,</li>
            <li>Only a small amout is needed to finish the last step of the process to give your nails a truly beautiful shine!!!</li>
            <li>Tried other top coats and they don&#x27;t compare,  not even the stuff they were applying in the salons.</li>
            <li>Cured fast with LED light, nice thin layer (some top offs can be too thick, this one was just right), extra shiny and secure finish.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses this with the other product and keeps her &amp;#34;office&amp;#34; nails pretty and strong.</li>
            <li>Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  </li>
            <li>I mainly bought this polish to mix with some polish my daughter bought for me that wasn&#x27;t staying on very well.</li>
            <li>I left my fingers under the UV light for 10 mins, it never dried!  </li>
            <li>First remove old gel polish.</li>
            <li>Upstate NY winter involves mouse protection - I was stuffing steel wool into crevices and the polish looked brand new!</li>
            <li>It is like getting 66% more for less money.</li>
            <li>I actually had better control using a seperate gel brush with these products since the are quite fluid unlike structure/builder type gels.</li>
            <li>This bottle is 0.50 ounces and the local stores sell the 0.30 ounce sizes for more money than the bigger bottle on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It sets well, leaves a nice shine &amp; makes my nails feel harder than with regular polish alone</li>
            <li>Product came quickly, cheaper than Sally&#x27;s smaller size plus no tax....</li>
            <li>..its a decent price</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>High shine and durability for your Gelish Manicure that lasts for weeks.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>This Gelish foundation seal was used over the French manicure set as a top coat and it dried quickly with a mirror-like glossy finish.</li>
            <li>However, make sure you do not have it close to the light as it will curate the actual polish and turn it hard.</li>
            <li>If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  </li>
            <li>so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;TECH</li>
            <li>I found the Harmony Gelish products to be thinner than normal nail polish</li>
            <li>with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  </li>
            <li>Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION.</li>
            <li>After trying a lot of other UV top coats, this is the one I keep going back to.</li>
            <li>Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first,</li>
            <li>FIXED!</li>
            <li>I think I got an old bottle or something!  </li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend gelish for anybody wanting to try out gel color polish for the first time.</li>
            <li>You can even go out and get a regular/non gel professional pedicure,  then go home and put a coat of this on top, cure it for two minutes and make your pedicure last twice as long!!!!</li>
            <li>The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  </li>
            <li>Must have the top coat for shellac manicures for that shine and hard finish.  </li>
            <li>Clear Pump Dispenser Bottle  </li>
            <li>I am a professional nail tech, and decided to purchase the Gelish UV soak off gel polish at home, what can I say?</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  </li>
            <li>When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. .</li>
            <li>flick off old polish from</li>
            <li>Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.  </li>
            <li>I find I must do this nearly every day ..</li>
            <li>Debra Lynn Professional 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li>and it last until I&#x27;m ready to take it off.  </li>
            <li>They are like a nail \\&quot;cap\\&quot; that fits to the edge of your natural nail and supports it as it grows out.  </li>
            <li>I have several fingernails that are really a wreck from using gel polish (namely Nailene) and am growing them out.  </li>
            <li>I use this as a top coat over my regular nail polish,  it&#x27;s my lil secret to make my the regular polish last for more than 2 days.  </li>
            <li>The brush has hardened on Every bottle that I have gotten within a 1-2 months even though I keep it stored in a cool dark place.</li>
            <li>It really makes the application thick and not as smooth.</li>
            <li>If I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color ..</li>
            <li>Then, apply it super, super *thin*.</li>
            <li>The base and the top it off from gelish is the best , i could use any gel polish from any company and use base and top from gelish</li>
            <li>I did this and wasted a full bottle of it.</li>
            <li>Once dry, (which is kinda weird since it&#x27;s tacky), you hit it with a *lint-free* cloth with the alcohol again and you have a beautiful, lasting,</li>
            <li>moG6S8TEGJXZMD]]This is the final touch to sealing your new Gelish nail polish job</li>
            <li>I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel.</li>
            <li>I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine.</li>
            <li>I read a review somewhere that said that they mixed the UV polish that wasn&#x27;t curing with some clear on foil and their polish worked.</li>
            <li>Has the same chemical ingredients as the Gelish Structure Gel (Clear) but is a thinner viscosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>*Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  </li>
            <li>My manicure lasts over 3 weeks - I only re-do the polish as my nails have grown out too far.    </li>
            <li>I save a ton of money by doing this from home - I got the starter kit has a yule gift and have continued to add to my collection with no regrets</li>
            <li>My manicures are hard and strong and last up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glides on smooth but thick enough to cover well.</li>
            <li>It ruins the whole manicure.  </li>
            <li>Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  </li>
            <li>The viscosity is pretty thin so don&#x27;t glob on too much or it will run in the side walls and you&#x27;ll flood the cuticle.</li>
            <li>(Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  </li>

            <li> I got my first gel nail manicure this year and was so impressed that I decided to figure it out DIY.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> and I swear by the gelish brand, time and time again, because it always looks great and it is easy.</li>

            <li> It lasts amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Its amazing.</li>
            <li> but once that was done it was amazing.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and works great.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for years ..</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.  </li>
            <li> Nail Strengthener,  REALLY HANDY FOR ACETONE &amp; ALCHOHOL-</li>
            <li> so this was really nice.  </li>
            <li> Really - this system is awesome.  </li>
            <li> But this does seal and gives a nice shine.</li>
            <li> It seals the polish and adds in a nice and glossy finish to the nail&#x27;s surface.  </li>
            <li> There are lots of YouTube videos to show you how to use this product and do your own gel manicures.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice shiny finish.</li>
            <li> so i can start doing my own gel manicures at home.</li>
            <li> Everything else went on nicely.  </li>
            <li> Nice amount.</li>
            <li> seals nicely.</li>
            <li> I recommend it if you&#x27;re doing your own shellac nails at home.  </li>
            <li> The top coat keeps my polish from chipping a good 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Love love love!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful top coat keeps a gorgeous shine and makes my nails look so pretty.  </li>
            <li> Itâ€™s so very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is amazing better than using acrylic  </li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use and keeps me from having to spend $30 at the nail salon!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quite good!  </li>
            <li> it leaves a wonderful shine and dries under uv light in 2 mins last about a good week with chipping or peeling..</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t slide into your cuticles.</li>
            <li> :) Nice and work fine :)</li>
            <li> the bottle is huge!</li>
            <li> I have both the foundation and top it off.</li>
            <li> and then the Top it off then wiped.</li>
            <li> but just I just filed it and put on a uv top coat to seal edge</li>
            <li> Lot of 2 one bottle Foundation one bottle Top Coat</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The top coat has an awesome shine, that has lasted through an entire weekend of cleaning my house.</li>
            <li> I will surely be purchasing this product for client use as well.</li>
            <li> This is the last part to your perfect manicure!</li>
            <li> I now love Ibd sealer.</li>
            <li> After curing the Top Coat, make sure to finish your nails off with 70-99% alcohol or they will be tacky.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I just love this top cop</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use rubbing alcohol or something to remove the tacky surface after UV or LED drying.</li>
            <li> WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL</li>
            <li> Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  </li>
            <li> Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.)</li>
            <li> Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER).</li>
            <li> TOP LED Nail Gel Polish Cure Lamp Harmony Shellac UV Dryer Timer Control New&lt;</li>

            <li> Absolutely love the Gelish products.  </li>
            <li> Love how this stuff just evens out on</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own to give you that prefectly smooth look.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to wipe the top coat (after being cured) off with alcohol to get the tacky off and make sure it is set well.</li>
            <li> but I just HAVE to write that I LOVE LOVE LOVE Gelish.  </li>
            <li> to 1 min more with the 36 w lamp.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;A couple of tips: make sure to SHAKE WELL.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think about  a top coat</li>
            <li> I love this gel top coat.</li>
            <li> No matter how bumpy your nails appear, once you put this on, they appear smooth and glossy!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the shine it gives as well as the added strength it provides my nails.  </li>
            <li> I have always used CND&#x27;s top coat</li>
            <li> I do not have any yellowing with CND&#x27;s top coat.</li>
            <li> I just apply a drop of Top It</li>
            <li> I often use non-gel nail polish under Top It</li>
            <li> I only wear Harmony Gelish nail polish because its the best!!  </li>
            <li> but gelish is perfect over regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I love how this leaves your nails shiny until you take it off.</li>
            <li> Gotta have top it off, don&#x27;t skip on this.  </li>
            <li> This top coat is shiny,</li>
            <li> I wear two coats on top of my gel mani</li>
            <li> I do my nails at home and love the Gelish Harmony product.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the sally hansen brand top coat and my color</li>
            <li> I use whatever color I like from my polish stash and then apply the top coat.</li>
            <li> Top</li>
            <li> I cover this with the Top</li>
            <li> I bought the Foundation Gel and the Top</li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I decided to try this brand for my top coat.  </li>
            <li> Gelish soak off sealer gel top it off</li>
            <li> Its thinner does not chip and bristles seem to be better.</li>
            <li> But I do love the product and will continue using this brand for my no chip manicures.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I love my gels</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as my top coat since I started using the gelish polishes.  </li>
            <li> this is a great top coat for gel polish, truly prevent cracks and chipping,  highly recommend gelish products.  </li>
            <li> Love the Gelish Products, they&#x27;re worth it every Penney!!</li>
            <li> My manicure turned out beautiful, be very careful not to get the polish on your skin or cuticle, that seemed to be the best advice I heard, it looks very neat and clean (and doesn&#x27;t lift or peel) if you keep it off the skin!</li>
            <li> an it looks just as good as the first day I put the polish on.  </li>
            <li> but well worth the results!!</li>
            <li> This top coat will smooth it</li>
            <li> i found a great product and don&#x27;t want to part with it till it&#x27;s completely gone or unusable</li>
            <li> An LED light is required to set the Top</li>
            <li> Just be sure to cure with LED or ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li> A good wattage lamp is imperative to set, (I bought a 36-watt for a good price here too), and as long as you cure well between coats, you&#x27;re all set!</li>
            <li> I am excited to see that as a nail tech, I have more than one choice of soak off systems.</li>
            <li> (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li> (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Also, this seller was very quick with shipping.</li>
            <li> then comes off easily after buffing the surface.</li>
            <li> that I don&#x27;t know how strong the bulb is</li>
            <li> I just wipe a strong alcohol (90%) on and that&#x27;s sufficient.</li>
            <li> Yes, you do have to soak it off, but to keep your nails strong and from chipping, breaking, splitting or peeling, this product cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> This is a good gell clear top coat</li>
            <li> The TOP IT OFF gives your nails that great shine that lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> If nail drier am able to do my own nails at home and put a fresh top coat on a manicure to extend the time between a new one.  </li>
            <li> So any light can affect it.</li>
            <li> If you get this too close to your uv light it will start to cure in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  </li>
            <li> Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.  </li>
            <li> Curing Nail Dryer Light Timer</li>
            <li> They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.  </li>
            <li> The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It Off then wipe your nail lightly with an alcohol swab to remove any uncured polish or</li>
            <li> When you cure this under the light, it will spread so and case the polish to go on your skin and it will lift off your nail.</li>
            <li> No ridges, just smooth and shiny nails.</li>
            <li> Off to the chip and seal it under the LED light for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone who wants to save money and has the time and the talent to paint their own nails.</li>
            <li> These lamps are available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> it stays glossy for days and has a smooth finish</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fantastic consistency and doesn&#x27;t get a lot of bubbles.</li>
            <li> I have found it is much easier and more economical to purchase acrylic (water-base) paints and mix my own color of choice for my nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I use a gel color cure it with light, then sealer cure it with light, wipe all nails with cotton ball dipped in alcohol and done.  </li>
            <li> Of course, an LED light is needed.</li>
            <li> Product goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> and then you get wrinkles in your polish after exposing it to the light.  </li>
            <li> Reviewers complain about it being tacking after they&#x27;re done using the UV light.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, gelish is a cheap, good quality brand.</li>
            <li> super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick and sticky, goes on nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually great for pedicures because it lasts a month or more down on the toes without chipping or peeling.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to try all of my colors</li>
            <li> True clear coat that is easy to use and cures nicely.</li>
            <li> Shiny and super smooth surface.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Gelish Foundation, Top Coat, and color polishes to start doing my own gel nails at home.</li>
            <li> Clean up as needed.  </li>
            <li> Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  </li>
            <li> Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol.</li>
            <li> this is called a clean up brush.</li>
            <li> You really have to make sure to *lightly</li>
            <li> This is also a full ounce compared to a half ounce of CND brand, so it&#x27;s a very good deal.  </li>
            <li> Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Good top coat, a little runny but very shiny and lasts a good amount of time, cures fast</li>
            <li> i try to put a good layer on, sometimes even double layer it, curing it twice.</li>
            <li> My nails look gorgeous and last 2 weeks minimum.</li>
            <li> This top sealer works really well.</li>
            <li> This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Gelish and their whole brand of nail polish.</li>
            <li> Using this, I can get a full 10-12 days out of my gel nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i tried using ibd intense seal top coat</li>
            <li> I really like this Gelish top coat by Hand and Nail Harmony.</li>
            <li> My nails grow quickly</li>
            <li> I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light ..</li>
            <li> Super shiny and my friends at work want to come over and do theirs too.</li>
            <li> First, seal the free edge of the nail.</li>
            <li> First seal the free edge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to keep my nails long for more than a week.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty runny, so use caution when applying it!</li>
            <li> This product description states clearly that this is a lot of 2, one bottle Foundation and one bottle of Top Coat, which I though was a super deal.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product - I cure this over my regular dry polish...</li>
            <li> Large bottles (bigger than CND) and good prices.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try and cram your whole hand in the light-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoother than CND&#x27;s Shellac top coat, and has the same cure time too (in a UV light).</li>
            <li> That one works without having to cleanse it and is more professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing gel nails for awhile and this isn&#x27;t worth putting on.</li>
            <li> I had bought a mini just to try out first then bought full size</li>
            <li> I use many different brands of colored gel nail polish, but I always use Gelish top coat because it is long-lasting and very shiny.  </li>
            <li> Now I can do my own nails and have them look professionally done, at a much reduced price.</li>
            <li> I love Gelish products but this clear coat just isnt for me.</li>
            <li> Made polish last much longer and super shiny!!!</li>
            <li> It will even up your French manicure very easily.</li>
            <li> Using this product as directed in the Harmony Gelish You Tube Video  has caused ZERO damage to my nails, which is great because i have always had damage to them in the past whenever I had gel or acrylic overlay.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before the Foundation, make sure your nails are clean and DRY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super shiny and very durable.</li>
            <li> Turns out not so much as I only received the Top</li>
            <li> Make sure to follow the You Tube video by the Harmony Gelish company on how to properly apply the product</li>
            <li> Both looked great, but the big difference is in how long it lasted.  </li>
            <li> it will last better.  </li>
            <li> Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li> then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  </li>
            <li> I had a big problem with the foundation and the top it off.  </li>
            <li> I use all of Gelish&#x27;s products and especially the top coat.</li>
            <li> You get more out of the product when you use all the same brand polishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased the gelish top coat to use for work and myself.</li>
            <li> but it is so sensitive to light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;good product, easy to use, dry fast under any type of uv light.</li>
            <li> pretty much everything you&#x27;d want in a basic gel top coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;a hard time making the white perfect on myself.</li>
            <li> The price was definetly better than CND, so Ill give this a fair chance.</li>
            <li> Shellac chips within a week for me, and opi gel color is good, but a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now.</li>
            <li> Shellac lasted between two and three weeks on my nails and would probably have lasted longer, but my nails grow incredibly fast and it looks funny having no product on the growth area.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty much guessing on cure times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this over other gel polish and traditional polishes with great results.</li>
            <li> but since the polish lasts so long I have to wait! :)</li>
            <li> I prefer to use my regular gel brushes when applying these products-they dont harden and you can wipe them easily.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly under UV lamp and makes the manicure look professional.</li>
            <li> nice and shimmery, and it has a slight shimmer to it which I think is what helps make your nails so shiny.  </li>
            <li> I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks ..</li>
            <li> You must let the nail polish dry before sealing it with Top</li>
            <li> This polish holds up to two weeks,  or more, of mistreatment every single time.</li>
            <li> I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  </li>
            <li> I use it over my regular polish (not special, gel polish) and it works great to keep my mani shiny and from chipping.  </li>
            <li> My nails look amazingly shiny, I used it over regular nail polish to make it last over two weeks!!</li>
            <li> I love how my polish doesn&#x27;t chip, and they are harder than ever.  </li>
            <li> This one peels off and lifts too much.</li>
            <li> apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  </li>
            <li> I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  </li>
            <li> Various helpful supplies I got from Amazon.com:  magnifying glasses, lint free cloth, brush for Structure Gel,  </li>
            <li> so it is very forgiving</li>
            <li> I really want this Gelish to work out for us.  </li>
            <li> Gelish is So much cheaper than Acrylic nails at the salon.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Top it Off and wasnt surprised to find it \\&quot;runny\\&quot; compared to CND.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  </li>
            <li> I use it over my NORMAL (NOT GEL) nail polish, then wait for that to dry, and top it with my Gelish topcoat.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to find another that wears as long and as strong.</li>
            <li> Great gel top coat, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, high gloss,</li>
            <li> Only a small amout is needed to finish the last step of the process to give your nails a truly beautiful shine!!!</li>
            <li> Tried other top coats and they don&#x27;t compare,  not even the stuff they were applying in the salons.</li>
            <li> Cured fast with LED light, nice thin layer (some top offs can be too thick, this one was just right), extra shiny and secure finish.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses this with the other product and keeps her &amp;#34;office&amp;#34; nails pretty and strong.</li>
            <li> Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  </li>
            <li> I mainly bought this polish to mix with some polish my daughter bought for me that wasn&#x27;t staying on very well.</li>
            <li> I left my fingers under the UV light for 10 mins, it never dried!  </li>
            <li> First remove old gel polish.</li>
            <li> Upstate NY winter involves mouse protection - I was stuffing steel wool into crevices and the polish looked brand new!</li>
            <li> It is like getting 66% more for less money.</li>
            <li> I actually had better control using a seperate gel brush with these products since the are quite fluid unlike structure/builder type gels.</li>
            <li> This bottle is 0.50 ounces and the local stores sell the 0.30 ounce sizes for more money than the bigger bottle on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It sets well, leaves a nice shine &amp; makes my nails feel harder than with regular polish alone</li>
            <li> Product came quickly, cheaper than Sally&#x27;s smaller size plus no tax....</li>
            <li> ..its a decent price</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> High shine and durability for your Gelish Manicure that lasts for weeks.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> This Gelish foundation seal was used over the French manicure set as a top coat and it dried quickly with a mirror-like glossy finish.</li>
            <li> However, make sure you do not have it close to the light as it will curate the actual polish and turn it hard.</li>
            <li> If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  </li>
            <li> so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;TECH</li>
            <li> I found the Harmony Gelish products to be thinner than normal nail polish</li>
            <li> with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  </li>
            <li> Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION.</li>
            <li> After trying a lot of other UV top coats, this is the one I keep going back to.</li>
            <li> Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first,</li>
            <li> FIXED!</li>
            <li> I think I got an old bottle or something!  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend gelish for anybody wanting to try out gel color polish for the first time.</li>
            <li> You can even go out and get a regular/non gel professional pedicure,  then go home and put a coat of this on top, cure it for two minutes and make your pedicure last twice as long!!!!</li>
            <li> The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  </li>
            <li> Must have the top coat for shellac manicures for that shine and hard finish.  </li>
            <li> Clear Pump Dispenser Bottle  </li>
            <li> I am a professional nail tech, and decided to purchase the Gelish UV soak off gel polish at home, what can I say?</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. .</li>
            <li> flick off old polish from</li>
            <li> Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.  </li>
            <li> I find I must do this nearly every day ..</li>
            <li> Debra Lynn Professional 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li> and it last until I&#x27;m ready to take it off.  </li>
            <li> They are like a nail \\&quot;cap\\&quot; that fits to the edge of your natural nail and supports it as it grows out.  </li>
            <li> I have several fingernails that are really a wreck from using gel polish (namely Nailene) and am growing them out.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a top coat over my regular nail polish,  it&#x27;s my lil secret to make my the regular polish last for more than 2 days.  </li>
            <li> The brush has hardened on Every bottle that I have gotten within a 1-2 months even though I keep it stored in a cool dark place.</li>
            <li> It really makes the application thick and not as smooth.</li>
            <li> If I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color ..</li>
            <li> Then, apply it super, super *thin*.</li>
            <li> The base and the top it off from gelish is the best , i could use any gel polish from any company and use base and top from gelish</li>
            <li> I did this and wasted a full bottle of it.</li>
            <li> Once dry, (which is kinda weird since it&#x27;s tacky), you hit it with a *lint-free* cloth with the alcohol again and you have a beautiful, lasting,</li>
            <li> moG6S8TEGJXZMD]]This is the final touch to sealing your new Gelish nail polish job</li>
            <li> I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel.</li>
            <li> I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine.</li>
            <li> I read a review somewhere that said that they mixed the UV polish that wasn&#x27;t curing with some clear on foil and their polish worked.</li>
            <li> Has the same chemical ingredients as the Gelish Structure Gel (Clear) but is a thinner viscosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> *Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  </li>
            <li> My manicure lasts over 3 weeks - I only re-do the polish as my nails have grown out too far.    </li>
            <li> I save a ton of money by doing this from home - I got the starter kit has a yule gift and have continued to add to my collection with no regrets</li>
            <li> My manicures are hard and strong and last up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glides on smooth but thick enough to cover well.</li>
            <li> It ruins the whole manicure.  </li>
            <li> Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  </li>
            <li> The viscosity is pretty thin so don&#x27;t glob on too much or it will run in the side walls and you&#x27;ll flood the cuticle.</li>
            <li> (Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  </li>
            <li> If you already have compromised skin around your nails, I don&#x27;t recommend this, as the removal soaks will cause extreme drying, rashes, and possibly bleeding, cracked cuticles if you are sensitive to the remover.</li>
            <li> I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application.</li>
            <li> A bottle of this will last you a long time, I have been doing my nails with this at home for well over a year, and still have plenty left.</li>
            <li> Sally beauty supply is the only store near me that sells them - and the bottles they sell are 10$ and half the amount of polish (.25 oz).  </li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.(This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails!)  </li>
            <li> I did not find this product to last as long as it should.</li>
            <li> I dry brushed that layer as well and finished applying layers as directed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use regular polish anymore because this is dry when you finish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shellac nail polish for nearly 2 years and typically use CND brand.  </li>
            <li> Peeling: If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra  for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula</li>
            <li> on solid colors, but its not for my pink and white&#x27;s by any means...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is not really a complaint but a suggestion to users.</li>
            <li> This will last the same amount of time as does the Gelish Soak Off Gel Nail Polish which is an average cost of $10 per .5oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> when I heard how long gel nails lasted ..</li>
            <li> I then carefully add the #350 around the upper nail bed ..</li>
            <li> Gelish on the other hand, didn&#x27;t last a week before it was lifting and peeling.  </li>
            <li> I use it with my other regular nail polish</li>
            <li> Those two products hardened on the brush so that by the 4th nail the brushes were hard and thick with the product and would not go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> this is a DRY cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It truly last for a few weeks and the only reason you need to take it off is because your nails grow out.</li>
            <li> This brush made even this amateur try look professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one bottle of this in the past 2 years with my nails nearly always manicured.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an crazy nail obsessed lady - just a mom who wants to look nice once in a while.  </li>
            <li> No bristles were loose nor have any fallen out.</li>
            <li> Start with the short end of Hands Down ..  </li>
            <li> Every time I put it on it is dry but sticky!</li>
            <li> the pad can be cut in half for double usage!)  </li>
            <li> (I keep mine next to my bed and put it on at night when I set my alarm) as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need each product to complete the manicure, which will be instantly dry and hard when done.</li>

            <li> I use it with gel polish and also with regular polish and it holds the bond tightly.</li>

            <li> does need to be soaked off tho, even after a year of having the same bottle (the consistency has gotten a little thicker but not unusable).</li>
            <li> Then as the gel gets to be 2-3 to 4 weeks old my nail beds have grown out at least 1/4\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Gelish is a decent UV-cured gel - it does stay on well and retains shine for at least a week or two (less of you wash a lot of dishes).</li>

            <li> After a lot of experimentation, I&#x27;ve settled on using OPI gelcolor base coat, a variety of different gel nail polish colors, and Gelish top it off.  </li>

            <li> I PICKED UP FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:&lt;br /&gt;*****GELISH STRUCTURE GEL  </li>
            <li> When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail.</li>
            <li> I have used other products, but they haven&#x27;t stayed on as well.  </li>
            <li> This is a must have for any Gelish manicure, but I also use it will other brands of gel polish.</li>
            <li> I do my 4 fingers on one hand, then my 2 thumbs, and then the 4 fingers on the other hand.</li>
            <li> I will use up the bottle I have (which will be a while, a little goes a long way!)</li>
            <li> It makes every color extremely shiny.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in combination with some other gelish products, so that I didn&#x27;t have to keep paying $30ish</li>
            <li> With the remaining product that is left in the brush, apply the gel over your polish of choice up to but not touching cuticle line.  </li>
            <li> with the pad slightly off center.  </li>
            <li> (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails</li>
            <li> On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip.</li>
            <li> Its just a little harder to work with and something I will get used to, but Gelish has never disapointed me.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> My nails should last at least 2 weeks with this product.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with the gelish top coat and base.</li>
            <li> I wish the Top it Off came with a shorter brush like the foundation base does.</li>

            <li> (less harmful to cuticles and surrounding skin than UV lamps)  </li>
            <li> There was a slight learning curve involved -   1.  </li>
            <li> and it sucks, cracks in one day and a total waste of money</li>
            <li> my removal time will be 10 minutes or less</li>
            <li> TIPS: [...]&lt;br /&gt;Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  </li>
            <li> I watched a few YouTube videos, (gotta love YouTube), and found out the only things I needed were the base, the topcoat, and the lamp!</li>
            <li> The gelish products make my nails hard and long (sounds a little kinky, huh???).  </li>
            <li> If some sticks on the tips, a little pressure with an orange stick coated with acetone ought to make it release.  </li>
            <li> it does make the nail a little weaker because of the soaking and scrapping.</li>
            <li> No problem if it does - just wipe it off, but to avoid it just keep a little bit on the brush.</li>
            <li> With this sealer I did not ever have to scrape it off, I filed the nail bed to break the seal up a little did my foil wraps and 10 mins.</li>

            <li> Total waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to get it off.</li>
            <li> I had gotten tired of my nail polish starting to chip after 2 or 3 days, so I thought why not.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gelish by Harmony for a few years now and this soak off</li>
            <li> Purpose: Used to strengthen weak nails OR to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips.</li>
            <li> Both bottles were capped tightly after application to nail but the brushes got hard.</li>
            <li> This top coat is TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> small toenails</li>
            <li> If I get a chip, (usually along the tips of my pointer fingers)  </li>
            <li> I even do my families and friends nails for a small fee.</li>
            <li> usually wait 12 hours after painting my nails.  </li>
            <li> * buff the nail with an emery block first to give it some traction for the base coat.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the bristles become very stiff.</li>
            <li> and it sets the manicure hard.</li>
            <li> self-leveling,  hard as a rock and durable.</li>
            <li> If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  </li>
            <li> If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.</li>
            <li> If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;ll go on too thick.</li>
            <li> If you put too thick of a coat on, it will bubble.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the CND gets thick</li>
            <li> If you have normal nails just using Foundation Gel  as your base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not rough on my nails, so was really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The trick is to apply a thin layer.  </li>
            <li> If needed apply 2 thin layers of the Gelish strengthener.  </li>
            <li> Apply 1-3 thin coats depending upon nail strength desired; curing between each application.</li>
            <li> Use really thin layers - thinner</li>
            <li> Put a thin coat on.</li>
            <li> so I personally don&#x27;t use the base.  </li>
            <li> i usually get sick of the color before it starts peeling off after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> You do not need an expensive LED lamp to cure the gel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is soooo expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it&#x27;s been three weeks</li>
            <li> (SORRY IN ADVANCE THAT MY \\&quot;WORD\\&quot; DOCUMENT CONVERTS</li>
            <li> This ensures a thin layer OR WILL PEEL!  </li>
            <li> In the beginning it is merely \\&quot;tipping\\&quot; the nails ..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s so&lt;br /&gt;old</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll make your fingers lay weird and won&#x27;t cure evenly.</li>
            <li> and I save a fortune by not having to buy expensive nail polishes.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product line.</li>
            <li> Then, apply a VERY THIN coat of Foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions:  Apply a very thin coat to the nail and cure.  </li>
            <li> dot a small amount of base coat on each nail with the brush.</li>
            <li> and you cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> (or skip if you used alcohol if you choose) APPLY SPARINGLY - i.e. very thin coat!  </li>
            <li> IMPOSSIBLE after the LED</li>
            <li> SO BADLY TO AMAZON</li>
            <li> bad smell...highly recommend.</li>

            <li> Arrived on time.  Always like Gelish brand.  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Great gel top coat, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, high gloss, pretty much everything you&#x27;d want in a basic gel top coat. My only complaint is not really a complaint but a suggestion to users. The viscosity is pretty thin so don&#x27;t glob on too much or it will run in the side walls and you&#x27;ll flood the cuticle. I use the Gelish base and top coat al the time with different brands of gel polish between.</li>
            <li> The perfect top coat for gel nails.  I have yet to find another that wears as long and as strong.</li>
            <li> Cured fast with LED light, nice thin layer (some top offs can be too thick, this one was just right), extra shiny and secure finish.  Did not chip.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat on the market. I have tried some others and they just don&#x27;t hold up as well.</li>
            <li> I have both the foundation and top it off. You need really good lighting to see but it affects the product brush a lot! Both bottles were capped tightly after application to nail but the brushes got hard. So any light can affect it. I prefer to use my regular gel brushes when applying these products-they dont harden and you can wipe them easily. I actually had better control using a seperate gel brush with these products since the are quite fluid unlike structure/builder type gels.I made a \\&quot;gelly\\&quot; sandwich using the foundation then China Glaze Holographic polish 2 coats and 2 coats of glitter polish-each coat \\&quot;throughly dried\\&quot; and then the Top it off then wiped. So I dont end up wasting all of the nail polishes I invested in. its been one week and it in great shape. No chips or lifts.I had an edge chip on one nail because I slammed my finger in a drawer but just I just filed it and put on a uv top coat to seal edge and it is still holding up.</li>
            <li> This polish is what they were using in the salon when i went to have my nails done every 3 weeks. I then decided I could do this at home myself and purchased the items needed. Best decision ever and easy to use. You do not need an expensive LED lamp to cure the gel. I purchased a 36 watt lamp for around $45 and it works great. This polish is awesome!!</li>
            <li> This product description states clearly that this is a lot of 2, one bottle Foundation and one bottle of Top Coat, which I though was a super deal.  Turns out not so much as I only received the Top it Off.    Product Description  Lot of 2 one bottle Foundation one bottle Top Coat</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re doing Harmony Gelish nails yourself, this is step 5. You&#x27;ll need each product to complete the manicure, which will be instantly dry and hard when done.</li>
            <li> If you get this too close to your uv light it will start to cure in the bottle. Same with th foundation. So keep them a distance away.</li>
            <li> great gel top coat. i try to put a good layer on, sometimes even double layer it, curing it twice. i usually get sick of the color before it starts peeling off after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am a professional nail tech, and decided to purchase the Gelish UV soak off gel polish at home, what can I say? I love this stuff. The top coat has an awesome shine, that has lasted through an entire weekend of cleaning my house. It&#x27;s smoother than CND&#x27;s Shellac top coat, and has the same cure time too (in a UV light). I am excited to see that as a nail tech, I have more than one choice of soak off systems. I will surely be purchasing this product for client use as well.</li>
            <li> Great product! This is the last part to your perfect manicure! I have used Gelish for over 3 months now and I just love it! Make sure to follow the You Tube video by the Harmony Gelish company on how to properly apply the product and you cannot go wrong! My nails look gorgeous and last 2 weeks minimum. The TOP IT OFF gives your nails that great shine that lasts for a long time.  I love how my polish doesn&#x27;t chip, and they are harder than ever.  Using this product as directed in the Harmony Gelish You Tube Video  has caused ZERO damage to my nails, which is great because i have always had damage to them in the past whenever I had gel or acrylic overlay.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this one. I now love Ibd sealer. That one works without having to cleanse it and is more professional. This one peels off and lifts too much.</li>
            <li> This stuff is soooo expensive for what you get. It works, but takes awhile for the gel polish to come off. I feel like it&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Harmony Gelish was an answer to my prayers!&lt;br /&gt;No other polish would stay on my nails as long as Gelish does! 3 weeks on hands and almost 2 months on toes! Shiny and super smooth surface.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Gelish Foundation, Top Coat, and color polishes to start doing my own gel nails at home. I could not be more happy! To save money, I did not purchase the pH bond or the finishing cleanser. Before the Foundation, make sure your nails are clean and DRY. Then, apply a VERY THIN coat of Foundation. After curing the Top Coat, make sure to finish your nails off with 70-99% alcohol or they will be tacky. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had both Shellac and Gelish on my nails, done in a Salon by a \\&quot;professional.\\&quot;  Both looked great, but the big difference is in how long it lasted.  Shellac lasted between two and three weeks on my nails and would probably have lasted longer, but my nails grow incredibly fast and it looks funny having no product on the growth area.  Gelish on the other hand, didn&#x27;t last a week before it was lifting and peeling.  I&#x27;m not rough on my nails, so was really disappointed.  I purchased the Shellac products and have started to do my nails at home.  Gelish is cheaper, but as my mother always said, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really in love with these products after just one try!  My manicure turned out beautiful, be very careful not to get the polish on your skin or cuticle, that seemed to be the best advice I heard, it looks very neat and clean (and doesn&#x27;t lift or peel) if you keep it off the skin!</li>
            <li> This top sealer works really well. Use 70% isopropyl alcohol to remove tackiness after curing and you have a beautiful shine with no worries of chipping. Love it</li>
            <li> This top coat is TERRIBLE! I&#x27;ve been doing gel nails for awhile and this isn&#x27;t worth putting on. It ruins the whole manicure.  Every time I put it on it is dry but sticky! So sticky the every fiber from my clothing sticks to it so it&#x27;s like the rollers you use to get lint off your coat.  I always have to brush over it is with nail polish remover to get the sticky film off and leave the color!  I will be buying the Shellac top coat as is superior in every way!</li>
            <li> Great product... The trick is to apply a thin layer.  It dries quickly under UV lamp and makes the manicure look professional.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it&#x27;s been three weeks and my nails are shiny and 10x stronger than before.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I just love this top cop it leaves a wonderful shine and dries under uv light in 2 mins last about a good week with chipping or peeling..I had bought a mini just to try out first then bought full size</li>
            <li> This is the best brand of top coat for gel nails out there.  I use many different brands of colored gel nail polish, but I always use Gelish top coat because it is long-lasting and very shiny.  It goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t slide into your cuticles.</li>
            <li> nice and shimmery, and it has a slight shimmer to it which I think is what helps make your nails so shiny.  Just make sure to use rubbing alcohol or something to remove the tacky surface after UV or LED drying.</li>
            <li> This product is just great.  Now I can do my own nails and have them look professionally done, at a much reduced price.</li>
            <li> After trying a lot of other UV top coats, this is the one I keep going back to. Good coverage, goes on even, well made brush.</li>
            <li> WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited to write this review until I had tried MANY of the tips from MANY of the wonderful reviewers on Amazon.com!  Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  I have been doing my own nails for years .. when I heard how long gel nails lasted .. I was hooked!  I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks .. my manicure very nicely 2 weeks .. then I must start to \\&quot;tip\\&quot; the ends with a matching regular nail polish.  If I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color .. it will last better.  My nails grow quickly so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  Hope the below is helpful .. thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AUGUST 2013  (SORRY IN ADVANCE THAT MY \\&quot;WORD\\&quot; DOCUMENT CONVERTS SO BADLY TO AMAZON VIA THE SENTENCE STRUCTURES!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manicure &amp; Pedicure Gelish Application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AUGUST 2013  The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones.&lt;br /&gt;Manicure &amp; Pedicure Gelish Application [...]&lt;br /&gt;1. First remove old gel polish. Rough up nails well so acetone can get through. Then starting with the little finger and work to the thumb.  Soak pad of Hands Down with acetone.  Start with the short end of Hands Down ..  with the pad slightly off center.  Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. . This helps keep the pads moist longer.  Do the second hand.  Put a glove on the second hand and set the timer for 20 minutes after completing 2nd hand. With the gloves on, can do other tasks.  After 20 minutes, remove the glove and pull off the pads, one ata time .. starting with little finger-1st hand, flipping the polish off each nail with an orange stick as you go. If some sticks on the tips, a little pressure with an orange stick coated with acetone ought to make it release.  Pads can reused a couple of times before throwing away .. flick off old polish from pad/flatten/let dry/store separated in paper sheets they came in.  (Using: Graham Hands Down Soak Off Gel Nail Wraps-works GREAT! -for small toenails the pad can be cut in half for double usage!)  2.  Apply cuticle remover .. push back the cuticle.  3.  Remove cuticle from nail plate.  Clean up as needed.  4.  Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.  5.  Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.  6.  Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  (IF POSSIBLE:  apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  Leave on overnight if possible. Then:  wash with soap and water and polish using the proper steps.  7.  Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol. You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.  8. Apply  PH Bond to the nail plate. (or skip if you used alcohol if you choose) APPLY SPARINGLY - i.e. very thin coat!  (Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  9. SKIP TO #12 IF nails are not peeling/brittle/weak/damaged.  If you have normal nails just using Foundation Gel  as your base.  **Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail. If needed apply 2 thin layers of the Gelish strengthener.  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  10.  Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.) Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.(This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails!)  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in the LED Light for 10 seconds.  10b NEXT  .. \\&quot;STRUCTURE GEL.  NOTE:  dot a small amount of base coat on each nail with the brush. Then, wipe the rest of the gel off of the brush. Use the mostly dry brush to spread the small amount of product on your nail. I even wipe the brush off between each nail. This ensures a thin layer OR WILL PEEL!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds. (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails but Structure Gel is a wonderful strong product!.)  11. If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  DO NOT USE CLEANSER... this is a DRY cleaning.  12.  Apply Gelish Color Coat of Choice. First, seal the free edge of the nail. Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer. APPLICATION SHOULD BE ALMOST SEE-THROUGH ON 1st COAT!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  13.  Repeat Step 11, 12 &amp; 13 for 2nd color coat.  14.  Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER). First seal the free edge. Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION. If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  15.  Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.  16.  Use cuticle oil nightly  as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:  a.  I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light .. with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.  b.  I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  I do this as I go as it is easier to do while wet .. IMPOSSIBLE after the LED light!c.  Peeling: If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra  for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula, this was the culprit in my second  Gelish kit.&lt;br /&gt;d.  By searching and finally finding a regular nail polish (Sally Hansen \\&quot;#350 Heart to Heart\\&quot; Diamond Strength No Chip Nail Color) close to my gel polish (gelish \\&quot;Tiger Blossum-Item #01334) I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  Not looking great toward the end but tolerable!  In the beginning it is merely \\&quot;tipping\\&quot; the nails .. ie using the #350 to color the tip of the nails after they wear off.  I find I must do this nearly every day .. just do this as I put on my make up .. being careful of the finger tips as I apply my make up.  Then as the gel gets to be 2-3 to 4 weeks old my nail beds have grown out at least 1/4\\&quot;.  I then carefully add the #350 around the upper nail bed .. then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  I get another week out of it .. YEAH!&lt;br /&gt;e.

I was always using my Iphone as a timer backup for the UV lamp so this was really nice.  I found that the replacement bulbs for the UV lamp were almost $30, and the LED lamp is supposed to last 35,000 hours - so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;TECH TIPS: [...]&lt;br /&gt;Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  For best performance follow recommended cure times.&lt;br /&gt;**I think the soaking the Gel polish off in Acetone every time they come in weakens the nail bed as well. I make my client only wear it ever third time they get a manicure. I don&#x27;t care what they say...it does make the nail a little weaker because of the soaking and scrapping. [...]**clients who like to peel the product off, I believe this may be why subsequent applications are not working. They are taking the top layer of keratin off. I always caution my clients not do to this and if they do, they cannot expect the product to perform the way it&#x27;s designed to do. **Do buy a bottle of cuticle oil and use it over your Shellac every day (I keep mine next to my bed and put it on at night when I set my alarm) as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking. **there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now. Gelish, Geleration, Axxium, Gelicure... lots of them. They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.  **Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first, some, all of the above.&lt;br /&gt;**  [...]&lt;br /&gt;TIPS I PICKED UP FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:&lt;br /&gt;*****GELISH STRUCTURE GEL  **I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine. I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  .. Purpose: Used to strengthen weak nails OR to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips. Use this product after the Gelish Foundation (BASE) step has been completed  Directions: Apply 1-3 thin coats depending upon nail strength desired; curing between each application. When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail. Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail. You want to minimize the times you lift the brush from the product so as not to incorporate air bubbles. Once the nail is covered with the sculpting gel, turn your hand over keeping it level for 1 minute. This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape. Cure as directed between each application. See requirements for the cure time needed  Requirements: Gelish structure must be cured with an LED lamp or UV lamp system. LED cure time 30 seconds. 36W UV Lamp - 2 minutes  Note: For me this is a must have product. I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application. This helps to equal out the level differences between the two. On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip. Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top If Off as the final step .  **.  **Apply with a nail art brush.  **I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel. I dry brushed that layer as well and finished applying layers as directed. The end result is fantastic.  **The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  **Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  **Notice this is called a clean up brush. That is what it does. It will even up your French manicure very easily. Don&#x27;t know how anyone can do a French manicure without one. I wanted to try the French tip look with the CND Shellac process I do at home and purchased this brush for that specific purpose. This brush made even this amateur try look professional. This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand. No bristles were loose nor have any fallen out.

            <li> Absolutely love the Gelish products.  I&#x27;ve never been able to keep my nails long for more than a week.  The gelish products make my nails hard and long (sounds a little kinky, huh???).  My manicure lasts over 3 weeks - I only re-do the polish as my nails have grown out too far.    This product is so easy to use and keeps me from having to spend $30 at the nail salon!  Just love it!</li>
            <li> Gelish is a decent UV-cured gel - it does stay on well and retains shine for at least a week or two (less of you wash a lot of dishes). It&#x27;s actually great for pedicures because it lasts a month or more down on the toes without chipping or peeling. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to get it off. You have to soak your fingers in nail polish remover, and that is HELL on your skin. If you already have compromised skin around your nails, I don&#x27;t recommend this, as the removal soaks will cause extreme drying, rashes, and possibly bleeding, cracked cuticles if you are sensitive to the remover.</li>
            <li> Must have the top coat for shellac manicures for that shine and hard finish.  I do cure the top coat for 3 minutes under the lights, 2 minutes on the color coats!</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with the gelish top coat and base. They work like a charm! They give enough strenght for my nails to actually grow out. Awesome stuff!  I found the Harmony Gelish products to be thinner than normal nail polish so you want to be cleaning your brush often otherwise it runs onto your skin. No problem if it does - just wipe it off, but to avoid it just keep a little bit on the brush. Love how this stuff just evens out on it&#x27;s own to give you that prefectly smooth look.  Don&#x27;t forget to wipe the top coat (after being cured) off with alcohol to get the tacky off and make sure it is set well. I have been using 2 min intervals with each step in a 36 watt UV lamp and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before - but I just HAVE to write that I LOVE LOVE LOVE Gelish.  I&#x27;m not an crazy nail obsessed lady - just a mom who wants to look nice once in a while.  I&#x27;ve had my manicure on for one week an it looks just as good as the first day I put the polish on.  There was a slight learning curve involved -   1.  Use really thin layers - thinner than you think you should.  2.  If you&#x27;re in doubt about curing time - just cure it 30 sec. to 1 min more with the 36 w lamp.  3.  Fix any mistakes (polish on cuticle, pooling polish, etc..) BEFORE you cure.  Really - this system is awesome.  I recommend buying the polishes here on amazon.  Sally beauty supply is the only store near me that sells them - and the bottles they sell are 10$ and half the amount of polish (.25 oz).  I&#x27;ll never go back to regular nail polishes that chip and peel and lose their gloss.    Now, if I could just figure out what to do with my collection of OPI!</li>
            <li> I have used other products, but they haven&#x27;t stayed on as well.  My hands are washed often and I wear latex gloves a good part of my work day, and this product has stayed on great!  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish Top it off polish. It&#x27;s super shiny and very durable. I&#x27;m big fan of the Gelish product line.</li>
            <li> I do like the gelish, but do not like having to scuff up my nails.  I prefer CND.  But this does seal and gives a nice shine.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moG6S8TEGJXZMD]]This is the final touch to sealing your new Gelish nail polish job and it adds a lot to the final look and performance.  It seals the polish and adds in a nice and glossy finish to the nail&#x27;s surface.  This is what helps to make the polish stay on for two weeks.  Don&#x27;t forget to paint the front edge of the nail to seal it also.  This helps prevent chipping and pealing.  After you cure the UV Top It Off then wipe your nail lightly with an alcohol swab to remove any uncured polish or Top It Off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and the women of the family just love Gelish products and they are the best quality polishes we have found.  This bottle is 0.50 ounces and the local stores sell the 0.30 ounce sizes for more money than the bigger bottle on Amazon.  It is like getting 66% more for less money. This is a great product and I rate it as a 5 star item for its quality and look.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect top coat. Afer applying the gelish color, you apply this and the shine is unbelieveable! Love gelish. super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> High shine and durability for your Gelish Manicure that lasts for weeks.  This is a must have for any Gelish manicure, but I also use it will other brands of gel polish.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an artist who&#x27;s been painting her nails&lt;br /&gt;for quite some time, though. If this happens to&lt;br /&gt;be the case for someone buying the Gelish set,&lt;br /&gt;it takes a lot of practice to get used to this&lt;br /&gt;procedure, especially for a French.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to save money and do it myself. I bought the:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Foundation&lt;br /&gt;2. pH Bond&lt;br /&gt;3. Sleek White&lt;br /&gt;4. Top It Off&lt;br /&gt;5. Nourish - which smells AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my moms UV light which was great&lt;br /&gt;that I didn&#x27;t have to buy. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s so&lt;br /&gt;old that I don&#x27;t know how strong the bulb is so&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty much guessing on cure times.&lt;br /&gt;There are just a cople French Gelish Manicure videos&lt;br /&gt;on YouTube but I wish there were more. I am having such&lt;br /&gt;a hard time making the white perfect on myself. I even&lt;br /&gt;recently bought self-adhesive reinforcement circles&lt;br /&gt;to help make the line more perfect. We&#x27;ll see how that goes.</li>
            <li> True clear coat that is easy to use and cures nicely. I have used this over other gel polish and traditional polishes with great results.</li>
            <li> this topcoat is great! I use it over my NORMAL (NOT GEL) nail polish, then wait for that to dry, and top it with my Gelish topcoat.  Seal it under my UV Lamp and it is perfect for 1.5 weeks! Save time and money at the salon and do it at home by yourself.  One time of doing your nails yourself pays for itself (including the UV Lamp and the topcoat!).  Couldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff more.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Gelish and their whole brand of nail polish. This is the best top coat out there- I&#x27;ve tried this, OPI, and Shellac. Using this, I can get a full 10-12 days out of my gel nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of tips: make sure to SHAKE WELL. If you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;ll go on too thick. Put a thin coat on. If you put too thick of a coat on, it will bubble. Avoid the sides of your nails. When you cure this under the light, it will spread so and case the polish to go on your skin and it will lift off your nail. I do my 4 fingers on one hand, then my 2 thumbs, and then the 4 fingers on the other hand. Don&#x27;t try and cram your whole hand in the light- it&#x27;ll make your fingers lay weird and won&#x27;t cure evenly. Finally, if you notice bubbles when you&#x27;re in the painting process, don&#x27;t worry. This top coat will smooth it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this top coat! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I found the Harmony gelish products were great. I didn&#x27;t think about  a top coat but it is a must have when doing shellac nails and it is  a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this gel top coat. I use it with gel polish and also with regular polish and it holds the bond tightly.</li>
            <li> This top coat hardens my nails, and keeps them nice and shiny! Works amazing of course with gelish nail polish!</li>
            <li> Wat can I say is the best sealer gel top, I love it I use it with my other regular nail polish n it works good for me!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST gel top coat out there! I love it! No matter how bumpy your nails appear, once you put this on, they appear smooth and glossy! It lasts amazingly well. It is pretty runny, so use caution when applying it!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it along with the Gelish PH Bond and Foundation along with my gel color and it last until I&#x27;m ready to take it off.  I get two weeks wear out of it before it&#x27;s time to remove it.  The only reason I can&#x27;t go any longer is do to my nails growing out.  I love the shine it gives as well as the added strength it provides my nails.  I highly recommend it.  Debi B.</li>
            <li> I have always used CND&#x27;s top coat becuase its what I already had when I started with Gelish. I recently purchased Top it Off and wasnt surprised to find it \\&quot;runny\\&quot; compared to CND. Its just a little harder to work with and something I will get used to, but Gelish has never disapointed me. The price was definetly better than CND, so Ill give this a fair chance. I have read where you can \\&quot;chill\\&quot; the product to give a thicker consistancy before use? I may give that a shot. All in all, I am a huge Gelish fan and am very happy with all my purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE****&lt;br /&gt;So afer using Top it Off for about 4 sets of nails I am not as happy as i thought i would be. I love Gelish products but this clear coat just isnt for me. I am a tanner and this product turns yellow after one time in the tanning booth. I do not have any yellowing with CND&#x27;s top coat. I will use up the bottle I have (which will be a while, a little goes a long way!) on solid colors, but its not for my pink and white&#x27;s by any means...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this polish for a year now (yes, it still works!) and ever since I use it about once every 2 or 3 weeks. It sets well, leaves a nice shine &amp; makes my nails feel harder than with regular polish alone (so they grow a little).&lt;br /&gt;I have used this alone without a base and as a base (works both ways)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great polish. does need to be soaked off tho, even after a year of having the same bottle (the consistency has gotten a little thicker but not unusable). what can i say? i found a great product and don&#x27;t want to part with it till it&#x27;s completely gone or unusable</li>
            <li> My wife uses this with the other product and keeps her &amp;#34;office&amp;#34; nails pretty and strong. She uses every week!</li>
            <li> I did not find this product to last as long as it should.</li>
            <li> This product is my best find of the year. No ridges, just smooth and shiny nails. My manicures are hard and strong and last up to 2 weeks. If I get a chip, (usually along the tips of my pointer fingers)  I just apply a drop of Top It Off to the chip and seal it under the LED light for 30 seconds. That&#x27;s it! FIXED! I often use non-gel nail polish under Top It Off and it sets the manicure hard. You must let the nail polish dry before sealing it with Top It Off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to save money and has the time and the talent to paint their own nails. An LED light is required to set the Top It Off gel. These lamps are available on Amazon. There are lots of YouTube videos to show you how to use this product and do your own gel manicures. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Shine is perfect and application is easy.&lt;br /&gt;This product self levels so it is very forgiving&lt;br /&gt;to the inexperienced nail polisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requires UV lamp treatment time as do all Gelish&lt;br /&gt;polish components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No bad smell...highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.  I only wear Harmony Gelish nail polish because its the best!!  Beautiful top coat keeps a gorgeous shine and makes my nails look so pretty.  I&#x27;m a DIY girl, so this bottle will last me forever!!  I bought this bottle a year ago, use it twice a month ... and I still have about 1/4 of the bottle left.  Only a small amout is needed to finish the last step of the process to give your nails a truly beautiful shine!!! Love love love!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go without topping of my nails without this.  It has and keeps a beautiful nail shine for weeks!</li>
            <li> this is by far the best uv top coat i have ever used!! i tried using ibd intense seal top coat and it sucks, cracks in one day and a total waste of money but gelish is perfect over regular nail polish. it stays glossy for days and has a smooth finish i hope it lasts for 2 weeks, if it does i will buy this product faithfully</li>
            <li> Made polish last much longer and super shiny!!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> The base and the top it off from gelish is the best , i could use any gel polish from any company and use base and top from gelish</li>
            <li> Great product, more cost effective than Shellac top coat and works just as great.  It leaves a nice shiny finish.</li>
            <li> Great product. Will order again</li>
            <li> iT WAS EVERYTHING THAT IT SAID IT WAS &amp; MORE! LOVE HOW IT MADE MY NAILS SHINY &amp; LAST EVEN LONGER!!</li>
            <li> I got this item with the base coat and color polish. They all work great. I love how this leaves your nails shiny until you take it off. If you want shiny glass looking nails you can add an extra coat.</li>
            <li> Gotta have top it off, don&#x27;t skip on this.  It makes every color extremely shiny.  Your Gelish color will bling in the sunlight!</li>
            <li> I use this with any gel product and even cover regular nail polish with it for a fast-dry, glossy finish that covers lines, bumps and bubbles. Just be sure to cure with LED or ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li> Excellent as always!!! I love gelish brand the best and this Gelish top coat is best of all gel type top coats! I use this for manis and pedis, with gel polishes and my awesome uv machine at home.  You can even go out and get a regular/non gel professional pedicure,  then go home and put a coat of this on top, cure it for two minutes and make your pedicure last twice as long!!!! P.s. the bottle is huge! Compared to the tiny ones from Sally beauty supply in town.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to give it five stars. I mainly bought this polish to mix with some polish my daughter bought for me that wasn&#x27;t staying on very well. I read a review somewhere that said that they mixed the UV polish that wasn&#x27;t curing with some clear on foil and their polish worked. I did it and now I can use the three bottles I received for Christmas!</li>
            <li> This top coat is shiny, self-leveling,  hard as a rock and durable. I wear two coats on top of my gel mani and I beat the crap out of my hands, because I work as a nurse. So, my hands take a beating.  My nails are used as tools, get knocked into things, get slammed in med drawers, and banged against treatment carts. This polish holds up to two weeks,  or more, of mistreatment every single time. Can&#x27;t live without it. Tried other top coats and they don&#x27;t compare,  not even the stuff they were applying in the salons.</li>
            <li> Good top coat, a little runny but very shiny and lasts a good amount of time, cures fast</li>
            <li> I bought the gel system to do at home. I bought all of the items on-line including the top/base gels and the colors and the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This top coat is great! It is so easy to use. I priced buying everything in the store and let me save you some time - do not buy these from Sally&#x27;s. They are the mini&#x27;s and so over priced. This is the full size bottle and is a great price and a great product! I am so excited to try all of my colors but since the polish lasts so long I have to wait! :)</li>
            <li> I love gel nail polish! I bought this in combination with some other gelish products, so that I didn&#x27;t have to keep paying $30ish everytime I wanted my nails to look great for 3 or so weeks at a time. Also, this seller was very quick with shipping. I was on a bit of a time crunch to get this, but I went with the regular shipping anyway - and I still got it in time! Thank you!</li>
            <li> my nail lady used this stuff so i bought a bottle for myself so i can start doing my own gel manicures at home. it&#x27;s a fantastic consistency and doesn&#x27;t get a lot of bubbles. i use it over the opi axxium gel base</li>
            <li> I really want this Gelish to work out for us.  I bought the products for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and we did our nails today.  I had a big problem with the foundation and the top it off.  Those two products hardened on the brush so that by the 4th nail the brushes were hard and thick with the product and would not go on smoothly.  Has anyone else had that problem and is there a solution?  Everything else went on nicely.  But our nails look bumpy from the clumped products.</li>
            <li> I save a ton of money by doing this from home - I got the starter kit has a yule gift and have continued to add to my collection with no regrets</li>
            <li> I wish the Top it Off came with a shorter brush like the foundation base does. Works great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I do my nails at home and love the Gelish Harmony product.  A bottle of this will last you a long time, I have been doing my nails with this at home for well over a year, and still have plenty left.</li>
            <li> I use this over regular nail polish and it holds the polish on longer. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Gelish is the best top coat.</li>
            <li> I use all of Gelish&#x27;s products and especially the top coat. I used to use the sally hansen brand top coat and my color would start to peal the neck day! This is great and haven&#x27;t had to deal with any pealing. You get more out of the product when you use all the same brand polishes. This is a must have!</li>
            <li> I got my first gel nail manicure this year and was so impressed that I decided to figure it out DIY. I watched a few YouTube videos, (gotta love YouTube), and found out the only things I needed were the base, the topcoat, and the lamp! I don&#x27;t have oily nails so the pH prep stuff wasn&#x27;t necessary for me. I just wipe a strong alcohol (90%) on and that&#x27;s sufficient. You really have to make sure to *lightly* buff the nail with an emery block first to give it some traction for the base coat. Then, apply it super, super *thin*. The blunted brush helps out a lot with that. I use whatever color I like from my polish stash and then apply the top coat. Once dry, (which is kinda weird since it&#x27;s tacky), you hit it with a *lint-free* cloth with the alcohol again and you have a beautiful, lasting, *WET* shine like you just left the salon! A good wattage lamp is imperative to set, (I bought a 36-watt for a good price here too), and as long as you cure well between coats, you&#x27;re all set!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these items.  I t is saving me bunches of money/  I even do my families and friends nails for a small fee.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one bottle of this in the past 2 years with my nails nearly always manicured. It gives a great, wet-looking shine.</li>
            <li> Used with the gelish polish etc it is just like the salon. I don&#x27;t use regular polish anymore because this is dry when you finish...much easier. I have even used regular polish under this which works just as well.</li>
            <li> I just used this product yesterday. I put on the Nail Bliss French Manicure set. These are white French tips that are not tip extensions. They are like a nail \\&quot;cap\\&quot; that fits to the edge of your natural nail and supports it as it grows out.  I have several fingernails that are really a wreck from using gel polish (namely Nailene) and am growing them out.  This Gelish foundation seal was used over the French manicure set as a top coat and it dried quickly with a mirror-like glossy finish. My nails should last at least 2 weeks with this product. Yes, you do have to soak it off, but to keep your nails strong and from chipping, breaking, splitting or peeling, this product cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> Received it on time. Package looked good.</li>
            <li> I really like this Gelish top coat by Hand and Nail Harmony. Glides on smooth but thick enough to cover well. I definitely prefer it to the Shellac version!</li>
            <li> Ingredients:  Di-Hema Trimethylhexyl Dicarbamate, HEMA, Hydroxypropyl Methacrylate, Hydroxycyclohexyl Phenyl Ketone, Violet 2 (CL 60725).  Has the same chemical ingredients as the Gelish Structure Gel (Clear) but is a thinner viscosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose:  Used as the final coat in a gelish manicure to protect applied nail polish color and to enhance shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:  Apply a very thin coat to the nail and cure.  When applying, wipe the product from one side of the brush applicator back into the bottle neck.  With the remaining product that is left in the brush, apply the gel over your polish of choice up to but not touching cuticle line.  Ensure you swipe the nail tip end.  See requirements for the cure time needed.  Use Gelish Cleanser to remove the remaining residue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements:  The Hand &amp; Nail Harmony Gelish Top It Off must be cured with a 12W UVLED lamp or 36W UV lamp.  LED cure time - 20 seconds; 36W UV cure time - 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I have found it is much easier and more economical to purchase acrylic (water-base) paints and mix my own color of choice for my nail polish.  I cover this with the Top It Off gel ensuring I swipe my nail tip to protect the acrylic water-based paint.  This will last the same amount of time as does the Gelish Soak Off Gel Nail Polish which is an average cost of $10 per .5oz bottle.  I am guaranteed my removal time will be 10 minutes or less and I save a fortune by not having to buy expensive nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I bought this having used gel nails once before. I had gotten tired of my nail polish starting to chip after 2 or 3 days, so I thought why not. I used my regular polish and then applied this, uv cured and Tada! Its amazing. I forgot about wiping it off with alcohol after curing but once that was done it was amazing. Super shiny and my friends at work want to come over and do theirs too. I will definitely be purchasing this again, no doubt about it.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product and it works great for the gel look @ home.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly, cheaper than Sally&#x27;s smaller size plus no tax.... I have been playing with gel polish for some time now so thought I would try this sealer brand.  I don&#x27;t like to have the same color for 2-3 weeks so I personally don&#x27;t use the base.  I use a gel color cure it with light, then sealer cure it with light, wipe all nails with cotton ball dipped in alcohol and done.  When I change my color 2-5 days later I just soak a piece of cotton ball in remover wrap the nail in a aluminum foil strip for 15 mins. and scrape it off.  With this sealer I did not ever have to scrape it off, I filed the nail bed to break the seal up a little did my foil wraps and 10 mins. later it came off without having to scrape.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. Itâ€™s so very easy to apply. Help on application is on You Tube and on Gelish.com. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year or so and now this is all I use. Gelish is So much cheaper than Acrylic nails at the salon. If you have the time this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gelish by Harmony for a few years now and this soak off gel is the best on the market!</li>
            <li> This top coat works great and I swear by the gelish brand, time and time again, because it always looks great and it is easy.</li>
            <li> All the greatness of a salon manicure at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> :) Nice and work fine :)</li>
            <li> I think I got an old bottle or something!  I left my fingers under the UV light for 10 mins, it never dried!  Total waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> This gelish nail top coat is great stuff.  I have tried it and with a 32watt If nail drier am able to do my own nails at home and put a fresh top coat on a manicure to extend the time between a new one.  Really a good product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product once a week for several weeks now.  I use it over my regular polish (not special, gel polish) and it works great to keep my mani shiny and from chipping.  I change my polish once a week now.  Of course, an LED light is needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased the gelish top coat to use for work and myself. As far as I know, gelish is a cheap, good quality brand. Shellac chips within a week for me, and opi gel color is good, but a bit more expensive. Would definitely recommend gelish for anybody wanting to try out gel color polish for the first time.</li>
            <li> Large bottles (bigger than CND) and good prices. Product goes on smoothly. Nice amount. seals nicely. Was packaged carefully and arrived promptly. All around very happy.</li>
            <li> I bought the Foundation Gel and the Top It Off, they&#x27;re both great products, I&#x27;ve started using the Konad Stamping System, and I have to say that it makes a great difference when applying it after the Top It Off.  The reason is that if you make a mistake, you just wipe it off with non-acetone, and it will do nothing to the nail that is already painted!  Love the Gelish Products, they&#x27;re worth it every Penney!!</li>
            <li> I use this as a top coat over my regular nail polish,  it&#x27;s my lil secret to make my the regular polish last for more than 2 days.  Set lasts for a weekðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> This is amazing better than using acrylic  just is good to know how to applied the product just as its needed</li>
            <li> I use Gelish nail polish all the time. It truly last for a few weeks and the only reason you need to take it off is because your nails grow out. Definitely would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shellac nail polish for nearly 2 years and typically use CND brand.  After reading reviews, I decided to try this brand for my top coat.  It&#x27;s really quite good!  It&#x27;s not thick and sticky, goes on nice and smooth.  Sometimes the CND gets thick and then you get wrinkles in your polish after exposing it to the light.  This is also a full ounce compared to a half ounce of CND brand, so it&#x27;s a very good deal.  I recommend it if you&#x27;re doing your own shellac nails at home.  You will be happy you tried it!</li>
            <li> Gelish soak off sealer gel top it off&lt;br /&gt;good product, easy to use, dry fast under any type of uv light.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  After a lot of experimentation, I&#x27;ve settled on using OPI gelcolor base coat, a variety of different gel nail polish colors, and Gelish top it off.  That gives me the perfect combination of easy soak-off and GORGEOUS shine.  Nothing I&#x27;ve tried shines as beautifully as Gelish top it off, and keeps its shine til I decide to soak off.  I&#x27;ve cured it with a sensationail LED, red carpet manicure LED, and now with my Harmony 18g LED and it&#x27;s cured well under all three.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This top coat works great but it is so sensitive to light. The brush has hardened on Every bottle that I have gotten within a 1-2 months even though I keep it stored in a cool dark place. It literally hardens just from my table lamp</li>
            <li> Works great with all the gelish products.</li>
            <li> this is a great top coat for gel polish, truly prevent cracks and chipping,  highly recommend gelish products.  a++++++++++++++ product.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, it amazing!! Reviewers complain about it being tacking after they&#x27;re done using the UV light. That&#x27;s because you need to use alcohol to finish the job!! Gives it a beautiful shine that lasts for weeks!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good gell clear top coat however my brush on the inside is mangled and I have to use another polish brush. I think this was a batch of defects I should have sent it back.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 years now... I have noticed that the bristles become very stiff. It really makes the application thick and not as smooth. I purchased Essie top and base coat... WhoA!! What a difference with application. Its thinner does not chip and bristles seem to be better. It did cost an arm and a leg but well worth the results!!</li>
            <li> My nails look amazingly shiny, I used it over regular nail polish to make it last over two weeks!! The best investment I&#x27;ve ever done.</li>
            <li> Awesome product - I cure this over my regular dry polish...usually wait 12 hours after painting my nails.  The top coat keeps my polish from chipping a good 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;And then comes off easily after buffing the surface.</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat for your no chip manicure. However, make sure you do not have it close to the light as it will curate the actual polish and turn it hard. Which will then make you purchase another bottle. I did this and wasted a full bottle of it. But I do love the product and will continue using this brand for my no chip manicures.</li>
            <li> ..its a decent price and i love it. I love my gels and i hope i never stop doing them!</li>
            <li> Delivery etc was great, the gel polish is excellent! Upstate NY winter involves mouse protection - I was stuffing steel wool into crevices and the polish looked brand new!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as my top coat since I started using the gelish polishes.  It goes on smoothly and works great.</li>
            <li> Harmony products are wonderful and I will continue to order them. The colors are wonderful as well. You cannot go wrong with this product line.</li>
