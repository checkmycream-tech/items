            <li>There is NOTHING to fear in using this product, if your know to use a clarifying shampoo (a shampoo with sulfates) and a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>I would still buy this product though because it makes my hair look good, but after I have taken car of it because of the damage.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll it straightened my hair good</li>
            <li>lol Hope this helps someone :)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>

            <li>Okay I originally thought this was awesome!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love that!</li>
            <li>this kit is amazing it truly works for me.</li>
            <li>and I honestly believe I am going to go the distance.</li>
            <li>SOOOO beautiful, I never knew I had natural hair so beautiful.  </li>
            <li>the shampoo my hair felt squeaky clean which was great.</li>
            <li>make sure you follow the instructions, overall its a great product hopefully they can perfect it so others can benefit too.</li>
            <li>If you wanted to straighten your hair for a special event or something i would say get this,Do it the day of or before then WASH IT OUT!!</li>
            <li>also added some heat protectant oils to my hair after the conditioner just to be safe (and honestly, i didn&#x27;t skimp on the oils.</li>
            <li>Best product by far.  </li>
            <li>I must admit that after washing it with the anti-reversion shampoo and conditioner, I added my own stuff to my hair and it was more moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine shoulder length hair and this product worked.</li>
            <li>Easy!</li>
            <li>I am post-menopausal and suffer from night sweats and my hair is still going STRONG!</li>
            <li>My first impression after taking it out of the box was that I was happy it was a shampoo and conditioner and</li>
            <li>The hair got curly,  but it became softer than before I used the beautiful texture naturally straight on her hair.  </li>
            <li>The product was too good to be true and it was...</li>
            <li>The shampoo is kind of strong.</li>
            <li>I love this product  </li>
            <li>and I both love it.</li>
            <li>it may work better for others.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if this made it any better.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would have lasted 4 to 6 weeks</li>
            <li>Best of all, I had no heat damage four weeks later  when I washed it out.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>but it was okay.</li>
            <li>So I figured relaxer-free, my hair should be able to hold up even better...</li>
            <li>Even beauty salons haven&#x27;t been able to get my hair</li>
            <li>I will be buying it in bulk and using it,no more perms for me.</li>
            <li>It got my hair almost too straight lolol.</li>
            <li>i used it for my daughter&#x27;s hair, it was ok not what i was expecting theo.</li>
            <li>I get better results without it.</li>
            <li>I love the way that my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>My hair had more body to it</li>
            <li>and my hair still looks ok.</li>
            <li>thing I noticed is that my hair seems to be shedding more, but maybe not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shampoo each section as many times as needed and rebraid it.</li>
            <li>It still took me 3 hours, but that has more to do with me and my hair than the product.</li>
            <li>I think it works better for people with a looser curl pattern</li>
            <li>I was hoping to try this product to see if the results would be better.  </li>
            <li>Just okay for me.  </li>
            <li>I found something that works better,  but will not advertise here.</li>
            <li>I believe I would have achieved better results.</li>
            <li>will say that the end result was absolutely stunning.  </li>
            <li>Afterward, I rolled my hair using flexi-rods and my curls were stunning.  </li>
            <li>so I sure it wouldn&#x27;t work for me in the summer time    </li>
            <li>Overall,  I would say this product was the best I ever used.  </li>
            <li>Also to be on the safe side</li>
            <li>But the best part of all is definitely the body and bounce!</li>
            <li>I was expecting more for the price.</li>
            <li>Then I put the leave in conditioner in just as the directions recommended and my hair felt more tangled.</li>
            <li>after blow drying my hair felt even more poofier.</li>
            <li>I made sure that my roots received the attention that it needed with the product.  </li>
            <li>and so to be able to feel that... bothered me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M IN LOVE.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I watched so many YT reviews on the TMS system and everyone said &amp;#34;don&#x27;t over saturate&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My hair looked more like a blow out than the supposed straighten look on the box.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it, it gets better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this system.</li>
            <li>That couldn&#x27;t possibly be good for the scalp, right?</li>
            <li>This product is perfect because it allows you to flat iron your hair</li>
            <li>I flat iron it again and hair still flawless</li>
            <li>The products that I have tried, Mizani for one; which I thought was pretty good, but it did not stop the kitchen area (hair at the nape of the neck) from reverting.</li>
            <li>and my hair looked pretty good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s safe to say my once curly gorgeous natural hair is ruined!!!</li>
            <li>Good product, thanks.</li>
            <li>Love this product thought originally it would do nothing for my hair</li>
            <li>Easy application.</li>
            <li>My hair turned out so bouncy and full, even better than I could have imagined.</li>
            <li>it has rained a couple of times and my hair is still fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>and it still held up fine.</li>
            <li>my hair has always gotten really fine</li>
            <li>When I wanted to revert to my curls, a quick wash is all it took!</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s very much indeed true to its claim!!</li>
            <li>Eventually, I found this, and now I can proudly say that  there is no need for me to ever go back to relaxers.</li>
            <li>That is the primarily risk with using this product</li>
            <li>I need this to prevent reversion after all that work, which seems to be the primary marketed goal of this product.  </li>
            <li>So with my daughter i went against the instructions and did not apply the leave in lightly.</li>
            <li>To Beautiful Textures I say, do not change a thing about this product, nor any of the products that goes with this system,as so far, they have all worked just exactly the way the maker said they should.</li>
            <li>In the spring summer months, it&#x27;s the most challenging to stay straight with all the humidity in the NY area.</li>
            <li>I overly satisfied just being able to have straight non frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>its 90 degrees, in my car in traffic, hot flashing like noones business..got out car hair is blowing in the wind, still holding up!!</li>
            <li>Although I do know exactly why it is working, and how to care for it in spite of its most important ingredient(s);</li>
            <li>Overall an excellent product that I&#x27;ve used twice so far with really fantastic results</li>
            <li>It has been about a year since I applied this product to my daughter&#x27;s hair and it still hasn&#x27;t returned to its original condition.  </li>
            <li>I was quite excited to use this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair; however, my excitement waned after using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited an have been telling my family and friends.</li>
            <li>My hair is super smooth and bouncy.</li>
            <li>There are no products in the box besides the special shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>Still this product didn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
            <li>The results were good and my roots are more textlax look and feel versus the initial application that got my roots straight.</li>
            <li>I loved this product and will probably use it again next fall!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to go relaxer-free even before the natural movement was popular, but I&#x27;ve never desired the kinky, coily look.</li>
            <li>but I do know that I have what would be considered by most to be very kinky African-American hair.</li>
            <li>and I have not been able to get my hair this straight in a looong time.</li>
            <li>So my true test of this product will be to use it this summer and see if it can stand up against summer humidity, which i think it will.</li>
            <li>Then rinse the whole head off, to make sure there&#x27;s no shampoo</li>
            <li>I just like my curls better than I do straight hair at this point.  </li>
            <li>They give u a sample of both and the full bottles are sold separately.</li>
            <li>also it would be better if they were to tell you about how much product you should have it</li>
            <li>hair stayed straight during a weekend of rain and being misted on, and straightened much more quickly.</li>
            <li>I have pretty strong hair.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this product after hearing all the great reviews from other naturals.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply more to my roots in subsequent washes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>; So, seems like the ends don&#x27;t revert as quickly</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have extraordinary expectations.</li>
            <li>So my plan is to use it 2-3 times a year when I&#x27;m wanting to do length checks and show off my gorgeous long locks.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to get my natural hair to look that good from flat ironing it before.</li>
            <li>I did notice that when I washed my hair with my own shampoo and conditioner that  I didn&#x27;t have as much shrinkage as I normally do.</li>
            <li>I used the leftover in my daughter&#x27;s 3a hair but her hair is easy to blow straight</li>
            <li>I have tired so many products that promised to do what Beautiful Textures</li>
            <li>overall it&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>This product does, literally, exactly what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li>This Product is a must have for anyone looking to &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34; back-n-forth from curly to straight!!</li>
            <li>I can wear my hair straight, silky and smooth for up to two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 6 weeks now and my hair reverted but it seems as if the texture is more manageable when I do my natural styles.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the effort</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the try</li>
            <li>an soft i love it</li>
            <li>Motions smoothing system was the first one that I tried and I was impressed with how it soften the hair in the kitchen area, but at the first sign of humidity or rain it reverted right back, and I once again found myself with the flat iron in my hand within two or three days time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just aren&#x27;t doing it right</li>
            <li>It must work, so I&#x27;ll do her hair differently right?</li>
            <li>So right now I&#x27;m using shea moisture</li>
            <li>I was very interested in using this product based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Normally, kinky-haired people would need to use a lot of oil to prevent damage, but this system allows your hair to stay light and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I will try it once more to make sure I am applying it correctly and I will leave it on a little longer.</li>
            <li>When I reversed her hair to natural, it was easy.  </li>
            <li>The last time I had experienced this was when I paid $300 for a keratin treatment but even then I don&#x27;t remember my hair having such shine and movement!&lt;br</li>
            <li>not sure if that actually helps or not to be honest, but it makes me feel good about it)</li>
            <li>I would love to get back to swimming but have to figure out the right regime.</li>
            <li>(i have very very nappy 4c hair</li>
            <li>It did exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>Does not do anything to help your hair go from nappy to straight at all!</li>
            <li>Followed the directions exactly...</li>
            <li>I am pleased, but will wait to determine if I will use this product again after I see how my hair reverts back to kinky...</li>
            <li>have tried so many smoothing systems and my hair has defeated everyone last one of them.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li>This product worked exactly as I needed it to.</li>
            <li>However, getting through the initial steps were more than an undertaking.  </li>
            <li>My hair is mostly type 3c with a patch of 3a in the front and a patch of 3b in the back.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I applied this system three weeks ago, and my hair is STILL straight!</li>
            <li>i was kinda worried at first that it wouldn&#x27;t straighten it</li>
            <li>Next time I use the system I will saturate my hair more with the product.</li>
            <li>I have mostly 4A hair in the back.  </li>
            <li>It did not respond well when it was first applied and reverted almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I deep condition before I use the shampoo to make sure my hair is in an optimal state to take on heat styling.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use this kit because I have the actual Beautiful Textures shampoo, leave-in and other styling products.</li>
            <li>I was able to flat iron it</li>
            <li>I have stubborn 4C hair that I have not been able to flat iron</li>
            <li>Making the effort to do so seemed futile since most naturals have poofy hair within days of flat ironing.</li>
            <li>I think that i was overly conservative with the leave in potion because one side came out beautifully and the other side was poofy and seemed to want to revert within the hour after flat ironing.</li>
            <li>had followed its simple instructions to a tee, and as a result I got lovely, shiny, straight hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, disclaimer</li>
            <li>first use of shampoo and conditioner was a much better detangle and dry.</li>
            <li>My hair is perm straight and had soooo much body!</li>
            <li>My hair was silky smooth, and as I am typing this, I am over a week in with the product and after working out, attending a party outside in the heat, and experiencing daily life, most of the straightness has hung around.</li>
            <li>and so that&#x27;s just pretty much my opinion on that.</li>
            <li>My hair was still straight, but not as straight as the first time.</li>
            <li>it pretty much did nothing to keep that straight....</li>
            <li>its main Go-To parts for what keeps our hair straight &amp; resistant to humidity &amp; the like!</li>
            <li>I live in very hot climate in excess of over a hundred degrees and high humidity.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s straight but not as straight</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>The system is supposed to keep the length of your hair straight</li>
            <li>However after 1 day the straight look has started to revert.</li>
            <li>For those who want to know, I have very kinky hair with the tiniest coils</li>
            <li>and I would recommend to any transitioned or someone who wants to spice up their hair routine.</li>
            <li>This product was very damaging to my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>(Gloves are inside, but I really see no use for them, as there is no burning or staining without them.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to worry much about heat damage.</li>
            <li>this straight.</li>
            <li>so all u naturals out there who think u can&#x27;t get straight hair</li>
            <li>but still very soft)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>straight</li>
            <li>and if anyone has further questions feel free to ask me.</li>
            <li>, not as straight as it looks on the box.</li>
            <li>That being said, this product really helps my hair fight humidity.</li>
            <li>I even wore my hair straight during rainy days with ZERO frizz.</li>
            <li>When I tried the product with my sister&#x27;s hair it worked well and is still keeps it straight as it does but even with her hair</li>
            <li>Naturally Straight has done for my hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>I have a routine that I do to get my hair straight, without the sticky residue that this product causes.  </li>
            <li>This rating is for the product which didnt do much for my roots because they became puffy once humidity hit.</li>
            <li>The leave-in is VERY watery</li>
            <li>made a point to coat my hair evenly with the solution, but not use so much that it felt sticky or slimy.</li>
            <li>but you know your hair so use as much as you think you need.</li>
            <li>but the front and nape is a very looses curl pattern while the rest of my head is a kinkier coil.  </li>
            <li>I had so much softness and body</li>
            <li>So that means, don&#x27;t use 450 heat if your hair will get straight at 375.  </li>
            <li>I really want to try this</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t want to relax or texturize ahhhh</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as the girl on the box</li>
            <li>it kept my relaxed ends straight</li>
            <li>your hair will stay straight</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t straighten my hair very often</li>
            <li>but this enabled me to keep my hair straight for two weeks.</li>
            <li>, I did not apply this product to my whole head.</li>
            <li>and I want my hair to be straight with out a rexlaxer.</li>
            <li>Plus my hair still frizzed but not too much.</li>
            <li>and i have to say that it did better than expected my hair was shiny</li>
            <li>A lot of people comment about their hair getting straight; that was not my worry.</li>
            <li>have your edges and roots been poofy this whole time though?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li>and I can straighten my hair very well without this system</li>
            <li>the direction indicate that you are not to put too much product on your hair otherwise it will work against your desired outcome.</li>
            <li>works really well</li>
            <li>I think I under saturated as some of the strands reverted while others stayed straight.</li>
            <li>My hair after a normal blow out, will get smooth and straight, but one hot flash and BAM, instant afro,,</li>
            <li>I was careful not to oversaturate as the box indicated, maybe I should have used more.</li>
            <li>Softens my hair really well.</li>
            <li>I would use this for if you would like to maintain a straight style for a night or two.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much reversion if any at all.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft like a fresh relaxer.  </li>
            <li>Silky straight.  </li>
            <li>but honestly I could achieve the same results with just a heat protectant and flat iron</li>
            <li>if my hair gets wet the curls definitely come back, but they have a luster and a manageability where I can throw a dot of leave in conditioner and some gel in my palms , apply it to make hair, &amp;  make a pretty curly bun/topknot effortlessly (great for a day at the beach).  </li>
            <li>I used it on my hair first, same experience as most with initial application and concerns about lack of moisture.</li>
            <li>Other people seem to have had better luck with this system than I, but I will never use it again.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time for my 11 yr old Daughter and she</li>
            <li>My hair also stayed surprisingly moisturized the whole time, even though I only added avocado oil every few days .</li>
            <li>I used this system a month ago today and my hair never reverted back to my head full of curls.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t straighten any better than regular flat ironing, and my hair went right back to its original texture (3b/c) upon the first wash, and I used only the included shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I used as directed and my new growth is straight and my hair has shine and body.</li>
            <li>It did make my 4c hair very easy to blow dry straight and flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product a few weeks ago and have been natural for a year and my hair came out looking amazing</li>
            <li>Again, use lower heat setting starting out to be on the safe side (but not too low).  </li>
            <li>but it was quite decent.</li>
            <li>But upon my first wash it didn&#x27;t stay straight as long as it did the first time which was a week by the way.</li>
            <li>the heat recommended for blow drying and straightening is too high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I told her that the product manufacturers said that upon flat ironing it would cause the hair to be soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>But, I most say a little goes along way and the conditioning agent has alot of slip and detangles with ease.</li>
            <li>The first 8 hours, my hair was very straight but not soft at all.  </li>
            <li>I have been natural for 4 years, but haven&#x27;t figured out what my hair really likes.</li>
            <li>I have never gotten my hair this straight while being natural.</li>
            <li>it was soft and bouncy, but a lot of shedding after using it, want use this product again, I will try the motions straight product to see how that works.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and my hair stayed straight for weeks, even after washing it.</li>
            <li>and it is still straight and soft</li>
            <li>and I felt like the poof came just like it normally</li>
            <li>I just straighten it on my own, but it was slowly reverting.</li>
            <li>Application was not hard</li>
            <li>This is not hard to apply.</li>
            <li>is that you have use the flat iron and if your temp setting is too hot, you can damage your hair whether you use this product or not!  </li>
            <li>once you complete the process your straight hair is very soft.</li>
            <li>This kit allows me to straighten my hair with out it reverting back right away from the humidity.</li>
            <li>Washed a week 1/2 later and curls came back fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just have to try other products to smooth my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very prone to reversion, and normally is right back to its afro state after a hot shower, or a long day.</li>
            <li>However, I live in a humid climate and the product just didn&#x27;t do what it was intended to do.  </li>
            <li>My hair is relaxed and i Have a lot of new growth</li>
            <li>I live in florida</li>
            <li>(New Orleans, Louisiana, we practically live in water)  </li>
            <li>It did make my curls a little loose (not a big deal to me).Overall, great experience.</li>
            <li>and OMG my hair was super dry to the point like I couldn&#x27;t comb my hair.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t get your hair bone straight as relaxers do; however, it gets your hair straight enough to manage and style any way you desire.</li>
            <li>They are able to maintain their our hair, just not straight enough.</li>
            <li>When I used it on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair,  it was straight and soft.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions as indicated both bottles were empty before even being able to fully coat my hair and literally the same day my hair sweated out.</li>
            <li>Worked well with humidity and my hair retained curls and style and was very soft and sily.</li>
            <li>My fro came back immediately after first wash.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t last 15 minutes in a hot theater</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re natural looking to add some versatility to your hairstyle catalogue!</li>
            <li>and I generally wear my hair straight.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s chemicals, what do you expect, and for me that&#x27;s a small price to pay to have frizz free, silky, smooth hair all day long.</li>
            <li>today it drizzled a little, and my hair was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Flat ironed my hair and my hair stayed straight until it was time to wash again!</li>
            <li>We followed the directions exactly, except for the heat suggestion for the flat iron, we used 450.</li>
            <li>I recently moved from New York to Seattle, a very rainy city.</li>
            <li>Had this product been on the market way back then, I certainly would have used it.  </li>
            <li>Most work well on the mixed chicks, but not the tightly coiled group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice product but not enough for very long thick hair.  </li>
            <li>have naturally  nappy hair.</li>
            <li>I am also 57 years old.</li>
            <li>I grew weary of trying to maintain  my natural, hair.</li>
            <li>This will be my go to product to extend my relaxers and maybe transition to natural hair.</li>
            <li>It has been about 5 weeks and her hair is still manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>Never had a problem with detangling my natural hair</li>
            <li>My hair was the straightest it had ever been since I went natural.</li>
            <li>Used it on my daughters natural hair.</li>
            <li>Works seamlessly On my 3c/4a hair.</li>
            <li>I am fully natural at this point</li>
            <li>So far it has been over two weeks and even tho ir&#x27;s winter</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t care for the product I got the same effect as if I didn&#x27;t use the straighening system.</li>
            <li>Did I say my hair feels soft, no tangles and could comb through with issue.</li>
            <li>I have worn my hair natural for 5+ years.</li>
            <li>I was worried that I would not have my natural curls again.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>My friend does hair professionally</li>
            <li>My hair was extremely soft and bounce.</li>
            <li>but when I went to revert back to my natural hair, the front remained straight and still is hopefully it&#x27;ll shrink to it&#x27;s natural state.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>After a year of having natural curly hair I have ruined my hair by using this product.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for naturals who want to go straight every once in a while.</li>
            <li>(I currently have straight crochet braids installed) and let me tell you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I want to use this product I been natural almost 2 years now</li>
            <li>If this products continues to work, and my hair doesn&#x27;t revert (it hasn&#x27;t so far)</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>, It has taken alot just dealing with my hair in its natural state( 4c)...</li>
            <li>well it took about 1 hr to complete the steps..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking all over for this product because my hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understate how soft my hair was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural since 2006.</li>
            <li>I used it when I was natural</li>
            <li>I have links to the videos showing my results.&lt;br /&gt;On natural hair:https://www.youtube.com/</li>
            <li>last thing, I had my flat iron set pretty high.</li>
            <li>Since it has cooled down outside, I wanted to start wearing my hair straight because it won&#x27;t frizz back up as easily.</li>
            <li>I parted my hair in four parts to blow dry and it came out so straight and shiny!</li>
            <li>and my hair is still silky straight and flat.</li>
            <li>The hair stayed straight for two weeks without any additional flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I washed my hair the first time today since initial applying the kit last Sunday.</li>
            <li>When I flat-ironed and washed my hair, I only used the products that came with the box and followed the direction exactly (which I think is the key).</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not something I plan on consistently using back to back because I worry about causing heat damage.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw this product online, I was a bit skeptical b/c many of the women who had reviewed it were rocking some 3C/4A curls.</li>
            <li>Well, I have a 2 year old and 11 month old twins to take care of and it feels like my hair is my fourth baby in its natural curly state.</li>
            <li>I personally went for 3 weeks straight and went back to natural curls and had no damage whatsoever</li>
            <li>My hair is mostly straight but not completely so.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get as big as it normally would had</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to take care of it, as it tangles up so easily.</li>
            <li>and it will STAY STRAIGHT as long as you like!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten better results when I air dried my hair in double strand twists the day before and then flat ironed my hair.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t see any reason why it wouldn&#x27;t revert unless the temp on the flat iron was too high.  </li>
            <li>I gave it two stars as it fulfilled the promise of providing hair that was straight; however, her hair became really dry and brittle during and after the process.  </li>
            <li>My hair is brittle, dry and straight.</li>
            <li>So yes, when used correctly, this product will definitely get your hair straight and help it last.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use as much as i normally would when flat ironing</li>
            <li>My ends or very dry will this straight them also?</li>
            <li>I also bought a new flat iron that might have also helped too.</li>
            <li>Not only does the flat iron last, but my hair is so soft and manageable and it does not go back at the first mention of rain or humidity, not even when I perspire.</li>
            <li>but because I added my own products, it is not as bad as the first time.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m hoping my hair doesn&#x27;t need water to thrive, since I plan on using this product for as long as possible, or until my babies grow up and don&#x27;t need as much attention.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I got an entire kit to get rid of, wow.</li>
            <li>but if you use a deep conditioner before you use the system you will have soft moisturized hair.</li>
            <li>It makes the hair really soft but it reverts the minute you step outside.</li>
            <li>If you have short hair (just barely chin length) and your hair is completely natural, such as 4c natural, then this product m ay not be for you.</li>
            <li>I was ready to call it a sham, ready to say there has got to be a catch, I tried on a few hair tracks at first, (kinky curly hair)..</li>
            <li>Also, after working out, about 24 hours later, my hair was back to its normal state.  </li>
            <li>Normally I blow dry my hair</li>
            <li>So for me, blow drying and flat ironing is nothing outside of what I would normally do to straighten my hair even with a relaxer.</li>
            <li>I used this product a week ago for the first time ever on my totally natural hair and the directions say, you must blow dry your hair completely dry and use a flat iron in order for the product to work correctly, which ruined my hair.</li>
            <li>This review is intended for those who prefer wearing their hair straight and have no problem with relaxers other than the harshness of the product.</li>
            <li>And I didn&#x27;t notice that my hair got any straighter with this product I know some people on other reviews that I&#x27;ve seen indicated how straight and silky their hair was after putting the onto their hair.</li>
            <li>I have 3C, fully natural, no chemicals, bra strap length, African American hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not dry like others complain about</li>
            <li>Not dry.</li>
            <li>before getting this product, I resigned to never flat ironing my hair again as it was a waste of time—it wouldn&#x27;t lay flat and would quickly revert so</li>
            <li>That said, my hair came out soft and a little bouncy even in the hot/humid/ no a/c conditions I used the product in, and even though I used more than the recommended amount of the conditioner because my hair is thick.</li>
            <li>a quick tip: still use a dab of your usual leave in and also Nairobi setting lotion prior to blowing out.</li>
            <li>Works great if you don&#x27;t workout. :(</li>
            <li>Straight hair is not worth the harmful side effects.</li>
            <li>i have long hair but naturally curly/frizzy hair</li>
            <li>I do recommend buying the full sized bottles of shampoo and conditioner if your like us and need to wash your hair at least once to twice a week.</li>
            <li>At least I know that when I wash it with the right shampoo this weekend my natural curls will come back.      </li>
            <li>a low flat iron setting will never get ur hair straight so by using a setting too low ur risking heat damage just tohave slightly straight hair, it&#x27;s pointless.</li>
            <li>I felt my ends may have gotten less puffy, but i felt it just should stay straight with no touch up, period.</li>
            <li>that well my hair is a kinky coily texture and super thick</li>
            <li>If your ends aren&#x27;t freshly cut, you might want to have that done first or blowing it out and flat ironing will be difficult because of the balls on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have medium length, fine hair and previously would have that fluffy look as the day went on when i tried to wear my hair flat ironed.</li>
            <li>The rest of my hair feels brittle dry and just a hot mess.</li>
            <li>I have a tightly coiled 4c type hair and it does not make a difference at all unless very high level of heat is used to flat iron the hair which is what i am running away from.</li>

            <li> the shampoo my hair felt squeaky clean which was great.</li>
            <li> make sure you follow the instructions, overall its a great product hopefully they can perfect it so others can benefit too.</li>
            <li> If you wanted to straighten your hair for a special event or something i would say get this,Do it the day of or before then WASH IT OUT!!</li>
            <li> also added some heat protectant oils to my hair after the conditioner just to be safe (and honestly, i didn&#x27;t skimp on the oils.</li>
            <li> Best product by far.  </li>
            <li> I must admit that after washing it with the anti-reversion shampoo and conditioner, I added my own stuff to my hair and it was more moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine shoulder length hair and this product worked.</li>
            <li> Easy!</li>
            <li> I am post-menopausal and suffer from night sweats and my hair is still going STRONG!</li>
            <li> My first impression after taking it out of the box was that I was happy it was a shampoo and conditioner and</li>
            <li> The hair got curly,  but it became softer than before I used the beautiful texture naturally straight on her hair.  </li>
            <li> The product was too good to be true and it was...</li>
            <li> The shampoo is kind of strong.</li>
            <li> I love this product  </li>
            <li> and I both love it.</li>
            <li> it may work better for others.</li>
            <li> and I love the results.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if this made it any better.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would have lasted 4 to 6 weeks</li>
            <li> Best of all, I had no heat damage four weeks later  when I washed it out.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> but it was okay.</li>
            <li> So I figured relaxer-free, my hair should be able to hold up even better...</li>
            <li> Even beauty salons haven&#x27;t been able to get my hair</li>
            <li> I will be buying it in bulk and using it,no more perms for me.</li>
            <li> It got my hair almost too straight lolol.</li>
            <li> i used it for my daughter&#x27;s hair, it was ok not what i was expecting theo.</li>
            <li> I get better results without it.</li>
            <li> I love the way that my hair feels.  </li>
            <li> My hair had more body to it</li>
            <li> and my hair still looks ok.</li>
            <li> thing I noticed is that my hair seems to be shedding more, but maybe not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shampoo each section as many times as needed and rebraid it.</li>
            <li> It still took me 3 hours, but that has more to do with me and my hair than the product.</li>
            <li> I think it works better for people with a looser curl pattern</li>
            <li> I was hoping to try this product to see if the results would be better.  </li>
            <li> Just okay for me.  </li>
            <li> I found something that works better,  but will not advertise here.</li>
            <li> I believe I would have achieved better results.</li>
            <li> will say that the end result was absolutely stunning.  </li>
            <li> Afterward, I rolled my hair using flexi-rods and my curls were stunning.  </li>
            <li> so I sure it wouldn&#x27;t work for me in the summer time    </li>
            <li> Overall,  I would say this product was the best I ever used.  </li>
            <li> Also to be on the safe side</li>
            <li> But the best part of all is definitely the body and bounce!</li>
            <li> I was expecting more for the price.</li>
            <li> Then I put the leave in conditioner in just as the directions recommended and my hair felt more tangled.</li>
            <li> after blow drying my hair felt even more poofier.</li>
            <li> I made sure that my roots received the attention that it needed with the product.  </li>
            <li> and so to be able to feel that... bothered me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I watched so many YT reviews on the TMS system and everyone said &amp;#34;don&#x27;t over saturate&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My hair looked more like a blow out than the supposed straighten look on the box.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it, it gets better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this system.</li>
            <li> That couldn&#x27;t possibly be good for the scalp, right?</li>
            <li> This product is perfect because it allows you to flat iron your hair</li>
            <li> I flat iron it again and hair still flawless</li>
            <li> The products that I have tried, Mizani for one; which I thought was pretty good, but it did not stop the kitchen area (hair at the nape of the neck) from reverting.</li>
            <li> and my hair looked pretty good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s safe to say my once curly gorgeous natural hair is ruined!!!</li>
            <li> Good product, thanks.</li>
            <li> Love this product thought originally it would do nothing for my hair</li>
            <li> Easy application.</li>
            <li> My hair turned out so bouncy and full, even better than I could have imagined.</li>
            <li> it has rained a couple of times and my hair is still fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> and it still held up fine.</li>
            <li> my hair has always gotten really fine</li>
            <li> When I wanted to revert to my curls, a quick wash is all it took!</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s very much indeed true to its claim!!</li>
            <li> Eventually, I found this, and now I can proudly say that  there is no need for me to ever go back to relaxers.</li>
            <li> That is the primarily risk with using this product</li>
            <li> I need this to prevent reversion after all that work, which seems to be the primary marketed goal of this product.  </li>
            <li> So with my daughter i went against the instructions and did not apply the leave in lightly.</li>
            <li> To Beautiful Textures I say, do not change a thing about this product, nor any of the products that goes with this system,as so far, they have all worked just exactly the way the maker said they should.</li>
            <li> In the spring summer months, it&#x27;s the most challenging to stay straight with all the humidity in the NY area.</li>
            <li> I overly satisfied just being able to have straight non frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> its 90 degrees, in my car in traffic, hot flashing like noones business..got out car hair is blowing in the wind, still holding up!!</li>
            <li> Although I do know exactly why it is working, and how to care for it in spite of its most important ingredient(s);</li>
            <li> Overall an excellent product that I&#x27;ve used twice so far with really fantastic results</li>
            <li> It has been about a year since I applied this product to my daughter&#x27;s hair and it still hasn&#x27;t returned to its original condition.  </li>
            <li> I was quite excited to use this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair; however, my excitement waned after using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited an have been telling my family and friends.</li>
            <li> My hair is super smooth and bouncy.</li>
            <li> There are no products in the box besides the special shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Still this product didn&#x27;t do anything special.</li>
            <li> The results were good and my roots are more textlax look and feel versus the initial application that got my roots straight.</li>
            <li> I loved this product and will probably use it again next fall!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to go relaxer-free even before the natural movement was popular, but I&#x27;ve never desired the kinky, coily look.</li>
            <li> but I do know that I have what would be considered by most to be very kinky African-American hair.</li>
            <li> and I have not been able to get my hair this straight in a looong time.</li>
            <li> So my true test of this product will be to use it this summer and see if it can stand up against summer humidity, which i think it will.</li>
            <li> Then rinse the whole head off, to make sure there&#x27;s no shampoo</li>
            <li> I just like my curls better than I do straight hair at this point.  </li>
            <li> They give u a sample of both and the full bottles are sold separately.</li>
            <li> also it would be better if they were to tell you about how much product you should have it</li>
            <li> hair stayed straight during a weekend of rain and being misted on, and straightened much more quickly.</li>
            <li> I have pretty strong hair.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this product after hearing all the great reviews from other naturals.</li>
            <li> I was able to apply more to my roots in subsequent washes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; So, seems like the ends don&#x27;t revert as quickly</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have extraordinary expectations.</li>
            <li> So my plan is to use it 2-3 times a year when I&#x27;m wanting to do length checks and show off my gorgeous long locks.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to get my natural hair to look that good from flat ironing it before.</li>
            <li> I did notice that when I washed my hair with my own shampoo and conditioner that  I didn&#x27;t have as much shrinkage as I normally do.</li>
            <li> I used the leftover in my daughter&#x27;s 3a hair but her hair is easy to blow straight</li>
            <li> I have tired so many products that promised to do what Beautiful Textures</li>
            <li> overall it&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> This product does, literally, exactly what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> This Product is a must have for anyone looking to &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34; back-n-forth from curly to straight!!</li>
            <li> I can wear my hair straight, silky and smooth for up to two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 6 weeks now and my hair reverted but it seems as if the texture is more manageable when I do my natural styles.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the effort</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the try</li>
            <li> an soft i love it</li>
            <li> Motions smoothing system was the first one that I tried and I was impressed with how it soften the hair in the kitchen area, but at the first sign of humidity or rain it reverted right back, and I once again found myself with the flat iron in my hand within two or three days time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just aren&#x27;t doing it right</li>
            <li> It must work, so I&#x27;ll do her hair differently right?</li>
            <li> So right now I&#x27;m using shea moisture</li>
            <li> I was very interested in using this product based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Normally, kinky-haired people would need to use a lot of oil to prevent damage, but this system allows your hair to stay light and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I will try it once more to make sure I am applying it correctly and I will leave it on a little longer.</li>
            <li> When I reversed her hair to natural, it was easy.  </li>
            <li> The last time I had experienced this was when I paid $300 for a keratin treatment but even then I don&#x27;t remember my hair having such shine and movement!&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure if that actually helps or not to be honest, but it makes me feel good about it)</li>
            <li> I would love to get back to swimming but have to figure out the right regime.</li>
            <li> (i have very very nappy 4c hair</li>
            <li> It did exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> Does not do anything to help your hair go from nappy to straight at all!</li>
            <li> Followed the directions exactly...</li>
            <li> I am pleased, but will wait to determine if I will use this product again after I see how my hair reverts back to kinky...</li>
            <li> have tried so many smoothing systems and my hair has defeated everyone last one of them.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This product worked exactly as I needed it to.</li>
            <li> However, getting through the initial steps were more than an undertaking.  </li>
            <li> My hair is mostly type 3c with a patch of 3a in the front and a patch of 3b in the back.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I applied this system three weeks ago, and my hair is STILL straight!</li>
            <li> i was kinda worried at first that it wouldn&#x27;t straighten it</li>
            <li> Next time I use the system I will saturate my hair more with the product.</li>
            <li> I have mostly 4A hair in the back.  </li>
            <li> It did not respond well when it was first applied and reverted almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> I deep condition before I use the shampoo to make sure my hair is in an optimal state to take on heat styling.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this kit because I have the actual Beautiful Textures shampoo, leave-in and other styling products.</li>
            <li> I was able to flat iron it</li>
            <li> I have stubborn 4C hair that I have not been able to flat iron</li>
            <li> Making the effort to do so seemed futile since most naturals have poofy hair within days of flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I think that i was overly conservative with the leave in potion because one side came out beautifully and the other side was poofy and seemed to want to revert within the hour after flat ironing.</li>
            <li> had followed its simple instructions to a tee, and as a result I got lovely, shiny, straight hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, disclaimer</li>
            <li> first use of shampoo and conditioner was a much better detangle and dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is perm straight and had soooo much body!</li>
            <li> My hair was silky smooth, and as I am typing this, I am over a week in with the product and after working out, attending a party outside in the heat, and experiencing daily life, most of the straightness has hung around.</li>
            <li> and so that&#x27;s just pretty much my opinion on that.</li>
            <li> My hair was still straight, but not as straight as the first time.</li>
            <li> it pretty much did nothing to keep that straight....</li>
            <li> its main Go-To parts for what keeps our hair straight &amp; resistant to humidity &amp; the like!</li>
            <li> I live in very hot climate in excess of over a hundred degrees and high humidity.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s straight but not as straight</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> The system is supposed to keep the length of your hair straight</li>
            <li> However after 1 day the straight look has started to revert.</li>
            <li> For those who want to know, I have very kinky hair with the tiniest coils</li>
            <li> and I would recommend to any transitioned or someone who wants to spice up their hair routine.</li>
            <li> This product was very damaging to my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> (Gloves are inside, but I really see no use for them, as there is no burning or staining without them.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to worry much about heat damage.</li>
            <li> this straight.</li>
            <li> so all u naturals out there who think u can&#x27;t get straight hair</li>
            <li> but still very soft)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> straight</li>
            <li> and if anyone has further questions feel free to ask me.</li>
            <li> , not as straight as it looks on the box.</li>
            <li> That being said, this product really helps my hair fight humidity.</li>
            <li> I even wore my hair straight during rainy days with ZERO frizz.</li>
            <li> When I tried the product with my sister&#x27;s hair it worked well and is still keeps it straight as it does but even with her hair</li>
            <li> Naturally Straight has done for my hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> I have a routine that I do to get my hair straight, without the sticky residue that this product causes.  </li>
            <li> This rating is for the product which didnt do much for my roots because they became puffy once humidity hit.</li>
            <li> The leave-in is VERY watery</li>
            <li> made a point to coat my hair evenly with the solution, but not use so much that it felt sticky or slimy.</li>
            <li> but you know your hair so use as much as you think you need.</li>
            <li> but the front and nape is a very looses curl pattern while the rest of my head is a kinkier coil.  </li>
            <li> I had so much softness and body</li>
            <li> So that means, don&#x27;t use 450 heat if your hair will get straight at 375.  </li>
            <li> I really want to try this</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t want to relax or texturize ahhhh</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as the girl on the box</li>
            <li> it kept my relaxed ends straight</li>
            <li> your hair will stay straight</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t straighten my hair very often</li>
            <li> but this enabled me to keep my hair straight for two weeks.</li>
            <li> , I did not apply this product to my whole head.</li>
            <li> and I want my hair to be straight with out a rexlaxer.</li>
            <li> Plus my hair still frizzed but not too much.</li>
            <li> and i have to say that it did better than expected my hair was shiny</li>
            <li> A lot of people comment about their hair getting straight; that was not my worry.</li>
            <li> have your edges and roots been poofy this whole time though?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li> and I can straighten my hair very well without this system</li>
            <li> the direction indicate that you are not to put too much product on your hair otherwise it will work against your desired outcome.</li>
            <li> works really well</li>
            <li> I think I under saturated as some of the strands reverted while others stayed straight.</li>
            <li> My hair after a normal blow out, will get smooth and straight, but one hot flash and BAM, instant afro,,</li>
            <li> I was careful not to oversaturate as the box indicated, maybe I should have used more.</li>
            <li> Softens my hair really well.</li>
            <li> I would use this for if you would like to maintain a straight style for a night or two.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much reversion if any at all.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft like a fresh relaxer.  </li>
            <li> Silky straight.  </li>
            <li> but honestly I could achieve the same results with just a heat protectant and flat iron</li>
            <li> if my hair gets wet the curls definitely come back, but they have a luster and a manageability where I can throw a dot of leave in conditioner and some gel in my palms , apply it to make hair, &amp;  make a pretty curly bun/topknot effortlessly (great for a day at the beach).  </li>
            <li> I used it on my hair first, same experience as most with initial application and concerns about lack of moisture.</li>
            <li> Other people seem to have had better luck with this system than I, but I will never use it again.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time for my 11 yr old Daughter and she</li>
            <li> My hair also stayed surprisingly moisturized the whole time, even though I only added avocado oil every few days .</li>
            <li> I used this system a month ago today and my hair never reverted back to my head full of curls.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t straighten any better than regular flat ironing, and my hair went right back to its original texture (3b/c) upon the first wash, and I used only the included shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I used as directed and my new growth is straight and my hair has shine and body.</li>
            <li> It did make my 4c hair very easy to blow dry straight and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago and have been natural for a year and my hair came out looking amazing</li>
            <li> Again, use lower heat setting starting out to be on the safe side (but not too low).  </li>
            <li> but it was quite decent.</li>
            <li> But upon my first wash it didn&#x27;t stay straight as long as it did the first time which was a week by the way.</li>
            <li> the heat recommended for blow drying and straightening is too high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I told her that the product manufacturers said that upon flat ironing it would cause the hair to be soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> But, I most say a little goes along way and the conditioning agent has alot of slip and detangles with ease.</li>
            <li> The first 8 hours, my hair was very straight but not soft at all.  </li>
            <li> I have been natural for 4 years, but haven&#x27;t figured out what my hair really likes.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten my hair this straight while being natural.</li>
            <li> it was soft and bouncy, but a lot of shedding after using it, want use this product again, I will try the motions straight product to see how that works.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and my hair stayed straight for weeks, even after washing it.</li>
            <li> and it is still straight and soft</li>
            <li> and I felt like the poof came just like it normally</li>
            <li> I just straighten it on my own, but it was slowly reverting.</li>
            <li> Application was not hard</li>
            <li> This is not hard to apply.</li>
            <li> is that you have use the flat iron and if your temp setting is too hot, you can damage your hair whether you use this product or not!  </li>
            <li> once you complete the process your straight hair is very soft.</li>
            <li> This kit allows me to straighten my hair with out it reverting back right away from the humidity.</li>
            <li> Washed a week 1/2 later and curls came back fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just have to try other products to smooth my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very prone to reversion, and normally is right back to its afro state after a hot shower, or a long day.</li>
            <li> However, I live in a humid climate and the product just didn&#x27;t do what it was intended to do.  </li>
            <li> My hair is relaxed and i Have a lot of new growth</li>
            <li> I live in florida</li>
            <li> (New Orleans, Louisiana, we practically live in water)  </li>
            <li> It did make my curls a little loose (not a big deal to me).Overall, great experience.</li>
            <li> and OMG my hair was super dry to the point like I couldn&#x27;t comb my hair.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t get your hair bone straight as relaxers do; however, it gets your hair straight enough to manage and style any way you desire.</li>
            <li> They are able to maintain their our hair, just not straight enough.</li>
            <li> When I used it on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair,  it was straight and soft.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions as indicated both bottles were empty before even being able to fully coat my hair and literally the same day my hair sweated out.</li>
            <li> Worked well with humidity and my hair retained curls and style and was very soft and sily.</li>
            <li> My fro came back immediately after first wash.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last 15 minutes in a hot theater</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re natural looking to add some versatility to your hairstyle catalogue!</li>
            <li> and I generally wear my hair straight.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s chemicals, what do you expect, and for me that&#x27;s a small price to pay to have frizz free, silky, smooth hair all day long.</li>
            <li> today it drizzled a little, and my hair was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Flat ironed my hair and my hair stayed straight until it was time to wash again!</li>
            <li> We followed the directions exactly, except for the heat suggestion for the flat iron, we used 450.</li>
            <li> I recently moved from New York to Seattle, a very rainy city.</li>
            <li> Had this product been on the market way back then, I certainly would have used it.  </li>
            <li> Most work well on the mixed chicks, but not the tightly coiled group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very nice product but not enough for very long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> have naturally  nappy hair.</li>
            <li> I am also 57 years old.</li>
            <li> I grew weary of trying to maintain  my natural, hair.</li>
            <li> This will be my go to product to extend my relaxers and maybe transition to natural hair.</li>
            <li> It has been about 5 weeks and her hair is still manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> Never had a problem with detangling my natural hair</li>
            <li> My hair was the straightest it had ever been since I went natural.</li>
            <li> Used it on my daughters natural hair.</li>
            <li> Works seamlessly On my 3c/4a hair.</li>
            <li> I am fully natural at this point</li>
            <li> So far it has been over two weeks and even tho ir&#x27;s winter</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t care for the product I got the same effect as if I didn&#x27;t use the straighening system.</li>
            <li> Did I say my hair feels soft, no tangles and could comb through with issue.</li>
            <li> I have worn my hair natural for 5+ years.</li>
            <li> I was worried that I would not have my natural curls again.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> My friend does hair professionally</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely soft and bounce.</li>
            <li> but when I went to revert back to my natural hair, the front remained straight and still is hopefully it&#x27;ll shrink to it&#x27;s natural state.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> After a year of having natural curly hair I have ruined my hair by using this product.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for naturals who want to go straight every once in a while.</li>
            <li> (I currently have straight crochet braids installed) and let me tell you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want to use this product I been natural almost 2 years now</li>
            <li> If this products continues to work, and my hair doesn&#x27;t revert (it hasn&#x27;t so far)</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> , It has taken alot just dealing with my hair in its natural state( 4c)...</li>
            <li> well it took about 1 hr to complete the steps..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking all over for this product because my hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understate how soft my hair was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural since 2006.</li>
            <li> I used it when I was natural</li>
            <li> I have links to the videos showing my results.&lt;br /&gt;On natural hair:https://www.youtube.com/</li>
            <li> last thing, I had my flat iron set pretty high.</li>
            <li> Since it has cooled down outside, I wanted to start wearing my hair straight because it won&#x27;t frizz back up as easily.</li>
            <li> I parted my hair in four parts to blow dry and it came out so straight and shiny!</li>
            <li> and my hair is still silky straight and flat.</li>
            <li> The hair stayed straight for two weeks without any additional flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I washed my hair the first time today since initial applying the kit last Sunday.</li>
            <li> When I flat-ironed and washed my hair, I only used the products that came with the box and followed the direction exactly (which I think is the key).</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not something I plan on consistently using back to back because I worry about causing heat damage.  </li>
            <li> When I first saw this product online, I was a bit skeptical b/c many of the women who had reviewed it were rocking some 3C/4A curls.</li>
            <li> Well, I have a 2 year old and 11 month old twins to take care of and it feels like my hair is my fourth baby in its natural curly state.</li>
            <li> I personally went for 3 weeks straight and went back to natural curls and had no damage whatsoever</li>
            <li> My hair is mostly straight but not completely so.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get as big as it normally would had</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to take care of it, as it tangles up so easily.</li>
            <li> and it will STAY STRAIGHT as long as you like!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten better results when I air dried my hair in double strand twists the day before and then flat ironed my hair.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t see any reason why it wouldn&#x27;t revert unless the temp on the flat iron was too high.  </li>
            <li> I gave it two stars as it fulfilled the promise of providing hair that was straight; however, her hair became really dry and brittle during and after the process.  </li>
            <li> My hair is brittle, dry and straight.</li>
            <li> So yes, when used correctly, this product will definitely get your hair straight and help it last.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use as much as i normally would when flat ironing</li>
            <li> My ends or very dry will this straight them also?</li>
            <li> I also bought a new flat iron that might have also helped too.</li>
            <li> Not only does the flat iron last, but my hair is so soft and manageable and it does not go back at the first mention of rain or humidity, not even when I perspire.</li>
            <li> but because I added my own products, it is not as bad as the first time.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m hoping my hair doesn&#x27;t need water to thrive, since I plan on using this product for as long as possible, or until my babies grow up and don&#x27;t need as much attention.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I got an entire kit to get rid of, wow.</li>
            <li> but if you use a deep conditioner before you use the system you will have soft moisturized hair.</li>
            <li> It makes the hair really soft but it reverts the minute you step outside.</li>
            <li> If you have short hair (just barely chin length) and your hair is completely natural, such as 4c natural, then this product m ay not be for you.</li>
            <li> I was ready to call it a sham, ready to say there has got to be a catch, I tried on a few hair tracks at first, (kinky curly hair)..</li>
            <li> Also, after working out, about 24 hours later, my hair was back to its normal state.  </li>
            <li> Normally I blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> So for me, blow drying and flat ironing is nothing outside of what I would normally do to straighten my hair even with a relaxer.</li>
            <li> I used this product a week ago for the first time ever on my totally natural hair and the directions say, you must blow dry your hair completely dry and use a flat iron in order for the product to work correctly, which ruined my hair.</li>
            <li> This review is intended for those who prefer wearing their hair straight and have no problem with relaxers other than the harshness of the product.</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t notice that my hair got any straighter with this product I know some people on other reviews that I&#x27;ve seen indicated how straight and silky their hair was after putting the onto their hair.</li>
            <li> I have 3C, fully natural, no chemicals, bra strap length, African American hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not dry like others complain about</li>
            <li> Not dry.</li>
            <li> before getting this product, I resigned to never flat ironing my hair again as it was a waste of time—it wouldn&#x27;t lay flat and would quickly revert so</li>
            <li> That said, my hair came out soft and a little bouncy even in the hot/humid/ no a/c conditions I used the product in, and even though I used more than the recommended amount of the conditioner because my hair is thick.</li>
            <li> a quick tip: still use a dab of your usual leave in and also Nairobi setting lotion prior to blowing out.</li>
            <li> Works great if you don&#x27;t workout. :(</li>
            <li> Straight hair is not worth the harmful side effects.</li>
            <li> i have long hair but naturally curly/frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I do recommend buying the full sized bottles of shampoo and conditioner if your like us and need to wash your hair at least once to twice a week.</li>
            <li> At least I know that when I wash it with the right shampoo this weekend my natural curls will come back.      </li>
            <li> a low flat iron setting will never get ur hair straight so by using a setting too low ur risking heat damage just tohave slightly straight hair, it&#x27;s pointless.</li>
            <li> I felt my ends may have gotten less puffy, but i felt it just should stay straight with no touch up, period.</li>
            <li> that well my hair is a kinky coily texture and super thick</li>
            <li> If your ends aren&#x27;t freshly cut, you might want to have that done first or blowing it out and flat ironing will be difficult because of the balls on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have medium length, fine hair and previously would have that fluffy look as the day went on when i tried to wear my hair flat ironed.</li>
            <li> The rest of my hair feels brittle dry and just a hot mess.</li>
            <li> I have a tightly coiled 4c type hair and it does not make a difference at all unless very high level of heat is used to flat iron the hair which is what i am running away from.</li>
            <li> When I wanted a straight style (maybe once every other month), I would blow dry may hair and flat iron it.</li>
            <li> It has been less than 24 hours and my hair has already gone back to looking how it normally would</li>
            <li> After the second wash with their shampoo and conditioner, my new growth reverted back to it&#x27;s natural state plus left the film making it hard to comb.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked the same it always does when I flat iron it.</li>
            <li> The last time I flat ironed my hair was the summer, and it is now winter.</li>
            <li> I think I will just take her to have it professionally flat ironed next time.</li>
            <li> By the time I got to flat ironing the back of my head, my front roots had already began reverting.</li>
            <li> I had a really hard time de-tangling my hair and felt like there was more breakage than usual.  </li>
            <li> Now, I only have to flat iron once a week because that is how often I wash my hair and the flat iron</li>
            <li> All three of us natural with different curly to coily hair, not wavy not super kinky.</li>
            <li> , before I began the process I deep conditioned my hair (although this might not have done anything since the shampoo strips every single drop of anything from your hair which makes it feel kinda coarse, but not to worry,</li>
            <li> then getting my hair flat ironed.</li>
            <li> It may be me because I suck at flat ironing.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t flat iron</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change from when I flat iron my hair without this product.</li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> Once I flat ironed, the residue was gone.</li>
            <li> I used their Curly-to-Straight flat iron silkener as an added heat protectant and flat ironed.</li>
            <li> I have not used flat irons all year and every time I do, the style has lasted one day because of humidity.  </li>
            <li> you get through flat ironing (I used the chase method using the penman thermo straightening brush)</li>
            <li> I would recommend using your flat iron on the lowest heat setting that will straighten your hair.  </li>
            <li> The feeling went away after flat ironing  -</li>
            <li> but I curled mine after I flat ironed it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long because of humidity</li>
            <li> so when i opened the box i was kinda hesitant but after coin the steps i finally flat ironed my hair with my chi on 360</li>
            <li> I then flat ironed it on a temp of 355</li>
            <li> but when you flat iron it that feeling will go away</li>
            <li> once I flat ironed my hair and it will look like type 1 hair</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice any change in how flat my hair has gotten</li>
            <li> , I use it every two weeks but do NOT put a flat iron on anything</li>
            <li> from wash to flat iron..</li>
            <li> My hairdresser wanted to add moisture before flat ironing</li>
            <li> It has now been 4 days since I flat ironed again and the roots of my hair,</li>
            <li> I flat iron on 400.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and reverts at the first sign of sweat (I&#x27;m thinking 4B/4C).</li>
            <li> I am still not exactly sure just where or even when I heard about this smoothing system, but it was the first one that I saw that actually had a model with the same texture hair (coarse, tight curls) that I have and it actually seemed to work.</li>
            <li> I am giving the product three starts because I may simply used it wrong, but my hair has YET to revert back to its original curl pattern and its been over 2 months since I did the treatment.  </li>
            <li> Easy peezy, rice &amp; cheesy.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4c type hair and this product helped, but my hair slightly reverted after one shower.</li>
            <li> I can curl my hair with ceramic flat irons ONCE WEEKLY, and NO HOLDING SPRAY!!</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a way to tame my new growth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (I started using those several years ago when my hair was thinning due to medical reasons but continued to use them even after the fullness returned to my hair. )</li>
            <li> And all you have to do is wash and condition, which is the minimum any person does anyway, then blow dry and flat iron.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions: blow dry on medium heat with the leave-in conditioner and then flat iron hair on the recommended setting.  </li>
            <li> Hard to get straight ehen blow drying for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the fullest it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be keeping up with how long that takes but</li>
            <li> Will keep updated on how long the style lasts.    </li>
            <li> I could live with that, but it left a strange film on my hair that made it extremelly unmanagable and hard to comb.  </li>
            <li> not sure if this product or the new T3 flatiron but hair does not revert once i straigten it....</li>
            <li> Plus, this product (bought 2) arrived in the mail wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy earlier than its expected date!</li>
            <li> after I did the steps I went to blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> This product made my hair extremely dry, it felt like straw.  </li>
            <li> I keep seeing ppl say that their hair is dry or their roots revert</li>
            <li> I see a lot of people said it came out dry...</li>
            <li> You can still do twist outs and flex-rods sets once its dry but don&#x27;t apply any moisturizers just oil.  </li>
            <li> It straightened my roots but my ends were dry even though I used it twice😖</li>
            <li> the box indicated that you will feel the product on your hair even after you blow dry it</li>
            <li> She warned me that my hair would be extremely dry</li>
            <li> It is still a bit dry</li>
            <li> the only reason why its not a 5 because its only been a few days.</li>
            <li> But I would definitely use it again for my next length check in a few months!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> wrong works wonders my hair is soft bouncy and straight</li>
            <li> When I was relaxing my hair,  I constantly blow dried and flat ironed anyway.</li>
            <li> however usually when i straighten my hair it last only hours!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m biracial (black and white)</li>
            <li> After using this product, I noticed that my daughter&#x27;s hair was very dry, brittle and tangled.</li>
            <li> the back of my hair was a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> My hair reverts too quickly and it is awkward having one texture in the back and another in the front.</li>
            <li> Usually with the Mizani I was using the flat iron within the next two days or so</li>
            <li> but I kept going back for &amp;#34;just a little more&amp;#34; because I was scared of damage lol.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Then I took my 5 min walk into work and my hair looked like a flat frizzy mess by the time I got in the building.</li>
            <li> I used this a few weeks ago and I can&#x27;t say it worked any different</li>
            <li> With me being a military member, the smell is unacceptable while in uniform.  </li>
            <li> but I was missing my curls and reverted my hair back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply the leave in conditioner on the braids with hair soaking wet.</li>
            <li> so be careful when pouring.</li>
            <li> I blow dried and it left a residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> By the end of the event my hair was NOT straight and did not look like I had spent hours straightening it.    </li>
            <li> I addition, after blow drying and flat ironing my hair this time, the back of my hair was a little straighter a little longer</li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a natural hair and it is THICK.</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> - Leave-in conditioner made my scalp burn; It felt like there was alcohol or some other type of astringent in it  </li>
            <li> They warn you not to use other products while using this</li>
            <li> My 4A/4B hair is extremely dry and even though I added moisturizer, it made little difference.  </li>
            <li> but my hair is seriously dry!!!  </li>
            <li> She also has crazy thick hair and is the main reason i was testing this because she loves her hair straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very active and also in the military, therefore not working out</li>
            <li> the box comes with 2 small products in a bottle that you are supposed to one wash your hair with into condition before drying and flat ironing your hair.</li>
            <li> The flat ironing process was no better.</li>
            <li> I had high (yet realistic) hopes for this stuff but ended up sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Before the move I had to figure out what to do with my hair, cause moving with 3 babies is already hard enough, didn&#x27;t want to deal with my tangles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know when your used to getting all the shedding hair in a brush only.</li>
            <li> I am trying hard not to get upset about the fact my curl pattern may never come back</li>
            <li> I have 4C short to medium length hair that is usually hard to straighten.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little dry too, so I&#x27;ll have to put in a little bit of oil.</li>
            <li> I have tried using clarifying shampoo with no success.</li>
            <li> so its difficult to manage straight hair</li>
            <li> This is really a horrible product, and purchased two kits; in hopes this would be and good product.</li>
            <li> It did not weigh the hair down,  </li>
            <li> This is the product to try if you are anxious to see how long your hair is after months and months of shrinking curls!  </li>
            <li> The past few times I&#x27;ve flat ironed my hair</li>
            <li> The bottles are small but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but the products bottles are very small and not enough to cover my head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mom has complained about the smell it has when I flat iron Smell will go away after a couple of days</li>
            <li> and my hair has less body</li>
            <li> I have noticed slight breakage as well, and she is not one to retouch and restraighten her hair as often as I do.</li>
            <li> Well, for one it changed by jet black hair to a reddish brown.  </li>
            <li> My hair and my families hair was less bushy and withstood rain and humidity.</li>
            <li> Jamaican black castor oil products to try and help the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> When I first put the system in, I expected instant results and was a little disappointed when my hair was still the usual curly.</li>
            <li> However, her curl pattern has not been as tight since using the products about a month ago.</li>
            <li> made my hair dry and hard.</li>
            <li> After washing out the conditioner, I reapplied a little conditioner as a leave in on my hair per the instructions.</li>
            <li> I used Chi 44 Iron Guard heat protector and a little JBCO for shine.</li>
            <li> I have a little reversion at my roots, but nothing too noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am Not sure if it is due to the amount of hair that I have and the little product that they offer or if it&#x27;s just the product not working well...</li>
            <li> This could be because the hair is very thick african 4c hair.</li>
            <li> I have texlax/transitioning hair, which is very thick and coarse.  </li>
            <li> I then blow dried my hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time or money on the product.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> few tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li> This took a few hours to accomplish.</li>
            <li> so when its my natural texture it is difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> and I could tell this product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and before I blow dried it,  </li>
            <li> Not a huge issue, for her or me</li>
            <li> Usually can wear it down until I workout then throw it up in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> In fact, I would say less hair came out than usual.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I felt absolutely NO DIFFERENCE in my hair after using thsi product what so ever.</li>
            <li> But after just one use of this system, my ends were a raggedy mess!</li>
            <li> Even last winter when I flat ironed it it started to get a little poofy, but not as bad as summer humidity.</li>
            <li> I also have very little shrinkage.</li>
            <li> Met expectations but too pricy compared to shops its line 3times more expensive!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was in the store to purchase my usual &amp;#34;kiddie&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But I was skeptical because the leave-in doesn&#x27;t have the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> I also had not cut my ends in a few months so that didn&#x27;t help my plight!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it will work , my hair have been in braids</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it actually works.</li>
            <li> get me wrong, I&#x27;m used to my straightened hair getting big</li>
            <li> unfortunately my hair reverted back.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unfortunate that you can&#x27;t buy the products needed individually in regular sized bottles so that way you can treat your hair the way that it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> So I would suggest you test this product on a small area before using.</li>
            <li> there is a bit of a weird smell, especially when it gets some water on it.</li>
            <li> Since the instructions state &amp;#34;do not oversaturate your hair&amp;#34; it makes it a little impossible to ensure that the product gets completely through your hair.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s weird seeing all these hair everywhere in my house.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the long</li>
            <li> This product smells god awful, and does absolutely nothing but coat your hair with a dry sticky film.</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair and it made me hair feel hard.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s hard to wash out even with the shampoo provided.</li>
            <li> this crap really stinks, the smell is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I retouched my roots once or twice but the effects lasted at least 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> It took me at least 20 min just to get it all throughout my hair, again your hair is stripped so trying to detangle is a monster (but doable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The package insert says to wash your hair at least once a week with the maintenance shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m searching for tips from those who said they had minimal reversion to figure out what I&#x27;m doing wrong.</li>
            <li> it was thick and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> I have thick waist length type 4a hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick 4c hair.</li>
            <li> This product was uneffective the results were horrible and because of the overheat usage my hair has become  brittle and fragile  is still constantly  breaking off.</li>
            <li> BUT  after a while my hair felt soooo dry and an brittle it was breaking like crazy  </li>
            <li> its been foggy, the humidity is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Not good for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> I fell asleep without wrapping it, so when I woke up the next morning, I basically had a fro :(</li>
            <li> When I blow dried it felt horrible very sticky and difficult to get through.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and a bit on the corse side.</li>
            <li> and I find that after a couple uses my hair has broken a lot.</li>
            <li> I am soooo annoyed and will never try this product again.</li>
            <li> I was so Addicted to the (creamy crack)</li>
            <li> The shampoo is a little drying but not too bad imo.</li>
            <li> but I have very weak hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;To say I was skeptical about this product is an understatement, but I was at my wits end</li>
            <li> Within 15 minutes of my arrival at the theater, which had the heat on max unfortunately, my curls fell and my edges started to rise.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a questionable effect if my roots are on baby fro.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry for the ones that it didn&#x27;t work for</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> My hair felt dull and lifeless :(</li>
            <li> Was afraid to try this product</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting 2.5&amp;#34; off to deal with the split ends.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but it works!</li>
            <li> This product is also very difficult to get out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Ive heard that the leave in makes it impossible to detangle and leaves a residue</li>
            <li> so bad i cannot conceive using it again</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I made a terrible mistake by using this please don&#x27;t even purchase it.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, the straightening solution smells awful.</li>
            <li> The weather has been horrible.  </li>
            <li> it worked for me but the smell is horrible!</li>
            <li> The front now looks terrible like heat damage.</li>
            <li> This is horrible.</li>

            <li> This kit works well as it states, but if you put and water based products on your virgin hair after using this kit your hair will start to revert.  I did my daughter&#x27;s hair and she sweats during her sleep. Her hair has reverted, but only at the roots.  Will be using the kit on my head next.  Will update this review once done.</li>
            <li> LADIES. ..I FINALLY FOUND SOMETHING THAT WORKS&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally  nappy hair. I cut out my relaxer after 20 plus years of damaging effects. I am also 57 years old. This product is the BEST I have used. I grew weary of trying to maintain  my natural, hair. Now I have a choice! Iove the  versatility!  I can curl my hair with ceramic flat irons ONCE WEEKLY, and NO HOLDING SPRAY!! I am post-menopausal and suffer from night sweats and my hair is still going STRONG!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  amazing  ..easy to apply...straightens your hair beautifully. ..last along time with no frizz ..I love this product  .I would  recommend  to family  and friends. ..</li>
            <li> Hair reverted back after 2 days. The product was too good to be true and it was...Save your money.</li>
            <li> I give this product a one star only because I didn&#x27;t like how my hair felt  after I did the steps I went to blow dry my hair and OMG my hair was super dry to the point like I couldn&#x27;t comb my hair. I was able to flat iron it and it&#x27;s straight but not as straight like how I wanted it. But again everybody hair type is different so I just know for my hair it didn&#x27;t do much. Plus I got it from Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Update: I washed my hair the first time today since initial applying the kit last Sunday. I used the anti reversion shampoo and conditioner that comes with the kit. After washing out the conditioner, I reapplied a little conditioner as a leave in on my hair per the instructions. I then blow dried my hair. The results were good and my roots are more textlax look and feel versus the initial application that got my roots straight. Since it&#x27;s designed to only last 4-6 weeks I expect the results to wear off weekly as it should but I still have the shine and body that I had with the initial application.     I used this product to stretch my relaxer. I am 6 weeks post relaxer and this worked perfectly. I used as directed and my new growth is straight and my hair has shine and body. This will be my go to product to extend my relaxers and maybe transition to natural hair.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time for my 11 yr old Daughter and she and I both love it. She has Kinky coily textured hair and a lot of it! She and I both suffered anytime we had to do her hair. This product is truly a God send. It has been about 5 weeks and her hair is still manageable and soft. I can go on and on...point is it worked for us.</li>
            <li> I used this a few weeks ago and I can&#x27;t say it worked any different then getting my hair flat ironed. My hair looked the same it always does when I flat iron it. Also, I&#x27;m not about isong alot of heat on my hair so...that might be another reason I didn&#x27;t care for the results. But, I most say a little goes along way and the conditioning agent has alot of slip and detangles with ease. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again but give it a try it can&#x27;t hurt it may work better for others.</li>
            <li> OMG this isn&#x27;t good for your hair.  This product made my hair extremely dry, it felt like straw.  I had to go to the beauty salon to correct the straw like texture.  OMG this crap really stinks, the smell is overwhelming. With me being a military member, the smell is unacceptable while in uniform.  This is really a horrible product, and purchased two kits; in hopes this would be and good product. Now I got an entire kit to get rid of, wow.</li>
            <li> I keep seeing ppl say that their hair is dry or their roots revert but if you use a deep conditioner before you use the system you will have soft moisturized hair. About the roots even relaxed roots face reversion but it&#x27;s in the form of S shaped waves. The system is supposed to keep the length of your hair straight and if it did that then it worked. Nothing is perfect you gotta work with what you have. I bought this almost 5 weeks ago and I love the results. I sweat and my roots poof up but a jbco fixes that. I washed at the 3 week mark and i can tell the system does what it says it&#x27;s should do. It&#x27;s not a miracle it&#x27;s a hair product.</li>
            <li> Never had a problem with detangling my natural hair but I did have a problem with it frizzing as soon as I pressed it. My blowouts would not last a day! So when I saw this, I decided to try it. My first impression after taking it out of the box was that I was happy it was a shampoo and conditioner and the smell was very pleasant so that was definitely a plus. When I first put the system in, I expected instant results and was a little disappointed when my hair was still the usual curly. As soon as I started detangling my hair, I felt the difference. I parted my hair in four parts to blow dry and it came out so straight and shiny! I see a lot of people said it came out dry...a quick tip: still use a dab of your usual leave in and also Nairobi setting lotion prior to blowing out. Works like a charm! Flat ironed my hair and my hair stayed straight until it was time to wash again! Washed it and the curl pattern was looser but I could tell there was no damage. It&#x27;s been about 6 weeks now and my hair reverted but it seems as if the texture is more manageable when I do my natural styles. I also have very little shrinkage. I loved this product and will probably use it again next fall! lol Hope this helps someone :)</li>
            <li> not sure if this product or the new T3 flatiron but hair does not revert once i straigten it....so i am happy</li>
            <li> 3 and 1/2 stars.  It did make my 4c hair very easy to blow dry straight and flat iron.  However after 1 day the straight look has started to revert. It may be me because I suck at flat ironing. I used the leftover in my daughter&#x27;s 3a hair but her hair is easy to blow straight so I don&#x27;t know if this made it any better.  I would use it again just to help with the blow drying</li>
            <li> I am still not achieving the results that this product is claiming.  I will try it once more to make sure I am applying it correctly and I will leave it on a little longer.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product. It did exactly as stated. I&#x27;m sure it would have lasted 4 to 6 weeks but I was missing my curls and reverted my hair back. Lol. It did make my curls a little loose (not a big deal to me).Overall, great experience.</li>
            <li> Works just as it says it will. When I flat-ironed and washed my hair, I only used the products that came with the box and followed the direction exactly (which I think is the key). My hair was the straightest it had ever been since I went natural. My hair also stayed surprisingly moisturized the whole time, even though I only added avocado oil every few days . Best of all, I had no heat damage four weeks later  when I washed it out. I washed my hair once in the four week period (at two weeks) using the included shampoo and conditioner. I then flat-ironed it at a lower setting (350ish). My hair was still straight, but not as straight as the first time. For those who want to know, I have very kinky hair with the tiniest coils I think possible...probably in the 4a-4b range.</li>
            <li> Used it on my daughters natural hair. she is transitioning. I think that i was overly conservative with the leave in potion because one side came out beautifully and the other side was poofy and seemed to want to revert within the hour after flat ironing. I decided that I will try it again. I think the results were very nice and I would recommend to any transitioned or someone who wants to spice up their hair routine. My daughter has very thick hair and it&#x27;s coarse. I took my time distributing it through the hair. I would say it&#x27;s okay and when I retry it I will write another review. I do recommend buying the full sized bottles of shampoo and conditioner if your like us and need to wash your hair at least once to twice a week.</li>
            <li> Works seamlessly On my 3c/4a hair. Easy application. Leaves my curls refreshed and looser which makes styling a breeze. if my hair gets wet the curls definitely come back, but they have a luster and a manageability where I can throw a dot of leave in conditioner and some gel in my palms , apply it to make hair, &amp;  make a pretty curly bun/topknot effortlessly (great for a day at the beach).  I take excellent care of my hair and this is a must have in my arsenal. It only last 4 weeks, but that&#x27;s all I need. I deep condition my hair and have a weekly regimen that also helps manage my texture. Overall an excellent product that I&#x27;ve used twice so far with really fantastic results</li>
            <li> Met expectations but too pricy compared to shops its line 3times more expensive!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product was very damaging to my daughter&#x27;s hair.  After using this product, I noticed that my daughter&#x27;s hair was very dry, brittle and tangled. This product is also very difficult to get out of your hair. It has been about a year since I applied this product to my daughter&#x27;s hair and it still hasn&#x27;t returned to its original condition.  I have tried using clarifying shampoo with no success. Do yourself a favor and keep this chemical out of your hair!</li>
            <li> Works beautifully . No perm for 3 years</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste time or money on the product. I regret purchasing it</li>
            <li> I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair. It straightened it and made it a lot manageable. However, her curl pattern has not been as tight since using the products about a month ago. Not a huge issue, for her or me but I know that this may deter some.</li>
            <li> This review is intended for those who prefer wearing their hair straight and have no problem with relaxers other than the harshness of the product. For you, I think we have a winner. I began transitioning on a whim about 5 months ago. I was in the store to purchase my usual &amp;#34;kiddie&amp;#34; relaxer.  (I started using those several years ago when my hair was thinning due to medical reasons but continued to use them even after the fullness returned to my hair. ) Anyway, I happened to run into a product that claimed to straighten your hair but was not a relaxer. I didn&#x27;t believe it, but I decided to give it a try anyway. For years now, I have had a problem with the harshness of relaxers. I&#x27;ve always wanted some way to straighten my hair without worrying about my nails yellowing if I did not use gloves or my skin burning if I did not use a protective barrier. That couldn&#x27;t possibly be good for the scalp, right? I used the product I bought that day, and it wasn&#x27;t great but it was okay. But I was hopeful, so it got me to start searching for similar products. Eventually, I found this, and now I can proudly say that  there is no need for me to ever go back to relaxers. The product doesn&#x27;t get your hair bone straight as relaxers do; however, it gets your hair straight enough to manage and style any way you desire. And all you have to do is wash and condition, which is the minimum any person does anyway, then blow dry and flat iron. There are no products in the box besides the special shampoos and conditioners. (Gloves are inside, but I really see no use for them, as there is no burning or staining without them.)  When I was relaxing my hair,  I constantly blow dried and flat ironed anyway. I&#x27;ve never been one to worry much about heat damage. So for me, blow drying and flat ironing is nothing outside of what I would normally do to straighten my hair even with a relaxer. So I figured relaxer-free, my hair should be able to hold up even better...and it does.  It&#x27;s the fullest it has been in a long time. I&#x27;ve always wanted to go relaxer-free even before the natural movement was popular, but I&#x27;ve never desired the kinky, coily look. Had this product been on the market way back then, I certainly would have used it.  This is a way to achieve a straight look without having to use harsh chemical relaxers. And I don&#x27;t know what type my hair is - not that deep into it - but I do know that I have what would be considered by most to be very kinky African-American hair. And this product works wonderfully for me. I hope that it will work for you too.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I am fully natural at this point and I have not been able to get my hair this straight in a looong time. Even beauty salons haven&#x27;t been able to get my hair this straight. I was a bit skeptical, but it works! I also bought a new flat iron that might have also helped too. The last time I flat ironed my hair was the summer, and it is now winter. The past few times I&#x27;ve flat ironed my hair it starts to revert and get poofy literally the same day. Even last winter when I flat ironed it it started to get a little poofy, but not as bad as summer humidity. So my true test of this product will be to use it this summer and see if it can stand up against summer humidity, which i think it will. My hair is perm straight and had soooo much body! So far it has been over two weeks and even tho ir&#x27;s winter it has rained a couple of times and my hair is still fine. I will update with my results after I go back to my curls (i have very very nappy 4c hair so all u naturals out there who think u can&#x27;t get straight hair just aren&#x27;t doing it right, it is possible).&lt;br /&gt;Also, before I began the process I deep conditioned my hair (although this might not have done anything since the shampoo strips every single drop of anything from your hair which makes it feel kinda coarse, but not to worry, once you complete the process your straight hair is very soft. almost 3 weeks later and my hair has less body but still very soft)&lt;br /&gt;I also added some heat protectant oils to my hair after the conditioner just to be safe (and honestly, i didn&#x27;t skimp on the oils. I didn&#x27;t use as much as i normally would when flat ironing but i intended to use just a tiny amount but I kept going back for &amp;#34;just a little more&amp;#34; because I was scared of damage lol.&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, I had my flat iron set pretty high. I think that is key, yes I know u don&#x27;t want heat damage but a low flat iron setting will never get ur hair straight so by using a setting too low ur risking heat damage just tohave slightly straight hair, it&#x27;s pointless. I used the heat guide on the instructions and since my hair is 4c i used the highest recommendation of around 400.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t care for the product I got the same effect as if I didn&#x27;t use the straighening system. I have fine hair the heat recommended for blow drying and straightening is too high. My hair fizzed out after putting in my moisturizers and my workouts at the gym.</li>
            <li> Does not do anything to help your hair go from nappy to straight at all! Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb! I haven&#x27;t had a permanent in over a year and I have 4b,c hair . Baybay this had my hair salon straight and I can&#x27;t flat iron that well but my hair was laid. I did a YouTube review on this also my yt name is 2930honey and if anyone has further questions feel free to ask me. Also I got it for $8 at walgreens.love this stuff I will be buying it in bulk and using it,no more perms for me.</li>
            <li> Hard to get straight ehen blow drying for me</li>
            <li> The product made my granddaughters hair manageable., not as straight as it looks on the box. They are able to maintain their our hair, just not straight enough.</li>
            <li> Luv this, luv this!!!!! I can comb my hair after 5 years!!!!! I will be buying this again......</li>
            <li> I have very fine shoulder length hair and this product worked. It got my hair almost too straight lolol. Best product ever! Check out iconxhair.com</li>
            <li> Not good for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> i used it for my daughter&#x27;s hair, it was ok not what i was expecting theo.</li>
            <li> Very nice product but not enough for very long thick hair.  It worked as promised with no residue nor buildup.  Worked well with humidity and my hair retained curls and style and was very soft and sily.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I didn&#x27;t see any change from when I flat iron my hair without this product. I sectioned my hair and took my time applying the product. I felt like I followed the instructions to the T but I noticed no difference between using this and my regular routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting forever to try this product.  I have 4c hair and it made me hair feel hard.  The shine was great though.  My fro came back immediately after first wash.  It was a waste of money.  I get better results without it.</li>
            <li> It damaged my hair. I&#x27;ve yet to speak with someone at the company.</li>
            <li> I love the way that my hair feels.  I have stubborn 4C hair that I have not been able to flat iron and it last 5 minutes afterwards.  I am wrapping it up tonight and I cant wait to see how it is going to look in the morning.  Although, I completed all steps I do plan on experimenting by doing twistouts and I plan on going to the gym.  I would love to get back to swimming but have to figure out the right regime. Did I say my hair feels soft, no tangles and could comb through with issue.</li>
            <li> I was quite excited to use this product on my daughter&#x27;s hair; however, my excitement waned after using it.  I gave it two stars as it fulfilled the promise of providing hair that was straight; however, her hair became really dry and brittle during and after the process.  I am not planning to use this product again.  I think I will just take her to have it professionally flat ironed next time.</li>
            <li> Works great if you don&#x27;t workout. :( I&#x27;m very active and also in the military, therefore not working out is not an option. Usually can wear it down until I workout then throw it up in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions exactly... Still this product didn&#x27;t do anything special. My hair had more body to it but honestly I could achieve the same results with just a heat protectant and flat iron</li>
            <li> I have been natural for 4 years, but haven&#x27;t figured out what my hair really likes. It&#x27;s really hard to take care of it, as it tangles up so easily. Well, I have a 2 year old and 11 month old twins to take care of and it feels like my hair is my fourth baby in its natural curly state. I recently moved from New York to Seattle, a very rainy city. Before the move I had to figure out what to do with my hair, cause moving with 3 babies is already hard enough, didn&#x27;t want to deal with my tangles. Was afraid to try this product but I&#x27;m very glad I did. It has saved me a lot of time. Can go to sleep at night after the kids. Just apply some avocado oil to my hair and wrap it. Easy! I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in a month. Gross, I know. But I&#x27;m still unpacking, kids don&#x27;t give me a break and my hair still looks ok. That being said, this product really helps my hair fight humidity. I use avocado oil to keep my hair moisturized without reverting. So, I&#x27;m hoping my hair doesn&#x27;t need water to thrive, since I plan on using this product for as long as possible, or until my babies grow up and don&#x27;t need as much attention.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed is that my hair seems to be shedding more, but maybe not. It&#x27;s hard to know when your used to getting all the shedding hair in a brush only. When my hair is it&#x27;s curly state and sheds, it won&#x27;t go anywhere, till I brush it. So, it&#x27;s weird seeing all these hair everywhere in my house.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the long review.&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep condition hair before applying this system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finger detangled hair before washing it with shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use any extra product when applying this system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braid your hair before washing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo each section as many times as needed and rebraid it. Then rinse the whole head off, to make sure there&#x27;s no shampoo left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply the leave in conditioner on the braids with hair soaking wet. Then detangled each section with your fingers and a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detangling your hair before blowdrying makes everything easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avocado oil is a great mosturizer. I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have not straightened my hair in almost 3 years. Making the effort to do so seemed futile since most naturals have poofy hair within days of flat ironing. Well, this product made the process a breeze. It still took me 3 hours, but that has more to do with me and my hair than the product. My hair was silky smooth, and as I am typing this, I am over a week in with the product and after working out, attending a party outside in the heat, and experiencing daily life, most of the straightness has hung around. I am pleased, but will wait to determine if I will use this product again after I see how my hair reverts back to kinky...stay tuned.</li>
            <li> This product does, literally, exactly what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do! So, it&#x27;s very much indeed true to its claim!! Although I do know exactly why it is working, and how to care for it in spite of its most important ingredient(s); its main Go-To parts for what keeps our hair straight &amp; resistant to humidity &amp; the like! There is NOTHING to fear in using this product, if your know to use a clarifying shampoo (a shampoo with sulfates) and a good conditioner. AND THEN *stop* using clarifying shampoos and conditioners, and go back to using ones without! Easy peezy, rice &amp; cheesy. No problem. So this product is perfect. A little education goes a Long way. Plus, this product (bought 2) arrived in the mail wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy earlier than its expected date! Which is all a plus in my book!</li>
            <li> I have worn my hair natural for 5+ years. When I wanted a straight style (maybe once every other month), I would blow dry may hair and flat iron it. This took a few hours to accomplish. When I would step outside in the South Mississippi heat and humidity, POUF! This product is perfect because it allows you to flat iron your hair and it will STAY STRAIGHT as long as you like! I even wore my hair straight during rainy days with ZERO frizz. I was worried that I would not have my natural curls again. That was not the case. My curls came back after washing with no damage. No harsh chemicals. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product smells god awful, and does absolutely nothing but coat your hair with a dry sticky film. There is no straightening factor what so ever.  Seriously, I felt absolutely NO DIFFERENCE in my hair after using thsi product what so ever.</li>
            <li> The product is great, it does just as it promises but I have very weak hair and I find that after a couple uses my hair has broken a lot. When I tried the product with my sister&#x27;s hair it worked well and is still keeps it straight as it does but even with her hair I have noticed slight breakage as well, and she is not one to retouch and restraighten her hair as often as I do. I feel like maybe ti because when the product is in theres a tendency to hesitate using different products to take care of the hair because of worry that the effects of the cream may wear off. And it&#x27;s hard to wash out even with the shampoo provided. I would still buy this product though because it makes my hair look good, but after I have taken car of it because of the damage.</li>
            <li> I have tired so many products that promised to do what Beautiful Textures Naturally Straight has done for my hair. The products that I have tried, Mizani for one; which I thought was pretty good, but it did not stop the kitchen area (hair at the nape of the neck) from reverting. Usually with the Mizani I was using the flat iron within the next two days or so and I know I was damaging my hair with all that heat. Motions smoothing system was the first one that I tried and I was impressed with how it soften the hair in the kitchen area, but at the first sign of humidity or rain it reverted right back, and I once again found myself with the flat iron in my hand within two or three days time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many smoothing systems and my hair has defeated everyone last one of them. I am still not exactly sure just where or even when I heard about this smoothing system, but it was the first one that I saw that actually had a model with the same texture hair (coarse, tight curls) that I have and it actually seemed to work. I have done a lot of research on these smoothing systems and they are all not created equal. Most work well on the mixed chicks, but not the tightly coiled group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say I was skeptical about this product is an understatement, but I was at my wits end and I am determined not to go back to the creamy crack, even though I was this close. Long story short I bought this and it has worked wonders on my hair. Not only does the flat iron last, but my hair is so soft and manageable and it does not go back at the first mention of rain or humidity, not even when I perspire. To Beautiful Textures I say, do not change a thing about this product, nor any of the products that goes with this system,as so far, they have all worked just exactly the way the maker said they should. I am ever- so- grateful to whomever it is that came up with this product. Now, I only have to flat iron once a week because that is how often I wash my hair and the flat iron last from week to week. This is my fourth week and the product promises to last from 4 to 6 weeks and I honestly believe I am going to go the distance. Thanks again Beautiful Textures for an awesome product.</li>
            <li> Good product, thanks.</li>
            <li> LOOVEE IT the only reason why its not a 5 because its only been a few days. however usually when i straighten my hair it last only hours! make sure you follow the instructions, overall its a great product hopefully they can perfect it so others can benefit too.</li>
            <li> It makes the hair really soft but it reverts the minute you step outside. This could be because the hair is very thick african 4c hair. I think it works better for people with a looser curl pattern</li>
            <li> The product worked beautifully! It did exactly what it was supposed to do. When I wanted to revert to my curls, a quick wash is all it took! Great product!</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews and watching videos about this, I finally decided to give it a try. My friend does hair professionally so she applied it for me. We followed the directions exactly, except for the heat suggestion for the flat iron, we used 450. My hair is very thick and a bit on the corse side. Well when she finish, it looked great!! My hair was extremely soft and bounce. However, in the evening when I was cooking, I felt my roots poof up. It didn&#x27;t get as big as it normally would had I just straighten it on my own, but it was slowly reverting. I fell asleep without wrapping it, so when I woke up the next morning, I basically had a fro :( I did notice that when I washed my hair with my own shampoo and conditioner that  I didn&#x27;t have as much shrinkage as I normally do. I will try it again in the winter time, but I would only recommend this product if you have fine/curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was very interested in using this product based on the positive reviews.  I have texlax/transitioning hair, which is very thick and coarse.  I applied the product according to instructions.  I had a really hard time de-tangling my hair and felt like there was more breakage than usual.  Also, my hair was sticking and knotting up as I was blow drying my hair.  The first 8 hours, my hair was very straight but not soft at all.  However, I live in a humid climate and the product just didn&#x27;t do what it was intended to do.  Also, after working out, about 24 hours later, my hair was back to its normal state.  I have a routine that I do to get my hair straight, without the sticky residue that this product causes.  I was hoping to try this product to see if the results would be better.  I would say for all of those with transitioning hair to be weary of this product.  It did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised. This rating is for the product which didnt do much for my roots because they became puffy once humidity hit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the middle of transitioning and tried this on my roots.  Well, for one it changed by jet black hair to a reddish brown.  I could live with that, but it left a strange film on my hair that made it extremelly unmanagable and hard to comb.  After the second wash with their shampoo and conditioner, my new growth reverted back to it&#x27;s natural state plus left the film making it hard to comb.  Lost a lot of hair trying to comb through my roots.  I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Just okay for me.  I found something that works better,  but will not advertise here.</li>
            <li> Loved it! I have never been able to get my natural hair to look that good from flat ironing it before. I went to a family picnic in the park where it rained briefly twice and it still held up fine. Washed a week 1/2 later and curls came back fine. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> If you have short hair (just barely chin length) and your hair is completely natural, such as 4c natural, then this product m ay not be for you. Since the instructions state &amp;#34;do not oversaturate your hair&amp;#34; it makes it a little impossible to ensure that the product gets completely through your hair. I noticed that the product did not state whether or not you should comb the product through your hair, if I could have combed the product through my hair I believe I would have achieved better results. The shampoo and conditioner pack that is provided in the kit is only enough for one wash and after that you are left trying to find a Walgreens that may or may not carry the regular size bottles of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago and have been natural for a year and my hair came out looking amazing but when I went to revert back to my natural hair, the front remained straight and still is hopefully it&#x27;ll shrink to it&#x27;s natural state. I&#x27;ll be keeping up with how long that takes but overall it&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Since it has cooled down outside, I wanted to start wearing my hair straight because it won&#x27;t frizz back up as easily. I wanted to use this kit because I have the actual Beautiful Textures shampoo, leave-in and other styling products. My aunt had told me if I use their regular leave-in for 20 mins, it equals using this kit. But I was skeptical because the leave-in doesn&#x27;t have the same ingredients. So I used this kit and let me say..WOW. I have 3c/4a natural hair and it is THICK. So I shampooed my hair and the mistake I made is I shampooed it in the sink then shampooed in the shower. So my hair was washed in two different directions so it tangled up and I shed some hair. The leave-in is VERY watery so be careful when pouring. The instructions tell you to apply to your hair than detangle but I sectioned my hair in 4 and detangled then added it to each section. A little goes a long way. I paid attention to my hairline and re-added once I was done with all sections. I let it sit for 20 minutes. I counted from when I started applying the product. I blow dried and it left a residue on my hair. Once I flat ironed, the residue was gone. I used their Curly-to-Straight flat iron silkener as an added heat protectant and flat ironed. My hair is LAID. I still have enough leave-in for another application so I am sooooo happy with this. its 3 days later and my hair is still silky straight and flat. Plus I found this in my local BSS and it was only $7...can&#x27;t beat that</li>
            <li> I used this product a week ago for the first time ever on my totally natural hair and the directions say, you must blow dry your hair completely dry and use a flat iron in order for the product to work correctly, which ruined my hair. This product was uneffective the results were horrible and because of the overheat usage my hair has become  brittle and fragile  is still constantly  breaking off. I made a terrible mistake by using this please don&#x27;t even purchase it.</li>
            <li> It didnt work for me or make a difference at all</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. After a year of having natural curly hair I have ruined my hair by using this product. My hair never reverted back to curly after this product. My hair is brittle, dry and straight. Even when I get my Brazilian blowouts my hair returns to curly after washing but after using this product, and trying every method it&#x27;s safe to say my once curly gorgeous natural hair is ruined!!!</li>
            <li> This product worked exactly as I needed it to. My hair is keratin treated and I was looking for a way to tame my new growth.&lt;br /&gt;I made a point to coat my hair evenly with the solution, but not use so much that it felt sticky or slimy. I was able to apply more to my roots in subsequent washes.&lt;br /&gt;My hair stayed straight during a weekend of rain and being misted on, and straightened much more quickly. I retouched my roots once or twice but the effects lasted at least 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> 4C natural hair, very course &amp; thick. This stuff made my hair look like I got a perm. I have never gotten my hair this straight while being natural. It lasted in the shower &amp; outside(TX).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says don&#x27;t over saturate but you know your hair so use as much as you think you need. I parted into 4 sections &amp; put two quarter size smounts of conditioner on each section.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll it straightened my hair good it was soft and bouncy, but a lot of shedding after using it, want use this product again, I will try the motions straight product to see how that works.</li>
            <li> I am giving the product three starts because I may simply used it wrong, but my hair has YET to revert back to its original curl pattern and its been over 2 months since I did the treatment.  I am trying hard not to get upset about the fact my curl pattern may never come back but the front and nape is a very looses curl pattern while the rest of my head is a kinkier coil.  I am soooo annoyed and will never try this product again.</li>
            <li> This just does not work with my virgin/natural hair at all. I have a tightly coiled 4c type hair and it does not make a difference at all unless very high level of heat is used to flat iron the hair which is what i am running away from. i dont want a permanent damage to my hair. I wish i did not buy 2 packs of this</li>
            <li> This is the product to try if you are anxious to see how long your hair is after months and months of shrinking curls!  LOL.  I have not used flat irons all year and every time I do, the style has lasted one day because of humidity.  I tried this product out after seeing a Youtube video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the end result was absolutely stunning.  I had so much softness and body it was unreal. However, getting through the initial steps were more than an undertaking.  The shampoo strips your hair to no moisture whatsoever, which is intended.  The leave-in doesn&#x27;t help at all with adding moisture back and I started to get worried.  However I followed the instructions and attempted to blow my hair out after the 20 min.  What&#x27;s unclear is do you leave it in 20 min after you&#x27;ve done all the sections or do you time from the 1st section?  It took me at least 20 min just to get it all throughout my hair, again your hair is stripped so trying to detangle is a monster (but doable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see any breakage or hair loss so I kept going.  In fact, I would say less hair came out than usual.  I also had not cut my ends in a few months so that didn&#x27;t help my plight!  If your ends aren&#x27;t freshly cut, you might want to have that done first or blowing it out and flat ironing will be difficult because of the balls on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get through flat ironing (I used the chase method using the penman thermo straightening brush) my hair came out GORGEOUS!!!!  SOOOO beautiful, I never knew I had natural hair so beautiful.  This product beats getting a relaxer ANY DAY.  It was well worth the effort and I learned some lessons along the way so the next time I apply it, it will be easier.  I would recommend using your flat iron on the lowest heat setting that will straighten your hair.  So that means, don&#x27;t use 450 heat if your hair will get straight at 375.  And, only use heat once!!  Afterward, I rolled my hair using flexi-rods and my curls were stunning.  You can still do twist outs and flex-rods sets once its dry but don&#x27;t apply any moisturizers just oil.  For a twist out just twist the hair and put a perm rod on the end, no need to add any product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not something I plan on consistently using back to back because I worry about causing heat damage.  So my plan is to use it 2-3 times a year when I&#x27;m wanting to do length checks and show off my gorgeous long locks.  I personally went for 3 weeks straight and went back to natural curls and had no damage whatsoever, in fact I feel like my hair improved.  I just like my curls better than I do straight hair at this point.  But I would definitely use it again for my next length check in a few months!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the ones that say their hair did not revert, I would say it may be user error or their hair was not in great shape to begin with.  There are no chemicals in this product, I don&#x27;t see any reason why it wouldn&#x27;t revert unless the temp on the flat iron was too high.  That is the primarily risk with using this product is that you have use the flat iron and if your temp setting is too hot, you can damage your hair whether you use this product or not!  Again, use lower heat setting starting out to be on the safe side (but not too low).  Try it girls!!</li>
            <li> Okay I originally thought this was awesome! But upon my first wash it didn&#x27;t stay straight as long as it did the first time which was a week by the way. The package insert says to wash your hair at least once a week with the maintenance shampoo and conditioner. They give u a sample of both and the full bottles are sold separately. In my opinion it should have came with it for this price...will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> My hair is mostly type 3c with a patch of 3a in the front and a patch of 3b in the back.  I followed the instructions: blow dry on medium heat with the leave-in conditioner and then flat iron hair on the recommended setting.  Within 15 minutes of my arrival at the theater, which had the heat on max unfortunately, my curls fell and my edges started to rise.  By the end of the event my hair was NOT straight and did not look like I had spent hours straightening it.    Pros: None because it didn&#x27;t work    Cons:  - Blow drying on medium took an extra 2hrs because of the volume of hair on my head.  - Leave-in conditioner made my scalp burn; It felt like there was alcohol or some other type of astringent in it  - My hair felt like it was coated with something sticky after blow drying.  The feeling went away after flat ironing  - It didn&#x27;t last 15 minutes in a hot theater so I sure it wouldn&#x27;t work for me in the summer time    I&#x27;ve gotten better results when I air dried my hair in double strand twists the day before and then flat ironed my hair.</li>
            <li> When I used it on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair,  it was straight and soft.  It did not weigh the hair down,  it was thick and bouncy.  When I reversed her hair to natural, it was easy.  The hair got curly,  but it became softer than before I used the beautiful texture naturally straight on her hair.  Overall,  I would say this product was the best I ever used.  The hair stayed straight for two weeks without any additional flat iron.  I have given one to my sister to try it on her hair.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t been this silky since I was relaxed! I love this stuff! The shampoo is a little drying but not too bad imo. Ive heard that the leave in makes it impossible to detangle and leaves a residue but I didn&#x27;t have any problems. The one thing i don&#x27;t like about this system is its lack of a deep conditioner. Also to be on the safe side I used Chi 44 Iron Guard heat protector and a little JBCO for shine. My hair is super smooth and bouncy. The bottles are small but a little goes a long way. I have shoulder length hair but its dense and coarse and I still have some product left over. I can wait to my next wash to use the anti reversion shampoo and conditioner that comes with it. I would definitely recommend this product for naturals who want to go straight every once in a while.</li>
            <li> Please do not use this product if you have type 4C/4B hair. You can achieve the same using your regular blow out process.</li>
            <li> Amazing! My hair was soft and my hair stayed straight for weeks, even after washing it.</li>
            <li> I really want to try this but I&#x27;m not sure it will work , my hair have been in braids and I really don&#x27;t want to relax or texturize ahhhh</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it actually works. I didn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as the girl on the box but it was quite decent. Application was not hard but I recommend that you wear gloves and try not to get it on your skin because it stings. The entire process tool 3.5 hours but I curled mine after I flat ironed it. I am on day three and it is still straight and soft but I look like I need a perm. I will definitely try this again.....maybe when my hair gets longer.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! My hair and my families hair was less bushy and withstood rain and humidity. This is not hard to apply. It lasted the four weeks also! Our hair was shiny and felt nice!</li>
            <li> If you wanted to straighten your hair for a special event or something i would say get this,Do it the day of or before then WASH IT OUT!! My hair is relaxed and i Have a lot of new growth it pretty much did nothing to keep that straight....it kept my relaxed ends straight BUT  after a while my hair felt soooo dry and an brittle it was breaking like crazy  I could not wait to wash it out so yeah your hair will stay straight but it does not feel moisturized at all</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last long because of humidity</li>
            <li> made my hair dry and hard.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t straighten my hair very often and when I do humidity is always a problem but this enabled me to keep my hair straight for two weeks. It could have lasted longer if I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair. It does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product online, I was a bit skeptical b/c many of the women who had reviewed it were rocking some 3C/4A curls. Not me! My hair is thick and reverts at the first sign of sweat (I&#x27;m thinking 4B/4C). before getting this product, I resigned to never flat ironing my hair again as it was a waste of time—it wouldn&#x27;t lay flat and would quickly revert so never enjoy my &#x27;straight&#x27; hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this product at my local beauty supply and applied it to my leave-out (I currently have straight crochet braids installed) and let me tell you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT GAVE MY HAIR LIFE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes—my hair was glossy w/shine, had movement, everything! The last time I had experienced this was when I paid $300 for a keratin treatment but even then I don&#x27;t remember my hair having such shine and movement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had followed its simple instructions to a tee, and as a result I got lovely, shiny, straight hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, disclaimer, I did not apply this product to my whole head. Perhaps if I had done my entire head, my results may have been different but I doubt it, so you decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: This will not be the last time I use this product!</li>
            <li> Awesome worked as stated! Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> it is okey. but I prefer a BKT for my afro hair.</li>
            <li> I have 4C short to medium length hair that is usually hard to straighten. My hair is very prone to reversion, and normally is right back to its afro state after a hot shower, or a long day. I applied this system three weeks ago, and my hair is STILL straight! I have a little reversion at my roots, but nothing too noticeable. So yes, when used correctly, this product will definitely get your hair straight and help it last. But the best part of all is definitely the body and bounce! My hair turned out so bouncy and full, even better than I could have imagined. Definitely worth the try if you&#x27;re natural looking to add some versatility to your hairstyle catalogue!</li>
            <li> I want to use this product I been natural almost 2 years now and I want my hair to be straight with out a rexlaxer. My ends or very dry will this straight them also?</li>
            <li> It straightened my roots but my ends were dry even though I used it twice😖 Plus my hair still frizzed but not too much. So dissapointed in this product. I was expecting more for the price. I&#x27;ll just have to try other products to smooth my hair. Maybe WEN</li>
            <li> i was kinda worried at first that it wouldn&#x27;t straighten it that well my hair is a kinky coily texture and super thick so when i opened the box i was kinda hesitant but after coin the steps i finally flat ironed my hair with my chi on 360 and i have to say that it did better than expected my hair was shiny an soft i love it also i bought the bought the anti reversion hair shine.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t expect your hair to be as &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; as the ladies&#x27; on the box - remember, &amp;#34;they&amp;#34; have to sell the product. That said, my hair came out soft and a little bouncy even in the hot/humid/ no a/c conditions I used the product in, and even though I used more than the recommended amount of the conditioner because my hair is thick. It did not come out shiny/glossy, it&#x27;s a little dry too, so I&#x27;ll have to put in a little bit of oil. If this products continues to work, and my hair doesn&#x27;t revert (it hasn&#x27;t so far), I&#x27;ll buy again next month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m searching for tips from those who said they had minimal reversion to figure out what I&#x27;m doing wrong. I used it on my hair first, same experience as most with initial application and concerns about lack of moisture. Also a definite issue detangling; after learning about detangling with conditioner with slip this felt like i was punishing my hair. A lot of people comment about their hair getting straight; that was not my worry. I need this to prevent reversion after all that work, which seems to be the primary marketed goal of this product.  I sweat from the scalp and I felt like the poof came just like it normally would.&lt;br /&gt;The first use of shampoo and conditioner was a much better detangle and dry. I felt my ends may have gotten less puffy, but i felt it just should stay straight with no touch up, period. So with my daughter i went against the instructions and did not apply the leave in lightly. It must work, so I&#x27;ll do her hair differently right? She also has crazy thick hair and is the main reason i was testing this because she loves her hair straight. She bragged about standing in the rain and her hair didn&#x27;t get curly. But I&#x27;m looking at her,&amp;#34;babe, have your edges and roots been poofy this whole time though?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Oh well, yeah.&amp;#34; So, seems like the ends don&#x27;t revert as quickly but it&#x27;s a questionable effect if my roots are on baby fro. And yes of course i applied to roots and ends. My cousin saw me buy it and tried it with similar results. All three of us natural with different curly to coily hair, not wavy not super kinky. So how does that work with different heads, unimpressive results?&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m used to my straightened hair getting big and I roll with it. But what was the point of me torturing my tresses(what it seemed like) during that initial application if it&#x27;s not gonna stay bone straight?&lt;br /&gt;If y&#x27;all have suggestions let me know. Using the rest of the two kits on her today but I don&#x27;t have extraordinary expectations. It didn&#x27;t seem to harm our hair so I&#x27;ll use it up.</li>
            <li> I use this kit all the time  i have long hair but naturally curly/frizzy hair so when its my natural texture it is difficult to manage. This kit allows me to straighten my hair with out it reverting back right away from the humidity. I live in florida so its difficult to manage straight hair this kit is amazing it truly works for me.</li>
            <li> My hair type is 3c-4a and I can straighten my hair very well without this system however it poofs back up with any type of weather or workout. So I purchased this product after hearing all the great reviews from other naturals. It has been less than 24 hours and my hair has already gone back to looking how it normally would after I straightened my hair.&lt;br /&gt;After the shampoo my hair felt squeaky clean which was great. Then I put the leave in conditioner in just as the directions recommended and my hair felt more tangled. after blow drying my hair felt even more poofier. Normally I blow dry my hair and I can run my fingers through it, after using this product the back of my hair was a tangled mess. I then flat ironed it on a temp of 355 and I could tell this product was a waste of money. My hair felt dull and lifeless :( so I pin curled it overnight and I woke up and my hair looked pretty good. I could already feel it getting poofy before I got out the house. Then I took my 5 min walk into work and my hair looked like a flat frizzy mess by the time I got in the building. I now have my hair pinned up so it can look halfway decent.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to see how it will look if I do a wash and go.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would not use this product again and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I had high (yet realistic) hopes for this stuff but ended up sorely disappointed. It didn&#x27;t straighten any better than regular flat ironing, and my hair went right back to its original texture (3b/c) upon the first wash, and I used only the included shampoo and conditioner. I have pretty strong hair. Damage isn&#x27;t a big issue. But after just one use of this system, my ends were a raggedy mess! I ended up cutting 2.5&amp;#34; off to deal with the split ends. Other people seem to have had better luck with this system than I, but I will never use it again. Not to mention, the straightening solution smells awful.</li>
            <li> I have thick waist length type 4a hair. the box comes with 2 small products in a bottle that you are supposed to one wash your hair with into condition before drying and flat ironing your hair. there wasn&#x27;t enough product in these bottles to coat my hair evenly. the direction indicate that you are not to put too much product on your hair otherwise it will work against your desired outcome. I made sure that my roots received the attention that it needed with the product.  however there wasn&#x27;t enough to spread throughout the shaft of my hair. I followed the directions as indicated both bottles were empty before even being able to fully coat my hair and literally the same day my hair sweated out. I live in very hot climate in excess of over a hundred degrees and high humidity. unfortunately my hair reverted back.  I am Not sure if it is due to the amount of hair that I have and the little product that they offer or if it&#x27;s just the product not working well... I will like to try this product again maybe buying two boxes in seeing if it will work. it&#x27;s unfortunate that you can&#x27;t buy the products needed individually in regular sized bottles so that way you can treat your hair the way that it&#x27;s supposed to. also it would be better if they were to tell you about how much product you should have it just says don&#x27;t over saturate your hair but one person&#x27;s interpretation of saturation could be completely different than another persons and so that&#x27;s just pretty much my opinion on that. note I did apply the product to my hair in a spray bottle to ensure that it was evenly spread throughout my entire hair and not just on one area and I did rub it in throughout my hair so it was coated but the products bottles are very small and not enough to cover my head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also the box indicated that you will feel the product on your hair even after you blow dry it but when you flat iron it that feeling will go away I still felt the residue on my hair it didn&#x27;t go away as theyindicated which I did not like as I do not apply product to my hair at all and so to be able to feel that... bothered me. And I didn&#x27;t notice that my hair got any straighter with this product I know some people on other reviews that I&#x27;ve seen indicated how straight and silky their hair was after putting the onto their hair. my hair has always gotten really fine once I flat ironed my hair and it will look like type 1 hair and I didn&#x27;t notice any change in how flat my hair has gotten and I use a 400° flatiron.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and I generally wear my hair straight. In the spring summer months, it&#x27;s the most challenging to stay straight with all the humidity in the NY area. I&#x27;ve read up on this Beautiful Textures TMS  product and  I trusted that it didn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;harsh chemicals&amp;#34; as advertised. Boy was I wrong!!  I had a sever allergic reaction. Itchy scalp, red patches along the nape of my neck, ears, face and swollen lymph nodes. And as a result,  had to be put on steroids. So I would suggest you test this product on a small area before using. Straight hair is not worth the harmful side effects.</li>
            <li> I am on week 2 going into week 3. and I really don&#x27;t even care if my hair doesn&#x27;t make it for the next few weeks.  I overly satisfied just being able to have straight non frizzy hair. The weather has been horrible.  I been walking in rain, its been foggy, the humidity is ridiculous. (New Orleans, Louisiana, we practically live in water)  My hair is still flawless. I&#x27;M IN LOVE. Best product by far.  I didn&#x27;t have any problem  My hair is not dry like others complain about but I&#x27;m also a moisturizer junkie and before I blow dried it,  I did add a a quarter size amount of coconut oil to my hair to help with heat damage.(I&#x27;m not sure if that actually helps or not to be honest, but it makes me feel good about it) I wash my hair two days ago and my curls came back. (Wonderful). I flat iron it again and hair still flawless and I think this time it actually shines more.(I used grapeseed oil instead of coconut oil this time because that was what was in my reach) I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;m sorry for the ones that it didn&#x27;t work for but I&#x27;m beyond impressed. I&#x27;m excited an have been telling my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Thua product sis wonders for my hair. I&#x27;m back curly now and my curls is still popping lol</li>
            <li> works really well, I use it every two weeks but do NOT put a flat iron on anything but my edges in between. Mom has complained about the smell it has when I flat iron Smell will go away after a couple of days and I personally don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> Love this product thought originally it would do nothing for my hair allllll wrong works wonders my hair is soft bouncy and straight</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;m biracial (black and white) have medium length, fine hair and previously would have that fluffy look as the day went on when i tried to wear my hair flat ironed. This product 98% reduces that! Even in humid Dallas, TX. I can wear my hair straight, silky and smooth for up to two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even today it drizzled a little, and my hair was perfectly fine. there is a bit of a weird smell, especially when it gets some water on it. But it&#x27;s chemicals, what do you expect, and for me that&#x27;s a small price to pay to have frizz free, silky, smooth hair all day long. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4c type hair and this product helped, but my hair slightly reverted after one shower. I watched so many YT reviews on the TMS system and everyone said &amp;#34;don&#x27;t over saturate&amp;#34;. I think I under saturated as some of the strands reverted while others stayed straight. Next time I use the system I will saturate my hair more with the product.</li>
            <li> This Product is a must have for anyone looking to &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34; back-n-forth from curly to straight!! I have been transitioning for about 2 years now, I have gained alot of length and thickness back to my hair!! I was so Addicted to the (creamy crack), It has taken alot just dealing with my hair in its natural state( 4c)... I was ready to call it a sham, ready to say there has got to be a catch, I tried on a few hair tracks at first, (kinky curly hair).. It worked, but I still wasnt convinced, I then took the bait, I bit the apple, Yes Ladies it works!!!! My hair after a normal blow out, will get smooth and straight, but one hot flash and BAM, instant afro,, well it took about 1 hr to complete the steps.. from wash to flat iron.. its 90 degrees, in my car in traffic, hot flashing like noones business..got out car hair is blowing in the wind, still holding up!!</li>
            <li> Save your money ! Does not work !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking all over for this product because my hair is naturally curly and I always wanted to straighten it without messing up my curl pattern this a great choice and buy if you wanna try it out</li>
            <li> it worked for me but the smell is horrible! so bad i cannot conceive using it again</li>
            <li> Not impressed. I have thick 4c hair. By the time I got to flat ironing the back of my head, my front roots had already began reverting. I was careful not to oversaturate as the box indicated, maybe I should have used more. My hair looked more like a blow out than the supposed straighten look on the box.</li>
            <li> They warn you not to use other products while using this but my hair is seriously dry!!!  My hairdresser wanted to add moisture before flat ironing but I told her not to.  She warned me that my hair would be extremely dry but I told her that the product manufacturers said that upon flat ironing it would cause the hair to be soft and smooth.  Not so at all.  My 4A/4B hair is extremely dry and even though I added moisturizer, it made little difference.  My hair is mostly straight but not completely so.  Will keep updated on how long the style lasts.    UPDATE  This is now week 2.  I guess everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  I do not see how this can last 4-6 weeks, especially not on my hair!  I must admit that after washing it with the anti-reversion shampoo and conditioner, I added my own stuff to my hair and it was more moisturized.  I addition, after blow drying and flat ironing my hair this time, the back of my hair was a little straighter a little longer (about 3 hours).  I have mostly 4A hair in the back.  It did not respond well when it was first applied and reverted almost immediately.  It is still a bit dry but because I added my own products, it is not as bad as the first time.  It has now been 4 days since I flat ironed again and the roots of my hair, some parts of the front of my hair and the back of my hair has reverted.  At least I know that when I wash it with the right shampoo this weekend my natural curls will come back.      I don&#x27;t know if I will use this product again.  My hair reverts too quickly and it is awkward having one texture in the back and another in the front.</li>
            <li> Softens my hair really well. I can&#x27;t understate how soft my hair was. Love that! Lost two stars because of the reversion. About the same as if I hadn&#x27;t used a system or any &amp;#34;anit-reversion&amp;#34; conditioner at all. I would use this for if you would like to maintain a straight style for a night or two. Normally, kinky-haired people would need to use a lot of oil to prevent damage, but this system allows your hair to stay light and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I have 3C, fully natural, no chemicals, bra strap length, African American hair.  This product worked well for me. I didn&#x27;t have much reversion if any at all.  I flat iron on 400.  One pass only!  If your texture doesn&#x27;t return it is heat damage, Not the product. I&#x27;ve used this product several times and my hair reverted fully every time. No problem.  I deep condition before I use the shampoo to make sure my hair is in an optimal state to take on heat styling. I also use a dime size amount of Chi Silk Infusion as heat protectant.  The shampoo is kind of strong. So I suggest only lathering with it once.  I waited to use this three times before reviewing.  That said...My hair is soft like a fresh relaxer.  Not dry. Not tangled. Silky straight.  Every time I use it, it gets better.</li>
            <li> I used this system a month ago today and my hair never reverted back to my head full of curls. I&#x27;ve been natural since 2006. My hair is a 3c with some areas of 3b. The front now looks terrible like heat damage. It won&#x27;t curl at all unless I manipulate it somehow. The rest of my hair feels brittle dry and just a hot mess. When I applied the system I tried not to oversaturate. When I blow dried it felt horrible very sticky and difficult to get through. The flat ironing process was no better. The stick feeling remained. I washed my hair after a week and used a clarifying shampoo ever since. But my hair just doesn&#x27;t seem like it will ever be the same. The only thing I see working is another big chop which I refuse to do. So right now I&#x27;m using shea moisture Jamaican black castor oil products to try and help the health of my hair. After valentines day I will be joining the dread heads. This is horrible.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this system. I used it when I was natural and I use it to extend my relaxer now that I&#x27;m texlaxed. I have links to the videos showing my results.&lt;br /&gt;On natural hair:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;REP7WIFfAw8&amp;list&#x3D;UUbAIkkW3nMLLJgDDVWLRFsw&lt;br /&gt;On my texlaxed hair: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;NBxv93HHvhw&amp;list&#x3D;UUbAIkkW3nMLLJgDDVWLRFsw</li>
            <li> Great product does what it states.</li>
