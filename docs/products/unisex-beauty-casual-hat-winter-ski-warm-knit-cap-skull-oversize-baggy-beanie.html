            <li>Great hat!</li>
            <li>kinda unconfortable wear and dont look as good as in the picture.</li>
            <li>very stylish even for a guy</li>
            <li>hope it will be ok after that..  </li>
            <li>the quality looks ok.</li>
            <li>Love this hat.</li>
            <li>It is what the company says it is..very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, warm and secure on my head.</li>
            <li>It came damp and  smelled strongly of mildew.  </li>
            <li>Nice and big and cozy..very cute!</li>
            <li>The picture looks better than the real thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>fabric feels great and not as itchy as other hats...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right for me.</li>
            <li>nice quality for a beanie hat, but it was a bit snug and i would say that my head is pretty average</li>
            <li>I expected it to be more baggy like the one shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li>Fit as expected, and is fashionable...</li>
            <li>Maybe if I stretch it out a bit it will help but its super long.</li>
            <li>Not as adult &#x27;oversized&#x27; as stated!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a tight fit.  </li>
            <li>I like this hat because it&#x27;s enough room for my hair to fit under it no matter what style I have and its not to thick to make me feel hot.</li>
            <li>Its not slouchy at all and is super stiff.</li>
            <li>Not worth to return since it didn&#x27;t cost that much to begin with.</li>
