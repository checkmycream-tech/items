            <li>My wife bought some of the hand creme in this scent, and I was so enraptured by it that I wanted her to wear a more \\&quot;liquid perfumed\\&quot; version.</li>

            <li>A lovely scent and so inexpensive...</li>
            <li>what more can a girl ask for?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sweet, but not like a holiday cookies kind of smell.</li>
            <li>Smells very sweet</li>
            <li>Very light clean smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li>so strong</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant, sweet, and great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>She was very pleased that I was able to get her two more bottles to last her for a while.</li>
            <li>I have every product that is available in this scent</li>
            <li>All will enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>the sell didn&#x27;t securely pack the glass bodymist.</li>
            <li>This product is no longer available through BBW.</li>
            <li>I was beyond excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>i havent received it yet, but this is my absolute favorite scent</li>
            <li>sweet stinky cookies on my skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very pretty and made of glass not plastic.</li>
            <li>but i love that it is strong because you only need one spray.</li>
            <li>it not been packed right by seller</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s warm and it&#x27;s different from the alcoholy-perfume scents that we pay so much for.</li>
            <li>This body mist has a wonderful fragrance, soft and subtle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this since it first came out at Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li>I was truly surprised to find it available anywhere again</li>
            <li>Sadly, I&#x27;d never buy again unless this issue gets resolved.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>The fact that this product however was discontinued, makes me very upset!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I was upset when Bath &amp; Body Works discontinued this product and bought as many bottles as I could before they closed it out.  </li>
            <li>sometimes it gives me a headache if it is too much.</li>
            <li>and so I spent a whole lot more than I ever did for a bottle.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, as I was nursing my last tiny dropplets.</li>
            <li>not sure why people say the scent doesnt last, i spray in the morning and still smells great in the evening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the once scent from B&amp;BW that I cant live without!</li>
            <li>I love the smell but the only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, another reviewer claimed it smelled \\&quot;too cookie sweet\\&quot; on her skin, but she must be in the minority, because it smelled wonderful on every female that sampled my wife&#x27;s hand creme.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;Shea Cashmere\\&quot; is a delicate, soft and very sexy fragrance that should do the trick.</li>
            <li>I love this and wore if for a few years.</li>
            <li>my new go to fragrance for summer and winter seasons in S.  Florida.</li>
            <li>If any guys are here shopping around to buy a very feminine and divine fragrance for their ladies, then look no further.</li>
            <li>reminds me of summer!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s that soft but noticeable fragrance .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on it as opposed to other, more expensive perfumes.</li>
            <li>This smells fantastic but it only lasts for less than an hour.</li>
            <li>so I took my posting down because the seller said give me a chances to make it right.</li>
            <li>if anyone is skeptical about this scent, i will tell you it&#x27;s amazing.</li>

            <li> if anyone is skeptical about this scent, i will tell you it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very natural, slightly musky vanilla - can&#x27;t imagine anyone hating it</li>
            <li> i am not generally a fan of scents that are too flowerly/fruity/chemical-ly</li>
            <li> and I will keep wearing it long as Amazon sell this product..</li>
            <li> it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> and this was the only one I was missing.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when the Bath and Body Works store stopped carrying the True Blue Spa Shea Cashmire Fragrance Mist.</li>
            <li> have moved on because the price is not worth the product.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t buy it again unless the price goes down</li>
            <li> but this product a little to pricey for them..</li>
            <li> and that was a little over a year ago.  </li>
            <li> I had trouble identifying what the addiction is, but I think it&#x27;s the underlying butterscotch scent.  </li>
            <li> so when I open it was just broken glass.</li>
            <li> Since Bath and Body discontinued this product it was hard to find.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s $80 and up, which is absolutely ridiculous</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t worried about the bottle being broken at all.</li>
            <li> and I was so sad that it was gone.</li>
            <li> But since Body and Bath discontinued it, the prices have been absolutely disgusting from the independent retailers.</li>
            <li> It is very unfortunate that Bath and Body discontinued carrying the mist.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to find it online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that Bath and Body Works is no longer</li>
            <li> but if you hate vanilla, it probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> i hate that they do not sell it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This spray has the same heavenly aroma as the creams.  However, it might be overkill if one uses the creams on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I use the lotion as well. The bottle is very pretty and made of glass not plastic. I love the smell but the only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t last. I would describe the initial smell as vanilla, brown sugar, and brazillian nut. Heavenly!</li>
            <li> My wife bought some of the hand creme in this scent, and I was so enraptured by it that I wanted her to wear a more \\&quot;liquid perfumed\\&quot; version. So, I came to Amazon and found this body spray and immediately ordered two bottles as a surprise for her. Unfortunately, another reviewer claimed it smelled \\&quot;too cookie sweet\\&quot; on her skin, but she must be in the minority, because it smelled wonderful on every female that sampled my wife&#x27;s hand creme. If any guys are here shopping around to buy a very feminine and divine fragrance for their ladies, then look no further. This \\&quot;Shea Cashmere\\&quot; is a delicate, soft and very sexy fragrance that should do the trick. Trust me.</li>
            <li> i havent received it yet, but this is my absolute favorite scent and i was devastated when i found out this week they had discontinued it. THANK GOD YOU ARE SELLING THIS ON AMAZON! i bought two bottles and i can&#x27;t wait to get them. if anyone is skeptical about this scent, i will tell you it&#x27;s amazing. i am not generally a fan of scents that are too flowerly/fruity/chemical-ly and i explained what i wanted to the lady at the store and she pulled this one out and it was absolutely perfect. it&#x27;s sweet, but not like a holiday cookies kind of smell. it&#x27;s warm and it&#x27;s different from the alcoholy-perfume scents that we pay so much for. yay!!!</li>
            <li> Probably THE best scent ever from bath and body works.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why people say the scent doesnt last, i spray in the morning and still smells great in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;If you like very strong scents or floral scents this is probably not for you.</li>
            <li> I have worn this many times and get nothing but compliments on it. It is now known to be my scent where I work. lol And I have coworkers coming into my cubicle to borrow the hand cream. I get more compliments on it as opposed to other, more expensive perfumes. The fact that this product however was discontinued, makes me very upset!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT product!!!</li>
            <li> I got this from a guy because he knew I liked shea but this smells to alcoholy and  sweet stinky cookies on my skin.Smells very sweet</li>
            <li> This body mist has a wonderful fragrance, soft and subtle. I get so many comments.  It is very unfortunate that Bath and Body discontinued carrying the mist. It was wonderful to be able to get it through Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this since it first came out at Bath and Body Works. Now Bath and Body Works doesn&#x27;t carry the mist I have to purchase this off of Amazon..I love this scent, my husband thinks it smells really good on me..My friends also says this smell so good they want to purchase it but this product a little to pricey for them..I love it and I will keep wearing it long as Amazon sell this product..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon, because I thought I would never be able to find this again..</li>
            <li> All I have to say is that I love this frangrance mist!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells sooooo wonderful.  I ALWAYS receive compliments when I wear it and people are always inquiring about what scent I am wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I can no longer purchase this in my local Bath &amp; Body Works stores, I&#x27;m simply ecstatic that I can now purchase this on-line via this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve made my one happy gal!!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  It is so light and pleasant.  I&#x27;m disappointed that Bath and Body Works is no longer&lt;br /&gt;carrying it.</li>
            <li> I use this product on a daily basis. The price is fair and I anticipate purchasing again and again.  Not any reason not to.</li>
            <li> This is the once scent from B&amp;BW that I cant live without! I have every product that is available in this scent and this was the only one I was missing. I was beyond excited to find it on Amazon. Even though it is only 3.4 oz it lasts a very long time. Shipping was fast. I will definetly order this again</li>
            <li> Great service. Great product. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> bath and body no longer carry the spray mist.  I use this instead of a perfume. receive complements often, from ladies and men and my grandsons.</li>
            <li> I wear this all the time, and get compliments on it wherever I go.   I had trouble identifying what the addiction is, but I think it&#x27;s the underlying butterscotch scent.  It&#x27;s a very natural, slightly musky vanilla - can&#x27;t imagine anyone hating it but if you hate vanilla, it probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance very feminine. Love it. I have been looking all over for this fragrance, the stores no longer carries it.  Bummer  ;+{</li>
            <li> This product has been discontinued by the manufacturer but my mother has used it for years. She was very pleased that I was able to get her two more bottles to last her for a while.</li>
            <li> I became a fan of this scent when I tried the hand cream. It&#x27;s pleasant, sweet, and great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a heavenly scent which lingers and evokes warmth, sensuality, and comfort. All will enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it!&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of summer!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s that soft but noticeable fragrance .&lt;br /&gt;I get tons of complements on it.</li>
            <li> I purchase this bodymisted a while back when I was depolyed on the USS Dwight D Eisenhower the sell didn&#x27;t securely pack the glass bodymist. I order 3 or 4 can&#x27; t remember actly but only one didn&#x27;t break do to it not been packed right by seller so when I open it was just broken glass. I then made a rating about it the seller got in contract with so I took my posting down because the seller said give me a chances to make it right. The seller offered to give me the money back but I say no just send me the bodymist because it was the only bodymist that I could use and been in the middle east on the water it was the best mist and a light smell. Well I never heard from the seller again or recieved my money back as of today.</li>
            <li> this is a fragrance I used for years and just loved it.  I was upset when Bath &amp; Body Works discontinued this product and bought as many bottles as I could before they closed it out.  I was truly surprised to find it available anywhere again and so I spent a whole lot more than I ever did for a bottle.  It&#x27;s just as wonderful as before, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll spend that much again.</li>
            <li> great product with great service thanks this as i said was a gift and the timming was the best would order again any time william r way to go.</li>
            <li> This is the nicest fragrance. Scent is wonderful, kind of like caramel, but that is my opinion, others may think different. A must buy.</li>
            <li> This product is no longer available through BBW. I was shocked to find it online. It arrived ahead of schedule. However, I believed I purchased the last bottle. I will miss this scent- Hopefully, BBW will bring this back.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when the Bath and Body Works store stopped carrying the True Blue Spa Shea Cashmire Fragrance Mist. I have tons of allergies and it&#x27;s the only Fragrance that doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze and itch. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, as I was nursing my last tiny dropplets. I received my product in a timely manner, in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Please keep selling this product! It&#x27;s Awesome! My husband loves this scent on me! It arrived on time and was packaged very nicely so I wasn&#x27;t worried about the bottle being broken at all. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> The company stopped making the body mist and I was so sad that it was gone. So happy to have found it here. I love the spray, it&#x27;s a scent that is fairly intoxicating, even for me!</li>
            <li> Love this scent, wish BBW still carried this.  Just glad I could find it here.</li>
            <li> Since Bath and Body discontinued this product it was hard to find. Very light clean smelling fragrance. Good for those who don&#x27;t like strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> I Love this! I used to buy it at Bath &amp; Body Works, but they stopped carrying it. I was so happy to find it for sale on Amazon. Love IT!</li>
            <li> Love it but the price went up so I won&#x27;t buy it again unless the price goes down</li>
            <li> I love this body mist...!  Last time I purchased this product; it was only $19.99 per bottle.  Now it&#x27;s $80 and up, which is absolutely ridiculous and that was a little over a year ago.  I guess it truly is all about that American Greed, huh?!</li>
            <li> I love this and wore if for a few years. But since Body and Bath discontinued it, the prices have been absolutely disgusting from the independent retailers. It is a 19.99 product selling for 80.00 and up? Seriously? Can you say gouging?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have moved on because the price is not worth the product.</li>
            <li> This smells fantastic but it only lasts for less than an hour. I have tried all the tricks to try and make a scent last longer &amp; it does not work with stuff. Sadly, I&#x27;d never buy again unless this issue gets resolved.</li>
            <li> my new go to fragrance for summer and winter seasons in S.  Florida. A lovely scent and so inexpensive...what more can a girl ask for?</li>
            <li> so strong but i love that it is strong because you only need one spray. sometimes it gives me a headache if it is too much. i hate that they do not sell it in stores anymore. ugh</li>
            <li> still have 1/2 bottles and spray stopped working.  very disappointed.  like the fragance but cannot use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where do I complain?</li>
