            <li>and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>but it is still perfect for catching hair.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. quality of the material is good, seems durable&lt;</li>
            <li>The hari catch cape is a good idea however it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this cape.</li>
            <li>Works better than the ones I used to use as a kid!</li>
            <li>I was using this to shave my own head.  </li>
            <li>I can see why this cape cost more and it does stand up on it own just like in the picture.  </li>
            <li>Good for a laugh though!</li>
            <li>makes clean up after a hair cut real easy.</li>
            <li>you will be pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll spend more time trying to keep it from collapsing</li>
            <li>now we love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would spread out better</li>
            <li>and it did catch most of the hair.</li>
            <li>Great idea, cape is very good, however, from being wrapped up it is hard to get straightened out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for when you live in an apartment and don&#x27;t want to get hair all over.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit from Japan, but works better than the cheap ones.  </li>
            <li>May catch most hair, but was cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s susupposed to, I use it for my husband and it has made clean up so very easy!</li>
            <li>easy to put on and remove and easy to discard the cut hair.  </li>
            <li>not too strong on the edge.</li>
            <li>However, I believe it is the best on the market right now for CATCHING hair, which means less cleaning for me.</li>
            <li>that were much more sturdy, the weight of the ring sort of falls in on its self and the shape never fully restored to a full circle.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to use, easy to clean, without having a fully draped cape on the body.</li>
            <li>Keeps perfect shape if you uncoil it and leave it out for a little bit.  </li>
            <li>Not so for the cheap brand.</li>
            <li>This is great if you need to trim someone&#x27;s hair on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>LOOKS LIKE IT WILL WORK GREAT IN THE FUTURE!</li>
            <li>Very handy for DIY haircut (short style).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cape isn&#x27;t worth buying!</li>
            <li>was more money than the &#x27;cheap&#x27; model but this model was the real deal.  </li>
            <li>The agreement is: wife cuts, I clean.</li>
            <li>Collected all of my hair and made clean up faster than ever.</li>
            <li>This is a big help in catching most of the hair clippings and saving on cleanup time.</li>
            <li>it is good and nice looking just what I am looking for but not wow me much, like the candy enclosed and the hand writing note.</li>
            <li>I really like this product it works really fine!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product, the quality is much better than what I expected it to be for the money</li>
            <li>Good construction, well thought out, easy to use and the manufacter put in details that once I saw them I knew they had actually spent time and brain power in making this &#x27;hair catcher cape&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>It catches the hair great and it&#x27;s mess free.</li>
            <li>It is more realistic of the guy having it on, where it is hanging on the shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li>Worth buying.</li>
            <li>Works good as expected.</li>
            <li>The quality is very good, so it seems it should last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact but the sides could be higher and not be so flimsy.</li>
            <li>inventive, quality was good but not perfect</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;3. can fold into a small roll, good for storage&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Easy enough to get it to hold shape if you use your brain.</li>
            <li>This caused hysteria at first, as it continually kept rolling back into its original shape of a coil.  </li>
            <li>My husband is in a wheelchair and this really worked well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and it came much quicker than it was scheduled to.</li>
            <li>then you would sweeping the floor - very</li>
            <li>I really wished this would have worked.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>It was hard to unroll and keep unrolled, but it was nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Its a great concept, but because it has been rolled up it tends to curl up into itself, making it unable to fulfill its purpose.</li>
            <li>Good concept but poorly executed</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good concept but poorly executed.</li>
            <li>I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here; this is probably the best one of these you are going to find out there, although it is certainly not perfect!  </li>
            <li>The shape does not stay completely round like in the picture, (it forms more of a half moon shape) but overall I think it is really</li>
            <li>It really cut down cleanup time and is great when cutting someone else&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>needs a little bit of time after unraveling to jump into its shape, but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Only four stars because the snap broke off, but I have these small clamps that will hold it just fine.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who gives adult haircuts, I think they have a smaller one for children.</li>
            <li>a home haircut, I can head straight to the shower with no need to vacuum the floor of loose hair.&lt;br /&gt;Quick,on time delivery.</li>
            <li>Other capes I&#x27;ve had are very inferior.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re cutting your own hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, as it would probably tip over if you tried to reach your head, and cause the mess that you were attempting to avoid in the first place.</li>
            <li>Yes, it doesn&#x27;t stay up like the picture shows, it is a little hard to assemble, but it does catch most of the clippings - hence 4 stars.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Other capes I&#x27;ve had are very inferior.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re cutting your own hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, as it would probably tip over if you tried to reach your head, and cause the mess that you were attempting to avoid in the first place.</li>
            <li> Yes, it doesn&#x27;t stay up like the picture shows, it is a little hard to assemble, but it does catch most of the clippings - hence 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the 2 of the 3 buttons on this did not line up properly so I wasn&#x27;t able to properly secure the hair catch as well as unable to keep the circular shape the way its shown on the picture.</li>
            <li> This cape must be unwound and placed on a flat surface before use.</li>
            <li> : Shipment took quite a long time.</li>
            <li> No mess and rolls up into itself, staying neat and taking up very little room.</li>
            <li> The blue ring is so tightly wrapped it can&#x27;t be straightened.</li>
            <li> This is a great item to have if you have someone whose movement to the sink is difficult to dry shave; its not just for cutting hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after a few days the cape finally became pliable, and it does work.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers - this product does NOT hold its shape as depicted in the picture and</li>
            <li> Totally not worth it</li>
            <li> Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> The product is not perfect, but it helps a lot preventing much of the hair to drop on the floor.</li>
            <li> the less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to use in the beginning, method of packaging is a lot to be desired, when I first opened it up, the cape was extremely hard to unroll and fasten.</li>
            <li> It is stores well, using little space.</li>
            <li> At the time of this writing, I would certainly buy it again, and would recommend this to anyone cutting hair indoors.</li>
            <li> The white liner is poor quality, don&#x27;t bother ordering.</li>
            <li> Plus a lot of hair gets trapped in the crease</li>
            <li> I almost bought a different model, from some other manufacter, however, the reviews of the other product were bad.  </li>
            <li> Little hard to put on someone.</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space in my crowded bathroom shelf space because it folds up small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen others in the past</li>
            <li> It is hard to get it to unroll evenly; but even still, it does get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Comes rolled up and the plastic collar is hard to get straighten out.</li>
            <li> Once you unroll this cape, it hardly keeps a shape that prevents hair from falling out.</li>
            <li> and it is difficult to empty it out into the garbage without getting hair everywhere...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this over a week and can still not get it to stay unrolled--very difficult to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I had this for maybe 3 years now and nothing is broken!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone cutting their families hair at home.</li>
            <li> Since the cape that came with my cutting kit cracked, I decided to hunt for a replacement when I stumbled upon this catcher.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s snaps are not aligned and are therefore impossible to snap together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too disappointed because I bought it knowing it was bound to have issues.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Sides do not stay up, so hair falls to ground. Defeated the purpose of buying this item.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here; this is probably the best one of these you are going to find out there, although it is certainly not perfect!  It is hard to get it to unroll evenly; but even still, it does get the job done.  Overall I am pleased with it.  The quality is very good, so it seems it should last a very long time.  Still, in today&#x27;s world; it seems a bit overpriced for what it is.</li>
            <li> Little hard to put on someone.</li>
            <li> inventive, quality was good but not perfect</li>
            <li> My husband is in a wheelchair and this really worked well.  Don&#x27;t plan to put back in box.  LOL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funky to put together and take apart but&lt;br /&gt;Simple at the same time. It is more realistic of the guy having it on, where it is hanging on the shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None the less. Exactley as described definitley a go getter!</li>
            <li> It works. And doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space in my crowded bathroom shelf space because it folds up small.  I store it in a sandwich bag.&lt;br /&gt;After a home haircut, I can head straight to the shower with no need to vacuum the floor of loose hair.&lt;br /&gt;Quick,on time delivery.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be thrown off by the complaints of others.  all you have to do is bend the band wrong-side-out and it works perfectly. easy to put on and remove and easy to discard the cut hair.  you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. quality of the material is good, seems durable&lt;br /&gt;2. caught 90% of the hair&lt;br /&gt;3. can fold into a small roll, good for storage&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Shipment took quite a long time. I ordered it on Nov 14, and received it on Dec 3. But it&#x27;s shipped all the way from Japan, so I have no complain about it.</li>
            <li> Great idea, cape is very good, however, from being wrapped up it is hard to get straightened out.  Takes a bit from Japan, but works better than the cheap ones.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> it is good and nice looking just what I am looking for but not wow me much, like the candy enclosed and the hand writing note.</li>
            <li> This is the hair catch cape to buy. I almost bought a different model, from some other manufacter, however, the reviews of the other product were bad.  Thank you reviewers on Amazon.  This &#x27;Hair catch cape&#x27; was more money than the &#x27;cheap&#x27; model but this model was the real deal.  Good construction, well thought out, easy to use and the manufacter put in details that once I saw them I knew they had actually spent time and brain power in making this &#x27;hair catcher cape&#x27;.  I can see why this cape cost more and it does stand up on it own just like in the picture.  Not so for the cheap brand. I was very pleased with this cape.</li>
            <li> This cape must be unwound and placed on a flat surface before use. It will relax and take the desired shape. It works just as described and has saved my family from hair getting all over and into the laundry. I recommend this product to anyone cutting their families hair at home. My family says it feel just like the salon place when they wear it.</li>
            <li> This cape isn&#x27;t worth buying! The blue ring is so tightly wrapped it can&#x27;t be straightened. It&#x27;s snaps are not aligned and are therefore impossible to snap together. Totally not worth it</li>
            <li> We bought this item to give as a gift. No instructions except on the box and they were in Japanese.</li>
            <li> not too strong on the edge.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my brother in law. He sometimes cuts our cousins hair at home and I figured it would help keep the hair off the floor for easier cleaning. It&#x27;s SO flimsy...don&#x27;t bother wasting your money. The person getting the haircut has to hold it up to try to catch the cut hair...it just ends up falling on the floor anyway. Good for a laugh though!</li>
            <li> The agreement is: wife cuts, I clean. Since the cape that came with my cutting kit cracked, I decided to hunt for a replacement when I stumbled upon this catcher. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t stay up like the picture shows, it is a little hard to assemble, but it does catch most of the clippings - hence 4 stars. However, I believe it is the best on the market right now for CATCHING hair, which means less cleaning for me. At the time of this writing, I would certainly buy it again, and would recommend this to anyone cutting hair indoors.</li>
            <li> The hari catch cape is a good idea however it doesn&#x27;t work.  It never holds the shape (like the picture), and the buttons are not aligned well.  Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> We got this to use as a costume piece. It was hard to unroll and keep unrolled, but it was nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, the quality is much better than what I expected it to be for the money and it came much quicker than it was scheduled to. I would recommend this to anyone who gives adult haircuts, I think they have a smaller one for children.</li>
            <li> The product is not perfect, but it helps a lot preventing much of the hair to drop on the floor.</li>
            <li> No mess and rolls up into itself, staying neat and taking up very little room. It really cut down cleanup time and is great when cutting someone else&#x27;s hair. If you&#x27;re cutting your own hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, as it would probably tip over if you tried to reach your head, and cause the mess that you were attempting to avoid in the first place.</li>
            <li> Good concept but poorly executed, you cannot keep the 3 snaps together. The white liner is poor quality, don&#x27;t bother ordering.</li>
            <li> Comes rolled up and the plastic collar is hard to get straighten out. This is a problem each time you use it. Also, the way it disconnects after use causes hair cuttings to fall on the floor. Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this over a week and can still not get it to stay unrolled--very difficult to maneuver. Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Keeps perfect shape if you uncoil it and leave it out for a little bit.  Works better than the ones I used to use as a kid!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to use in the beginning, method of packaging is a lot to be desired, when I first opened it up, the cape was extremely hard to unroll and fasten. But after a few days the cape finally became pliable, and it does work. makes clean up after a hair cut real easy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fold out like the picture.  May catch most hair, but was cheaply made.  Plus not one English word on the packaging or instructions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact but the sides could be higher and not be so flimsy.</li>
            <li> This is great if you need to trim someone&#x27;s hair on a regular basis.  It&#x27;s a bit clunky, but it saves you from sweeping, I guess.  It&#x27;s great for when you live in an apartment and don&#x27;t want to get hair all over.</li>
            <li> My wife did some research and bought this for me.  We use it every time she cuts my hair.  It is stores well, using little space.</li>
            <li> Once you unroll this cape, it hardly keeps a shape that prevents hair from falling out. My son has to hold it in place as it fights staying snapped shut.</li>
            <li> I was using this to shave my own head.  I&#x27;ve seen others in the past that were much more sturdy, the weight of the ring sort of falls in on its self and the shape never fully restored to a full circle.  Plus a lot of hair gets trapped in the crease and it is difficult to empty it out into the garbage without getting hair everywhere...</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s susupposed to, I use it for my husband and it has made clean up so very easy! Now when I&#x27;m done I just shake it out outside and I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers - this product does NOT hold its shape as depicted in the picture and the button holes do not align.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll spend more time trying to keep it from collapsing then you would sweeping the floor - very frustrating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good concept but poorly executed.</li>
            <li> This caused hysteria at first, as it continually kept rolling back into its original shape of a coil.  now we love it.  I use it on my husband, and the trimmed hair falls into the cape, and not onto the floor.</li>
            <li> We use this regularly to cut my husband&#x27;s hair. Very handy for DIY haircut (short style).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some times, I need to spread it out and lay it on a surface to let it shapes back to the form I like.</li>
            <li> LOOKS LIKE IT WILL WORK GREAT IN THE FUTURE!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I was hoping it would spread out better but it is still perfect for catching hair. Worth buying.</li>
            <li> It was a hit, so I purchased another!. This is a great item to have if you have someone whose movement to the sink is difficult to dry shave; its not just for cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;It needs a little bit of time after unraveling to jump into its shape, but it is worth the money. Its easy to use, easy to clean, without having a fully draped cape on the body.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the 2 of the 3 buttons on this did not line up properly so I wasn&#x27;t able to properly secure the hair catch as well as unable to keep the circular shape the way its shown on the picture. I really wished this would have worked.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to get it to hold shape if you use your brain. Just roll it the opposite way that it comes rolled and hold it for a bit. Collected all of my hair and made clean up faster than ever. Only four stars because the snap broke off, but I have these small clamps that will hold it just fine. In fact, I remember professionals that used similair clamps on traditional hair capes back before we did it at home.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cape for cutting hubby&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> This is a big help in catching most of the hair clippings and saving on cleanup time.</li>
            <li> The cape doesn&#x27;t stay open like it shows in the picture. The way you store it, prevents it from functioning correctly. So you can store it or you can keep it open all the time, you can&#x27;t do both.</li>
            <li> Works good as expected.</li>
            <li> Very well made. Other capes I&#x27;ve had are very inferior. This one should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work. Its a great concept, but because it has been rolled up it tends to curl up into itself, making it unable to fulfill its purpose. I&#x27;m not too disappointed because I bought it knowing it was bound to have issues.</li>
            <li> The shape does not stay completely round like in the picture, (it forms more of a half moon shape) but overall I think it is really and it did catch most of the hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it works really fine! I had this for maybe 3 years now and nothing is broken! It catches the hair great and it&#x27;s mess free.</li>
