            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>Works great for gel polish, but don&#x27;t be fooled by the word &amp;#34;FAN.&amp;#34;  This fan is a cooling fan, not a drying fan.  </li>

            <li>I am super pleased with the performance and being able to do both  hands at once shaved fifteen minutes off my service times.</li>
            <li>But other than that, this dryer is great!</li>

            <li>faster kindly  send your review with thanks.</li>
            <li>the you could fit two hands inside.  </li>
            <li>I am also super excited because the lamp is 42 watts  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it fits both hands under the dryer, it shaves off so much time.</li>
            <li>I am very disppointed that this company didn&#x27;t do more to help.</li>
            <li>and I got a quick \\&quot;no\\</li>
            <li>It works well and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>The fan isn&#x27;t super strong and I think you would be waiting a while to dry nails if you were to use it alone without the lights on, but it is handy anyway.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited &amp; cant wait to use it on my first client.</li>
            <li>I have just opened my own spa business and have had to make several purchases to get it up and running.</li>
            <li>but amazon has wiped that fear right away..</li>
            <li>And, voila, I can change it on a whim because my trusty lamp is right on my desk.  </li>
            <li>It is very convenient to be able to fit both hands in at the same time.</li>
            <li>It seems to me it would be much better to have the controls on the back of the unit</li>
            <li>My polish lasts forever and looks beautiful until I get tired of the color and want to change.  </li>
            <li>it is very spacious.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I really like this lamp.</li>
            <li>Everything worked very well.</li>
            <li>very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have money to throw out the window and really appreaciate customer service do not use SALON SUPPLY STORE for your supplies.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has a fan and is large enough for both hands at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I imagined a little screen with red numbers on it counting down, but it&#x27;s just a button that you can set to \\&quot;2\\&quot;, \\&quot;3,\\&quot; or \\&quot;5\\&quot; minutes which perfectly does the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Salon Edge 42W UV Lamp long enough to say - it&#x27;s all that I wanted and more.</li>
            <li>and I had a new bulb within 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;after</li>
            <li>If this is how they conduct business I will be making sure everyone spends their hard earned dollars elsewhere!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>reading other reviews I decided to spend a few extra dollars and purchase the 45 versus 36 watt light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes me more than 2 minutes for the base coat and 8 minutes for the 2 main coats and 5 minutes after the thick top coat.</li>

            <li> Great lamp! Bought over a year ago and still running strong!</li>
            <li> The price was good.  The lamp works well, and is wide enough to put both feet or hands in at the same time. Shipping was on time.</li>
            <li> I did some researching on which would be the best lamp to get and I cam across this one. I love the fact that it fits both hands under the dryer, it shaves off so much time. Very, very easy to use and I like that it also has a built-in fan. The fan isn&#x27;t super strong and I think you would be waiting a while to dry nails if you were to use it alone without the lights on, but it is handy anyway. If I had any complaints at all, I would say that it would be the digital timer. I had something different in mind. I imagined a little screen with red numbers on it counting down, but it&#x27;s just a button that you can set to \\&quot;2\\&quot;, \\&quot;3,\\&quot; or \\&quot;5\\&quot; minutes which perfectly does the job. No big deal to me at all. But other than that, this dryer is great!</li>
            <li> great light. easy to use with lots of room inside so I don&#x27;t smudge my nails. customer service excellent. I e-mailed that one of the 6 bulbs arrived burned out and I had a new bulb within 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;after reading other reviews I decided to spend a few extra dollars and purchase the 45 versus 36 watt light.</li>
            <li> This product works well for the price. No, it is not as wonderful as the $250.00 UV lamps that the salons use. But for the price, it pays for itself. Definitely would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it is very spacious. It is very convenient to be able to fit both hands in at the same time. Reduces the amount of time it takes to do nails by a lot!</li>
            <li> The only thing I cannot understand with these lamps is why the controls always face the client.  It seems to me it would be much better to have the controls on the back of the unit so I can see  them. Then I can sit across from my client, place their hands in the unit and turn it on from  MY SIDE of the unit. Go figure.  Anyway, I really like this lamp. I am super pleased with the performance and being able to do both  hands at once shaved fifteen minutes off my service times. I am also super excited because the lamp is 42 watts  and I can use it with the OPI gel-color without having to buy their $400.00 lamp! YAY!</li>
            <li> My Lamp was delivered very fast which I loved. It had some minor damage but nothing big at all. Everything worked very well. I love my lamp and I&#x27;m excited &amp; cant wait to use it on my first client.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Salon Edge 42W UV Lamp long enough to say - it&#x27;s all that I wanted and more.</li>
            <li> I bought this 14 months ago from Salon Supplies on EBay.&lt;br /&gt;Actually I like the store and they seem trying to answer your questions this year very fast.&lt;br /&gt;It takes me more than 2 minutes for the base coat and 8 minutes for the 2 main coats and 5 minutes after the thick top coat. Since I wait to do both hands at once. My time spent can be 15 minutes for both hands...I would think it is longer than if I would have used  the Led Lamp with the max watts . Since I never have had the led lamp to compare I like to hear from you.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion to my thought that for the money I paid BUT for such time length plus I hope  the lamp will last maybe longer than a few years,  I would think I have been treated by this company fairly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I decided to do my nails myself and save lots of money if I choose the good Harmony Gelish Products  with all 5 Stars rating so I will save time wonder whether the gel will be thick enough to just use less coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way I do not like to sit too long at the nail salons in my neighbourhood. I do think my nail gals are not the most polite service women I have known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If some one know the difference between this 42 w lamps and a big Led Lamp which  do the same but lots faster kindly  send your review with thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought this UV lamp for my mother and she loves it.  She asked me to purchase one for her and I had no idea what to look for.  I ended up doing a little research and decided to get this one.  It has more bulbs and I liked the idea the you could fit two hands inside.  My sister does nails and she asked me to get her one also.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy! I only wish I had done it sooner.  Last fall I purchased a small (4 finger) dryer at a local retailer for nearly the same cost. Now, we can dry both hands, instead of 4 fingers, 2 thumbs, 4 fingers. Saves 2/3 of the drying time!!!&lt;br /&gt;Product was as advertised, and arrived in perfect shape. Have had no problems in the month we have had it.</li>
            <li> I have just opened my own spa business and have had to make several purchases to get it up and running. One purchase I made was a UV lamp. Unfortunately this was not a good decision to do business with SALON SUPPLY STORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a piece of equipment I use regulary so it took me a few months to see how the unit worked. But the unit is extremely temperamental to turn on. It is hit or miss if it will work that day. The power button in the front of the unit must have bad wiring and in this case I have now lost business because of it. During my last appointment we tried for over 15 minutes to turn it on and finally gave up and had to use regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote an email to the company simply asking for an exchange, not a refund and I got a quick \\&quot;no\\&quot; it has pasted it&#x27;s warranty. It has only been just over 4 months, and the unit has been used less than 10 times! I am disgusted at the lack of help as a struggling business owner. If this is how they conduct business I will be making sure everyone spends their hard earned dollars elsewhere!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have money to throw out the window and really appreaciate customer service do not use SALON SUPPLY STORE for your supplies. I am very disppointed that this company didn&#x27;t do more to help.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped nicely though the interior of product appeared to have some flaws though it  will supposedly not affect the product purpose  vendor was quick to respond to issues</li>
            <li> Works great for gel polish, but don&#x27;t be fooled by the word &amp;#34;FAN.&amp;#34;  This fan is a cooling fan, not a drying fan.  It won&#x27;t help you for regular polish.</li>
            <li> I bought this from my granddaughter and she said it doesn&#x27;t speed the drying time for her toenails or fingernails.  A big waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Received promptly and am really pleased with the unit.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.... Fan works great and hands fit nicely.. It was everything I expected. I used to get nervous ordering things online but amazon has wiped that fear right away.. (my poor husband and our bank account).... There is nothing better than shopping from the comfort of your home especially during cold and flu season &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It works well and arrived quickly.  I didn&#x27;t read the measurements or even remember seeing them on the ad.  I contacted the seller to return it and found out it would be my financial responsibility to return it as it was due to size that I wanted to return it.  The return postage would have been $16.50.</li>
            <li> Gift for Wife, she loves it!</li>
            <li> You may have  read my ranting review on the Thermal Spa lamp I ordered.  It was a disaster -- I returned it and ordered the Salon Edge as a replacement.  Now I&#x27;m a happy camper.  This lamp really works, is always reliable, and cures my nails perfectly.  My polish lasts forever and looks beautiful until I get tired of the color and want to change.  And, voila, I can change it on a whim because my trusty lamp is right on my desk.  I love the fact that it has a fan and is large enough for both hands at the same time.  It has 6 lights, with great coverage.  I&#x27;m really happy with this lamp and highly recommend it.</li>
