            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry bout oiling myself through out the day, we&#x27;ve wasted so much money on store brought lotions for dry skin that doesn&#x27;t do any justice, my husband isn&#x27;t ashamed of wearing short sleeves any more, his skin looks so much better thanks to the almond oil, you want be disappointed and your skin will thank you!</li>
            <li>I will also warn that my girlfriend complained of mild irritation after accidentally getting some in her lady bits.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product due to the clarity, low scent, and overall quality of the product.</li>

            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry bout oiling myself through out the day, we&#x27;ve wasted so much money on store brought lotions for dry skin that doesn&#x27;t do any justice, my husband isn&#x27;t ashamed of wearing short sleeves any more, his skin looks so much better thanks to the almond oil, you want be disappointed and your skin will thank you!</li>
            <li> I will also warn that my girlfriend complained of mild irritation after accidentally getting some in her lady bits.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product due to the clarity, low scent, and overall quality of the product.</li>
            <li> - Cold Pressed &amp; Hexane Free - No Synthetic Preservatives, Colors or Fragnances]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this item in a quickly and timely manner, it was also packaged safe and secured, which means a lot to me - I hate damaged products and items - this is going to be for my new diet</li>
            <li> So if you feel like trying something different for your dry skin try Almond Oil and see how you like it.</li>
            <li> I use it to moisturize my earlobes (stretched ears here) and it does the job</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller several days ago and still no reply other</li>
            <li> I actually mix this with other oils to seal in the moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li> It mixed in with my recipes for face cream, lotions, and other beauty items as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can also be used alone or mixed with other oils and butters.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to sooth dry skin and irritated areas.</li>
            <li> I have added this oil to my regimen for my very dry skin and scalp</li>
            <li> I use those few drops on my face several times a day--when I wake up, after my shower and any other time I think of it, or my face feels dry.  </li>
            <li> Have to be really careful what I use on it.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Interestingly enough it smells like raw almonds.  </li>
            <li> Then I towel off, and my skin is so soft it&#x27;s almost ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can spoil myself without feeling guilty haha!</li>
            <li> it got all over my other items</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and I have to say that this one is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> so be very careful with this oil.  </li>
            <li> It has very little scent residue and makes the mango butter extra fluffy and creamy in the mixing process.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it arrived with the cap not screwed on all the way...</li>
            <li> The uses are endless for this oil!</li>
            <li> This oil has a slight smell</li>
            <li> In the winter I also apply moisturizer to fight the extra dry skin that comes from the bitter cold.  </li>
            <li> like the fact that it&#x27;s pure &amp; cold pressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be using it in my battle to combat the Carpenter bees that are destroying my wood projects in my backyard.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a con for me, because I needed something that didn&#x27;t have a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting rashes on my arms for a few weeks now that have been bothering me.</li>
            <li> I add it to my everyday body lotion.  </li>
            <li> Before I go out in the elements, I always put a few drops of oil on my face.</li>
            <li> my usual soaking them down with reg lotion.  </li>
            <li> Since it is all natural, it did not make my allergies go completely crazy like other moisturizers that have perfumes</li>
            <li> Less mess!!</li>
            <li> There is hardly any smell</li>
            <li> Just a faint smell of crushed almonds.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found some that are too thick</li>
            <li> Cold pressed like this is what you want!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was asked to review this Beauty Aura 100% Pure Sweet Almond Oil. It is very light and has a light smell. I used it on my face, upper arms and thighs. I am very pleased with the way it feels and smells. It helps to keep my skin very soft. No oily feel. I will be using it in my battle to combat the Carpenter bees that are destroying my wood projects in my backyard. I&#x27;ve heard that the bees do not care for the smell of almond oil. I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. I use it on my skin and my hair.</li>
            <li> This almond oil comes in a foil cap sealed bottle which is nice because I have had liquids come out of their containers in the mail a lot. It&#x27;s exactly what it says it is, 100% pure almond oil. I like to use a teaspoon or so with a bit of sugar for a hand and foot scrub. I will be buying another bottle once I use this one up!</li>
            <li> Nice lightweight carrier oil for essential oils.Came with instructions on different uses.Excited to try them all. Absorbs easily. Received at discount for review.</li>
            <li> This almond oil is great. It is 100% pure almond oil. There is no fragrance or smell. It absorbs into your skin easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling all greasy and slimy. I love the cap on it also. The oil doesn&#x27;t just pour out uncontrollably. You actually have to squeeze a bit on the container to get it to come out. Less mess!! I had no issues with spillage during shipping either. I use this oil mainly for removing make up and during massages. It works well to remove makeup without a lot of scrubbing necessary. I would highly recommend this oil.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite the &amp;#34;nut&amp;#34; when buying oils, essential oils, etc. I use these in my soapmaking business. I was very pleased to find this sweet almond oil. It is very well priced and I don&#x27;t have to buy it in bulk. It can be used directly on the skin, as a carrier oil for essential oils, and in cold-process soap, lotions, etc. Sweet almond oil is also great for massage oil! (Hint hint) This came packaged very well and has the traditional slightly &amp;#34;Nutty&amp;#34; aroma that good quality sweet almond oil always possesses. I am very happy to have found this company so I can buy in smaller quantities as the need arises. The quality is great and I find it is better in smaller bottles as you don&#x27;t have to worry about the shelf life because you can use it in a relatively short amount of time!</li>
            <li> This product has so many uses!! It&#x27;s great for itchy or dry skin.  I have super dry hands and this helps every time.  Also Almond Oil is good for your hair.  It helps control frizz and adds shine.  This is a great product for any beauty product enthusiast to have!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it all the time for massage</li>
            <li> My hair has always been so dry and dull, and it wasn&#x27;t until I used Beauty Aura Pure Sweet Almond oil that I began to notice a difference in my hair. It is full of the most nourishing vitamins such as vitamin A, E, and B along with Omega 3. My hair is so shiny and soft. I have never experienced such healthy hair before. Because of it&#x27;s nourishing properties, it helps promote hair growth. It is also great for a skin moisturizer! My skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. My skin is softer while using it. Ireceived this tto review.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this because I have heard it works miracles for nails! Just apply some to your nails and they grow and do not break!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I use this as a facial moisturizer, hair oil, and cuticle oil, and there are so many other uses I have yet to try!  I love this oil!!</li>
            <li> 100% almond pure sweet almond moisturizing oil is awesome. I used it for the first time today and can feel the difference.  It has my body feeling smooth and glowing. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic oil.  I love sweet almond oil in my homemade hand creams and moisturizers for my babies.  This oil has the wonderfully light scent of sweet almonds and is a lightweight oil that is fluid at room temperature.  Excellent as a carrier oil in the treatment of dry skin, eczema, and psoraisis.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil that works well, feels great, and doesn&#x27;t absorb too quickly. I received this product at a discount for an honest review and the only thing that I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about was that it was delivered in a plastic bag that was filled with the oil as about an 1/8th of the bottle has slipped out sometime during shipping. I will also warn that my girlfriend complained of mild irritation after accidentally getting some in her lady bits.</li>
            <li> I love the benefits of the the sweet almond oil have.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I mixed it with a couple of other oils and made my own moisturizer and it turn out wonderfully. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> THIS ALMOND OIL SMELLS SO GOOD AND WORKS GREAT ON ANYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE. I JUST USED IT ON MY HAIR LAST NIGHT TO HELP WITH THE DRYNESS ALSO USED IT ON MY LEGS AND BODY AFTER SHOWER TO HELP WITH MOISTURE. I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNTED RATE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Product was great but came to me damaged I contacted the seller several days ago and still no reply other then that good product</li>
            <li> This is a decent sized bottle and I like that the top makes for easy dispense of the oil since oil can get messy. I use this on my hair and it adds shine and locks in moisture. It has a light thin consistency; it&#x27;s not the lightest, but it&#x27;s not thick at all. I actually mix this with other oils to seal in the moisture in my hair. It mixes well and the oils seal perfectly.  I&#x27;ve read that it can help prevent hair shedding and reduces split ends, and I cant wait to see those results in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is great quality oil. This is a great brand and I&#x27;ve been pretty impressed with their oils.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of oils! I&#x27;ve been using sweet almond oil for months now and it&#x27;s so versatile. Can be used as a carrier oil for essential oils, a moisturizer, a makeup remover(especially eye makeup), and a hair treatment. Will always use it! Love it! Recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product is everything that I was expecting! It has left my skin feeling baby soft! Since it is all natural, it did not make my allergies go completely crazy like other moisturizers that have perfumes tend to. This will be a great to add to homemade soaps, lotions, and scrubs. This worked really well on my dry feet. I just rubbed some on and put a pair of socks on and when I took my socks off tonight they were so much softer!</li>
            <li> Love this oil, super moisturizing with next to no smell or fragrance at all. I use this to shave my legs for extra soft and smooth skin and also as an after shower moisturizer. Turn the water off, rub it all over before gently towel drying and I have soft glowy skin. In the winter I also apply moisturizer to fight the extra dry skin that comes from the bitter cold.  I am very happy with this purchase and I will definitely re-order when I run out!</li>
            <li> I make my own lotions, face care products, and related items. I use sweet almond oil in a vast majority of those recipes. I had never tried Beauty Aura before so I really wasn&#x27;t sure to expect. I was not disappointed. The oil arrived quickly and came in a much larger bottle than I expected. Before using it in a recipe, I tested it as a straight oil and carrier oil. Here are the pros and cons that I found with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil had a very light scent which was a nice change from some of the more popular brands out there. It was not overly greasy and absorbed quickly. I did try it as a hair treatment as well and was very satisfied with the results. It worked as good, if not better, than traditional hot oil treatments. My hair is very damaged from a recent coloring endeavor and this oil made it look beautiful after just one use.  It mixed in with my recipes for face cream, lotions, and other beauty items as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell like the almond oil you may find in stores or sold by essential oil resellers. This isn&#x27;t a con for me, because I needed something that didn&#x27;t have a heavy scent. I only list it as a con because some people may want that traditional overpowering almond scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is an excellent brand and oil to use as a carrier oil, part of DIY recipes for skin care, and as a hair hot oil treatment. I would recommend them to anyone having problems finding a reliable oil as well. If scent is a problem for you, don&#x27;t worry, this has a very light scent which is perfect for face care, hair care, and perfume making if you are concerned with your scents clashing.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of oils and the ones I need to dilute I use different carrier oils and this is a great carrier oil. It smells great, goes on easily, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t overpower the oil I&#x27;m diluting. I also use this oil in lieu of a lotion as a moisturizer and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. For the price this is a great deal for almond oil.</li>
            <li> After using this for a couple of days, I can tell a huge difference in my dry skin. It has worked wonders</li>
            <li> I have added this oil to my regimen for my very dry skin and scalp and i have noticed a major difference good stuff. This oil is good for hair, scalp and skin has worked wonders!!</li>
            <li> Love the product, but it took FOREVER to get to me</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer! I like the 4 oz size because it is convenient for travel. I love that this product doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals and that it is made in the USA! I can spoil myself without feeling guilty haha! My only complaint is that it arrived with the cap not screwed on all the way...it got all over my other items and I lost about 1/4 of this product.</li>
            <li> i really like the pure  sweet  almond oil i really like what it does it makes my face feel soft and smooth not oily like others.  it soaks in so quick which is really nice.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is a great moisturizer and it does not feel greasy. I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Really lovely quality Almond Oil -- perfect for moisturizing or massage use.  Very light aroma and seems to be of high quality.  I especially appreciate that it is cold-pressed. Would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER dry skin from having hypothyroidism and my husband having psoriasis so we were looking for something that can take the ease off the dryness....I combined the almond oil with some shea butter and boy oh boy there&#x27;s a big difference in our skin, I sometime use it right out the shower and I don&#x27;t have to worry bout oiling myself through out the day, we&#x27;ve wasted so much money on store brought lotions for dry skin that doesn&#x27;t do any justice, my husband isn&#x27;t ashamed of wearing short sleeves any more, his skin looks so much better thanks to the almond oil, you want be disappointed and your skin will thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting rashes on my arms for a few weeks now that have been bothering me. Applying this oil over my arms has REALLY helped stop the itching and allowed them to begin healing. I enjoy having this.</li>
            <li> Smells magnificent. Great for my hair</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the feel of this oil. I mix body butters and this is an wonderful addition. It has very little scent residue and makes the mango butter extra fluffy and creamy in the mixing process. I highly recommend this product due to the clarity, low scent, and overall quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Love my smooth and nourished skin. Also using it as a detangler for my daughter&#x27;s frizzy hair, works great. 100 % pure is all we need.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I highly recommend this product. Silky feel and light sent. Cold pressed like this is what you want!</li>
            <li> I use sweet almond oil to even my skin tone and as a humectant after I cleanse and tone my face. It&#x27;s also serves the dual purpose as a carrier oil for essential oil blends that I make in lieu of perfumes, and I&#x27;m happy with both. With its antioxidants and A, B, and E vitamins, it&#x27;s one of the best things I can put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;(Received this item at a discount for an honest review.)</li>
            <li> As a lover of essential oil I desire an amazing pure carrier oil. I have found it in this wonderful Sweet Almond Oil.&lt;br /&gt;I added lavender, orange and a drop of peppermint to the bottle and we use it as a massage oil.&lt;br /&gt;Another wonderful way I use this oil is I add peppermint oil to it and use it on my four legged babies as a flea deterrent. Plus this oil smells wonderful all on it&#x27;s own and doesn&#x27;t need anything added to still be an amazing oil. It is a perfect sized bottle and I am inlove!&lt;br /&gt;I was given this at a reduced rate to help facilitate this review.</li>
            <li> I got this product on a very good discounted price. I use this oil as a moisturizer for my face and body as a night time routine, and it has kept me moisturized and hydrated. My skin has improved alot and also it looks more brighter and soft nowadays. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve always wanted to try it and finally I did and I&#x27;m impressed!! It&#x27;s well worth the money. It leaves no order and leaves my skin super smooth and acne free! I would recommend this product to any one of my friends!</li>
            <li> Very good oil.  Can be used as a skin and hair hydrator. I add it to my everyday body lotion.  It is kind of thick so be very careful with this oil.  It has a wonderful smell as well. Almond oil is rich in vitamin A, B and E, which are great for skin health. Sweet almond oil improves the complexion and retaining glow of skin. It also moisturizes better and deeper, soothes skin irritation and skin inflammation, relieves dry and irritated skin, nourishes skin making it softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I actually use essential oil as basically a rinse in the shower, post washing and shaving.  Then I towel off, and my skin is so soft it&#x27;s almost ridiculous.  Not to mention the light, earthy smell of almond oil.  It&#x27;s also a great hair rinse, with the same softness results.  Love this oil, and the easy pour cap.</li>
            <li> A great product for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Smells very good and does as it says.&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful product to own and for a very appropriate cost for the size.&lt;br /&gt;Try it and you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> Sweet Almond Oil is a great oil. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and literally has no scent. It&#x27;s supposed to sooth dry skin and irritated areas. I have sensitive, allergic, reactive, rosacea skin. Have to be really careful what I use on it. Only use carrier oils to moisturize. The last week, or so, I&#x27;ve been having a lot of bumpy, rashy skin--especially on my cheeks. I thought I might be having an allergic reaction to some serums I&#x27;d made.  (One drop of an essential oil blend in a teaspoon of carrier oil--a 1% dilution, which is appropriate for face.) I actually figured out that it&#x27;s not the essential oil blends, it&#x27;s another allergy season starting (I get this way with tree and grass pollen in the spring and ragweed in the fall.) I&#x27;ve used the Beauty Aura Sweet Almond Oil and so far, no problem. My skin stayed smooth and pink (good for me.)  Another way that I use carrier oils is to protect my skin in the winter. Before I go out in the elements, I always put a few drops of oil on my face. It also helps protect your skin from the dryness in the house when the heat is on. I use those few drops on my face several times a day--when I wake up, after my shower and any other time I think of it, or my face feels dry.  Another thing that I want to do is make a herb oil infusion and make my own lip balm. For a lot of people, Sweet Almond Oil is the oil of choice for lip balm. I&#x27;ve just started to make herb infused oils (which are easy.) I&#x27;ve made salves for first aid and pain, so far. Next attempt will be lip balm. It&#x27;s just some infused oil, beeswax and essential oils to flavor (which is optional.) If it&#x27;s of interest, you can do a web search and come up with a lot of easy recipes.  I received this product at a discounted price for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I like the way it works, with no side effects! Fantastic</li>
            <li> This oil is in my top 5 oils! The uses are endless for this oil! Let me tell you my favorites, it is gentle enough to use one children &amp; babies. It is my LIFE saver after shaving. I get terrible razor burn and I use this oil and don&#x27;t get it anymore! I use this like lotion all over my body.  I put a pea size amount in my hands rub them together and then coat my hair shafts with my hands, to add shine to my hair. I use a drop to mix with my foundation in my make up routine, to get that dewy glow to my face. I could go on and on.... :) This is an essential and holy grail product for me! I have to have it on hand constantly! The shipping was fast on this product (and who doesn&#x27;t appreciate that?) and it was packaged well so there were no leaks like oils shipped in the hot summer can sometimes have. I am very impressed all around with product, and company purchased from!</li>
            <li> I used this product with a couple of other oils Combined as a hot oil treatment I loved the result.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00NF2PJ7E Beauty Aura 100 % Pure Sweet Almond Oil. Cold Pressed From Best Quality Almond Kernels. - Cold Pressed &amp; Hexane Free - No Synthetic Preservatives, Colors or Fragnances]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this item in a quickly and timely manner, it was also packaged safe and secured, which means a lot to me - I hate damaged products and items - this is going to be for my new diet and I am looking forward to using it!  I recommend this seller because they care about their products.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very good quality. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product too.</li>
            <li> nice size on this bottle of sweet almond oil..love to use it with my essential oils great carrier oil..nice product..</li>
            <li> Great product. Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil.  The company did a great job in packaging it, they wrapped the bottle with a baggie.  However, 1/3 of the product was spilled while shipping.  The oil itself goes on smooth and does what it is supposed to, which is fantastic! There is hardly any smell and you can even use it on your hair!  My hands are super dry from working with paper all the time, and this has been a wonderful solution for me.  The company contacted me and will fix the order which was spilled.  I am very satisfied with both the service and the product itself.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to smell like it&#x27;s name, &amp;#34;Sweet Almond.&amp;#34;  Interestingly enough it smells like raw almonds.  No sweetness or wafty aroma around it.  Just a faint smell of crushed almonds.  I was hoping it would smell more sugary but the rawness makes it seem more wholesome, organic almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is very fluid, not at all viscous like olive or emu oil, nor solid like coconut oil (at room temperature).  It&#x27;s easy to pour out and has an almost velvety texture.  I use it to moisturize my earlobes (stretched ears here) and it does the job well.  My skin becomes soft and pliable with just one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great as a makeup remover too!  I used it to moisturize the dark circles under my eyes and it helped clean up some extra eyeliner.  I will continue to use this in my daily routine.  So far, there have been no ill effects.  Will update in a couple months! Stand by!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Beauty Aura 100% pure Sweet Almond Oil for a while now, I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my skin being dry especially in the summer times wearing flip flops and forever every summer my heals oh my heals need I say more get so cracked, so I thought I would try something different instead of my usual soaking them down with reg lotion.  I thought I would give the Sweet Almond Oil a chance, first I&#x27;ve been using the oil on my skin after my shower, after drying off I rub the oil all over &amp; it soaks in really nice and is not really greasy.  I&#x27;ve applied the Sweet Almond Oil onto my cracked feet posting special attention to my left foot which has had a big crack, and now using it for a while about 8 or 9 days it looks amazing not nearly as deep or rough from the start.&lt;br /&gt;I have been really happy with my choice to try the Sweet Almond Oil, the very first reason I chose this product was for it being 100% pure.  So if you feel like trying something different for your dry skin try Almond Oil and see how you like it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It&#x27;s light weight has hardly any fragrance. I used it in 3 of my natural products that I make. I made shower gel, Shea Butter cream, and a face oil. All 3 turned out great. This is a perfect carrier oil. It can also be used alone or mixed with other oils and butters. I would highly recommend this Sweet Almound Oil.</li>
            <li> I really like the moisturizing properties of this oil for my hair. It&#x27;s light weight and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I love almond oil. It has so many benefits to your skin and hair. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and I have to say that this one is one of my favorites. I&#x27;ve found some that are too thick and I personally don&#x27;t like that. This one has the perfect amount of thickness that allows you to spread it easily. Fun tip: you can also use it as make up remover ^_^</li>
            <li> I like to apply oil fresh out of the shower on damp skin for optimal moisturizing. Beauty Aura&#x27;s bottle makes it easy to squeeze out the right amount. The oil soaked into my skin and left it smooth and radiant. I like that there is no smell so that it won&#x27;t compete with my perfume. It&#x27;s very important to me to treat my skin well and natural oils high in Omega 3 fatty acids, like this cold pressed Sweet Almond oil, are a great way to naturally moisturize while improving skin health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Discount given for review. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful carrier oil for my essential oils. It absorbs into the skin like magic. Sweet almond oil also benefits people with a variety of hair problems, because it heals split ends, nourishes the scalp, helps to improve circulation, enhances hair growth and reduces “hair fall”, while increasing the luster and shine of the hair. This is a must have around the house.</li>
            <li> I use this for massage - nice oil in a nice little bottle. Very low amount of fragrance - kinda nutty and natural smelling.</li>
            <li> We ordered the almond oil for a massage oil carrier. It has great texture. My wife loved it! We will buy it again!</li>
            <li> This has to be my fav carrier oil so far! I love trying out new oils bc I use them for  my skin and usually have a problem with breaking out but not with this amazing oil!! LOVE it&lt;br /&gt;This item was discounted in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li> Good product, nice quality. Works really well as a moisturizer for body and face. This oil has a slight smell but it&#x27;s not over whelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this hydrating Pure Sweet Almond Oil.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this oil, it&#x27;s very hydrating and little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it&#x27;s pure &amp; cold pressed.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels plumped and hydrated after the oil has soaked in.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to have it as part of my regular beauty regime.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product as a promotional sample in return for a genuine, objective opinion.</li>
            <li> I love Beauty Aura oils. I use them in making soap and other beauty products and they have never failed me.  They are pure and top quality.  Sweet Almond is an excellent oil for dry skin and it works well in my products.</li>
            <li> I had never used almond oil before, but was pleasantly surprised. THe aroma is awesome! Have been using it as a moisturizer for my hands and face and it work great!</li>
