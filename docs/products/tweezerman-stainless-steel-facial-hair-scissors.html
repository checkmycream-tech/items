            <li>Can&#x27;t seemto get the really good angles in my nose.</li>
            <li>Particularly good for inside the nose.</li>
            <li>Would be a good value at twice the price.</li>

            <li>They feel good in your hand and do the job.</li>
            <li>had a good set of nasal hair scissors that vanished.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a good quality pair of scissors.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Thank you for your service and for good products.</li>
            <li>For the price, these didn&#x27;t stand out as being exceptional based on their price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fit between the two arms of the scissors is very good</li>
            <li>very safe for a man.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>For the amount of money this item costs, this should be a much more smooth and impressive tool.</li>
            <li>These have worked amazingly well.</li>
            <li>but it is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>Despite that, I&#x27;d liked how they cut</li>
            <li>My beard looks nice and clean-cut after a trimming with these scissors.</li>
            <li>These did the job nicely.</li>
            <li>Nothing impressive really.</li>
            <li>Nice scissors, they work well for their purpose and price.</li>
            <li>Honestly I kind of regret it though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish is nice and won&#x27;t show fingerprints like chrome/plated versions.</li>
            <li>Use your own judgement.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, nice quality, just what I needed.</li>
            <li>Here we&#x27;re very pleased with the replacement for the scissors she lost :)</li>
            <li>Good quality, and fit a man&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li>Attractive as well as useful.</li>
            <li>good quality and nicely styled, priced about like Revlon, but far superior.</li>
            <li>Might as well just get fine tip ones and make sure you don&#x27;t stab yourself!</li>
            <li>But, they&#x27;re trimming my ear hairs just fine!</li>
            <li>This is very comfortable scissors.</li>
            <li>A better solution is to use the tweezerman.</li>
            <li>Although they cut OK, I have owned more quality blunt tip scissors.</li>
            <li>I now plan to order two more pair to keep at home (one for me and another for the wife).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they have become more than that.  </li>
            <li>Since I am a veterinary surgeon, I have to admit that they are better quality than most of my surgical instruments.  </li>
            <li>Very well made and service was great.</li>
            <li>Best personal care scissors money can buy!</li>
            <li>Ever seen those brightly-colored plastic play scissors they give pre-schoolers, the ones that don&#x27;t actually cut anything but look impressive?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better safety scissors out there...</li>
            <li>I really like it for trimming hairs (the size and blunt nose if great) and the finish is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have a matte finish that looks stain resistant, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect to get many stains out of my nose...  </li>
            <li>love these.</li>
            <li>sturdy, work well, love the safety feature of the tips.</li>
            <li>These are okay.</li>
            <li>I love Tweezerman products-</li>
            <li>Able to trim my beard with ease using these.</li>
            <li>Love the rounded tips.</li>
            <li>Like others said, you will not be able to trim your nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Love the rounded tip, always use it</li>
            <li>(I feel I have more control than special-purpose nail</li>
            <li>The rounded tip is OK</li>
            <li>A child&#x27;s school scissors are better quality.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Better than the cheap junk in many store scissor displays.</li>
            <li>Good quality scissors but their large size makes them inaccurate.</li>
            <li>Now, as I am sure you can imagine, this lack of precision is a huge downside</li>
            <li>These scissors are safe and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Great scissors that cut well and the rounded outside edges and tip make it very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I used these scissors for nose hair and felt no painful pulling and tugging!  </li>
            <li>No painfully plucking with tweezers anymore!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Simple &amp; easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are really nice - solid metal and good quality manufacture.</li>
            <li>I am able to fit my fingers in there and maneuver just fine, but not as comfortable as I</li>
            <li>These are very sharp and excellent quality.</li>
            <li>Works fine and is correct product, picture used by Amazon is a bit misleading when you get it though.  </li>
            <li>so I need to be quick and safe.</li>
            <li>These scissors felt light weight and cheap in my hand.</li>
            <li>but these scissors felt quite comfortable on my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought i would upgrade from a cheap pair i bought at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>Happy with purchase tho its been only a day!</li>
            <li>Cuts precisely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;man-sized,&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s important to me.</li>
            <li>These are the best small scissors I have found.  </li>
            <li>Use them, as all sharp devices, with respectful caution and you should be more than pleased with their outstanding results at doing things they are designed to do.</li>
            <li>These scissors were originally for my nose</li>
            <li>They work perfectly for a thick beard and fit comfortably in hands.</li>
            <li>These are everything that was said about them-quality, sharp and they just feel good in your hand!  </li>
            <li>These are excellent small scissors.  </li>
            <li>These scissors cut cleanly leaving no \\&quot;fuzzies\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>After you use them, spray them with Lysol and they are clean.  </li>
            <li>Works well as it cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li>Useful tool, good for mustaches and a bit of beard maintenance, but go for actual hair-trimming scissors if you want to do your whole beard, much more efficient and a much more even result.</li>
            <li>These seem well made, have nice action to them, and deliver precise cuts.</li>
            <li>So get these, trim your nose hair without pain and be a good social citizen.</li>
            <li>They are well made, sharp, light and cut great.  </li>
            <li>I needed a good pair of scissors to trim my facial and nose hairs.  </li>
            <li>I guess these are good for larger hands</li>
            <li>true.</li>
            <li>As a result, you can&#x27;t really cut much hair at once, so these scissors are only best for mustaches, eyebrows, nose, and ears.</li>
            <li>the cutting edges of the blades line up perfect right out of the box and 4 months later they still line up perfect.  </li>
            <li>--he&#x27;s very squiggly) and safe because of the rounded tips i&#x27;m not afraid of poking his eye out.</li>
            <li>These are some really nice scissors; much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp, very precise, quality built.</li>
            <li>However, their strong points all add together to make their weakest point: they&#x27;re just too large to be accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe it needs more use but out of the box the scissors are not that easy to open or close.</li>
            <li>Thanks, enjoy shopping here.</li>
            <li>But considering that I don&#x27;t try to shave the insides of my nostrils, I find the cut delivered to be far more than satisfying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think they are useful because of their size and shape.</li>
            <li>but this one is a flop, good for other things though.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and good quality</li>
            <li>They are reasonably sharp and do a good job of trimming nose hairs...when you can coax them into the position where they need to be.  </li>
            <li>Much simpler than the battery powered units and 100 times easier to clean and store.</li>
            <li>have very large hands</li>
            <li>I have big hands, but my fingers can still fit in the handles and easily operate the scissors.  </li>
            <li>The rounded tips are a nice touch, and the metal is a very  \\&quot;lackluster\\&quot; non glossy shade which I personally like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>The ends are too big can&#x27;t cut your nose hair love the company</li>
            <li>son swiped the first (fits his hands well and is pretty safe), so I had to buy a second one.</li>
            <li>i first look at country item was made from before considering to buy, i try to avoid made in china.</li>
            <li>I made the decision to stop using my electric beard trimmer and use something more traditional.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>For beards, I suggest you use an electric, $20 razor kit with changing heads that lets you groom much more evenly across your facial hair.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>As a result, I seldom actually use these -- most of the time I select another pair from my cabinet.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, very safe.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>A nice sharp, smooth cut and great size for big or small hands.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality trimmer, great for nose and other soft spots where you can&#x27;t afford to get cut.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other brands were slightly more expensive, and these both got reasonably good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are great for eye brows, or any other facial grooming.  </li>
            <li>My fault; liked the idea of durable, sharp non rusting stainless steel</li>
            <li>Would not recommend - a dollar store purchase would be more advantageous in the long run.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nonetheless a great buy for convenience if you like to groom very carefully and personally, and the rounded tips ensure no nicks!</li>
            <li>One of the reasons was that they are compact and easy to keep with my electric shaver when grooming to help even out the facial hair.</li>
            <li>and now I am more careful to make sure my scissors are dry before I put them</li>
            <li>Very high quality</li>
            <li>I purchased the stainless steel version that looks to have a gray matte</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>These are good-quality scissors for facial hair (nose hair and goatee, in my case), with all the important features:</li>
            <li>Looking for a reasonable priced nose scissor and chose this one.</li>
            <li>My pair readily adhered to a magnet meaning they contain ferrous metal.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I bought the Rubis Stainless and the Tweezerman Stainless, based on price, thinking I&#x27;d return one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The Rubis is shorter and thicker, but cuts well and seems very well made.  </li>
            <li>I really wish my boyfriend wouldn&#x27;t have opened the package like a maniac</li>
            <li>Thanks for your concern.  </li>
            <li>Well made pair of stainless steel scissors.</li>
            <li>I plan to order the Princess Care ® Solo SS Moustache Beard Scissors which can be ordered either curved or straight.</li>
            <li>The scissors I received are actually eyebrow trimmers, probably designed for women, since I can barely fit my fingers into them.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit too much pressure to get them to close, if they start closing on your skin that pressure is no bueno.</li>
            <li>These scissors would work well for a straight Hitler style mustache.</li>
            <li>Everything in this listing indicates that they are selling the stainless steel version of the scissors.</li>
            <li>the UPC # and Model # match that of the stainless steel version.</li>
            <li>* Very small&lt;br /</li>
            <li>These are fantastic scissors for facial hairs.  </li>
            <li>I spent much more for these than the drugstore scissors that I prefer.</li>
            <li>and it also cuts very well.</li>
            <li>Fits my fingers and cuts very well.</li>
            <li>and these scissors really do the trick.  </li>
            <li>the plus side, I feel very confident that these will last a long time.</li>
            <li>The unique design of these blades  let&#x27;s me get a much closer and neater trim of my facial hair without nicking myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly encourage you do the same and this product does a fantastic job with that.</li>
            <li>I was really hesitant to pay so much for tweezers/scissors... but after opening the package I realized how high quality they were.</li>
            <li>While I can certainly understand the scissors not having a sharp, pointed tip, ideally the head should be a little more narrow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what brand they were, but they were far superior to this product.</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman stainless steel facial hair scissor is a nice little scissor, and priced right.  </li>
            <li>&amp; for $15, I was really expecting them to at least be able to open &amp; close easily for a good cut, but no, they are very stiff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was immediately impressed with the sure, smooth and precision fit of the cutting edges as I simply opened and closed the blades slowly.&lt;br /&gt;Trimming individual hairs was easy and quick due to the sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m male with a full beard and larger-than-average sized nose</li>
            <li>This is a nice scissor but too small.</li>
            <li>The rounded nose is useful in two ways: It &#x27;grabs&#x27; hairs at the tip of the scissors and holds them so it has almost a little bit of a scythe action, grabbing the curly hairs and making sure they dont get missed, and it is useful for trimming nose hairs for the same reason and the non-nipping effect in the nostrils.  </li>
            <li>The metal scissors look new, as they should be because they are stainless steel, but the screw is not rust resistant</li>
            <li>You are paying for top quality that will last multiple years.</li>
            <li>Its been my experience that scissors of all types stop performing when used for things unintended for those particular scissors.  </li>
            <li>I bought these scissors for two main reasons.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>They work well and seem to be high quality.  </li>
            <li>Nothing high tech about it.</li>
            <li>Highly recomend these scissors.</li>
            <li>These are high quality scissors but there is no way they could be used for nose hair, too blunt at the tip.</li>
            <li>It has high quality.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a high quality pair of scissors but this is not it.  </li>
            <li>all, these scissors are high quality and they just work.</li>
            <li>The thicker blades do require a little more thought to get a closer trim in my nostril, but I manage ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy, but sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>They are sharp, made of strong metal, and manufactured in italy.  </li>
            <li>Also,  the blades themselves are very sturdy and haven&#x27;t bent or separated so far</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d opened a few things with them which led to some more damage.</li>
            <li>The quality seems great, and I can trim very precisely without having to worry about a sharp tip or cutting him.</li>
            <li>The scissors work really well and are quite well made, The finger grips could be just a bit more comfortable but is just a very minor complaint.</li>
            <li>The tips are a little too large to fit in the ear or nose.</li>
            <li>These are solidly built as you would expect from Tweezerman, the &#x27;hinge&#x27; is nice and tight so</li>
            <li>I have had these for three years now and the blades are still sharp and the hinge works smoothly.</li>
            <li>very sharp, easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to leave it open if wet</li>
            <li>They are very sharp, small and do a great job on ear and nasal hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These scissors are fantastic for getting facial hair cleanly cut when its in small amounts.</li>
            <li>I bought these scissors last summer, but just used them for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>ALSO THE BLUNT ENDS ARE TO LARGE TO ALOW FOR EASY TRIMMING IN CORNERS &amp; HARD</li>
            <li>The blades match up perfectly, the cutting edges are very slightly serrated to grip the hairs just before they are cut, and the handles are just the right size.  </li>
            <li>Scissor is very stiff, I have purchased this brand before always been pleased with product.  </li>
            <li>(Although I don&#x27;t have large hands or fingers, so if you do then perhaps you should get a bigger</li>
            <li>Finger holes are large enough for a man&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li>Its larger than you think and is fine for trimming a beard but too big for your ears or nose hairs (which is gross</li>
            <li>The bulbous head on the scissors is a little bigger than the photo would seem to imply, which means that maneuvering it inside a human nose to where it needs to be to effectively cut hair can be a challenge.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the actual scissor part is a little thicker than what I would consider ideal for my nostrils!  </li>
            <li>After 1 use, I can say they are easy to use, are sharp enough to work well, and they have a masculine</li>
            <li>I use it to touch up on stray hairs that grow faster than the rest of the beard as well keep my lips clear of hair.</li>
            <li>This works great and allows me to keep my facial hair fuller without having random hairs ruining the profile.</li>
            <li>The picture shows them, the description clearly states it,</li>
            <li>have a pair of Tweezerman Stainless Steel Facial Hair Scissors I keep at my workplace, just in case of \\&quot;whatever\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The purchase price along with the shipping cost far exceeds expectations.</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman stainless steel facial hair scissors were not sent as ordered.</li>
            <li>As you can see from the image, they appear to be straight and also the description nowhere mentioned that they were curved, so I sent them back for a refund.  </li>
            <li>He is only two-years-old and they work very well.</li>
            <li>Or let the nose hairs grow buck wild.</li>
            <li>but it grew old</li>
            <li>I feel that I don&#x27;t have complete control and could cut myself.</li>
            <li>I used to nick myself all the time with my old pair,  </li>
            <li>Pin in the middle isn&#x27;t stainless.</li>
            <li>I trim the hairs around his face, especially the eyes, and it&#x27;s sharp enough that i can cut fast (which is important</li>
            <li>Quality is okay, however to small and not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>These scissors are not curved like the old ones and the tips are much thicker than my old ones making it harder to pit against my skin.</li>
            <li>and I got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to gamble that a 3rd pair would work well, so I think I&#x27;m going have to find some new scissors.</li>
            <li>They arent intimidating and no sharp ends to gouge any part of me or, like my parts of my dog.  </li>
            <li>I use an old German-made Solingen scissors I&#x27;ve had for 30 years and wanted a second set for travel.  </li>
            <li>I kept this pair to leave in a summer home and as an eventual replacement for my old German ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scissors sent were not stainless steel or straight blade.</li>
            <li>I paid for this product: Tweezerman Facial Hair Scissors Stainless Steel $ 17.10 and brought me this: Tweezerman GEAR Facial Hair Scissors $ 10.99, I want my money back.</li>
            <li>I actually use them to clip the nails of my two young children</li>
            <li>Does a good job on nose hair without cutting the skin and ditto for ear hair.</li>
            <li>Quality of the product is high but the pair I received were not new.</li>
            <li>They are sharp, ergonomic and have a very robust feel.  </li>
            <li>works really well on other surfaces as well</li>
            <li>These are too thick and big to fit up anyone&#x27;s nostrils or to trim non-whiskers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The rounded tip is also great, don&#x27;t have to worry about stabbing yourself!</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t really let you down.</li>
            <li>These small but useful scissors are sharp, stay sharp, neither rust nor loosen and have a useful blunted tip</li>
            <li>Comes in a nice small hard plastic package.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help that the hinge is pretty stiff.</li>
            <li>When you first open the packaging and hold the scissors, you can tell that they&#x27;re made of high quality materials and will last you quite some time; they&#x27;ve got a good thickness and heft to them and are quite sharp making it immediately apparent that they&#x27;re up to task for cutting those thick facial, nose, or ear hairs you might have.</li>
            <li>Now, due to my Italian heritage, my hairs are thick and coarse so most scissors just can&#x27;t get the job done and only bend or pull the hairs.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re medium-high quality, way above most other scissors in this size, and the round tips help prevent patients from getting jabbed from sharp tips.</li>
            <li>small overall but with large finger holes, rounded tips, sharp, and stainless steel.</li>
            <li>These scissors are sharp and a handy size but a little small for people with big hands.</li>
            <li>These little scissors are really well made.  </li>
            <li>I would give them a 5 star rating, but, while the blades themselves are stainless the screw in the middle is not; I have noticed a little rust around it</li>
            <li>so there isn&#x27;t any gap between the blades - the blades are nice and sharp (but I&#x27;m not sure if re-sharpening them is a realistic option due to the small size . . . )</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t seemto get the really good angles in my nose.</li>
            <li> Particularly good for inside the nose.</li>
            <li> Would be a good value at twice the price.</li>
            <li> so I am also, good quality and price</li>
            <li> They feel good in your hand and do the job.</li>
            <li> had a good set of nasal hair scissors that vanished.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good quality pair of scissors.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your service and for good products.</li>
            <li> For the price, these didn&#x27;t stand out as being exceptional based on their price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The fit between the two arms of the scissors is very good</li>
            <li> very safe for a man.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> For the amount of money this item costs, this should be a much more smooth and impressive tool.</li>
            <li> These have worked amazingly well.</li>
            <li> but it is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> Despite that, I&#x27;d liked how they cut</li>
            <li> My beard looks nice and clean-cut after a trimming with these scissors.</li>
            <li> These did the job nicely.</li>
            <li> Nothing impressive really.</li>
            <li> Nice scissors, they work well for their purpose and price.</li>
            <li> Honestly I kind of regret it though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish is nice and won&#x27;t show fingerprints like chrome/plated versions.</li>
            <li> Use your own judgement.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, nice quality, just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Here we&#x27;re very pleased with the replacement for the scissors she lost :)</li>
            <li> Good quality, and fit a man&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> Attractive as well as useful.</li>
            <li> good quality and nicely styled, priced about like Revlon, but far superior.</li>
            <li> Might as well just get fine tip ones and make sure you don&#x27;t stab yourself!</li>
            <li> But, they&#x27;re trimming my ear hairs just fine!</li>
            <li> This is very comfortable scissors.</li>
            <li> A better solution is to use the tweezerman.</li>
            <li> Although they cut OK, I have owned more quality blunt tip scissors.</li>
            <li> I now plan to order two more pair to keep at home (one for me and another for the wife).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they have become more than that.  </li>
            <li> Since I am a veterinary surgeon, I have to admit that they are better quality than most of my surgical instruments.  </li>
            <li> Very well made and service was great.</li>
            <li> Best personal care scissors money can buy!</li>
            <li> Ever seen those brightly-colored plastic play scissors they give pre-schoolers, the ones that don&#x27;t actually cut anything but look impressive?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better safety scissors out there...</li>
            <li> I really like it for trimming hairs (the size and blunt nose if great) and the finish is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have a matte finish that looks stain resistant, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect to get many stains out of my nose...  </li>
            <li> love these.</li>
            <li> sturdy, work well, love the safety feature of the tips.</li>
            <li> These are okay.</li>
            <li> I love Tweezerman products-</li>
            <li> Able to trim my beard with ease using these.</li>
            <li> Love the rounded tips.</li>
            <li> Like others said, you will not be able to trim your nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Love the rounded tip, always use it</li>
            <li> (I feel I have more control than special-purpose nail</li>
            <li> The rounded tip is OK</li>
            <li> A child&#x27;s school scissors are better quality.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Better than the cheap junk in many store scissor displays.</li>
            <li> Good quality scissors but their large size makes them inaccurate.</li>
            <li> Now, as I am sure you can imagine, this lack of precision is a huge downside</li>
            <li> These scissors are safe and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Great scissors that cut well and the rounded outside edges and tip make it very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I used these scissors for nose hair and felt no painful pulling and tugging!  </li>
            <li> No painfully plucking with tweezers anymore!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Simple &amp; easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are really nice - solid metal and good quality manufacture.</li>
            <li> I am able to fit my fingers in there and maneuver just fine, but not as comfortable as I</li>
            <li> These are very sharp and excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Works fine and is correct product, picture used by Amazon is a bit misleading when you get it though.  </li>
            <li> so I need to be quick and safe.</li>
            <li> These scissors felt light weight and cheap in my hand.</li>
            <li> but these scissors felt quite comfortable on my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought i would upgrade from a cheap pair i bought at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase tho its been only a day!</li>
            <li> Cuts precisely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;man-sized,&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s important to me.</li>
            <li> These are the best small scissors I have found.  </li>
            <li> Use them, as all sharp devices, with respectful caution and you should be more than pleased with their outstanding results at doing things they are designed to do.</li>
            <li> These scissors were originally for my nose</li>
            <li> They work perfectly for a thick beard and fit comfortably in hands.</li>
            <li> These are everything that was said about them-quality, sharp and they just feel good in your hand!  </li>
            <li> These are excellent small scissors.  </li>
            <li> These scissors cut cleanly leaving no \\&quot;fuzzies\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> After you use them, spray them with Lysol and they are clean.  </li>
            <li> Works well as it cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li> Useful tool, good for mustaches and a bit of beard maintenance, but go for actual hair-trimming scissors if you want to do your whole beard, much more efficient and a much more even result.</li>
            <li> These seem well made, have nice action to them, and deliver precise cuts.</li>
            <li> So get these, trim your nose hair without pain and be a good social citizen.</li>
            <li> They are well made, sharp, light and cut great.  </li>
            <li> I needed a good pair of scissors to trim my facial and nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> I guess these are good for larger hands</li>
            <li> true.</li>
            <li> As a result, you can&#x27;t really cut much hair at once, so these scissors are only best for mustaches, eyebrows, nose, and ears.</li>
            <li> the cutting edges of the blades line up perfect right out of the box and 4 months later they still line up perfect.  </li>
            <li> --he&#x27;s very squiggly) and safe because of the rounded tips i&#x27;m not afraid of poking his eye out.</li>
            <li> These are some really nice scissors; much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp, very precise, quality built.</li>
            <li> However, their strong points all add together to make their weakest point: they&#x27;re just too large to be accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe it needs more use but out of the box the scissors are not that easy to open or close.</li>
            <li> Thanks, enjoy shopping here.</li>
            <li> But considering that I don&#x27;t try to shave the insides of my nostrils, I find the cut delivered to be far more than satisfying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think they are useful because of their size and shape.</li>
            <li> but this one is a flop, good for other things though.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and good quality</li>
            <li> They are reasonably sharp and do a good job of trimming nose hairs...when you can coax them into the position where they need to be.  </li>
            <li> Much simpler than the battery powered units and 100 times easier to clean and store.</li>
            <li> have very large hands</li>
            <li> I have big hands, but my fingers can still fit in the handles and easily operate the scissors.  </li>
            <li> The rounded tips are a nice touch, and the metal is a very  \\&quot;lackluster\\&quot; non glossy shade which I personally like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> The ends are too big can&#x27;t cut your nose hair love the company</li>
            <li> son swiped the first (fits his hands well and is pretty safe), so I had to buy a second one.</li>
            <li> i first look at country item was made from before considering to buy, i try to avoid made in china.</li>
            <li> I made the decision to stop using my electric beard trimmer and use something more traditional.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> For beards, I suggest you use an electric, $20 razor kit with changing heads that lets you groom much more evenly across your facial hair.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> As a result, I seldom actually use these -- most of the time I select another pair from my cabinet.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, very safe.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> A nice sharp, smooth cut and great size for big or small hands.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality trimmer, great for nose and other soft spots where you can&#x27;t afford to get cut.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other brands were slightly more expensive, and these both got reasonably good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are great for eye brows, or any other facial grooming.  </li>
            <li> My fault; liked the idea of durable, sharp non rusting stainless steel</li>
            <li> Would not recommend - a dollar store purchase would be more advantageous in the long run.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nonetheless a great buy for convenience if you like to groom very carefully and personally, and the rounded tips ensure no nicks!</li>
            <li> One of the reasons was that they are compact and easy to keep with my electric shaver when grooming to help even out the facial hair.</li>
            <li> and now I am more careful to make sure my scissors are dry before I put them</li>
            <li> Very high quality</li>
            <li> I purchased the stainless steel version that looks to have a gray matte</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> These are good-quality scissors for facial hair (nose hair and goatee, in my case), with all the important features:</li>
            <li> Looking for a reasonable priced nose scissor and chose this one.</li>
            <li> My pair readily adhered to a magnet meaning they contain ferrous metal.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I bought the Rubis Stainless and the Tweezerman Stainless, based on price, thinking I&#x27;d return one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The Rubis is shorter and thicker, but cuts well and seems very well made.  </li>
            <li> I really wish my boyfriend wouldn&#x27;t have opened the package like a maniac</li>
            <li> Thanks for your concern.  </li>
            <li> Well made pair of stainless steel scissors.</li>
            <li> I plan to order the Princess Care ® Solo SS Moustache Beard Scissors which can be ordered either curved or straight.</li>
            <li> The scissors I received are actually eyebrow trimmers, probably designed for women, since I can barely fit my fingers into them.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit too much pressure to get them to close, if they start closing on your skin that pressure is no bueno.</li>
            <li> These scissors would work well for a straight Hitler style mustache.</li>
            <li> Everything in this listing indicates that they are selling the stainless steel version of the scissors.</li>
            <li> the UPC # and Model # match that of the stainless steel version.</li>
            <li> * Very small&lt;br /</li>
            <li> These are fantastic scissors for facial hairs.  </li>
            <li> I spent much more for these than the drugstore scissors that I prefer.</li>
            <li> and it also cuts very well.</li>
            <li> Fits my fingers and cuts very well.</li>
            <li> and these scissors really do the trick.  </li>
            <li> the plus side, I feel very confident that these will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The unique design of these blades  let&#x27;s me get a much closer and neater trim of my facial hair without nicking myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly encourage you do the same and this product does a fantastic job with that.</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to pay so much for tweezers/scissors... but after opening the package I realized how high quality they were.</li>
            <li> While I can certainly understand the scissors not having a sharp, pointed tip, ideally the head should be a little more narrow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what brand they were, but they were far superior to this product.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman stainless steel facial hair scissor is a nice little scissor, and priced right.  </li>
            <li> &amp; for $15, I was really expecting them to at least be able to open &amp; close easily for a good cut, but no, they are very stiff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was immediately impressed with the sure, smooth and precision fit of the cutting edges as I simply opened and closed the blades slowly.&lt;br /&gt;Trimming individual hairs was easy and quick due to the sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m male with a full beard and larger-than-average sized nose</li>
            <li> This is a nice scissor but too small.</li>
            <li> The rounded nose is useful in two ways: It &#x27;grabs&#x27; hairs at the tip of the scissors and holds them so it has almost a little bit of a scythe action, grabbing the curly hairs and making sure they dont get missed, and it is useful for trimming nose hairs for the same reason and the non-nipping effect in the nostrils.  </li>
            <li> The metal scissors look new, as they should be because they are stainless steel, but the screw is not rust resistant</li>
            <li> You are paying for top quality that will last multiple years.</li>
            <li> Its been my experience that scissors of all types stop performing when used for things unintended for those particular scissors.  </li>
            <li> I bought these scissors for two main reasons.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> They work well and seem to be high quality.  </li>
            <li> Nothing high tech about it.</li>
            <li> Highly recomend these scissors.</li>
            <li> These are high quality scissors but there is no way they could be used for nose hair, too blunt at the tip.</li>
            <li> It has high quality.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a high quality pair of scissors but this is not it.  </li>
            <li> all, these scissors are high quality and they just work.</li>
            <li> The thicker blades do require a little more thought to get a closer trim in my nostril, but I manage ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, but sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp, made of strong metal, and manufactured in italy.  </li>
            <li> Also,  the blades themselves are very sturdy and haven&#x27;t bent or separated so far</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d opened a few things with them which led to some more damage.</li>
            <li> The quality seems great, and I can trim very precisely without having to worry about a sharp tip or cutting him.</li>
            <li> The scissors work really well and are quite well made, The finger grips could be just a bit more comfortable but is just a very minor complaint.</li>
            <li> The tips are a little too large to fit in the ear or nose.</li>
            <li> These are solidly built as you would expect from Tweezerman, the &#x27;hinge&#x27; is nice and tight so</li>
            <li> I have had these for three years now and the blades are still sharp and the hinge works smoothly.</li>
            <li> very sharp, easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to leave it open if wet</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, small and do a great job on ear and nasal hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These scissors are fantastic for getting facial hair cleanly cut when its in small amounts.</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors last summer, but just used them for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> ALSO THE BLUNT ENDS ARE TO LARGE TO ALOW FOR EASY TRIMMING IN CORNERS &amp; HARD</li>
            <li> The blades match up perfectly, the cutting edges are very slightly serrated to grip the hairs just before they are cut, and the handles are just the right size.  </li>
            <li> Scissor is very stiff, I have purchased this brand before always been pleased with product.  </li>
            <li> (Although I don&#x27;t have large hands or fingers, so if you do then perhaps you should get a bigger</li>
            <li> Finger holes are large enough for a man&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> Its larger than you think and is fine for trimming a beard but too big for your ears or nose hairs (which is gross</li>
            <li> The bulbous head on the scissors is a little bigger than the photo would seem to imply, which means that maneuvering it inside a human nose to where it needs to be to effectively cut hair can be a challenge.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the actual scissor part is a little thicker than what I would consider ideal for my nostrils!  </li>
            <li> After 1 use, I can say they are easy to use, are sharp enough to work well, and they have a masculine</li>
            <li> I use it to touch up on stray hairs that grow faster than the rest of the beard as well keep my lips clear of hair.</li>
            <li> This works great and allows me to keep my facial hair fuller without having random hairs ruining the profile.</li>
            <li> The picture shows them, the description clearly states it,</li>
            <li> have a pair of Tweezerman Stainless Steel Facial Hair Scissors I keep at my workplace, just in case of \\&quot;whatever\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The purchase price along with the shipping cost far exceeds expectations.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman stainless steel facial hair scissors were not sent as ordered.</li>
            <li> As you can see from the image, they appear to be straight and also the description nowhere mentioned that they were curved, so I sent them back for a refund.  </li>
            <li> He is only two-years-old and they work very well.</li>
            <li> Or let the nose hairs grow buck wild.</li>
            <li> but it grew old</li>
            <li> I feel that I don&#x27;t have complete control and could cut myself.</li>
            <li> I used to nick myself all the time with my old pair,  </li>
            <li> Pin in the middle isn&#x27;t stainless.</li>
            <li> I trim the hairs around his face, especially the eyes, and it&#x27;s sharp enough that i can cut fast (which is important</li>
            <li> Quality is okay, however to small and not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> These scissors are not curved like the old ones and the tips are much thicker than my old ones making it harder to pit against my skin.</li>
            <li> and I got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to gamble that a 3rd pair would work well, so I think I&#x27;m going have to find some new scissors.</li>
            <li> They arent intimidating and no sharp ends to gouge any part of me or, like my parts of my dog.  </li>
            <li> I use an old German-made Solingen scissors I&#x27;ve had for 30 years and wanted a second set for travel.  </li>
            <li> I kept this pair to leave in a summer home and as an eventual replacement for my old German ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The scissors sent were not stainless steel or straight blade.</li>
            <li> I paid for this product: Tweezerman Facial Hair Scissors Stainless Steel $ 17.10 and brought me this: Tweezerman GEAR Facial Hair Scissors $ 10.99, I want my money back.</li>
            <li> I actually use them to clip the nails of my two young children</li>
            <li> Does a good job on nose hair without cutting the skin and ditto for ear hair.</li>
            <li> Quality of the product is high but the pair I received were not new.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, ergonomic and have a very robust feel.  </li>
            <li> works really well on other surfaces as well</li>
            <li> These are too thick and big to fit up anyone&#x27;s nostrils or to trim non-whiskers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The rounded tip is also great, don&#x27;t have to worry about stabbing yourself!</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t really let you down.</li>
            <li> These small but useful scissors are sharp, stay sharp, neither rust nor loosen and have a useful blunted tip</li>
            <li> Comes in a nice small hard plastic package.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help that the hinge is pretty stiff.</li>
            <li> When you first open the packaging and hold the scissors, you can tell that they&#x27;re made of high quality materials and will last you quite some time; they&#x27;ve got a good thickness and heft to them and are quite sharp making it immediately apparent that they&#x27;re up to task for cutting those thick facial, nose, or ear hairs you might have.</li>
            <li> Now, due to my Italian heritage, my hairs are thick and coarse so most scissors just can&#x27;t get the job done and only bend or pull the hairs.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re medium-high quality, way above most other scissors in this size, and the round tips help prevent patients from getting jabbed from sharp tips.</li>
            <li> small overall but with large finger holes, rounded tips, sharp, and stainless steel.</li>
            <li> These scissors are sharp and a handy size but a little small for people with big hands.</li>
            <li> These little scissors are really well made.  </li>
            <li> I would give them a 5 star rating, but, while the blades themselves are stainless the screw in the middle is not; I have noticed a little rust around it</li>
            <li> so there isn&#x27;t any gap between the blades - the blades are nice and sharp (but I&#x27;m not sure if re-sharpening them is a realistic option due to the small size . . . )</li>
            <li> Stay very sharp, feel solid and live up to there Tweezerman name.</li>
            <li> My only major qualm is that these are small, they are the size of standard nail-clipping scissors, which makes them kind of useless for trimming your entire beard up.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars is they are slightly larger than I expected, making them a little more difficult to use in my nostrils than would be true if they were a little smaller.</li>
            <li> I just received these scissors and, while the quality appears to be okay, I was disappointed to see they don&#x27;t have straight blades.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about hurting myself with the sharp end, but these scissors are still plenty sharp, so the rounded end isn&#x27;t that much safer.</li>
            <li> Definitely seem they will last a long time</li>
            <li> its blades, and then far less likely it&#x27;ll cut through that hair.</li>
            <li> The single-piece design of each cutting edge makes these feel solid in your hands, not dinky like most facial hair scissors do.  </li>
            <li> , I think they&#x27;ll last a long time</li>
            <li> * Will last a long time&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I think they will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is, however, a bit more clumsy and hard to control.</li>
            <li> What I received instead was made from a casting which tends to be far inferior to the previous process</li>
            <li> felt they were sharp enough and the blades actually cut.</li>
            <li> Like the rubis, you can&#x27;t really get close and thus not effective  </li>
            <li> Love the rounded tip, I don&#x27;t worry about cutting her with these.  </li>
            <li> but I expected something smaller when I bought them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I feel like these are a well built product and should get the job done for a long time.</li>
            <li> Use them on his paws around his claws and in between his foot pads, around his eyes when hairs get too long.  </li>
            <li> - it is a bit safer, but also makes the profile larger which can make it harder to use.</li>
            <li> You will find yourself asking yourself why you waited so long after trying these affordable, well made scissors.</li>
            <li> The reason I did not give them 5 stars is because they are rather thickly made so that I can&#x27;t get very close to the hairs&#x27; roots to cut them close…at all.</li>
            <li> No, save your money and go down to the local drugstore and buy something inexpensive that actually might do the job.</li>
            <li> I use them for everything from cutting open packages to finger nails to too many other things to mention.  </li>
            <li> They also have a stiff action.</li>
            <li> They are sharp enough to cut facial hairs quite easily, but have rounded tips to keep you from cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> there are other tweezerman ones that are thinner, and work well, buying a 2nd pair of the others</li>
            <li> I kept them for travel, and I expect they&#x27;ll get through the TSA with no fuss due to the short blades.  </li>
            <li> These scissors are made with extremely high-quality and feel like they will last forever.  </li>
            <li> I use the product to trim my mustach and other facial hair.  </li>
            <li> so it can dry.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; tips make it difficult to cleanly trim.</li>
            <li> could feel absolutely no side to side play, which assures them making such sharp cuts.  </li>
            <li> Facial hair is no fun</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thick making them only possible to cut hairs at a horizontal angle to your face, also opposite of what i&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> It is made of solid materials that hasn&#x27;t rusted or worn down.</li>
            <li> It just makes it less likely.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to have them sharpened and have gotten them wet</li>
            <li> Over that time, though, the blade dulled, which was to be expected</li>
            <li> expect both of them might rust if stored wet, but I have had no issues with either pair.</li>
            <li> If you got a big hand, it is not fit for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tips are carefully rounded, to avoid pinching or wounding.</li>
            <li> Look carefully at the size and dimensions of this scissors.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a little bit longer which would have made it somewhat easier to maneuver, however, it&#x27;s very sharp and well suited for trimming facial hairs.  </li>
            <li> Even so, it is a minor complaint as it does not hamper the effectiveness of the scissors and is only a cosmetic problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> scissors are seriously sharp, as intended to be so.</li>
            <li> The reviews did help in my selection and price was the other factor.</li>
            <li> Other than this</li>
            <li> I have big hands and the finger holes are on the small side.</li>
            <li> I bought these to trim pesky eyebrow hairs &amp; after reading how sharp these were I decided to purchase them.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and the steel has not rusted.</li>
            <li> Stay sharp.</li>
            <li> Therefor I am extremely dissatisfied with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Scissors are sharp and well built.</li>
            <li> Sharp, as others have said.</li>
            <li> The other reason was the rounded tips to utilize for spots that I&#x27;d otherwise nick myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased these after going through 2 other scissors for trimming nose hairs.</li>
            <li> one.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these for my nose, and if I had to buy them again, I would probably get the ones with the sharp point instead of the rounded end.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and they cut well.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to small pet owners.</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, however they are stiff to open and close.</li>
            <li> They are sharp but the lack of a curve makes it difficult to trim certain areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fun</li>
            <li> like that the tips are rounded to cut down on the number of jabs I might experience when trimming&lt;br</li>
            <li> very sharp.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, though.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and work&lt;br /&gt;Well.</li>
            <li> The problem is if your a woman with small hands the sccisaor grip is too wide and shimmys&lt;br /&gt;Down</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the finger holes are too small.  </li>
            <li> Actually, they were also so dull that very few hairs were cut at all.</li>
            <li> This pair may be defective, because it&#x27;s loose at the hinge (which cannot be tightened) and the blades are fairly dull.</li>
            <li> Been using for years with little maintenance.</li>
            <li> If you plan to use it to trim nostril hair, however, I found it to be a little bit awkward as the rounded tips are too large.</li>
            <li> Made in Italy, not a cheap, poorly-fitting scissors that will rust or break in 3 months like those manufactured somewhere else.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t want to waste money on practically disposable scissors so I bought these.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t leave it in a pool of water as I accidentally did and it started rusting within a few days.</li>
            <li> small but very sharp.</li>
            <li> The tip is dull while the rest is quite sharp.</li>
            <li> * Stiff hinge</li>
            <li> They are a little small for trimming the rest of my beard.</li>
            <li> SHE LIKES TO SLEEP IN THE CAT TREE LEVELS WHICH ARE TOO SMALL FOR HER, CAUSING HER FIR TO MAT IN THE BACK.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never realized that it is that small.</li>
            <li> past your knuckles and gets stuck.</li>
            <li> I wear men&#x27;s small gloves and</li>
            <li> Nose &amp; ear hair is a pain to clip, &amp; ordinary scissors are often painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These were as advertised, I don&#x27;t find them to be flimsy or too small.  </li>
            <li> These are high quality scissors but the design of the finger holes makes them painful to use.</li>
            <li> Maybe my nose is just too small, but the tips of these are thick and I cannot get a close cut at all.</li>
            <li> weak, arms of the scissors don&#x27;t close tight, doesn&#x27;t cut well, hair just bends between blades of the scissors.</li>
            <li> Consequently, trying to trim facial hair with these has resulted in painfully plucking out hairs and uneven results.</li>
            <li> These scissors cut my hairs quite well but, back to their size, I am afraid to get too close to my face or too deep in my nose for fear of cutting myself.</li>
            <li> I initially complained about the price</li>
            <li> I can finally trim my unsightly ear hair without worrying about stabbing myself with the pointy manicure scissors I was using.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard.  </li>
            <li> I wish that the safety blade was not so thick.</li>
            <li> I use them on my thick goatee and mustache.  </li>
            <li> I am not a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> These scissors are dull, dull, DULL!  </li>
            <li> The material used may be too thick for some, and certainly unlikely to appeal to the average woman.</li>
            <li> This is the only item I have ever purchased from Amazon.com and been disappointed with.  </li>
            <li> As a test of small scissors, I try to cut very thin sewing thread to see the quality of the cut.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as sharp as I wanted and the handles are square shaped, which is very uncomfortable for the grip.</li>
            <li> trying to get them to work in a tight place in my nose cause a rather painful cut and lots of blood.</li>
            <li> Resistance of the connection makes for slow cutting.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.</li>
            <li> My wife pointed out that it was sad we&#x27;ve become accustomed to reading reviews on the smallest of items.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found it was junk, after 30 days and could not return it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the mechanism is mediocre and the scissors are quite diminutive.</li>

            <li> so you do not make your spouse angry by accidentally poking or cutting your dog or cat when trimming their clumped fur</li>

            <li> Great scissors. very safe for a man.</li>
            <li> Every man needs these! Plucking or pulling hairs from your nose is an awful thing. It&#x27;s not fun and it&#x27;s bad for you! All it takes is one infected hair follicle inside of your nostrils from a bad pluck job and you&#x27;ll find that you just stop trimming your nose hair altogether. Next thing you know you have bushels of hair flowing out your nose, boogers clinging to every strand and people avoiding you in public places. A better solution is to use the tweezerman. Cut those pesky nose hairs, and do so without having to worry about impaling yourself. The ends of these bad boys are rounded, unlike the hair cutting scissors you stole from your wife&#x27;s bathroom drawer.  Those scissors will draw blood, these will not! So get these, trim your nose hair without pain and be a good social citizen.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality trimmer, great for nose and other soft spots where you can&#x27;t afford to get cut.  Made in Italy, not a cheap, poorly-fitting scissors that will rust or break in 3 months like those manufactured somewhere else.</li>
            <li> These little scissors are really well made.  They are great for eye brows, or any other facial grooming.  Great for travel too.</li>
            <li> This is a great scissors that are built nice and does the job well. It has a mat silver look which I like.</li>
            <li> Like the rubis, you can&#x27;t really get close and thus not effective  there are other tweezerman ones that are thinner, and work well, buying a 2nd pair of the others</li>
            <li> These scissors felt light weight and cheap in my hand. Although they cut OK, I have owned more quality blunt tip scissors.</li>
            <li> I bought these to trim my daughter&#x27;s bangs and they work great.  Love the rounded tip, I don&#x27;t worry about cutting her with these.  Very high quality, I think they&#x27;ll last a long time</li>
            <li> Bought these for a medic kit, which has nothing to do with \\&quot;facial hair\\&quot;.  They&#x27;re medium-high quality, way above most other scissors in this size, and the round tips help prevent patients from getting jabbed from sharp tips.</li>
            <li> These are the best small scissors I have found.  They are sharp, ergonomic and have a very robust feel.  I have now bought 2 pair, one for home and one for travel.  I have not used the lifetime sharpening but it is a nice feature.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard.  I needed a good pair of scissors to trim my facial and nose hairs.  I purchased the stainless steel version that looks to have a gray matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was immediately impressed with the sure, smooth and precision fit of the cutting edges as I simply opened and closed the blades slowly.&lt;br /&gt;Trimming individual hairs was easy and quick due to the sharp blades.  As a test of small scissors, I try to cut very thin sewing thread to see the quality of the cut.  These scissors cut cleanly leaving no \\&quot;fuzzies\\&quot;.  Makes them great for trimming off those dangling threads we sometimes see on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could feel absolutely no side to side play, which assures them making such sharp cuts.  The rounded tips help prevent accidental stabs into you skin.  If I wanted a scissor to cut almost razor close, I might select a design without the rounded tip.  But considering that I don&#x27;t try to shave the insides of my nostrils, I find the cut delivered to be far more than satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very large hands but these scissors felt quite comfortable on my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a pair of Tweezerman Stainless Steel Facial Hair Scissors I keep at my workplace, just in case of \\&quot;whatever\\&quot;.  I now plan to order two more pair to keep at home (one for me and another for the wife).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple word of warning:&lt;br /&gt;These scissors are seriously sharp, as intended to be so. Although they have rounded safety tips, they are not toys, and are not for use by children, or people with unsure hands.  Use them, as all sharp devices, with respectful caution and you should be more than pleased with their outstanding results at doing things they are designed to do.</li>
            <li> HAVE A FEMALE CAT WHO IS AS BIG AS A TOM CAT.  SHE LIKES TO SLEEP IN THE CAT TREE LEVELS WHICH ARE TOO SMALL FOR HER, CAUSING HER FIR TO MAT IN THE BACK.&lt;br /&gt;THESE MATS ARE PAINFUL FOR CATS. SO I BOUGHT THESE SCISSORS TO CUT THE MATTING OFF. IT WORKED PERFECTLY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY CAT IS SO HAPPY NOW</li>
            <li> Good quality, and fit a man&#x27;s hand. very sharp. would buy again, at this price. I got the product I wanted</li>
            <li> These scissors were originally for my nose but they have become more than that.  I use them for everything from cutting open packages to finger nails to too many other things to mention.  The best part about them is they are surgical steel.  Since I am a veterinary surgeon, I have to admit that they are better quality than most of my surgical instruments.  I have yet to have them sharpened and have gotten them wet and there is no rust.  After you use them, spray them with Lysol and they are clean.  A must buy!</li>
            <li> These work great for trimming my husband&#x27;s moustache.  Very well made and service was great.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Made in Italy. Better than the cheap junk in many store scissor displays. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of these which I used for a year which worked great. Over that time, though, the blade dulled, which was to be expected and I&#x27;d opened a few things with them which led to some more damage. Also the hinge rusted up from from moisture. Despite that, I&#x27;d liked how they cut so much I got a second pair. This pair may be defective, because it&#x27;s loose at the hinge (which cannot be tightened) and the blades are fairly dull. Consequently, trying to trim facial hair with these has resulted in painfully plucking out hairs and uneven results. I don&#x27;t want to gamble that a 3rd pair would work well, so I think I&#x27;m going have to find some new scissors.</li>
            <li> Best personal care scissors money can buy!</li>
            <li> These Tweezerman scissors are wonderful. They have a nice weight to them that shows their great quality. They are sharp enough to cut facial hairs quite easily, but have rounded tips to keep you from cutting yourself. My beard looks nice and clean-cut after a trimming with these scissors. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are good-quality scissors for facial hair (nose hair and goatee, in my case), with all the important features: small overall but with large finger holes, rounded tips, sharp, and stainless steel.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp. They work perfectly for a thick beard and fit comfortably in hands.</li>
            <li> Ever seen those brightly-colored plastic play scissors they give pre-schoolers, the ones that don&#x27;t actually cut anything but look impressive?  That&#x27;s what these scissors remind me of.  And lest you think that means you can&#x27;t hurt yourself with them, think again: trying to get them to work in a tight place in my nose cause a rather painful cut and lots of blood. No, save your money and go down to the local drugstore and buy something inexpensive that actually might do the job.</li>
            <li> Just used a different cheapie pair today.  Now I know how good the Tweezerman scissor is.  Have used the Tweezerman several years.  Worth it.</li>
            <li> These are high quality scissors but the design of the finger holes makes them painful to use.</li>
            <li> If you buy the Tweezerman grooming kit (that comes with these scissors) the scissors are something like 30% smaller. I guess these are good for larger hands but I expected something smaller when I bought them.</li>
            <li> The ends are too big can&#x27;t cut your nose hair love the company but this one is a flop, good for other things though.</li>
            <li> I got these to trim my mustache and beard. Solid construction, works well. Very sharp, though. Accidentally clipped one nostril when trimming my mustache.</li>
            <li> Looking for a reasonable priced nose scissor and chose this one. The reviews did help in my selection and price was the other factor. Does a good job on nose hair without cutting the skin and ditto for ear hair. At that time in life where this is a problem but this scissor handles it without the nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> It really is a great product. I use it to touch up on stray hairs that grow faster than the rest of the beard as well keep my lips clear of hair. Great scissors that cut well and the rounded outside edges and tip make it very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I got this for clipping the hair around my dogs eyes so I need to be quick and safe. These did the job nicely. I&#x27;m sure there are better safety scissors out there...but these can&#x27;t be beat for the price. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> When you first open the packaging and hold the scissors, you can tell that they&#x27;re made of high quality materials and will last you quite some time; they&#x27;ve got a good thickness and heft to them and are quite sharp making it immediately apparent that they&#x27;re up to task for cutting those thick facial, nose, or ear hairs you might have. However, their strong points all add together to make their weakest point: they&#x27;re just too large to be accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m male with a full beard and larger-than-average sized nose and I needed some scissors to keep them trimmed up. Now, due to my Italian heritage, my hairs are thick and coarse so most scissors just can&#x27;t get the job done and only bend or pull the hairs. These scissors cut my hairs quite well but, back to their size, I am afraid to get too close to my face or too deep in my nose for fear of cutting myself. Now, as I am sure you can imagine, this lack of precision is a huge downside so I&#x27;ll be looking for another set of scissors soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR: Good quality scissors but their large size makes them inaccurate.</li>
            <li> The scissors are very good.  They have lived up to expectations.  I bought them for my husband who&#x27;s been using them regularly.</li>
            <li> I purchased a pair of these Tweezerman facial scissors. They are very sharp, small and do a great job on ear and nasal hair.  true. My pair readily adhered to a magnet meaning they contain ferrous metal.  Other than this the scissors are great.</li>
            <li> The purchase price along with the shipping cost far exceeds expectations. It serves the purpose but next time I would go [&lt;br /&gt;to a neighborhood drug store.</li>
            <li> I have big hands and the finger holes are on the small side. I am able to fit my fingers in there and maneuver just fine, but not as comfortable as I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the tips are rounded to cut down on the number of jabs I might experience when trimming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt they were sharp enough and the blades actually cut. They did not pull the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I feel like these are a well built product and should get the job done for a long time.</li>
            <li> good quality and nicely styled, priced about like Revlon, but far superior. I had others o f the same make, they kept sharpness well.</li>
            <li> I really like it for trimming hairs (the size and blunt nose if great) and the finish is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son swiped the first (fits his hands well and is pretty safe), so I had to buy a second one.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my facial hair. It delivers an even cut, and doesn&#x27;t leave unwanted split ends. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> THE STEEL USED FOR THESE SCISSORS IS NOT THE BEST QUALITY &amp; THEY ARE NOT COMFOTABLE  IN YOUR HAND BECAUUSE OF THE DESIGHN OF THEM, THE WAY THE STEEL IS SHAPED,THAT IS WHERE YOU HOLD THEM IN YOUR FINGERS. ALSO THE BLUNT ENDS ARE TO LARGE TO ALOW FOR EASY TRIMMING IN CORNERS &amp; HARD TO REACH PLACES IN NOSE &amp; EARS. REDDOG OVER &amp; OUT.</li>
            <li> Scissors which are used to cut ear and nose hair.  They work well and seem to be high quality.  Tweezerman hasn&#x27;t failed me yet.</li>
            <li> i first look at country item was made from before considering to buy, i try to avoid made in china.</li>
            <li> I use an old German-made Solingen scissors I&#x27;ve had for 30 years and wanted a second set for travel.  After reading the reviews, I bought the Rubis Stainless and the Tweezerman Stainless, based on price, thinking I&#x27;d return one.  I kept both, for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other brands were slightly more expensive, and these both got reasonably good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rubis is shorter and thicker, but cuts well and seems very well made.  I kept them for travel, and I expect they&#x27;ll get through the TSA with no fuss due to the short blades.  They have a matte finish that looks stain resistant, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect to get many stains out of my nose...  The thicker blades do require a little more thought to get a closer trim in my nostril, but I manage ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tweezerman has longer, thinner blades.  It also seems well made and cuts well.  It also has a matte finish which seems stain resistant.  The finish is darker than the Rubis, as shown in the image.  I kept this pair to leave in a summer home and as an eventual replacement for my old German ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect both of them might rust if stored wet, but I have had no issues with either pair.</li>
            <li> I made the decision to stop using my electric beard trimmer and use something more traditional. Its been great. This works great and allows me to keep my facial hair fuller without having random hairs ruining the profile. I highly encourage you do the same and this product does a fantastic job with that. A nice sharp, smooth cut and great size for big or small hands.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman stainless steel facial hair scissors were not sent as ordered. A different product was sent in place of the one shown / described in the product listing / photo. The scissors sent were not stainless steel or straight blade. I received scissors of a different design and finish with curved blades. Only the scissor length was correct.</li>
            <li> I uses these to trim my mustache. I thought i would upgrade from a cheap pair i bought at the drugstore. These scissors are not curved like the old ones and the tips are much thicker than my old ones making it harder to pit against my skin.</li>
            <li> Solid feel. Been using for years with little maintenance. Be sure to leave it open if wet so it can dry.</li>
            <li> Comes in a nice small hard plastic package. Works well as it cuts cleanly. Nothing high tech about it. Its a well made nose clipper.</li>
            <li> The scissors work really well and are quite well made, The finger grips could be just a bit more comfortable but is just a very minor complaint.</li>
            <li> love these. sturdy, work well, love the safety feature of the tips.</li>
            <li> These are okay. Nothing impressive really. I bought these to trim pesky eyebrow hairs &amp; after reading how sharp these were I decided to purchase them. The tip is dull while the rest is quite sharp. Opposite of what I&#x27;m looking for. They&#x27;re thick making them only possible to cut hairs at a horizontal angle to your face, also opposite of what i&#x27;m looking for. &amp; for $15, I was really expecting them to at least be able to open &amp; close easily for a good cut, but no, they are very stiff. I really wish my boyfriend wouldn&#x27;t have opened the package like a maniac so I could return them, but oh well. He can have them for his beard.</li>
            <li> These scissors are just what I needed for my mustache.  Nothing fancy, but sharp and easy to use.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife pointed out that it was sad we&#x27;ve become accustomed to reading reviews on the smallest of items.  Here we&#x27;re very pleased with the replacement for the scissors she lost :)</li>
            <li> Nice scissors, they work well for their purpose and price. I love Tweezerman products- they don&#x27;t really let you down.</li>
            <li> Able to trim my beard with ease using these. Very nice scissors! I would recommend them to anyone needing to do some &amp;#34;Manscaping&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Quality is okay, however to small and not sharp enough. Thanks for your concern.  Will try another pear hoping to have sharper blade.</li>
            <li> Well made pair of stainless steel scissors. They are sharp and the steel has not rusted. Highly recomend these scissors.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seemto get the really good angles in my nose. But i dont feel like i&#x27;m going to spear myself in the nose if i sneeze.</li>
            <li> I just received these scissors and, while the quality appears to be okay, I was disappointed to see they don&#x27;t have straight blades. As you can see from the image, they appear to be straight and also the description nowhere mentioned that they were curved, so I sent them back for a refund.  I plan to order the Princess Care ® Solo SS Moustache Beard Scissors which can be ordered either curved or straight.</li>
            <li> Works fine and is correct product, picture used by Amazon is a bit misleading when you get it though.  Picture in package is what you get not the stand alone scissor picture</li>
            <li> Great.  Stay sharp. Love the rounded tips. I use them on my sons hair.  He is only two-years-old and they work very well.</li>
            <li> The scissors I received are actually eyebrow trimmers, probably designed for women, since I can barely fit my fingers into them. Therefor I am extremely dissatisfied with this purchase.  RC</li>
            <li> Very sharp, very safe. Particularly good for inside the nose. Would be a good value at twice the price.</li>
            <li> This is a nice scissor but too small. I never realized that it is that small. If you got a big hand, it is not fit for you.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp, very precise, quality built. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The tips are a little too large to fit in the ear or nose.</li>
            <li> Like others said, you will not be able to trim your nose hairs. Might as well just get fine tip ones and make sure you don&#x27;t stab yourself! Or let the nose hairs grow buck wild. But, they&#x27;re trimming my ear hairs just fine!</li>
            <li> These are high quality scissors but there is no way they could be used for nose hair, too blunt at the tip. They also have a stiff action. It takes a bit too much pressure to get them to close, if they start closing on your skin that pressure is no bueno. Would not recommend for nose hair.</li>
            <li> Best to rid hair from your neck, without the possibiity of any nicks. works really well on other surfaces as well</li>
            <li> This is very comfortable scissors. You can use it for anything. You can use it for baby&#x27;s haircut too. It has high quality.</li>
            <li> These are solidly built as you would expect from Tweezerman, the &#x27;hinge&#x27; is nice and tight so the cutting edges of the blades line up perfect right out of the box and 4 months later they still line up perfect.  The single-piece design of each cutting edge makes these feel solid in your hands, not dinky like most facial hair scissors do.  The rounded nose is useful in two ways: It &#x27;grabs&#x27; hairs at the tip of the scissors and holds them so it has almost a little bit of a scythe action, grabbing the curly hairs and making sure they dont get missed, and it is useful for trimming nose hairs for the same reason and the non-nipping effect in the nostrils.  I will say that the curved tip doesnt make it impossible to cut yourself with these while trimming your beard/mustache, I have already nipped myself several times.  It just makes it less likely.  My only major qualm is that these are small, they are the size of standard nail-clipping scissors, which makes them kind of useless for trimming your entire beard up.  Useful tool, good for mustaches and a bit of beard maintenance, but go for actual hair-trimming scissors if you want to do your whole beard, much more efficient and a much more even result.</li>
            <li> Scissor is very stiff, I have purchased this brand before always been pleased with product.  I would not recommend buying facial scissors.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a high quality pair of scissors but this is not it.  They aren&#x27;t as sharp as I wanted and the handles are square shaped, which is very uncomfortable for the grip.</li>
            <li> Scissors are sharp and well built. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I wish that the safety blade was not so thick. They are sharp but the lack of a curve makes it difficult to trim certain areas.</li>
            <li> Facial hair defined: beards and man hair only.  These are too thick and big to fit up anyone&#x27;s nostrils or to trim non-whiskers.  They are sharp and good quality but I don&#x27;t think they are useful because of their size and shape.</li>
            <li> they work great. Love the rounded tip, always use it</li>
            <li> These are everything that was said about them-quality, sharp and they just feel good in your hand!  Awesome and made in the USA.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Sharp, as others have said. My fault; liked the idea of durable, sharp non rusting stainless steel scissors.&lt;br /&gt;The problem; I have a curved mustache which I trim with curved scissors which also work for nose &amp;  ear hair. These scissors would work well for a straight Hitler style mustache. I&#x27;ll keep them for nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> I paid for this product: Tweezerman Facial Hair Scissors Stainless Steel $ 17.10 and brought me this: Tweezerman GEAR Facial Hair Scissors $ 10.99, I want my money back. Thieves!!</li>
            <li> Finally something that works, requires no batteries and now my wife doesn&#x27;t have to continually remind me to trim my nose hairs!</li>
            <li> Everything in this listing indicates that they are selling the stainless steel version of the scissors. The picture shows them, the description clearly states it, the UPC # and Model # match that of the stainless steel version. However what they shipped was a cheaper pair of nickel plated tweezerman scissors.</li>
            <li> I  do like the tweezerman tweezers so bought the scissors. They are very sharp and work&lt;br /&gt;Well. The problem is if your a woman with small hands the sccisaor grip is too wide and shimmys&lt;br /&gt;Down past your knuckles and gets stuck. You have to relax your hand and shake the scissors off.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a woman and you hate getting rings stuck on your fingers you won&#x27;t like these scissors.</li>
            <li> Excellent scissors. Delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Thanks, enjoy shopping here.</li>
            <li> Update: I have had these for three years now and the blades are still sharp and the hinge works smoothly. I initially complained about the price but these are meant to last. You are paying for top quality that will last multiple years. I take horrible care of mine and leave it in the shower, which caused the screw to rust. The metal scissors look new, as they should be because they are stainless steel, but the screw is not rust resistant so beware if exposing the scissors to water. Even so, it is a minor complaint as it does not hamper the effectiveness of the scissors and is only a cosmetic problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t want to waste money on practically disposable scissors so I bought these. Honestly I kind of regret it though. For the price, these didn&#x27;t stand out as being exceptional based on their price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, these things are tiny. I wear men&#x27;s small gloves and yet my hand still cramped up trying to use these. It doesn&#x27;t help that the hinge is pretty stiff. Maybe it needs more use but out of the box the scissors are not that easy to open or close. Some may like this for precision but it grew old fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I feel very confident that these will last a long time. It is made of solid materials that hasn&#x27;t rusted or worn down. Still looks like it came out of the box yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;* Great quality materials&lt;br /&gt;* Will last a long time&lt;br /&gt;* Does not rust&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;* Expensive&lt;br /&gt;* Very small&lt;br /&gt;* Stiff hinge</li>
            <li> Nose &amp; ear hair is a pain to clip, &amp; ordinary scissors are often painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect for the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple &amp; easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips are carefully rounded, to avoid pinching or wounding.</li>
            <li> Forgot what it was like to have a great pair of Scissors. Very sharp and super easy to clean. Great price</li>
            <li> Its been my experience that scissors of all types stop performing when used for things unintended for those particular scissors.  These are fantastic scissors for facial hairs.  I do use them on my dog as well. They arent intimidating and no sharp ends to gouge any part of me or, like my parts of my dog.  So no injuries to report when grooming.  I use them on my thick goatee and mustache.  As mentioned I use them to trim up doggie.  Use them on his paws around his claws and in between his foot pads, around his eyes when hairs get too long.  They are well made, sharp, light and cut great.  totally recommend</li>
            <li> These are excellent small scissors.  I actually use them to clip the nails of my two young children (I feel I have more control than special-purpose nail trimmers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fit between the two arms of the scissors is very good (snug) so there isn&#x27;t any gap between the blades - the blades are nice and sharp (but I&#x27;m not sure if re-sharpening them is a realistic option due to the small size . . . ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish is nice and won&#x27;t show fingerprints like chrome/plated versions.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. They are very sharp, however they are stiff to open and close. I feel that I don&#x27;t have complete control and could cut myself. I spent much more for these than the drugstore scissors that I prefer. I would not have purchased, had I tried them before buying.</li>
            <li> I use these for trimming my mustache and nose hairs. They are a little small for trimming the rest of my beard. I would give them a 5 star rating, but, while the blades themselves are stainless the screw in the middle is not; I have noticed a little rust around it and now I am more careful to make sure my scissors are dry before I put them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rounded tip is also great, don&#x27;t have to worry about stabbing yourself!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now.  it is made for the face.  I used to nick myself all the time with my old pair,  so I had to sacrifice on quality/ closeness to solve for it.  The unique design of these blades  let&#x27;s me get a much closer and neater trim of my facial hair without nicking myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also,  the blades themselves are very sturdy and haven&#x27;t bent or separated so far</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors for two main reasons. One of the reasons was that they are compact and easy to keep with my electric shaver when grooming to help even out the facial hair. The other reason was the rounded tips to utilize for spots that I&#x27;d otherwise nick myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These scissors are fantastic for getting facial hair cleanly cut when its in small amounts. These scissors are absolutely tiny! As a result, you can&#x27;t really cut much hair at once, so these scissors are only best for mustaches, eyebrows, nose, and ears. For beards, I suggest you use an electric, $20 razor kit with changing heads that lets you groom much more evenly across your facial hair. This thing just isn&#x27;t big enough to do the job. It&#x27;s nonetheless a great buy for convenience if you like to groom very carefully and personally, and the rounded tips ensure no nicks!</li>
            <li> I would call these scissors \\&quot;okay.\\&quot;  They are reasonably sharp and do a good job of trimming nose hairs...when you can coax them into the position where they need to be.  That&#x27;s the tricky part.  The bulbous head on the scissors is a little bigger than the photo would seem to imply, which means that maneuvering it inside a human nose to where it needs to be to effectively cut hair can be a challenge.  While I can certainly understand the scissors not having a sharp, pointed tip, ideally the head should be a little more narrow.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.  Excellent product.  I think they will last a long time.  Would make great stocking stuffers</li>
            <li> Scissors are great....very sharp, easy to hold.  Could be a tad longer in length</li>
            <li> These are really nice - solid metal and good quality manufacture.</li>
            <li> These scissors are sharp and a handy size but a little small for people with big hands. I bought them to store in a pocket of a diabetes monitoring kit and they are a perfect size for that purpose.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; tips make it difficult to cleanly trim. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> I used these scissors for nose hair and felt no painful pulling and tugging!  These scissors are made with extremely high-quality and feel like they will last forever.  The rounded ends of the blades keep them from accidentally stabbing tender tissue.  The reason I did not give them 5 stars is because they are rather thickly made so that I can&#x27;t get very close to the hairs&#x27; roots to cut them close…at all.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about jabbing yourself with this and it also cuts very well. Just don&#x27;t leave it in a pool of water as I accidentally did and it started rusting within a few days.</li>
            <li> These seem well made, have nice action to them, and deliver precise cuts. The rounded tip is OK - it is a bit safer, but also makes the profile larger which can make it harder to use.</li>
            <li> Now I don’t poke my scalp out or above my eyebrows when I snip away. Good for the job!</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase tho its been only a day! Cuts precisely. Attractive as well as useful.</li>
            <li> This is the only item I have ever purchased from Amazon.com and been disappointed with.  (I have placed 24 orders in the last 6 months).  Unfortunately, I found it was junk, after 30 days and could not return it.  These scissors are dull, dull, DULL!  A child&#x27;s school scissors are better quality.  I wouldn&#x27;t give a $1 for them.  This product should be removed from sale by Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend and she is happy with this product so I am also, good quality and price</li>
            <li> I purchased these after going through 2 other scissors for trimming nose hairs. The others would pull and these do not. Stay very sharp, feel solid and live up to there Tweezerman name.</li>
            <li> These were as advertised, I don&#x27;t find them to be flimsy or too small.  (Although I don&#x27;t have large hands or fingers, so if you do then perhaps you should get a bigger one.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these for my nose, and if I had to buy them again, I would probably get the ones with the sharp point instead of the rounded end.  I was concerned about hurting myself with the sharp end, but these scissors are still plenty sharp, so the rounded end isn&#x27;t that much safer. It is, however, a bit more clumsy and hard to control. So I&#x27;d go for the pointy ones next time.</li>
            <li> For the amount of money this item costs, this should be a much more smooth and impressive tool. Unfortunately the mechanism is mediocre and the scissors are quite diminutive. Would not recommend - a dollar store purchase would be more advantageous in the long run.</li>
            <li> Superb product...small but very sharp. Easy to handle very happy with this sizzor. Would reccomend it to anyone trimming all facial hair</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to pay so much for tweezers/scissors... but after opening the package I realized how high quality they were. Definitely seem they will last a long time and I am very impressed!</li>
            <li> Much simpler than the battery powered units and 100 times easier to clean and store.</li>
            <li> They do protect my nasal and ear tissues, but then, it&#x27;s very unlikely that I&#x27;ll get a hair&lt;br /&gt;between its blades, and then far less likely it&#x27;ll cut through that hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as advertised!!!</li>
            <li> These are great. The build quality is great as well. They feel good in your hand and do the job.</li>
            <li> I bought these scissors last summer, but just used them for the first time yesterday.  I have to say, these are the worst nasal hair scissors I&#x27;ve ever had.  Maybe my nose is just too small, but the tips of these are thick and I cannot get a close cut at all. Actually, they were also so dull that very few hairs were cut at all. I wish I&#x27;d tried these when I bought them,  I&#x27;d have returned them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a good set of nasal hair scissors that vanished. I&#x27;m not sure what brand they were, but they were far superior to this product.</li>
            <li> weak, arms of the scissors don&#x27;t close tight, doesn&#x27;t cut well, hair just bends between blades of the scissors. I am not a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;man-sized,&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s important to me. Excellent design, apparently superior quality material, good delivery. The material used may be too thick for some, and certainly unlikely to appeal to the average woman.</li>
            <li> I use the product to trim my mustach and other facial hair.  The blades are sharp and they cut well.  My only complaint is that the finger holes are too small.  Larger finger holes and it is a 5</li>
            <li> mine started rusting after 3 days leaving it in bathroom. I thought it was not supposed to. Use your own judgement.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband who has a beard and mustache.  He specifically asked for these scissors and is very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> These scissors are safe and comfortable. Resistance of the connection makes for slow cutting.Made of a weird composite type of metal. They seem durable enough.overall okay.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman stainless steel facial hair scissor is a nice little scissor, and priced right.  I expected it to be a little bit longer which would have made it somewhat easier to maneuver, however, it&#x27;s very sharp and well suited for trimming facial hairs.  If you plan to use it to trim nostril hair, however, I found it to be a little bit awkward as the rounded tips are too large.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, nice quality, just what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good quality pair of scissors.  It is well built and I got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The simple construction belies the precision that these scissors are made with.  The blades match up perfectly, the cutting edges are very slightly serrated to grip the hairs just before they are cut, and the handles are just the right size.  These will probably last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> The scissors shown in the product listing is made from an extrusion which is then formed into the final shape resulting in a stronger and longer lasting tool. What I received instead was made from a casting which tends to be far inferior to the previous process mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a return was requested from the vendor, a return number was issued together with a shipping label for which postage had to be paid by the customer. If this the direction in which Amazon is headed I guess it&#x27;s time to do my online shopping with eBay.</li>
            <li> Quality of the product is high but the pair I received were not new. There was hair stuck in the oil on the blades. I sanitized them and used them but these were listed as &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These scissors are sturdy. The blunted ends are a plus. But for me, the blade length is too short. As a result, I seldom actually use these -- most of the time I select another pair from my cabinet.</li>
            <li> I can finally trim my unsightly ear hair without worrying about stabbing myself with the pointy manicure scissors I was using. These are very sharp and excellent quality. The only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars is they are slightly larger than I expected, making them a little more difficult to use in my nostrils than would be true if they were a little smaller.</li>
            <li> Finger holes are large enough for a man&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> I bought these to trim the face of my 3lb toy poodle. These have worked amazingly well. The quality seems great, and I can trim very precisely without having to worry about a sharp tip or cutting him. This is a personal must-have!</li>
            <li> Quality product. Fits my fingers and cuts very well.</li>
            <li> Look carefully at the size and dimensions of this scissors. Its larger than you think and is fine for trimming a beard but too big for your ears or nose hairs (which is gross but I have to tell the truth).  I wish I had bought a smaller one and you have to rip the packaging apart to get to the scissors.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I was expecting. The sub-nose shape is too big for some applications.</li>
            <li> Facial hair is no fun and these scissors really do the trick.  No painfully plucking with tweezers anymore!  The rounded tip provide security from self-mutilation (also painful!) and the blades work well.  You will find yourself asking yourself why you waited so long after trying these affordable, well made scissors.</li>
            <li> i actually bought these for my dog (a 6 lb Yorkie terrier) and i like it. I trim the hairs around his face, especially the eyes, and it&#x27;s sharp enough that i can cut fast (which is important--he&#x27;s very squiggly) and safe because of the rounded tips i&#x27;m not afraid of poking his eye out. I definitely recommend this to small pet owners.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Blades are sharp. Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Get the job done.  Rounded tips key.</li>
            <li> We purchased three pair of safety scissors to help keep our teacup poodle hair around her eyes trimmed. The Tweezerman pair cut very good and are safe for their use. The extra pairs are for our senior minds when we cannot remember where we put those scissors. Thank you for your service and for good products. Larry.</li>
            <li> After 1 use, I can say they are easy to use, are sharp enough to work well, and they have a masculine, antique brushed pewter color.</li>
            <li> You wont poke yourself with these. The tip is well rounded.</li>
            <li> I can tell these scissors are well made.  They are sharp, made of strong metal, and manufactured in italy.  I have big hands, but my fingers can still fit in the handles and easily operate the scissors.  My only complaint is that the actual scissor part is a little thicker than what I would consider ideal for my nostrils!  Otherwise, great product.</li>
            <li> Pin in the middle isn&#x27;t stainless. Find a solution to this, and you&#x27;ve got yourself a great pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> These are some really nice scissors; much better than I expected. The two blades are very well attached so you don&#x27;t get any rattling or uneven closings. The rounded tips are a nice touch, and the metal is a very  \\&quot;lackluster\\&quot; non glossy shade which I personally like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, these scissors are high quality and they just work.</li>
            <li> These small but useful scissors are sharp, stay sharp, neither rust nor loosen and have a useful blunted tip so you do not make your spouse angry by accidentally poking or cutting your dog or cat when trimming their clumped fur</li>
