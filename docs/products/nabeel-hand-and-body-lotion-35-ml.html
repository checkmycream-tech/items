            <li>First trail of this kind of bakhoor.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>This is my first time burning this particular kind of incense.</li>
            <li>I was glad to be able to try it (only one package) instead of having to buy a bunch.  </li>
            <li>Al-Rehab ships quickly.  </li>
            <li>This one is my favorite so far of the Bakhoor by Nabeel.</li>
            <li>The scent is soft and it&#x27;s lovely to burn.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the ritual of burning incense, and  Bakhoor is an entirely new smell for me.</li>
            <li>you very much.</li>
            <li>When I burn just a little bit and let the smoke diffuse throughout the house, it reminds me of stepping into a large church service where everyone is dressed in their best, and smelling the mingling of all the various perfumes, colognes and aftershaves.  </li>
            <li>exactly  like what we have in gulf countries ...</li>
            <li>Will buy more from this same seller when I run out.  </li>
            <li>I found this a little stronger than another brand from the same company (Mulham), but still very good.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li>I look forward to using it real soon.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very lite and not overbearing.</li>
            <li>the packages arrived so fast.  </li>
            <li>With &amp;#34;Touch Me&amp;#34; less is more.  </li>
            <li>Definitely less earthy, and more perfumed then what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you&#x27;ve never used Arabian incense.</li>
            <li>Everyone speaks highly of this incense on YouTube.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong as other kinds of bakhoor.</li>
            <li>I normally burn Nag Champa or Pinon Pine incense.</li>

            <li>But I really like it, and look forward to trying different kinds.  </li>
            <li>A soft scent that lingers and instantly lifts the mood.</li>
            <li>I find that if I burn very much at once, or burn it in a small enclosed space, the fragrance becomes overpowering.  </li>
            <li>crazy about Nabeel&#x27;s product especially touch me products they are amazing</li>

            <li> I am in love with this Bakhoor!  Wow!</li>
            <li> The smell of this thing is so awesome!!!  There is little to no smoke.  I plan to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Superb incense with a delicious scent. Woods, amber, musk, sandalwod, and other scents that approach floral notes. A soft scent that lingers and instantly lifts the mood. The incense itself is concentrated, a little on some charcoal will do the trick. Highly recommended if you&#x27;ve never used Arabian incense.</li>
            <li> This is a complex, multi-layered fragrance, quite different from the regular incense. I found this a little stronger than another brand from the same company (Mulham), but still very good. The name on the package is &#x27;Nabeel&#x27; and there is a pamphlet in the package saying that &#x27;Touch Me&#x27; is now called &#x27;Nabeel,&#x27; so the seller may as well change it on the site.</li>
            <li> This scent brings me back to Dubai.  That&#x27;s about 90% of the reason I love it.  I chose the form because there&#x27;s either no smoke or so little smoke that you cannot actually see it or anything.</li>
            <li> Smells great! It&#x27;s very small but you don&#x27;t need much at all. 👍🏼 Looks like chocolate! 😋</li>
            <li> I like the smell . I use to make my house and clothes smell good. Even after shower I use to perfume my hair and body .</li>
            <li> Everyone speaks highly of this incense on YouTube.  I was glad to be able to try it (only one package) instead of having to buy a bunch.  It smells good.  I just ordered the burner (I couldn&#x27;t locate mine so I have to buy another one).  I look forward to using it real soon.  Al-Rehab ships quickly.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Too small pieces of bakhoor</li>
            <li> beautiful fragrance.  I hate paying more for s&amp;h than product</li>
            <li> Smells like a home permanent!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice smelling Bakhoor, the smell also lasts a while once you are done burning it. The smell is very lite and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bakhoor Touch Me was good experience for me and my brothers. For any who want a good bakhoor I advice you to bay it.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!!!!  Great for smoking hair and clothes in the closet!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and smells amazing. I got some really expensive bakhoor from Dubai and this still beats it! Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> We love Bakhoor!  I am so pleased with Nabeel&#x27;s services.  This is my second, but certainly not last, order and both times the packages arrived so fast.  I was literally surprised!  This time, I also ordered the Bakhoor perfume oil.......oh my goodness!  Great!  Just Great!  The oil served well in my oil burner and on me.  I&#x27;m so grateful and so pleased!  Thanks Nabeel Perfumes, please continue with your superior services and pleasEEE keep the good things coming :-).</li>
            <li> crazy about Nabeel&#x27;s product especially touch me products they are amazing</li>
            <li> With &amp;#34;Touch Me&amp;#34; less is more.  I find that if I burn very much at once, or burn it in a small enclosed space, the fragrance becomes overpowering.  BUT-! When I burn just a little bit and let the smoke diffuse throughout the house, it reminds me of stepping into a large church service where everyone is dressed in their best, and smelling the mingling of all the various perfumes, colognes and aftershaves.  Very soothing, with happy associations for me.  A quality product.</li>
            <li> First trail of this kind of bakhoor.&lt;br /&gt;Very delighted with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Great smell and orginal product exactly  like what we have in gulf countries ...</li>
            <li> Very warm and beautiful scent. A little goes a long way. Not too strong as other kinds of bakhoor. Recommend!</li>
            <li> Great scent at a great price.  Will buy more Great scent at a great price.  Will buy more from this same seller when I run out.  Would recommend to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that I will find this al bakhoor in amazon bcoz my sister had this one when we were in the midle east ,same product by Nabeel perfumes . Realy nice smell. I loved it.</li>
            <li> Very good product, smells nice and last longer</li>
            <li> This one is my favorite so far of the Bakhoor by Nabeel. The scent is soft and it&#x27;s lovely to burn. They also delivered in a timely manor. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> its just as home smell</li>
            <li> I love this incense !!! Love, Love, Love !!! I also have the perfume &#x27;&#x27; Touch Me &#x27;&#x27; (which I love too). It brings a nice smell to the room and you don&#x27;t have to let it burn for a long time. I strongly recomand it !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guylaine from Canada</li>
            <li> Really happy with seller and the amount of Bakhoor I received. This is my first time burning this particular kind of incense. I normally burn Nag Champa or Pinon Pine incense. I enjoy the ritual of burning incense, and  Bakhoor is an entirely new smell for me. Definitely less earthy, and more perfumed then what I&#x27;m used to. But I really like it, and look forward to trying different kinds.  Happy with my purchase, and would highly recommend this seller.</li>
