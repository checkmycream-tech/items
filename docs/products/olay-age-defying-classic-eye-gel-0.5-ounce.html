            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Two or three days after I used this eye gel once at night, both my eyes look more puffy and tired-looking.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know for sure if it&#x27;s erasing any fine lines.</li>
            <li>and yes; I am an aging gay man.</li>
            <li>After just 2 days of use you couldn&#x27;t even see any fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This gel goes on smoothly and then disappears without making my eye makeup bleed onto it as creamier eye preparations do.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my eye area smooth and cool.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with my order, exactly what I ordered..will order again..</li>
            <li>I am 42 and this product works great for getting rid of puffiness and dry skin under my eyes and my eyelids.</li>
            <li>I love applying it in the morning and have really come to appreciate the cooling feeling.​</li>
            <li>This gel makes goes on cool and makes the skin tingle.</li>
            <li>It felt cool to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shiny and does not get absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizes under the eye and softens any fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I smile often and it minimizes crows feet.</li>
            <li>It is worth trying.</li>
            <li>:) It&#x27;s not going to eliminate the wrinkles completely and at some point in time I&#x27;m going to lose the battle, but between now</li>
            <li>The price was right and It came pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li>For an added treat, put it in the fridge for an extra refreshing feel.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this.  </li>
            <li>I am very sory Olay</li>
            <li>I hope they never get crazy and discontinue this marvelous idea.</li>
            <li>This really tightens and firms.</li>

            <li>it really hydrates under your eyes..</li>
            <li>I really like this eye cream.</li>
            <li>My skin is totally smooth when I wake up after it being dry and itchy before going to sleep.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles now, but I certainly don&#x27;t want intense wrinkles, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>A total waste of money (though it&#x27;s pretty cheap).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet but decided since I&#x27;m in my early 30</li>
            <li>The skin under my eyes does feel baby soft and moist</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen it as low as $8 and as high as $41.</li>

            <li> If you use this as directions say, and use it daily of every few days it really tightens up your eyes. A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for fifteen years now. I love it. I will always use this product...and yes; I am an aging gay man. It works! I smile often and it minimizes crows feet. Score!</li>
            <li> I use this on my intire face in the afternoon when I start to feel dry.  I am very sory Olay has discontinued this item.. Glad to find it on Amazon since it is not in the retail stores any more</li>
            <li> thats all you need---best for the price on the market</li>
            <li> My friend gave me a tip to start using eye cream now since it would be harder to control wrinkles later on in life. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles now, but I certainly don&#x27;t want intense wrinkles, especially around my eyes. I love applying it in the morning and have really come to appreciate the cooling feeling.​</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff made for around the eyes.  It firms the area and does not get a lotion film in your eyes because it is a water based gel.  I hope they never get crazy and discontinue this marvelous idea.</li>
            <li> This is so great. I love it. After just 2 days of use you couldn&#x27;t even see any fine lines around my eyes. My eyes feels great too. This really tightens and firms. I keep mine in the fridge for a really good cooling effect. Love it!</li>
            <li> Too bad this is not sold in my stores anymore.It is worth trying.</li>
            <li> Lotion isn&#x27;t thick, it is runny almost watery. Did not reduce wrinkles. And I didn&#x27;t notice any less eye darkness .</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years now.  I&#x27;m over 50 and have no crows feet.  I use just a dot all around my eyes after cleansing my face.  It lasts for months and costs less than $10.  It reduces wrinkles and puffiness and diminishes dark circles.  It makes my eyes feel great, like a drink for my eyes.</li>
            <li> So happy to get it again!!!  I love this product and was so unhappy when I could not get it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not able to use creams on my eyelids due to severe itching and sensitivity and this is the only product I have found that does not cause problems. Its not oily, very lightweight and no perfumy smell. I just use a dab over each eyelid up to my eyebrow.  I feel that is reduces the wrinkles and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly for me and I will continue to use!</li>
            <li> This gel goes on smoothly and then disappears without making my eye makeup bleed onto it as creamier eye preparations do.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and love it.  Especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The only brand I use!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, it just absorbs so much better than cream and just works beautifully overnight to make you look refreshed.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money (though it&#x27;s pretty cheap). I don&#x27;t know what the rave with this eye gel is all about. The gel is quite thick and hard to spread. It&#x27;s shiny and does not get absorbed quickly. Two or three days after I used this eye gel once at night, both my eyes look more puffy and tired-looking. An, for an unknown reason, my eyes are rheum-filled each morning when I woke up after using this. Disgusting.</li>
            <li> disappointed because I wanted the eye gel and I got a cream.  Didn&#x27;t bother sending it back because it was too much trouble.</li>
            <li> uSED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 10 years now. If you apply it everyday or every other day (depending on your wrinkles and age) it will smooth them out a little and make them look less noticeable. This is the only product that works for me. I&#x27;ve actually applied it in the morning and by afternoon can see results. But that was in my 40&#x27;s. Now that in my 50&#x27;s it takes longer to work and I have to apply it everyday. :) It&#x27;s not going to eliminate the wrinkles completely and at some point in time I&#x27;m going to lose the battle, but between now and then I&#x27;ll keep using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note the price can vary widely. I&#x27;ve seen it as low as $8 and as high as $41. So shop wisely. :)</li>
            <li> this eye gel is the BEST i have ever found..can&#x27;t find it in stores like i used to...but found it here on line..it really hydrates under your eyes..i put it under my eyes and all around for night!!!!</li>
            <li> I am 42 and this product works great for getting rid of puffiness and dry skin under my eyes and my eyelids. My skin is totally smooth when I wake up after it being dry and itchy before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My eyes look &amp; feel amazing when I use this product.</li>
            <li> I used the product for a couple months with no noticeable change.  I&#x27;m also not a big fan of the texture.</li>
            <li> helps with the dark circles and the puffiness......if used daily it also seems to tighten the skin under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I like this eye gel a lot. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet but decided since I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s that it&#x27;s time to start using eye cream sooner than later. This gel makes goes on cool and makes the skin tingle. For an added treat, put it in the fridge for an extra refreshing feel. The skin under my eyes does feel baby soft and moist but I don&#x27;t know for sure if it&#x27;s erasing any fine lines. The price was right and It came pretty quickly too. I will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> I like this item.  Not being carried in the store, so had to order on line.</li>
            <li> This gel is great!!  Really moisturizes under the eye and softens any fine lines.  Have been using it for while and love it!</li>
            <li> Love! Keeps my eye area smooth and cool. Does not irritate my eyes and helps my under eye concealer go on. I use morning and night.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream. Using it every night has help hide any wrinkles .have been using for quite a few years now and it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with my order, exactly what I ordered..will order again..</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this.  I forgot about it and one day when my eyes felt dry puffy and tired.  I tried it.  It was shockly awesome.  It felt cool to the touch.  The puffiness and the tiredness went away.  The lines were noticeble deminshing as well.  It is a great product.</li>
