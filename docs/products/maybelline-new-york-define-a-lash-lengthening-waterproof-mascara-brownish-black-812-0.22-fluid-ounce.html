    <ol>
            <li>This is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>This mascara works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always searching for the best mascara ever invented.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect example of not having to spend a fortune to get the best.</li>
            <li>Price was great - and it shipped on tme.  </li>
            <li>and this mascara works great.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have a lot of&lt;br /&gt;lashes and am extremely happy with the product.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great lengthening (not volumizing)</li>
            <li>Happy with this mascara.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like most &amp;#34;reasonable&amp;#34; tube mascaras you buy nowadays--the brush just isn&#x27;t very good, makes the stuff clump.</li>
            <li>Again, this is not my ideal product, but it works fairly well for me--for now. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, the mascara looks good and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Really good</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>My lashes look nice and not clumpy.</li>
            <li>Goes on  nicely.</li>
            <li>The mascara looks nice once applied</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve come across thus far. . .  </li>
            <li>love this item can&#x27;t find any color but &amp;#34;very black&amp;#34; in stores.</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ll admit it--</li>
            <li>this mascara probably most closely compares to [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The rest of my lashes look fabulous though!</li>
            <li>It gives me even more length and definition.</li>
            <li>brush is too flexible but otherwise ok</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t be seeking better, anytime soon.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, but I believe Maybelline has discontinued this product.  </li>
            <li>These were ok.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>maybe I should try to add more and see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>I feel the brush needs to have more support</li>
            <li>For the price, this is ok..</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years</li>
            <li>I found it on line and bought as many as I could get -</li>
            <li>I must say this one comes closer to being perfect more than any other I have used.</li>
            <li>Need mascara and this item came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Waterproof, easy to apply, stays put until I take it off.  </li>
            <li>need special chemicals to remove it from your eyes and this is something we want to avoid, we prefer water :)</li>
            <li>I thought by now, Maybelline may have advanced their products, and I was intrigued by the unique brush shape, which is supposed to be curved to better fit the lash line</li>
            <li>But, this product is no longer available in stores</li>
            <li>mascara, this is a great one for a low price.</li>
            <li>great lasting product and will not run in water or in the shower.</li>
            <li>It  was such  a great price I should have purchased two.</li>
            <li>I liked that there was fast shipping</li>
            <li>Minor inconvenience when you take into consideration the great result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do think that once you get the hang of how to control the brush, its pretty ok..</li>
            <li>I like this mascara in the dark brown because it&#x27;s great for an easy, non-hassle daytime look.</li>
            <li>About ready to order more.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the only mascara products I have purchased that looks good and stays put.</li>
            <li>This one keeps my lashes softer, but it still washes away pretty easily with my allergies.  </li>
            <li>It smudges pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Although this is definitely not the best mascara most people have in mind when looking for the perfect one (length, volume, clump-free, holds curls, non-smudging/transfering), I really like this mascara for day wear, because it is very casual and natural-looking.</li>
            <li>The best lengthening mascara EVER!&lt;br /&gt;- Allows for layering, without serious clumping.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It gets clumpy and dries up quickly.</li>
            <li>I have more than once been in a rush and had the brush not go into the tube smoothly and snap back, spraying mascara all over my shirt.  </li>
            <li>My favorite CG so far has been [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I think this has become one of my favorite mascaras I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>I just quickly add this on in the morning on top of my light daytime makeup, and I&#x27;m out the door, looking put-together, but not too harsh.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect too much from this, but was very surprised, and delighted with the performance of this mascara, and at a low price!</li>
            <li>it was so easy to apply and it dry fast ,your eye lashes dont go down it beautiful just what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous mascaras over the years and the ones that I fall in love with always seem to get discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I first used my sister&#x27;s when I was in labor with my daughter.  </li>
            <li>After trying every conceivable mascara out there (from the very expensive to the very cheap), this is the closest I have found to perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>I was also attracted to the tube, as green is my favorite color!).  </li>
            <li>I generally use 3 coats (it&#x27;s important to not let the coats dry in between applications) and use a fine tooth lash comb in between coats.  </li>
            <li>They really do come out beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lengthens really well, is clump-free, and does not smudge.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara a lot.</li>
            <li>The wand is flimsy and it didn&#x27;t really lengthen my lashes.</li>
            <li>It is a Very god price too I think.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide as much length or volume as I&#x27;d like it to, but I&#x27;ve also just been applying one or two coats...</li>
            <li>It stays really well and is def waterproof.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara...</li>
            <li>but I dont like the brush too much.</li>
            <li>The end of the wand (the part you touch your lashes with) is a bit flimsy, but as long as you&#x27;re gentle, it should be fine.</li>
            <li>I love the black I bought at the store.</li>
            <li>I am constantly buying new ones in hopes of finding the perfect product for making my sparse, thin lashes look long, full, and lush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Define-a-Lash since the Sky High formulation was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>Maybelline Waterproof Full &#x27;n Soft - 313 Dark Brown]] was my go-to product for awhile, more recent, I have been on a Cover Girl kick.  </li>
            <li>quick to apply, leaves a fairly natural effect, goes on pretty smoothly (not very clumpy)  </li>
            <li>I find that the full drama mascaras with great volume, length, etc. are a bit too much for me for everyday, and is usually a lot harder to remove at night, while this removes really well.</li>
            <li>I can live with that.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mascara (Brownish Black) because I was searching for a cheap one that still worked.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash off with loreal eye mak up remover in the green bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair complected and black is too harsh</li>
            <li>If I take the time to apply several coats (the instructions say not to let the product dry between coats), I do get a significant lengthening effect.  </li>
            <li>only con that I can think of is the the brush portion of the wand is VERY flexible.  </li>
            <li>I should not have been surprised.</li>
            <li>[do I mention here, that I&#x27;m 67 yrs young ?]</li>
            <li>I can attest that it really makes a big difference in her makeup ensemble.</li>
            <li>One that is the full package in the darkest black for full drama, and this one, which I use for daytime / everyday.</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend it high enough!</li>
            <li>twice as long and really does define them.</li>
            <li>You really have to take your time and be careful when you do this.  </li>

            <li>Exact Eyelights Mascara - Black Pearl]]</li>
            <li>Exact Eyelights Mascara - Black Pearl]] in formulation and application.  </li>
            <li>I have thinning lashes due to my age and this mascara makes them look much longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, but you don&#x27;t have to put several coats on to get a long lash look.</li>

            <li> Cover Girl Lash Exact Mascara - Black Brown]]</li>
            <li> Exact Eyelights Mascara - Black Pearl]]</li>
            <li> Exact Eyelights Mascara - Black Pearl]] in formulation and application.  </li>
            <li> I have thinning lashes due to my age and this mascara makes them look much longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> Not heavy, but you don&#x27;t have to put several coats on to get a long lash look.</li>
            <li> The big plus - it comes in Brownish Black - less harsh with fair complexions than Black.</li>
            <li> So, I ordered a new waterproof mascara from the same company--it came quite hydrated--with a note telling me that if an order were dried up I should have told them and had the price refunded.  </li>
            <li> I have big eyes and long eyelashes</li>
            <li> For some odd reason this one&#x27;s wand/brush is flimsy and if I&#x27;m not careful putting it back in the bottle it bends and gets all over.</li>
            <li> Decent but does not make my eyelashes quite thick enough.  </li>
            <li> Brush is really flimsy and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I do like the mascara enough though that I have just learned to take my time and be careful...</li>
            <li> and it is minor</li>
            <li> I have a good deal of lashes, but they are not as long as I would wish them to be and so stiff they are almost impossible to curl.</li>
            <li> However, like the CG Exact Eyelights, I find the longish wand a bit difficult to work with, especially when applying the mascara to my left eye (I&#x27;m right-handed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was dry from the get go.</li>
            <li> I have long dark lashes.  </li>
            <li> Not very waterproof.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love this item can&#x27;t find any color but &amp;#34;very black&amp;#34; in stores. I&#x27;m fair complected and black is too harsh</li>
            <li> The wand is so flimsy and thin that it flings mascara all over you when you pull it in or out, unless you are super slow.  It gloops all over my lashes, too, and it calls itself brownish-black but it&#x27;s blacker than half of my black mascaras.  I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Hate it it&#x27;s make my lashes stick together and no length nor thickness is added</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous mascaras over the years and the ones that I fall in love with always seem to get discontinued.  For at least 4 years, I have been trying to replace Revlon ColorStay Lash Tint.  After trying every conceivable mascara out there (from the very expensive to the very cheap), this is the closest I have found to perfect for me.  I have long dark lashes.  I curl them and I want a mascara that will a) help hold the curl, b) define the lashes and c) lengthen the lashes.  This mascara did all of the above.  I generally use 3 coats (it&#x27;s important to not let the coats dry in between applications) and use a fine tooth lash comb in between coats.  They really do come out beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con that I can think of is the the brush portion of the wand is VERY flexible.  I can&#x27;t say for certain if the flexibility helps with the functionality of the mascara, but it does make it quite difficult to reinsert into the tube.  You really have to take your time and be careful when you do this.  I have more than once been in a rush and had the brush not go into the tube smoothly and snap back, spraying mascara all over my shirt.  I do like the mascara enough though that I have just learned to take my time and be careful...I can live with that.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Does not smear.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ll admit it--I think I have a mascara addiction!  I am constantly buying new ones in hopes of finding the perfect product for making my sparse, thin lashes look long, full, and lush.  Although Maybelline&#x27;s [[ASIN:B000VB9YEQ Maybelline Waterproof Full &#x27;n Soft - 313 Dark Brown]] was my go-to product for awhile, more recent, I have been on a Cover Girl kick.  My favorite CG so far has been [[ASIN:B001ESN2M0 Cover Girl Lash Exact Mascara - Black Brown]], but since that one still wasn&#x27;t my holy grail, I&#x27;ve also tried [[ASIN:B002PRQJCE CoverGirl Lash Blast Length Mascara - Black/ Brown]], [[ASIN:B001BMJPD4 Cover Girl Lash Blast Waterproof Mascara - Very Black]], and [[ASIN:B001PO2VA2 Cover Girl Exact Eyelights Mascara - Black Pearl]], all of which came up short in one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, on a recent trip to Ulta, I decided to go back to Maybelline.  I thought by now, Maybelline may have advanced their products, and I was intrigued by the unique brush shape, which is supposed to be curved to better fit the lash line (another confession:  I was also attracted to the tube, as green is my favorite color!).  So, here&#x27;s what I found:  this mascara probably most closely compares to [[ASIN:B001PO2VA2 Cover Girl Exact Eyelights Mascara - Black Pearl]] in formulation and application.  If I take the time to apply several coats (the instructions say not to let the product dry between coats), I do get a significant lengthening effect.  However, like the CG Exact Eyelights, I find the longish wand a bit difficult to work with, especially when applying the mascara to my left eye (I&#x27;m right-handed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the mascara looks good and lasts all day.  Again, this is not my ideal product, but it works fairly well for me--for now. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using for years.  With a pool, I like waterproof.  I could not find the color I wanted in the stores.  Price was great - and it shipped on tme.  About ready to order more.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have thinning lashes due to my age and this mascara makes them look much longer and fuller. I will order another one when this one is gone.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the brush with this mascara.  It was hard to put mascara on the little lashes at the inside and outside corners of my eyes and also the lower lashes.  The mascara also clumped on my lashes.  The brush did not seem to separate my lashes.  The mascara also smudged under my eyes within an hour after I applied it.  It continued to smudge even after I wiped the smudges off.  I will not buy this mascara again.</li>
            <li> Need mascara and this item came very quickly.  The only think I don&#x27;t like is the brush is flimzie! I may try one of my other brushes.</li>
            <li> I have very watery eyes, so its hard for me to find a mascara that has staying power in the corners without making my lashes hard &amp; brittle.  This one keeps my lashes softer, but it still washes away pretty easily with my allergies.  I haven&#x27;t found one yet that won&#x27;t.  The rest of my lashes look fabulous though!</li>
            <li> I have big eyes and long eyelashes and this mascara works great. It gives me even more length and definition.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect too much from this, but was very surprised, and delighted with the performance of this mascara, and at a low price!</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this product, but by miss-tack we didn&#x27;t notice that it is waterproof, the packages are very alike.&lt;br /&gt;There for my wife was disappointing at the end and she is not using it because it is a nightmare to remove the product in the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;You need special chemicals to remove it from your eyes and this is something we want to avoid, we prefer water :)</li>
            <li> Decent but does not make my eyelashes quite thick enough.  So I use it after I put on another mascara to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only mascara products I have purchased that looks good and stays put. I often have issues with waterproof mascara smudging under the eye, but not with this one.</li>
            <li> I ordered just this product as it literally was in my arsenal of &amp;#34;products that I can wear and that won&#x27;t budge until I use a product to take it off&amp;#34;. I even went swimming in a chlorinated pool---lots of times---and it stayed on. But, this product is no longer available in stores so I thought &amp;#34;what a deal!&amp;#34; But it was not. It was dry from the get go. I know that the product probably sat in a warehouse for a while, so I should not have been surprised. So, I ordered a new waterproof mascara from the same company--it came quite hydrated--with a note telling me that if an order were dried up I should have told them and had the price refunded.  I will do just that. I bought  some other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Define-a-Lash since the Sky High formulation was discontinued.  Waterproof, easy to apply, stays put until I take it off.  The big plus - it comes in Brownish Black - less harsh with fair complexions than Black.</li>
            <li> Actually makes my lashes defined and longer! Don&#x27;t have a lot of&lt;br /&gt;lashes and am extremely happy with the product. Makes my lashes&lt;br /&gt;Look twice as long and really does define them. Really good price.&lt;br /&gt;Normally 8+ at stores. Will be buying this again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I have a good deal of lashes, but they are not as long as I would wish them to be and so stiff they are almost impossible to curl. I have tried a lot of mascaras, both grocery as well as department store brands, and found that Maybelline Define-A-Lash actually DOES WHAT IT PROMISSES and then some!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Lengthens! A LOT! The best lengthening mascara EVER!&lt;br /&gt;- Allows for layering, without serious clumping.&lt;br /&gt;- Curls up the lashes while it lengthens.&lt;br /&gt;- Even the NON-waterproof version stays put; the longest I wore it was about 14 hours; the mascara did not transfer onto skin (YEY!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Only one and it is minor: the applicator brush has short spikes. They make it difficult to brush thru the lash. However, I have a separate lash brush that does the job. Minor inconvenience when you take into consideration the great result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Define-A-Lash mascara is a rarity amongst beauty products, as it actually delivers the result it promises. I cannot recommend it high enough!</li>
            <li> Nice. Not heavy, but you don&#x27;t have to put several coats on to get a long lash look. Separates the lashes well.</li>
            <li> Although this is definitely not the best mascara most people have in mind when looking for the perfect one (length, volume, clump-free, holds curls, non-smudging/transfering), I really like this mascara for day wear, because it is very casual and natural-looking. I have 2 mascaras. One that is the full package in the darkest black for full drama, and this one, which I use for daytime / everyday. This lengthens really well, is clump-free, and does not smudge. However, it is not a volume mascara (at all), nor does it hold curls too well throughout the day). I like this mascara in the dark brown because it&#x27;s great for an easy, non-hassle daytime look. I just quickly add this on in the morning on top of my light daytime makeup, and I&#x27;m out the door, looking put-together, but not too harsh. I find that the full drama mascaras with great volume, length, etc. are a bit too much for me for everyday, and is usually a lot harder to remove at night, while this removes really well. If you are looking for a great lengthening (not volumizing) mascara, this is a great one for a low price.</li>
            <li> Happy with this mascara.  It arrived on time and was as described - thank you!</li>
            <li> I ordered by mistake... wanted the regular not waterproof. Waterproof does not go on as well and if I happen to get some in my eye, I have problems all day...</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I had to get used to the flexible brush, but after a time or two, it was no problem.  I really like this mascara a lot.</li>
            <li> brush is too flexible but otherwise ok</li>
            <li> The wand is too flimsy and almost breaks off when you pull it out of its case. Plus it&#x27;s difficult to apply for the same reason, and I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference in lash length after using it.</li>
            <li> I did not care for the results I received when using the product.  The wand is flimsy and it didn&#x27;t really lengthen my lashes.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve come across thus far. . .  [do I mention here, that I&#x27;m 67 yrs young ?] Won&#x27;t be seeking better, anytime soon.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it ~</li>
            <li> I hate it :( My eyelashes clump together if I use this and the brush is so flexible that it&#x27;s awkward to hold and use. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This mascara is all I hoped for. It lengthens my lashes, doesn&#x27;t clump and darkens them without looking harsh. And it arrived on time like everything I ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I believe Maybelline has discontinued this product.  My lashes look nice and not clumpy.</li>
            <li> great lasting product and will not run in water or in the shower. It is a Very god price too I think.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. Goes on  nicely. No clunks..will purchase  again. It  was such  a great price I should have purchased two.</li>
            <li> These were ok. I liked that there was fast shipping though.&lt;br /&gt;I received two products...one of them was already open but I just tossed it.&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful that I bought two. I did not bother to return the other product because to me it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;always such a hassle to return online items. It&#x27;s not worth my time and effort.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I first used my sister&#x27;s when I was in labor with my daughter.  I stayed on throughout the labor and delivery and into the next day.</li>
            <li> goes on well, doesnt clump. stays on when i swim.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this stuff in the stores anymore so I will be sad when it&#x27;s all gone.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara (Brownish Black) because I was searching for a cheap one that still worked. I think this has become one of my favorite mascaras I&#x27;ve tried so far.  Pros: Inexpensive, easy/quick to apply, leaves a fairly natural effect, goes on pretty smoothly (not very clumpy)  Cons: The end of the wand (the part you touch your lashes with) is a bit flimsy, but as long as you&#x27;re gentle, it should be fine. It doesn&#x27;t provide as much length or volume as I&#x27;d like it to, but I&#x27;ve also just been applying one or two coats... maybe I should try to add more and see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I already had this mascara before purchasing this one. I love the black I bought at the store. For some odd reason this one&#x27;s wand/brush is flimsy and if I&#x27;m not careful putting it back in the bottle it bends and gets all over. I do like the product as it doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle in a big gob I have to wipe off before applying. It stays really well and is def waterproof. Comes off a little hard (I think that&#x27;s the point of WP tho) will keep buying.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara...Easy to wash off with loreal eye mak up remover in the green bottle. Definately defines and lenghens</li>
            <li> Love this.  It is my favorite mascara.  AM so sorry it is not sold in stores, but thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not very waterproof. It smudges pretty easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like most &amp;#34;reasonable&amp;#34; tube mascaras you buy nowadays--the brush just isn&#x27;t very good, makes the stuff clump. Hard to separate the lashes with this brush.</li>
            <li> Quality is as expected.</li>
            <li> This mascara recently died (sniff) but I shall be reordering. It stays on through thick and thin and minimal clumps.</li>
            <li> it was so easy to apply and it dry fast ,your eye lashes dont go down it beautiful just what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for several years now. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and don&#x27;t want the volume of the younger girls, I just want lengthening. This mascara works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and it was good--not clumpy. We&#x27;ll see over time how it holds up in the tube now that it has been opened. I find that mascara doesn&#x27;t hold up well once opened. It gets clumpy and dries up quickly. It was definitely waterproof and not flaky.</li>
            <li> The mascara looks nice once applied but I dont like the brush too much. I do think that once you get the hang of how to control the brush, its pretty ok.. I feel the brush needs to have more support though.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara does make your lashes feel hard and uncomfortable sometimes but I guess thats what happens to me, not sure if thats the case with everyone.. I prefer other mascaras as compared to this one. For the price, this is ok..</li>
            <li> Reordered this. Cannot find &amp;#34;brown-black&amp;#34; anywhere. Maybelline is discounting it but I don&#x27;t want to switch yet to what&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always searching for the best mascara ever invented. I must say this one comes closer to being perfect more than any other I have used. It&#x27;s the perfect example of not having to spend a fortune to get the best. It is waterproof, and the brush does keep your eyelashes separated. The tip of the brush coats and separates the inside and outside corner lashes. I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and now I cannot find it in stores anywhere.  I found it on line and bought as many as I could get - I hope this products is not being discontinued !!!</li>
            <li> Brush is really flimsy and hard to use. Not as bad once you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding mascara that I like and that makes a difference in my eyes....but with this I think I have found a keeper.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife. She loves that it is offered in a very dark brown. I can attest that it really makes a big difference in her makeup ensemble. Quite noticeable.</li>
