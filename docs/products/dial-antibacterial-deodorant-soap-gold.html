            <li>but I was impressed.</li>
            <li>The soap very good.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>

            <li>and I think it&#x27;s a great antibacterial soap.</li>
            <li>8 pack is a great buy.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, wonderful deal.</li>
            <li>but I use the liquid body wash, so that is great as well.</li>
            <li>The menfolk don&#x27;t wrinkle their noses at the smell as &#x27;too girly&#x27; LOL</li>
            <li>Nice product!</li>
            <li>Lathers up good  smells  great</li>

            <li>this is a good bar of soap.</li>
            <li>I like this soap because it makes my bathroom smell good</li>
            <li>Good job</li>
            <li>Dial soap is a good brand.</li>
            <li>it smells amazing, it&#x27;s anti-bacterial for us athletic types, and this was a good value.</li>
            <li>works and smells nice shipped and packed good</li>
            <li>LOVE THE SMELL PRICE GOOD DELIVERY GOOD</li>
            <li>Rather than being a nice even rectangle, this soap has a curved surface on one side.  </li>
            <li>is by far the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so amazed that the current keepers of a formerly great brand could be so recklesss in their quest to cheat us that have tainted a 30 year great brand.</li>
            <li>My husband &amp; I love this soap.</li>
            <li>what more can I say.</li>
            <li>After receiving it and trying it, we are satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this soap for years, and my husband and i both love it.  </li>
            <li>:) this is my favorite fragrant soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soap what more do you want?</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap.  </li>
            <li>love the smell of this soap.</li>
            <li>a gift for my brother I love him</li>
            <li>As a bar soap goes I don&#x27;t think it gets better then</li>
            <li>I received my package in a timely manner and the package was nice and clean just like</li>
            <li>Pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>I alternate between Dial and Safeguard, and like both of them, but this was cheaper and the free add-on shipping was great!</li>
            <li>It was what i expected at an excellent price.</li>
            <li>A prefer a deodarant soap with a nice fragrance and which leaves me with a clean, fresh, confident feeling all day.</li>
            <li>I wanted something cheap that works and this stuff fit the bill better than anything else.</li>
            <li>Can use easily and for lots of cleaning purposes.</li>
            <li>We had not tried this product before and were hoping that the scent was not too strong.  </li>
            <li>Possibly even great for those with acne as I do</li>
            <li>Jusr love the scent and as it named  FRESH.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant deodorant scent and produces rich lather and leaves my skin feeling clean, but not dried out.</li>
            <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t all that great, but it definitely passes the test of leaving me feeling clean, fresh and confident.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean, I wasn&#x27;t sure as to what this product would smell or feel like</li>
            <li>Smell is rich yet not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The Dial brand managers have redesigned all products to not last, and no longer be good value.</li>
            <li>also love coast and irish spring for their wonderful scents but dial is antibacterial, so you get that extra feature along with a great and long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>Really I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything special.</li>
            <li>The scent of this soap is very, very overpowering in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Not bad as far as bar soap.  </li>
            <li>for some reason the one i bought here goes 2x as fast.</li>
            <li>I am waiting for someone to really get hurt and SUE THEM.</li>
            <li>This is a god no frills bar soap that will not dry your skin out and gets you clean</li>
            <li>this although some might see it as drying for the skin, this soap always makes you feel clean...and isn&#x27;t that the whole point of using it.</li>
            <li>The carved middle makes them break in half more easily.</li>
            <li>It leaves us feeling clean but not slimy like moisturizing soaps, such as carress.</li>
            <li>The middle has been carved and they slip out of your hands more easily and don&#x27;t last nearly as long.  </li>
            <li>This was such a great deal , and i know i will be purchasing other products in the near future</li>
            <li>It had a soothing smell and kept my skin feeling clean without a that dry feel.</li>
            <li>The soap has a very fresh scent, is antibacterial, the bars are individually wrapped, and are white in color.</li>
            <li>I love the small of the Spring Water scent.  </li>
            <li>When its first open and days afterwards.</li>
            <li>It works extremely well peeling off the fine sand I live around and in on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Excellent...arrived early</li>
            <li>One of our favorites as far as bar soap goes.</li>
            <li>This is my new one and only soap</li>
            <li>If you use a washcloth or pouf to lather the soap, it will be fine, but if you&#x27;re the type who likes to have direct soap-to-body contact, you may find this frustrating.</li>
            <li>(owned by Henkel, Germany) recently added a new scooped out bottom shape to their bath size bars, which reduces the ounces of the bar, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>

            <li> It was formerly nearly flat on bottom.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a reasonably priced antibacterial bar soap, but the Dial Spring Water fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell and it gets me clean, but I don&#x27;t like the that weird sticky feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> (unless you like slipping in the shower!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much to say about soap.</li>
            <li> i prefer dial over all other soap.  </li>
            <li> I usually get this soap at Walmart for the same price and since this was a bargain on Amazon I stocked up.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is the shape of the bar.  </li>
            <li> I have used other soaps that are not antibacterial but they do not clean you as well.  </li>
            <li> This makes the soap \\&quot;dispense\\&quot; unevenly which will eventually lead to the thin center breaking into two larger \\&quot;chunks\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It is just very awkward to hold and wears out in the middle first leaving you with two small pieces.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to those who have trouble finding a soap to get the grime off.</li>
            <li> My sons use it everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Deciding to cheat us by cutting a large chunk out of the bar is one thing, but to create also create safety hazard that could really hurt someone is beyond stupid.</li>
            <li> I usually get these for $0.50 a bar.</li>
            <li> I am seriously worried about a SLIP AND FALL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure why I am reviewing this; how can you go wrong with soap?</li>
            <li> You added DANGEROUS to their list of product enhancements.</li>
            <li> I do hate the shape of the bar.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The soap has a very fresh scent, is antibacterial, the bars are individually wrapped, and are white in color. Nice product!</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it gets me clean, but I don&#x27;t like the that weird sticky feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I love this soap. It leaves us feeling clean but not slimy like moisturizing soaps, such as carress. We both dislike moisturizing soap. There&#x27;s soap &amp; there&#x27;s moisturizer. We don&#x27;t need them to be one!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SMELL PRICE GOOD DELIVERY GOOD</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bar soap...what more can I say. It&#x27;s just like what you would find in a local market;if,you have a way of getting there.</li>
            <li> We had not tried this product before and were hoping that the scent was not too strong.  After receiving it and trying it, we are satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great price.</li>
            <li> this is a good bar of soap. i have always bought this a walgreens. but there is one big problem i notice with this and the one i bought at walgreens. for some reason the one i bought here goes 2x as fast. so for the price i think i will keep buying them at walgreens</li>
            <li> What is there to say? Its a big package of soap. Now I don&#x27;t need to worry about it  for a while.</li>
            <li> A prefer a deodarant soap with a nice fragrance and which leaves me with a clean, fresh, confident feeling all day. The fragrance isn&#x27;t all that great, but it definitely passes the test of leaving me feeling clean, fresh and confident.</li>
            <li> Use this soap all the time!  I need deodorant soap for my body, but use regular soap for my face and hands.  Have used this for years!</li>
            <li> I love the small of the Spring Water scent.  I keep smelling my hands!</li>
            <li> i prefer dial over all other soap.  also love coast and irish spring for their wonderful scents but dial is antibacterial, so you get that extra feature along with a great and long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I was using Dove and Oil of Olay and needed soap that is antibacterial soap.  I bought Dial and now I cant stop using it...its the best soap out there.  I wish I had used this before I used Dove and Oil of Olay!</li>
            <li> I think the price is great. The soap has a fragrance but it mellows with time. It won&#x27;t make you ashy that I&#x27;ve noticed. Pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this soap for years, and my husband and i both love it.  it smells amazing, it&#x27;s anti-bacterial for us athletic types, and this was a good value.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I am reviewing this; how can you go wrong with soap? Sent it to my daughters dorm.  She likes the scent.</li>
            <li> Eliminates BO and makes the gals happy</li>
            <li> I usually get these for $0.50 a bar. I always get the white Dial soaps because the yellow ones have a tendency to stain my countertops.</li>
            <li> I received my package in a timely manner and the package was nice and clean just like im going to be dialing away in the shower :) this is my favorite fragrant soap. The price was great I usually get this soap at Walmart for the same price and since this was a bargain on Amazon I stocked up.</li>
            <li> works and smells nice shipped and packed good</li>
            <li> Really I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything special. I wanted something cheap that works and this stuff fit the bill better than anything else.</li>
            <li> Not bad as far as bar soap.  Can use easily and for lots of cleaning purposes.</li>
            <li> great soap, great price, great filler product to get free shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap what more do you want? It does what it needs to.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap.  Works great and smells great.  And the price is right...especially on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> This was such a great deal , and i know i will be purchasing other products in the near future</li>
            <li> I like this soap because it makes my bathroom smell good and it is Antibacterial !!  I have used other soaps that are not antibacterial but they do not clean you as well.  I would recommend this soap !!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T TOUCH THAT DIAL! (unless you like slipping in the shower!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dial (owned by Henkel, Germany) recently added a new scooped out bottom shape to their bath size bars, which reduces the ounces of the bar, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long. It was formerly nearly flat on bottom. There is no reason for this scoop except to reduce longevity of the bar while appearing to be the same size as before. Problem is the scoop causes a HAZARD. The bars now WILL NOT STAY IN THE SOAP DISH. The bars continually fall under foot. I picked up the bar 2 or 3 times every shower. It gets under my feet. I am seriously worried about a SLIP AND FALL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deciding to cheat us by cutting a large chunk out of the bar is one thing, but to create also create safety hazard that could really hurt someone is beyond stupid. I am waiting for someone to really get hurt and SUE THEM. The bar is out of balance on soap dishes. If you have that smaller piece left over from before, you&#x27;ll never get the bar to stay put. It is under foot every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIAL&#x27;S GREED MODIFICATIONS ARE GOING TO HURT SOMEONE!!!!!! I have about slipped several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so amazed that the current keepers of a formerly great brand could be so recklesss in their quest to cheat us that have tainted a 30 year great brand. The Dial brand managers have redesigned all products to not last, and no longer be good value. You added DANGEROUS to their list of product enhancements. Good job Dial Brand management!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t touch that dial.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they put in them, but some deodorant soaps make me itchy (Irish Spring, Coast) and this one doesn&#x27;t.  I alternate between Dial and Safeguard, and like both of them, but this was cheaper and the free add-on shipping was great!</li>
            <li> This is my new one and only soap I feel I will ever buy. I would recommend this product to those who have trouble finding a soap to get the grime off. Possibly even great for those with acne as I do and it seems to have improved for now.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this soap. It also seems to be the only soap that removes onion smell. It works extremely well peeling off the fine sand I live around and in on a daily basis. It does not leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this Dial soap over others is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about soap. It was what i expected at an excellent price. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I  always purchase dial soap and I think it&#x27;s a great antibacterial soap. I would recommend this soap to anyone.</li>
            <li> The soap very good. I do hate the shape of the bar. It is just very awkward to hold and wears out in the middle first leaving you with two small pieces. I hope the company reads these reviews and fixes the shape of the bar.</li>
            <li> 8 pack is a great buy. Dial soap is a good brand. I get it for my son and my mom. Should last awhile. I will be purchasing this again. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> The scent of this soap is very, very overpowering in my opinion.  My husband opened up a bar of this soap and took a shower and my entire bathroom and bedroom reaked of this scent.  It was actually burning my sinuses.  I put the used bar in a zip lock bag and the rest of the 7 unopened bars in a double plastic bag.  If you have allergy or sinus issues, I would suggest you find a milder scented soap.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, wonderful deal. My sons use it everyday. I&#x27;m sooty but I use the liquid body wash, so that is great as well. Smell is rich yet not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is a god no frills bar soap that will not dry your skin out and gets you clean I like it a lot</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a reasonably priced antibacterial bar soap, but the Dial Spring Water fits the bill.  It has a pleasant deodorant scent and produces rich lather and leaves my skin feeling clean, but not dried out. My only complaint about this product is the shape of the bar.  Rather than being a nice even rectangle, this soap has a curved surface on one side.  This makes the soap \\&quot;dispense\\&quot; unevenly which will eventually lead to the thin center breaking into two larger \\&quot;chunks\\&quot;.  If you use a washcloth or pouf to lather the soap, it will be fine, but if you&#x27;re the type who likes to have direct soap-to-body contact, you may find this frustrating.</li>
            <li> Excellent...arrived early</li>
            <li> a gift for my brother I love him</li>
            <li> Best soap for no-frills, get-the-job-done folks.</li>
            <li> One of our favorites as far as bar soap goes. The menfolk don&#x27;t wrinkle their noses at the smell as &#x27;too girly&#x27; LOL</li>
            <li> As a bar soap goes I don&#x27;t think it gets better then this although some might see it as drying for the skin, this soap always makes you feel clean...and isn&#x27;t that the whole point of using it.</li>
            <li> Jusr love the scent and as it named  FRESH. When its first open and days afterwards.</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean, I wasn&#x27;t sure as to what this product would smell or feel like but I was impressed. It had a soothing smell and kept my skin feeling clean without a that dry feel.</li>
            <li> These bars keep getting smaller.  The middle has been carved and they slip out of your hands more easily and don&#x27;t last nearly as long.  The carved middle makes them break in half more easily.</li>
            <li> Lathers up good  smells  great</li>
