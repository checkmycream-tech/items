            <li>all perfect.  </li>
            <li>That way you&#x27;re just concentrating on the shaving technique itself, and not simultaneously trying to learn how to generate and maintain that perfect razor edge.  </li>

            <li>Given the circumstances, i think i would be happy with any of the popular brands be it shark, derby, or feather.</li>
            <li>Some is really good, while some seems quite self-obsessive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality for the price, the handle doesn&#x27;t get slippery easily, weight feels good, looks very nice.</li>

            <li>Absolutely love this razor!  </li>
            <li>Very nice, holds the blades nice and strong.</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing.</li>
            <li>face, since then it has been amazing.</li>
            <li>kind of like what Apple products are supposed to be</li>
            <li>own 3 straights and use this for travel.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot of comment about shaving with this kind of razor</li>
            <li>This is one of the best straight razors I have used.</li>
            <li>Nice weight.</li>
            <li>It provides the best shave, and it&#x27;s super easy to use if you know how.</li>
            <li>I have used many straight razors, this one has been the best.</li>
            <li>nice craft and build, using SS pro blades and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Most amazing razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It has good weight and balance and feels comfortable in my hands.  </li>
            <li>great razor, a little pricey but is excellent quality</li>
            <li>The razor works best with feather razors because they sit flush like a true straight.</li>
            <li>Perfect alternative to a true straight edge.</li>
            <li>and I am now glad I have both razors.</li>
            <li>You will be glad you did.raight razor shaving, then get this feather razor with either the pro or pro guard blades.</li>
            <li>You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>The protected nape blades work better for me.</li>
            <li>When in experienced hands, this will shave you much closer than any safety razor I have tried.</li>
            <li>preference is to shave mostly with a DE.</li>
            <li>end result was the closest and most thorough shave in my life.</li>
            <li>For the price, there is nothing better in my opinion for doing shaves.</li>
            <li>it cut s just as good as a real straight razor except you dont have to strop it.</li>
            <li>you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>10x better.  </li>
            <li>OUTSTANDING blade.  </li>
            <li>If you shave with a Parker which is a bit more unforgiving than a Shavette, you will LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li>They are simply the best.  </li>
            <li>The balance, ease of cleaning and loading blades, the quality of the shave are on the top of their competition.  </li>
            <li>My SS &amp; DX non folding razor handles are much better then this one.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the shave method, so opted for a better handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes shaving easier but also be prepared to bleed a bit. :-)</li>
            <li>A great compromise for beginning to use a straight blade razor.</li>
            <li>Outstanding razor.</li>
            <li>I like it better then</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve realized that the plastic handle is actually better for a guy like me who probably should take better care of my stuff.  </li>
            <li>Paid $110&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly with both the Feather professional and the Super blades.  </li>
            <li>It gives a good close, comfortable shave and is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>Easy to load and un load blades, easy to clean, and has a nice balanced feel.</li>
            <li>The Feather is great for travel and does an amazing job, but it takes a lot more skill to use this than a normal straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is more comfortable to shave with and use.  </li>
            <li>But for a full shave on a disposable blade, this feather is by far much superior!  </li>
            <li>I love this Artist model as it&#x27;s the perfect weight and fits comfortably in my little fingers.</li>
            <li>But in the other hand, the quality of this razor is so awesome!!!.</li>
            <li>If you are coming from a Mach 3 disposable type there will be a learning curve but don&#x27;t be intimated it&#x27;s easy to get the hang of.</li>
            <li>and I did 3 passes, easy breezy.</li>
            <li>Then I purchased a Parker which is a great razor (much better feel than the Shavette) but it has too short a tang.</li>
            <li>It is easy to get the blade in and out of the razor, but not so easy that it just falls out.</li>
            <li>High quality piece, good size and weight.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic razor, the blades are the sharpest I&#x27;ve used, and the handle make it easy to handle with precision.</li>
            <li>I like how the head easily opens up for cleaning, yet holds the blade securely when in use.</li>
            <li>To put a cheap handle-scale on such a great razor is like putting a Kia logo on a Lexus.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this razor with either blade provides an extremely smooth and close shave.  </li>
            <li>I end up with a great shave and no red, burning, weeping neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon Prime delivered this in 1 day, on a sunday, on a holiday weekend for free.</li>
            <li>This barber student didn&#x27;t want a cheap Shavette</li>
            <li>A beginner should not use a cheap razor to learn with this isn&#x27;t Guitar 101.</li>
            <li>Is heavy and the details are perfect.</li>
            <li>Just take your time and use a light touch.</li>
            <li>What I did was to use this razor for the easy areas in the beginning and clean up the rest with my DE razor</li>
            <li>Easy as hell to change out razors and clean.</li>
            <li>It was a cheap way to get started.  </li>
            <li>Best straight razor use it daily to straighten my beard</li>
            <li>I originally used the pro guard razor with this feather, but wanted something a bit sharper and easier</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I have had to clean it from time to time as the inside gets some soap residue.</li>
            <li>Also I clean out the inside of the razor holder each time</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably true, but I don&#x27;t use a straight razor more than 1-2x per month, so I change this razor</li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning, if you are in experienced BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li>The Parker stainless steel shavette is better than that one.</li>
            <li>i truly don&#x27;t see how it would be practical to repetedly do full shaves with either the dovo or parker shavettes.</li>
            <li>For a full shave, they say you can get 8-10 shaves out of these razors?</li>
            <li>I get such baby-smooth shaves from this razor and I am also free to focus on the part of shaving that I find most enjoyable -- playing with all the shaving soaps, creams, and lotions.</li>
            <li>I am still working up the nerve to use it for a full shave (learning one part of my face at a time)  </li>
            <li>To start getting into traditional shaving, this is a good way to go.</li>
            <li>Having used a variety of safety, traditional straights, and Shavettes - I find the Feather to be a superior product.</li>
            <li>I have to tell you, my clients all praise the difference and swear by how superior it is to my last razor, and I too cannot get over the quality of this razor , and the blades that come with it.</li>
            <li>Easy to keep clean, easy to change blades, easy shaving, especially with three or four days growth.  </li>
            <li>Very ergonomic design and great design overall for a replaceable blade razor.</li>
            <li>Changing out the blades is a breeze and when paired with the Feather Super blades its reeeeeaaaalllll niiiiiiiiiiicccceee.</li>
            <li>The ‘feedback’ is about the same as with my Theirs Issard that cost many times more than this one.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor for years not and used to use the cheap blades and cheap handle.  </li>
            <li>Each persons whiskers are different, but I get about 10-15 good shaves per blade making this rather economical as well.iveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each persons whiskers are different, but I get about 10-15 good shaves per blade making this rather economical as well.</li>
            <li>The student kit shavettes are garbage as the blades consistently slip and are too light.</li>
            <li>It performed a lot better than my normal Gillette.  </li>
            <li>Let me preface this with I have used and presently own electric, disposable cartridge, shavette, Feather DX and classic straight razors.  </li>
            <li>Its my first straight razor, and I&#x27;ve gotten comfortable with it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I agree with most of the other reviews in that the Feather gives a great shave, blades are easy to change, blades are sharper than you might otherwise achieve with a traditional straight razor, but for a hundred bucks the handle is cheap.  </li>
            <li>So if you are on the fence about trying straight razors or trying this particular one I highly recommend this razor and hope that your experiences are as good as mine.  </li>
            <li>The blades aren&#x27;t cheap, but compared to a modern razor, they are a pittance.  </li>
            <li>It took me about 7 shaves till I really felt comfortable with the razor.</li>
            <li>The blades are amazing and they seem to last for ever.  </li>
            <li>Same goes with my safety razor, which I use most of the time as my primary razor.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and adult safe.</li>
            <li>One thing that may be worth mentioning is the listing gives a max temperature for sterilization that is misleading for us in the USA.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and effective;</li>
            <li>but so worth it.</li>
            <li>Really for the money you can buy a real straigh razor ( i dont know the shave quality) of just add more shaving stuff.</li>
            <li>I dont buy it again, not for the quality just because you can get better shave with a cheap but no lasting razor.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving fun again.</li>
            <li>Feather offers 4 different types of blades, from &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; to incredibly unsafe if one is not accustomed to shaving with a straight blade.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money over cheaper Shavettes.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money over cheaper Shavettes.</li>
            <li>Given the circumstances, i think i would be happy with any of the popular brands be it shark, derby, or feather.ver tried other blades except the Sharp which isn&#x27;t even the correct one for this razor.</li>
            <li>The parker, dovo and the other one, are good but have some imprefections.</li>
            <li>if your looking for a good straight razor and don&#x27;t want to strope it or maybe your new to straight razor and don&#x27;t want to spend  a lot of money on a straight razor</li>
            <li>This swipe right through it with ease.</li>
            <li>Very close and clean.</li>
            <li>The design is superior in both form and function to most all other shavettes and performs similarly to a traditional.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a complete noob to &#x27;straight style&#x27; shaving and curiosity got the better me.</li>
            <li>Little too light and wasn&#x27;t completely thrilled with the blades not being as long as the holder without using specific blades that weren&#x27;t all that great.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit flimsy and seems cheap compared to the high quality stainless of the razor.</li>
            <li>Tried the Dovo Shavette first.  </li>
            <li>, first shave with it</li>
            <li>and it is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>I use the standard artist club blades and they are outstanding, when combined with elegance shave gel</li>
            <li>Can not express how much I like shaving with this razor!  </li>
            <li>The handle is not flashy but it works, I have had no issues.</li>
            <li>The Japanese turn out products well engineered with top quality and have no concept of appearance  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite traditional type razor.  </li>
            <li>First one broke in a couple months.  </li>
            <li>I shaved with the Feather exclusively for the first month until I got my sharpening stones and strop setup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know that there are those who will say I should be concerned with the quality of the shave and to those I say:  I wet shave to enjoy the time, like fine wine.  </li>
            <li>BTW, I have not been compensated or endorsed to provide this feedback, I paid full price for this razor and blades and was prompted to write this review only by my experiences and the hope that others enjoy it as much.  </li>
            <li>These Feather blades are sharp as hell - sharper and more unforgiving than any of the 6 actual straight razors that I own.  </li>
            <li>I believe this razor offers some special advantages.</li>
            <li>The matte finish is very nice, and provides enough grip even with wet hands.</li>
            <li>It is my first foray into straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with using a straight razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all about that perfect edge, and so far I haven&#x27;t got the knack for producing it on the conventional straight, but with this Feather I just put in a new blade when the current one starts tugging, and it&#x27;s smooth as butter and extremely close and easy</li>
            <li>I thought my Feather Artist Club DX was a fantastic razor, but this fine shaving tool has it beat, hands down.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, for beginners on a budget that are hesitant to spend this much on this feather razor at first.....i would buy the Parker stainless first and see if u can tolerate it.(do not buy that dovo).</li>
            <li>First and foremost, the replaceable blade platform allows the beginner to concentrate primarily on learning proper technique.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little concerned that the handle is plastic, but after using it for a few weeks I&#x27;ve shifted my focus from the plastic to the shave, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is certainly up to the task but is by no means a safety razor.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking about buying your first straight razor, I highly recommend getting the Feather because even though it is a hundred bucks you will spend much more initially buying a good traditional razor and all the stones and strops you need to keep it sharp.  </li>
            <li>Enough heft to feel balanced, light enough to easily manipulate.  </li>
            <li>Pretty decent design.</li>
            <li>If you want to try a straight, but don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t spend time honing and stropping, buy this razor.</li>
            <li>For veterans, I can&#x27;t speak for you as I don&#x27;t have the experience with &amp;#34;real straight razors&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>(I dont habe a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; straight razor).</li>
            <li>But with this feather, it is very practical.</li>
            <li>althought i could probably go much longer.</li>
            <li>If you want the straight razor experience without the stropping and honing and all the support equipment this is the razor you should consider.</li>
            <li>Control must be learned and it really takes time.</li>
            <li>I have straight razors - an Iwasaki kamisori, and</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s something to be said about the convenience, while still retaining the form and function of the straight razor.  </li>
            <li>know some people think to use this as a straight razor starter.  </li>
            <li>I do think you can get most of the technique, although in a way you are going the harder route.  </li>
            <li>just straight water</li>
            <li>It might last shaves 2-3Max, but since theyre so cheap for 100</li>
            <li>It might last shaves 2-3Max, but since theyre so cheap for 100</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind buying the blades and want a straight razor you don&#x27;t have to hone and strop, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li>Very close shave with the pro guard blades</li>
            <li>What I really like about this changeable blade razor over others I have used is the ‘feedback’ I get while shaving.  </li>
            <li>These are NOT beginner&#x27;s straight razors.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to...</li>
            <li>really I dont know</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t talk about real straigh razor because I never use it.</li>
            <li>I started with a Dovo Shavette and got the hang of using a straight razor, albeit with training wheels.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try a straight w/o the stropping and maintenance.  </li>
            <li>you are just getting in to straight shaving</li>
            <li>Same as it&#x27;s big brother Feather DX, which I love to shave with it, SS you get the same results, I love them both :</li>
            <li>I have used this razor, with Feather ProGuard blades, for several months now and I thoroughly enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>When shaving properly this razor is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>You will get the straight razor experience without all the maintenance overhead.</li>
            <li>It is much, much</li>
            <li>I just sent my razor out for custom scales because the scale really annoys me.  </li>
            <li>The only shortcoming is plastic handle is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Started my journey to straight razor shaving with a Parker replaceable.  </li>
            <li>opinion on someone just learning to shave with a straight razor is to start with the Feather.  </li>
            <li>I get really close shaves without</li>
            <li>So if you want to experience straight razor shaving without the honing and stropping, get this razor.</li>
            <li>This Feather is very ergonomic.  </li>
            <li>Shavettes that use split DE blades don&#x27;t offer much leeway for mistakes and tend to produce deeper nicks IMHO.  </li>
            <li>Shavettes that use split DE blades don&#x27;t offer much leeway for mistakes and tend to produce deeper nicks IMHO.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for myself to practice with before investing in a $300+ straight razor.</li>
            <li>Although, whoever sells this razor handle should do ALOT better job of making it clear that it&#x27;s only the handle</li>
            <li>I can only imagine how nice this would be with proper prep, soap, or cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ok, Im new in the long road of straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li>I can easily pull a small cloth through it to clean out any junk.</li>
            <li>In fact, the machine-honed disposable blades will be much sharper than a traditional straight-razor blade, which is why many straight-razor enthusiasts will recommend a traditional straight razor for newbies over a razor like this.</li>
            <li>I think the Dovo is much better and its much cheaper, Also dovo blades are nearly half the price of feather blades</li>
            <li>I use the feather professional blades and they work nicely, they are sharp but I barely nicked myself once the first time</li>
            <li>In retrospect, it&#x27;s almost better to spend $150 on a basic straight set up, THEN go back to the Feather.  </li>
            <li>This was my first straight razor after using safety razors for a long time; my barber used this on me and recommended it as first straight razor.</li>
            <li>This one however has stood out for me, mainly for the feel and ease of use.</li>
            <li>I know many are like me and started with a shavette before making the big plunge into actual straights -</li>
            <li>I am using the Feather ‘Professional’ blades and the first shave with a new blade</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The whole honing and stropping was fun when I was first learning but at least for me that romance died quickly.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have not yet come close to duplicating that experience with my straight razor.  </li>
            <li>I have been shaving with this razor for a few months now and love it.</li>
            <li>These blades are super sharp and come out extra hot right out of the box, so I recommend researching how to cork</li>
            <li>Nothing worked despite proper pre shave prep and shaving technique, right after shaving</li>
            <li>I emphasize this to the beginner as this particular straight will deliver results and also a learned confidence to be a proficient shaver should one find they like this method of shaving and want to make the leap into a traditional straight and strop, etc.  </li>

            <li>I bought this Feather SS folding handle straight razor first, then I bought a conventional straight razor, which did not come shave ready.  </li>
            <li>First time shaving with a straight razor, big fan of the feather SS so far.</li>
            <li>Other than the cheap handle the razor is well made.</li>
            <li>They are really sharp and all so smooth.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worries about finding time to sharpen your razor, just slip in a new blade and you are set.</li>
            <li>Third, several blades are available in levels of aggressiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition, the handle design coupled with the long tang will easily accommodate various hand sizes.  </li>
            <li>so i prepped only with hot water.</li>
            <li>For me the other double edge ( I split in two) have more edge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super smooth, but out of everything I&#x27;ve ever tried this has been the closest shave.  </li>
            <li>I use the KAI Captain Mild Pink blades with it.</li>
            <li>I was new to straight shaving when i first started using this thing about a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li>I used the feather super blades and I dont feel the smood shaving that I got with the other ones.</li>
            <li>It is complete garbage, despite the name brand reputation.</li>
            <li>I am a master barber for over 10 years, and i have used several disposable straight razors.</li>
            <li>i went from modern razor to double edge razor, then from double edge razor to straight edge razor.</li>
            <li>I use the sandelwood creme from Taylor of Old Bond street.</li>
            <li>I have four traditional straight razors and it can be a pain sometimes honing and stropping.</li>
            <li>During the week if I leave too much water on the blade before putting it up, I will see some browning appear along the blade, never the actual handle.</li>
            <li>I take an old one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This offers ease as well when it comes to traveling.</li>
            <li>I am a professional barber and have found that Feather brand razors have no comparison in the world.  </li>
            <li>You are in complete control.</li>
            <li>use a Feather Professional blade</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve read the feather gives an even closer shave than a traditional straight.</li>
            <li>and purists may vehemently disagree, but I would recommend the Feather SS to a beginning straight shaver above a cheapo Shavette and a traditional straight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: The Feather SS is a home run as far as razors go.</li>
            <li>Unless one is a professional Barber,  I would recommend the SS over the Feather DX.  </li>

            <li>Unless one is a professional Barber,  I would recommend the SS over the Feather DX.  </li>
            <li>I am a Master Barber in NYS, and we are not allowed to use a traditional straight blade.</li>
            <li>While there is the hobby aspect to shaving that is ritualized and enjoyable - at the end of the day I&#x27;m looking for a few key elements.</li>
            <li>I am more into soaps, creams, oils, lotions, and creating thick foamy lather than I am into stropping and honing.</li>
            <li>There is less initial cost then a true straight blade which you have to learn how to hone and all.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I have found this razor the most adaptable to other grooming tasks using the pro-guard blades, such as shaving the back of neck.  </li>

            <li>After using this straight razor for a couple of weeks, I see no need to spend $300+ on any other straight razor.</li>
            <li>If you are a professional  looking for a high quality razor, look no further.</li>
            <li>I had been using a straight razor for a few months honing my technique when I thought I would try these because of their reputation and due to the fact that I could get a straight razor shave in quickly before work (no stropping, etc).</li>
            <li>Only reason this does not get a 5 star was that the price is high for what it is.  </li>
            <li>While the closest shave I have had (or probably ever get) was with one of my Theirs Issard the investment in time to get and maintain the edge, is presently, too high for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I watched some videos on youtube, then loaded up a Sharp single edge blade (smaller and sticks out more than it should) that i bought for a returned shavette.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>All of the good aspects of straight razor shaving and none of the bad.</li>
            <li>The scales on the feather SS are some sort of resin plastic (not the same type as my oakleys), but are just rigid enough (wish they made billet stainless or CNC Delrin scales for this).</li>
            <li>I really like the Feather for when I don&#x27;t want to strop, but just know that these blades are much less forgiving than any actual straight.  </li>
            <li>Bought this item as my first straight razor with the expectation that a replaceable blade would give me one less excuse to accidentally cut myself.  </li>
            <li>A new user should seriously just try working up to a full face shave with this gradually</li>
            <li>anyway,  If you do want to get a little more serious with straight razor shaving, then get this feather razor with either the pro or pro guard blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s weighted well, balanced, and uber sharp blades and handled very well.  </li>
            <li>(straights are much easier to shave with and these blades are sharp as hell), but when I can&#x27;t carry my strop, this is my go to.</li>
            <li>I normally get several (at least a week’s worth of) shaves on a blade.  </li>
            <li>I cut myself up the first time I used this, and that&#x27;s after using straights a long time and being careful.  </li>
            <li>the novelty of using a conventional straight razor will wear off someday</li>
            <li>then the average straight razor.  </li>
            <li>It already takes quite a bit of time to go through the pre-shave routine and then actually shave with a straight razor, so I&#x27;m really not interested in maintaining the sharpness of the blade.</li>
            <li>So having tried several other replaceable straight blades/razors, I decided to splurge and get this.</li>
            <li>was initially drawn to wet shaving and straight razors initially out of a sense of nostalgia.</li>
            <li>I usually just shave with it once or twice a week for fun and then use my electric razor for maintenance in between.</li>
            <li>the shave is beyond easy, even on tough beards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, as I learn to hone and strop and try to get the conventional straight razor experience, I use the Feather&#x27;s performance as the gold standard</li>
            <li>I can start to feel a little more resistance with the blades as they start to dull.</li>
            <li>Also, the blade angle will be a little different (although that can be said between various straight razors).  </li>
            <li>They all have good and bad points.  </li>

            <li> Awesome !</li>
            <li> all perfect.  </li>
            <li> That way you&#x27;re just concentrating on the shaving technique itself, and not simultaneously trying to learn how to generate and maintain that perfect razor edge.  </li>
            <li> But if you watch a couple of videos on youtube, and practice, you&#x27;ll be rewarded with one of the best shaving experiences ever!  </li>

            <li> excellent razor easy to use and well balanced.</li>
            <li> Given the circumstances, i think i would be happy with any of the popular brands be it shark, derby, or feather.</li>
            <li> Some is really good, while some seems quite self-obsessive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality for the price, the handle doesn&#x27;t get slippery easily, weight feels good, looks very nice.</li>

            <li> face, since then it has been amazing.</li>
            <li> kind of like what Apple products are supposed to be</li>
            <li> own 3 straights and use this for travel.  </li>
            <li> I read a lot of comment about shaving with this kind of razor</li>
            <li> This is one of the best straight razors I have used.</li>
            <li> Nice weight.</li>
            <li> It provides the best shave, and it&#x27;s super easy to use if you know how.</li>

            <li> great razor, a little pricey but is excellent quality</li>
            <li> The razor works best with feather razors because they sit flush like a true straight.</li>
            <li> Perfect alternative to a true straight edge.</li>
            <li> and I am now glad I have both razors.</li>
            <li> You will be glad you did.raight razor shaving, then get this feather razor with either the pro or pro guard blades.</li>
            <li> You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> The protected nape blades work better for me.</li>
            <li> When in experienced hands, this will shave you much closer than any safety razor I have tried.</li>
            <li> preference is to shave mostly with a DE.</li>
            <li> end result was the closest and most thorough shave in my life.</li>
            <li> For the price, there is nothing better in my opinion for doing shaves.</li>
            <li> it cut s just as good as a real straight razor except you dont have to strop it.</li>
            <li> you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> 10x better.  </li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING blade.  </li>
            <li> If you shave with a Parker which is a bit more unforgiving than a Shavette, you will LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li> They are simply the best.  </li>
            <li> The balance, ease of cleaning and loading blades, the quality of the shave are on the top of their competition.  </li>
            <li> My SS &amp; DX non folding razor handles are much better then this one.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed the shave method, so opted for a better handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes shaving easier but also be prepared to bleed a bit. :-)</li>
            <li> A great compromise for beginning to use a straight blade razor.</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor.</li>
            <li> I like it better then</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve realized that the plastic handle is actually better for a guy like me who probably should take better care of my stuff.  </li>
            <li> Paid $110&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly with both the Feather professional and the Super blades.  </li>
            <li> It gives a good close, comfortable shave and is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy to load and un load blades, easy to clean, and has a nice balanced feel.</li>
            <li> The Feather is great for travel and does an amazing job, but it takes a lot more skill to use this than a normal straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is more comfortable to shave with and use.  </li>
            <li> But for a full shave on a disposable blade, this feather is by far much superior!  </li>
            <li> I love this Artist model as it&#x27;s the perfect weight and fits comfortably in my little fingers.</li>
            <li> But in the other hand, the quality of this razor is so awesome!!!.</li>
            <li> If you are coming from a Mach 3 disposable type there will be a learning curve but don&#x27;t be intimated it&#x27;s easy to get the hang of.</li>
            <li> and I did 3 passes, easy breezy.</li>
            <li> Then I purchased a Parker which is a great razor (much better feel than the Shavette) but it has too short a tang.</li>
            <li> It is easy to get the blade in and out of the razor, but not so easy that it just falls out.</li>
            <li> High quality piece, good size and weight.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor, the blades are the sharpest I&#x27;ve used, and the handle make it easy to handle with precision.</li>
            <li> I like how the head easily opens up for cleaning, yet holds the blade securely when in use.</li>
            <li> To put a cheap handle-scale on such a great razor is like putting a Kia logo on a Lexus.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this razor with either blade provides an extremely smooth and close shave.  </li>
            <li> I end up with a great shave and no red, burning, weeping neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon Prime delivered this in 1 day, on a sunday, on a holiday weekend for free.</li>
            <li> This barber student didn&#x27;t want a cheap Shavette</li>
            <li> A beginner should not use a cheap razor to learn with this isn&#x27;t Guitar 101.</li>
            <li> Is heavy and the details are perfect.</li>
            <li> Just take your time and use a light touch.</li>
            <li> What I did was to use this razor for the easy areas in the beginning and clean up the rest with my DE razor</li>
            <li> Easy as hell to change out razors and clean.</li>
            <li> It was a cheap way to get started.  </li>
            <li> Best straight razor use it daily to straighten my beard</li>
            <li> I originally used the pro guard razor with this feather, but wanted something a bit sharper and easier</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have had to clean it from time to time as the inside gets some soap residue.</li>
            <li> Also I clean out the inside of the razor holder each time</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably true, but I don&#x27;t use a straight razor more than 1-2x per month, so I change this razor</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning, if you are in experienced BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> The Parker stainless steel shavette is better than that one.</li>
            <li> i truly don&#x27;t see how it would be practical to repetedly do full shaves with either the dovo or parker shavettes.</li>
            <li> For a full shave, they say you can get 8-10 shaves out of these razors?</li>
            <li> I get such baby-smooth shaves from this razor and I am also free to focus on the part of shaving that I find most enjoyable -- playing with all the shaving soaps, creams, and lotions.</li>
            <li> I am still working up the nerve to use it for a full shave (learning one part of my face at a time)  </li>
            <li> To start getting into traditional shaving, this is a good way to go.</li>
            <li> Having used a variety of safety, traditional straights, and Shavettes - I find the Feather to be a superior product.</li>
            <li> I have to tell you, my clients all praise the difference and swear by how superior it is to my last razor, and I too cannot get over the quality of this razor , and the blades that come with it.</li>
            <li> Easy to keep clean, easy to change blades, easy shaving, especially with three or four days growth.  </li>
            <li> Very ergonomic design and great design overall for a replaceable blade razor.</li>
            <li> Changing out the blades is a breeze and when paired with the Feather Super blades its reeeeeaaaalllll niiiiiiiiiiicccceee.</li>
            <li> The ‘feedback’ is about the same as with my Theirs Issard that cost many times more than this one.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor for years not and used to use the cheap blades and cheap handle.  </li>
            <li> Each persons whiskers are different, but I get about 10-15 good shaves per blade making this rather economical as well.iveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The student kit shavettes are garbage as the blades consistently slip and are too light.</li>
            <li> It performed a lot better than my normal Gillette.  </li>
            <li> Let me preface this with I have used and presently own electric, disposable cartridge, shavette, Feather DX and classic straight razors.  </li>
            <li> Its my first straight razor, and I&#x27;ve gotten comfortable with it very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I agree with most of the other reviews in that the Feather gives a great shave, blades are easy to change, blades are sharper than you might otherwise achieve with a traditional straight razor, but for a hundred bucks the handle is cheap.  </li>
            <li> So if you are on the fence about trying straight razors or trying this particular one I highly recommend this razor and hope that your experiences are as good as mine.  </li>
            <li> The blades aren&#x27;t cheap, but compared to a modern razor, they are a pittance.  </li>
            <li> It took me about 7 shaves till I really felt comfortable with the razor.</li>
            <li> The blades are amazing and they seem to last for ever.  </li>
            <li> Same goes with my safety razor, which I use most of the time as my primary razor.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and adult safe.</li>
            <li> One thing that may be worth mentioning is the listing gives a max temperature for sterilization that is misleading for us in the USA.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and effective;</li>
            <li> but so worth it.</li>
            <li> Really for the money you can buy a real straigh razor ( i dont know the shave quality) of just add more shaving stuff.</li>
            <li> I dont buy it again, not for the quality just because you can get better shave with a cheap but no lasting razor.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving fun again.</li>
            <li> Feather offers 4 different types of blades, from &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; to incredibly unsafe if one is not accustomed to shaving with a straight blade.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money over cheaper Shavettes.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money over cheaper Shavettes.</li>
            <li> Given the circumstances, i think i would be happy with any of the popular brands be it shark, derby, or feather.ver tried other blades except the Sharp which isn&#x27;t even the correct one for this razor.</li>
            <li> The parker, dovo and the other one, are good but have some imprefections.</li>
            <li> if your looking for a good straight razor and don&#x27;t want to strope it or maybe your new to straight razor and don&#x27;t want to spend  a lot of money on a straight razor</li>
            <li> This swipe right through it with ease.</li>
            <li> Very close and clean.</li>
            <li> The design is superior in both form and function to most all other shavettes and performs similarly to a traditional.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a complete noob to &#x27;straight style&#x27; shaving and curiosity got the better me.</li>
            <li> Little too light and wasn&#x27;t completely thrilled with the blades not being as long as the holder without using specific blades that weren&#x27;t all that great.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit flimsy and seems cheap compared to the high quality stainless of the razor.</li>
            <li> Tried the Dovo Shavette first.  </li>
            <li> , first shave with it</li>
            <li> and it is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I use the standard artist club blades and they are outstanding, when combined with elegance shave gel</li>
            <li> Can not express how much I like shaving with this razor!  </li>
            <li> The handle is not flashy but it works, I have had no issues.</li>
            <li> The Japanese turn out products well engineered with top quality and have no concept of appearance  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite traditional type razor.  </li>
            <li> First one broke in a couple months.  </li>
            <li> I shaved with the Feather exclusively for the first month until I got my sharpening stones and strop setup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know that there are those who will say I should be concerned with the quality of the shave and to those I say:  I wet shave to enjoy the time, like fine wine.  </li>
            <li> BTW, I have not been compensated or endorsed to provide this feedback, I paid full price for this razor and blades and was prompted to write this review only by my experiences and the hope that others enjoy it as much.  </li>
            <li> These Feather blades are sharp as hell - sharper and more unforgiving than any of the 6 actual straight razors that I own.  </li>
            <li> I believe this razor offers some special advantages.</li>
            <li> The matte finish is very nice, and provides enough grip even with wet hands.</li>
            <li> It is my first foray into straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with using a straight razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about that perfect edge, and so far I haven&#x27;t got the knack for producing it on the conventional straight, but with this Feather I just put in a new blade when the current one starts tugging, and it&#x27;s smooth as butter and extremely close and easy</li>
            <li> I thought my Feather Artist Club DX was a fantastic razor, but this fine shaving tool has it beat, hands down.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, for beginners on a budget that are hesitant to spend this much on this feather razor at first.....i would buy the Parker stainless first and see if u can tolerate it.(do not buy that dovo).</li>
            <li> First and foremost, the replaceable blade platform allows the beginner to concentrate primarily on learning proper technique.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little concerned that the handle is plastic, but after using it for a few weeks I&#x27;ve shifted my focus from the plastic to the shave, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is certainly up to the task but is by no means a safety razor.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about buying your first straight razor, I highly recommend getting the Feather because even though it is a hundred bucks you will spend much more initially buying a good traditional razor and all the stones and strops you need to keep it sharp.  </li>
            <li> Enough heft to feel balanced, light enough to easily manipulate.  </li>
            <li> Pretty decent design.</li>
            <li> If you want to try a straight, but don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t spend time honing and stropping, buy this razor.</li>
            <li> For veterans, I can&#x27;t speak for you as I don&#x27;t have the experience with &amp;#34;real straight razors&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> (I dont habe a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; straight razor).</li>
            <li> But with this feather, it is very practical.</li>
            <li> althought i could probably go much longer.</li>
            <li> If you want the straight razor experience without the stropping and honing and all the support equipment this is the razor you should consider.</li>
            <li> Control must be learned and it really takes time.</li>
            <li> I have straight razors - an Iwasaki kamisori, and</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s something to be said about the convenience, while still retaining the form and function of the straight razor.  </li>
            <li> know some people think to use this as a straight razor starter.  </li>
            <li> I do think you can get most of the technique, although in a way you are going the harder route.  </li>
            <li> just straight water</li>
            <li> It might last shaves 2-3Max, but since theyre so cheap for 100</li>
            <li> It might last shaves 2-3Max, but since theyre so cheap for 100</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind buying the blades and want a straight razor you don&#x27;t have to hone and strop, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li> Very close shave with the pro guard blades</li>
            <li> What I really like about this changeable blade razor over others I have used is the ‘feedback’ I get while shaving.  </li>
            <li> These are NOT beginner&#x27;s straight razors.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to...</li>
            <li> really I dont know</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t talk about real straigh razor because I never use it.</li>
            <li> I started with a Dovo Shavette and got the hang of using a straight razor, albeit with training wheels.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try a straight w/o the stropping and maintenance.  </li>
            <li> you are just getting in to straight shaving</li>
            <li> Same as it&#x27;s big brother Feather DX, which I love to shave with it, SS you get the same results, I love them both :</li>
            <li> I have used this razor, with Feather ProGuard blades, for several months now and I thoroughly enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> When shaving properly this razor is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> You will get the straight razor experience without all the maintenance overhead.</li>
            <li> It is much, much</li>
            <li> I just sent my razor out for custom scales because the scale really annoys me.  </li>
            <li> The only shortcoming is plastic handle is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Started my journey to straight razor shaving with a Parker replaceable.  </li>
            <li> opinion on someone just learning to shave with a straight razor is to start with the Feather.  </li>
            <li> I get really close shaves without</li>
            <li> So if you want to experience straight razor shaving without the honing and stropping, get this razor.</li>
            <li> This Feather is very ergonomic.  </li>
            <li> Shavettes that use split DE blades don&#x27;t offer much leeway for mistakes and tend to produce deeper nicks IMHO.  </li>
            <li> Shavettes that use split DE blades don&#x27;t offer much leeway for mistakes and tend to produce deeper nicks IMHO.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for myself to practice with before investing in a $300+ straight razor.</li>
            <li> Although, whoever sells this razor handle should do ALOT better job of making it clear that it&#x27;s only the handle</li>
            <li> I can only imagine how nice this would be with proper prep, soap, or cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ok, Im new in the long road of straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li> I can easily pull a small cloth through it to clean out any junk.</li>
            <li> In fact, the machine-honed disposable blades will be much sharper than a traditional straight-razor blade, which is why many straight-razor enthusiasts will recommend a traditional straight razor for newbies over a razor like this.</li>
            <li> I think the Dovo is much better and its much cheaper, Also dovo blades are nearly half the price of feather blades</li>
            <li> I use the feather professional blades and they work nicely, they are sharp but I barely nicked myself once the first time</li>
            <li> In retrospect, it&#x27;s almost better to spend $150 on a basic straight set up, THEN go back to the Feather.  </li>
            <li> This was my first straight razor after using safety razors for a long time; my barber used this on me and recommended it as first straight razor.</li>
            <li> This one however has stood out for me, mainly for the feel and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I know many are like me and started with a shavette before making the big plunge into actual straights -</li>
            <li> I am using the Feather ‘Professional’ blades and the first shave with a new blade</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The whole honing and stropping was fun when I was first learning but at least for me that romance died quickly.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have not yet come close to duplicating that experience with my straight razor.  </li>
            <li> I have been shaving with this razor for a few months now and love it.</li>
            <li> These blades are super sharp and come out extra hot right out of the box, so I recommend researching how to cork</li>
            <li> Nothing worked despite proper pre shave prep and shaving technique, right after shaving</li>
            <li> I emphasize this to the beginner as this particular straight will deliver results and also a learned confidence to be a proficient shaver should one find they like this method of shaving and want to make the leap into a traditional straight and strop, etc.  </li>

            <li> I bought this Feather SS folding handle straight razor first, then I bought a conventional straight razor, which did not come shave ready.  </li>
            <li> First time shaving with a straight razor, big fan of the feather SS so far.</li>
            <li> Other than the cheap handle the razor is well made.</li>
            <li> They are really sharp and all so smooth.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worries about finding time to sharpen your razor, just slip in a new blade and you are set.</li>
            <li> Third, several blades are available in levels of aggressiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition, the handle design coupled with the long tang will easily accommodate various hand sizes.  </li>
            <li> so i prepped only with hot water.</li>
            <li> For me the other double edge ( I split in two) have more edge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super smooth, but out of everything I&#x27;ve ever tried this has been the closest shave.  </li>
            <li> I use the KAI Captain Mild Pink blades with it.</li>
            <li> I was new to straight shaving when i first started using this thing about a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li> I used the feather super blades and I dont feel the smood shaving that I got with the other ones.</li>
            <li> It is complete garbage, despite the name brand reputation.</li>
            <li> I am a master barber for over 10 years, and i have used several disposable straight razors.</li>
            <li> i went from modern razor to double edge razor, then from double edge razor to straight edge razor.</li>
            <li> I use the sandelwood creme from Taylor of Old Bond street.</li>
            <li> I have four traditional straight razors and it can be a pain sometimes honing and stropping.</li>
            <li> During the week if I leave too much water on the blade before putting it up, I will see some browning appear along the blade, never the actual handle.</li>
            <li> I take an old one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This offers ease as well when it comes to traveling.</li>
            <li> I am a professional barber and have found that Feather brand razors have no comparison in the world.  </li>
            <li> You are in complete control.</li>
            <li> use a Feather Professional blade</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read the feather gives an even closer shave than a traditional straight.</li>
            <li> and purists may vehemently disagree, but I would recommend the Feather SS to a beginning straight shaver above a cheapo Shavette and a traditional straight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: The Feather SS is a home run as far as razors go.</li>
            <li> Unless one is a professional Barber,  I would recommend the SS over the Feather DX.  </li>

            <li> Unless one is a professional Barber,  I would recommend the SS over the Feather DX.  </li>
            <li> I am a Master Barber in NYS, and we are not allowed to use a traditional straight blade.</li>
            <li> While there is the hobby aspect to shaving that is ritualized and enjoyable - at the end of the day I&#x27;m looking for a few key elements.</li>
            <li> I am more into soaps, creams, oils, lotions, and creating thick foamy lather than I am into stropping and honing.</li>
            <li> There is less initial cost then a true straight blade which you have to learn how to hone and all.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I have found this razor the most adaptable to other grooming tasks using the pro-guard blades, such as shaving the back of neck.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I have found this razor the most adaptable to other grooming tasks using the pro-guard blades, such as shaving the back of neck.  </li>
            <li> After using this straight razor for a couple of weeks, I see no need to spend $300+ on any other straight razor.</li>
            <li> If you are a professional  looking for a high quality razor, look no further.</li>
            <li> I had been using a straight razor for a few months honing my technique when I thought I would try these because of their reputation and due to the fact that I could get a straight razor shave in quickly before work (no stropping, etc).</li>
            <li> Only reason this does not get a 5 star was that the price is high for what it is.  </li>
            <li> While the closest shave I have had (or probably ever get) was with one of my Theirs Issard the investment in time to get and maintain the edge, is presently, too high for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I watched some videos on youtube, then loaded up a Sharp single edge blade (smaller and sticks out more than it should) that i bought for a returned shavette.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> All of the good aspects of straight razor shaving and none of the bad.</li>
            <li> The scales on the feather SS are some sort of resin plastic (not the same type as my oakleys), but are just rigid enough (wish they made billet stainless or CNC Delrin scales for this).</li>
            <li> I really like the Feather for when I don&#x27;t want to strop, but just know that these blades are much less forgiving than any actual straight.  </li>
            <li> Bought this item as my first straight razor with the expectation that a replaceable blade would give me one less excuse to accidentally cut myself.  </li>
            <li> A new user should seriously just try working up to a full face shave with this gradually</li>
            <li> anyway,  If you do want to get a little more serious with straight razor shaving, then get this feather razor with either the pro or pro guard blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weighted well, balanced, and uber sharp blades and handled very well.  </li>
            <li> (straights are much easier to shave with and these blades are sharp as hell), but when I can&#x27;t carry my strop, this is my go to.</li>
            <li> I normally get several (at least a week’s worth of) shaves on a blade.  </li>
            <li> I cut myself up the first time I used this, and that&#x27;s after using straights a long time and being careful.  </li>
            <li> the novelty of using a conventional straight razor will wear off someday</li>
            <li> then the average straight razor.  </li>
            <li> It already takes quite a bit of time to go through the pre-shave routine and then actually shave with a straight razor, so I&#x27;m really not interested in maintaining the sharpness of the blade.</li>
            <li> So having tried several other replaceable straight blades/razors, I decided to splurge and get this.</li>
            <li> was initially drawn to wet shaving and straight razors initially out of a sense of nostalgia.</li>
            <li> I usually just shave with it once or twice a week for fun and then use my electric razor for maintenance in between.</li>
            <li> the shave is beyond easy, even on tough beards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, as I learn to hone and strop and try to get the conventional straight razor experience, I use the Feather&#x27;s performance as the gold standard</li>
            <li> I can start to feel a little more resistance with the blades as they start to dull.</li>
            <li> Also, the blade angle will be a little different (although that can be said between various straight razors).  </li>
            <li> They all have good and bad points.  </li>
            <li> Online retailers (with the exception of a few makes and models) are generally sold out of new traditional straights.</li>
            <li> The shave is the absolutely the closest you can get, and you never need to press hard (which is a major cause of skin irratation).</li>
            <li> I think it was starting to dull by the end of the first shave as it started pulling by the time i got to the upper lip ATG.</li>
            <li> I think it was starting to dull by the end of the first shave as it started pulling by the time i got to the upper lip ATG.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Feather Professional blades, and they are sharp, but after three shaves they start tugging, and produce nicks and weepers.</li>
            <li> Once I realized that you need VERY little pressure to get a great shave, I stopped cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> And while you do working on that sharpening technique on a conventional straight, you know what a truly sharp razor shave feels like.</li>
            <li> There is no shortage of online info about straights and wet shaving in general.</li>
            <li> I was curious why this razor was so much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Got minor razorburn since i took long and made many extra passes to figure out the right angle and position/hand to get the job done, but nothing worst than what the M5 would&#x27;ve done if i took the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> , looks like a traditional straight razor and frankly, I was a little scared after hearing folks talk about the Feather blades being deadly.</li>
            <li> I think this will be with me for a long time.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m 4 shaves in, there is no blade movement, and it&#x27;s is still very SHARP!</li>
            <li> I have only been taking a stab at straight razor shaving for the past few months (no pun intended), but I don&#x27;t see why I would want to put all the effort into stropping and honing when I could just replace the blade on this feather.</li>
            <li> I want to keep it as sharp as possible,</li>
            <li> I use the straight razor to get those tough spots remaining on my neck that would require several passes with a DE.</li>
            <li> I had started using a double edged razor a few months prior to using this razor.</li>
            <li> Blade is only slightly exposed.</li>
            <li> Only took a few shaves to learn proper technique and now it&#x27;s down to perfection.  </li>
            <li> Started wet shaving with DE razors and Feather bladed.  </li>
            <li> The blades aren&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> These are NOT straight razors with \\&quot;training wheels\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still rough like sandpaper and my face was still grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a wide range of Shavette style straights that use split DE blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> High quality piece, good size and weight. Holds blades firmly.  Only reason this does not get a 5 star was that the price is high for what it is.  Paid $110&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly with both the Feather professional and the Super blades.  I think the supers last a little longer but both are extremely sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this razor with either blade provides an extremely smooth and close shave.  I had read all sorts of things about how sharp feather blades are thought I would slice my face off.  If you can use a shavette you can use the Feather with no problems.  If you are coming from a Mach 3 disposable type there will be a learning curve but don&#x27;t be intimated it&#x27;s easy to get the hang of.</li>
            <li> Started wet shaving with DE razors and Feather bladed.  Took the plunge to this razor.  HOLY CRAP what a difference.  It&#x27;s weighted well, balanced, and uber sharp blades and handled very well.  Outlines my goatee with perfection.  I now only shave every 2 days and could probably get away with a third if I wasn&#x27;t so anal about it.  Only took a few shaves to learn proper technique and now it&#x27;s down to perfection.  This is THE perfect setup for me.  Will not be making a change anytime soon.  Tried the Dovo Shavette first.  Little too light and wasn&#x27;t completely thrilled with the blades not being as long as the holder without using specific blades that weren&#x27;t all that great.  This hits the spot.  If you want to try a straight, but don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t spend time honing and stropping, buy this razor.</li>
            <li> For veterans, I can&#x27;t speak for you as I don&#x27;t have the experience with &amp;#34;real straight razors&amp;#34;. So, the only thing for me to compare this to except for would be  the dovo shavette disposable and the Parker disposable. (I dont habe a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; straight razor). Don&#x27;t waste your efforts on the dovo disposable shavette. It is complete garbage, despite the name brand reputation. The Parker stainless steel shavette is better than that one. But for a full shave on a disposable blade, this feather is by far much superior!  or if you have a barbershop, this is what you should be using! i truly don&#x27;t see how it would be practical to repetedly do full shaves with either the dovo or parker shavettes. But with this feather, it is very practical. I have only been taking a stab at straight razor shaving for the past few months (no pun intended), but I don&#x27;t see why I would want to put all the effort into stropping and honing when I could just replace the blade on this feather. I originally used the pro guard razor with this feather, but wanted something a bit sharper and easier so i went with the pro, which is excellent for me. and I am now glad I have both razors. For a full shave, they say you can get 8-10 shaves out of these razors? That&#x27;s probably true, but I don&#x27;t use a straight razor more than 1-2x per month, so I change this razor every 2 shaves just cus I want to keep it as sharp as possible, althought i could probably go much longer. Same goes with my safety razor, which I use most of the time as my primary razor. They say u can get a few shaves out of a safety razor, but at .02-.03 cents per razor, why even bother? Anyway, for beginners on a budget that are hesitant to spend this much on this feather razor at first.....i would buy the Parker stainless first and see if u can tolerate it.(do not buy that dovo). I still do use my paker along with a safety razor shave), but my dovo is packed away.......anyway,  If you do want to get a little more serious with straight razor shaving, then get this feather razor with either the pro or pro guard blades. You will be glad you did.raight razor shaving, then get this feather razor with either the pro or pro guard blades. You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent design. Lightweight and adult safe. Blade is only slightly exposed. Although, whoever sells this razor handle should do ALOT better job of making it clear that it&#x27;s only the handle they&#x27;re selling</li>
            <li> A tad bit too big for me. The blades aren&#x27;t what I expected. The protected nape blades work better for me. All in all, it does the job.</li>
            <li> Great looking does the job but over priced.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing. Even the same blades are noticeably different.</li>
            <li> This razor is wonderfully crafted. I have used many straight razors, this one has been the best. I had to get used to the cutting angle, first shave with it and I peppered the poor guys face, since then it has been amazing.</li>
            <li> If you want the straight razor experience without the stropping and honing and all the support equipment this is the razor you should consider. While it is expensive, it is a competent razor so why should they give it away?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is certainly up to the task but is by no means a safety razor. When in experienced hands, this will shave you much closer than any safety razor I have tried. A new user should seriously just try working up to a full face shave with this gradually or there will be blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the razor&#x27;s fault. Control must be learned and it really takes time. Even using a common DE safety razor is not as effortless as it may seem. It takes time to learn how to guide a blade over your face to properly shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preference is to shave mostly with a DE. I use the straight razor to get those tough spots remaining on my neck that would require several passes with a DE. I end up with a great shave and no red, burning, weeping neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not like about this razor is the handle. It is a bit flimsy and seems cheap compared to the high quality stainless of the razor. One thing that may be worth mentioning is the listing gives a max temperature for sterilization that is misleading for us in the USA. It does not clarify that the 135 degree temperature given is Celsius. So you can heat it up to 275 degrees Fahrenheit if you want to sterilize it.</li>
            <li> I think this will be with me for a long time.  If mine gets somehow stolen tomorrow, I&#x27;d probably order another one without hesitation.  I have straight razors - an Iwasaki kamisori, and Hart Steel 6/8 square tip - and this still finds a lot of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s something to be said about the convenience, while still retaining the form and function of the straight razor.  The blades aren&#x27;t cheap, but compared to a modern razor, they are a pittance.  Meanwhile, I&#x27;m always assured a very sharp blade.  Sometimes when my razors are due for a honing, I reach for my feather to get that close shave they aren&#x27;t doing at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people think to use this as a straight razor starter.  I can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s a terrible idea.  Keep in mind that it is lighter and sharper then the average straight razor.  Also, the blade angle will be a little different (although that can be said between various straight razors).  I do think you can get most of the technique, although in a way you are going the harder route.  I cut myself up the first time I used this, and that&#x27;s after using straights a long time and being careful.  I can only imagine a novice.  That said, it doesn&#x27;t take long to get the technique down.</li>
            <li> Amazon Prime delivered this in 1 day, on a sunday, on a holiday weekend for free. Wow...very impressed. Feather blades and accessories don&#x27;t get here until next week when im away traveling. Did quite a bit of research before buying this and it is exactly what i wanted. While I was open to learning to strop and hone, however, i don&#x27;t want to pay $175 for a Dovo and then another $300+ for a DMT glass/water stone, strop setup. The scales on the feather SS are some sort of resin plastic (not the same type as my oakleys), but are just rigid enough (wish they made billet stainless or CNC Delrin scales for this). The blade holder material and release mechanism is A+ for design and execution. It&#x27;s simple and effective; kind of like what Apple products are supposed to be - i hate apple btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a complete noob to &#x27;straight style&#x27; shaving and curiosity got the better me. I watched some videos on youtube, then loaded up a Sharp single edge blade (smaller and sticks out more than it should) that i bought for a returned shavette. My face is accustomed to daily shaving with cartridges (Fake Mach5 herein defined as \\&quot;M5\\&quot;) and just straight water so i prepped only with hot water. It took 45 minutes for WithTheGrain/ XrossTG /AgainstTG, but the only damage was 1 nick and my finger while stretching skin which went away by the time i was done. I have created worst damage with my M5 and nicks from that make me bleed for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result was the closest and most thorough shave in my life. Got minor razorburn since i took long and made many extra passes to figure out the right angle and position/hand to get the job done, but nothing worst than what the M5 would&#x27;ve done if i took the same amount of time. The M5 is definitely going in the trash as soon as i use up my final cartridge. Given the results under unfavorable conditions, i am very satisfied with my purchase. I can only imagine how nice this would be with proper prep, soap, or cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried other blades except the Sharp which isn&#x27;t even the correct one for this razor. I think it was starting to dull by the end of the first shave as it started pulling by the time i got to the upper lip ATG. It might last shaves 2-3Max, but since theyre so cheap for 100 i just threw it away. Given the circumstances, i think i would be happy with any of the popular brands be it shark, derby, or feather.ver tried other blades except the Sharp which isn&#x27;t even the correct one for this razor.

            <li> I thought my Feather Artist Club DX was a fantastic razor, but this fine shaving tool has it beat, hands down.  It gives a good close, comfortable shave and is easy to keep clean.  As with the DX, the only drawback to this razor is that it is too pricy for a disposable blade model, especially one with plastic scales (the DX is made of wood).  Still, it&#x27;s less than half what the DX costs.  If you don&#x27;t mind buying the blades and want a straight razor you don&#x27;t have to hone and strop, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been barbering for 27 years.. This is a great product, I should have bought it sooner!!</li>
            <li> First time shaving with a straight razor, big fan of the feather SS so far. It&#x27;s good quality for the price, the handle doesn&#x27;t get slippery easily, weight feels good, looks very nice. I use the feather professional blades and they work nicely, they are sharp but I barely nicked myself once the first time and I did 3 passes, easy breezy.</li>
            <li> I am a master barber for over 10 years, and i have used several disposable straight razors. This one however has stood out for me, mainly for the feel and ease of use. I use the standard artist club blades and they are outstanding, when combined with elegance shave gel the shave is beyond easy, even on tough beards. If you are a professional  looking for a high quality razor, look no further. For the price, there is nothing better in my opinion for doing shaves. Easy to load and un load blades, easy to clean, and has a nice balanced feel. I give 5 stars all day, great great razor.</li>
            <li> i went from modern razor to double edge razor, then from double edge razor to straight edge razor. I have got to say this gives me the closest shave without irritating my skin. Takes a couple bloody shave to learn how to handle the the razor properly but totally worth it. This goes great with feather razor blade.</li>
            <li> Very ergonomic design and great design overall for a replaceable blade razor. This was my first straight razor after using safety razors for a long time; my barber used this on me and recommended it as first straight razor. The design is superior in both form and function to most all other shavettes and performs similarly to a traditional. Changing out the blades is a breeze and when paired with the Feather Super blades its reeeeeaaaalllll niiiiiiiiiiicccceee.</li>
            <li> Great handle Razor, Great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it is a little heavy for my liking, i seem to cut myself with proguard and prolight blades. I think the Dovo is much better and its much cheaper, Also dovo blades are nearly half the price of feather blades</li>
            <li> i am very impressed with this razor. it cut s just as good as a real straight razor except you dont have to strop it. if your looking for a good straight razor and don&#x27;t want to strope it or maybe your new to straight razor and don&#x27;t want to spend  a lot of money on a straight razor then you should try this razor. you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Very nice, holds the blades nice and strong. Very close shave with the pro guard blades</li>
            <li> Can not express how much I like shaving with this razor!  I had been using a straight razor for a few months honing my technique when I thought I would try these because of their reputation and due to the fact that I could get a straight razor shave in quickly before work (no stropping, etc). Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you do need to take your time, the blades a very sharp. The resulting shave though is second to none. This is a keeper. I may never shave with another razor again.</li>
            <li> I love this Artist model as it&#x27;s the perfect weight and fits comfortably in my little fingers. The blades are more expensive then I&#x27;d like but so worth it. This barber student didn&#x27;t want a cheap Shavette and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t! The student kit shavettes are garbage as the blades consistently slip and are too light. A beginner should not use a cheap razor to learn with this isn&#x27;t Guitar 101.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this with I have used and presently own electric, disposable cartridge, shavette, Feather DX and classic straight razors.  They all have good and bad points.  Often the trade-off is time, effort and closeness of shave.  I believe this razor is the best at balancing those attributes.  While the closest shave I have had (or probably ever get) was with one of my Theirs Issard the investment in time to get and maintain the edge, is presently, too high for me.&lt;br /&gt;  I am using the Feather ‘Professional’ blades and the first shave with a new blade is usually bloody if I am not paying attention.  That is the bad news (if having too sharp a razor can be a bad thing), the good news is the blade ‘mellows’ after the first shave or two.  I normally get several (at least a week’s worth of) shaves on a blade.  What I really like about this changeable blade razor over others I have used is the ‘feedback’ I get while shaving.  The ‘feedback’ is about the same as with my Theirs Issard that cost many times more than this one.&lt;br /&gt;  I also have the Feather DX and I like the Feather SS 10x better.  It is more comfortable to shave with and use.  I can’t explain it but it is.  So if you are on the fence about trying straight razors or trying this particular one I highly recommend this razor and hope that your experiences are as good as mine.  BTW, I have not been compensated or endorsed to provide this feedback, I paid full price for this razor and blades and was prompted to write this review only by my experiences and the hope that others enjoy it as much.  Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with this razor for a few months now and love it. I usually just shave with it once or twice a week for fun and then use my electric razor for maintenance in between. I use the sandelwood creme from Taylor of Old Bond street. It is a perfect combination.</li>
            <li> I have four traditional straight razors and it can be a pain sometimes honing and stropping. The whole honing and stropping was fun when I was first learning but at least for me that romance died quickly.  I agree with most of the other reviews in that the Feather gives a great shave, blades are easy to change, blades are sharper than you might otherwise achieve with a traditional straight razor, but for a hundred bucks the handle is cheap.  I completed my second shave today and this is without a doubt going to be my goto razor.  Extremely close shave with no effort at all.  If you are thinking about buying your first straight razor, I highly recommend getting the Feather because even though it is a hundred bucks you will spend much more initially buying a good traditional razor and all the stones and strops you need to keep it sharp.  Other than the cheap handle the razor is well made.</li>
            <li> This was an unbelievable razor to learn on and I can see a pro having it in there arsenal. The razor works best with feather razors because they sit flush like a true straight. I only had a nic when I used derby blades. Everyone should have one of these in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> **EDIT**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  After owing this for a few months and using straight razors for almost 6 months, I wanted to come back and add to my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  These are NOT beginner&#x27;s straight razors.  These are NOT straight razors with \\&quot;training wheels\\&quot;.  I know many are like me and started with a shavette before making the big plunge into actual straights - but beware.  These Feather blades are sharp as hell - sharper and more unforgiving than any of the 6 actual straight razors that I own.  I really like the Feather for when I don&#x27;t want to strop, but just know that these blades are much less forgiving than any actual straight.  In retrospect, it&#x27;s almost better to spend $150 on a basic straight set up, THEN go back to the Feather.  The Feather is great for travel and does an amazing job, but it takes a lot more skill to use this than a normal straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own 3 straights and use this for travel.  OUTSTANDING blade.  I prefer my straights and wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for a starting blade (straights are much easier to shave with and these blades are sharp as hell), but when I can&#x27;t carry my strop, this is my go to.</li>
            <li> nice craft and build, using SS pro blades and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Ok, Im new in the long road of straight razor shaving. I stared 1 months ago because im tired of spending money and having rash( sorry if my english is not perfect). I have 4 shavette: Dovo, Parker, one that I dont know the brand and the feather. Thanks to... really I dont know, I have the ability to shave with this kinf of razor and use to shave my head too. No nick in 10 shaves. I read a lot of comment about shaving with this kind of razor and I feel like a havea gift jejejeje. Ok, back to the Feather review, really Im not impressed with the shave a got with this razor. For me the other double edge ( I split in two) have more edge. I used the feather super blades and I dont feel the smood shaving that I got with the other ones. I can&#x27;t talk about real straigh razor because I never use it. But in the other hand, the quality of this razor is so awesome!!!. Is heavy and the details are perfect. The parker, dovo and the other one, are good but have some imprefections. Really for the money you can buy a real straigh razor ( i dont know the shave quality) of just add more shaving stuff. I dont buy it again, not for the quality just because you can get better shave with a cheap but no lasting razor.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review on the blades for this razor, but in a nutshell, I love this razor!!!!  I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor for years not and used to use the cheap blades and cheap handle.  Boy, I was missing out.  This is a fantastic razor, the blades are the sharpest I&#x27;ve used, and the handle make it easy to handle with precision.</li>
            <li> I started with a Dovo Shavette and got the hang of using a straight razor, albeit with training wheels. Then I purchased a Parker which is a great razor (much better feel than the Shavette) but it has too short a tang. I just got this and it has some heft, but controls great, looks like a traditional straight razor and frankly, I was a little scared after hearing folks talk about the Feather blades being deadly. If you shave with a Parker which is a bit more unforgiving than a Shavette, you will LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li> Been using a DE for years.  Wanted to try a straight w/o the stropping and maintenance.  This is a great product.  Sharp, sharp, sharp.  Blades last me about eight shaves.  Learning curve was about a week, but getting great shaves.  Enough heft to feel balanced, light enough to easily manipulate.  Easy to keep clean, easy to change blades, easy shaving, especially with three or four days growth.  Will switch back and forth between my Fat Boy and this one from now on.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. I have a very thick course beard and dull Mach 3 blades in a single use. My electric gets stuck in my beard if I let it grow for 3 days. This swipe right through it with ease. Very close and clean. I was new to straight shaving when i first started using this thing about a year and a half ago. Since then I will never go back. The feather blades are extremely sharp and can hold an edge for about 7 shaves before I start nicking myself. I can start to feel a little more resistance with the blades as they start to dull. The handle is not flashy but it works, I have had no issues. I have had to clean it from time to time as the inside gets some soap residue. During the week if I leave too much water on the blade before putting it up, I will see some browning appear along the blade, never the actual handle. I try to make it a point to shake it off after each use. Also I clean out the inside of the razor holder each time I take an old one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are just getting in to straight shaving and you want a better experience then the parker can offer this is the best thing to start out with. There is less initial cost then a true straight blade which you have to learn how to hone and all. This offers ease as well when it comes to traveling. You don&#x27;t have to worries about finding time to sharpen your razor, just slip in a new blade and you are set. For $20 you get 20 blades that last 20 weeks. This thing just saves you money.</li>
            <li> Most amazing razor I have ever used.  I am a professional barber and have found that Feather brand razors have no comparison in the world.  They are simply the best.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Perfect alternative to a true straight edge.</li>
            <li> All of the good aspects of straight razor shaving and none of the bad. I am blown away with how well this thing works.</li>
            <li> Same as it&#x27;s big brother Feather DX, which I love to shave with it, SS you get the same results, I love them both :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I do recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> I have used this razor, with Feather ProGuard blades, for several months now and I thoroughly enjoy it.  When shaving properly this razor is fantastic.  It has good weight and balance and feels comfortable in my hands.  It is easy to get the blade in and out of the razor, but not so easy that it just falls out.</li>
            <li> I am truly in love with this razor! It is my first foray into straight razor shaving. I can&#x27;t imagine wanting or needing anything else. I am more into soaps, creams, oils, lotions, and creating thick foamy lather than I am into stropping and honing. It already takes quite a bit of time to go through the pre-shave routine and then actually shave with a straight razor, so I&#x27;m really not interested in maintaining the sharpness of the blade. This is the perfect solution. You will get the straight razor experience without all the maintenance overhead. In fact, the machine-honed disposable blades will be much sharper than a traditional straight-razor blade, which is why many straight-razor enthusiasts will recommend a traditional straight razor for newbies over a razor like this. It is much, much sharper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But not to fear. You are in complete control. You will learn to tweak the variables to the specific needs of your face - the blade, the angle of attack, the amount of pressure on the blade, the pre-shave preparation, and the slickness and thickness of the lather. It took me about a week to get the hang of how to use the razor and I can now do WTG, XTG, and ATG passes without any nicks or cuts. Just take your time and use a light touch. What I did was to use this razor for the easy areas in the beginning and clean up the rest with my DE razor, I started out only doing the cheeks with a WTG pass, then added the neck WTG, then XTG, and finally ATG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Feather Professional blade and I can get about 10 shaves out of each blade. These blades are super sharp and come out extra hot right out of the box, so I recommend researching how to cork the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine going back to a cartridge-based razor again. I get such baby-smooth shaves from this razor and I am also free to focus on the part of shaving that I find most enjoyable -- playing with all the shaving soaps, creams, and lotions.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best straight razors I have used.</li>
            <li> great razor, a little pricey but is excellent quality</li>
            <li> excellent razor easy to use and well balanced. I use it with feather proguard blades and I forgot with cuts or irritation. Recommended! The cost justifies the quality but you will not regret.</li>
            <li> I just received my feather SS folding razor and had to post this.  The Japanese turn out products well engineered with top quality and have no concept of appearance  To put a cheap handle-scale on such a great razor is like putting a Kia logo on a Lexus.  The balance, ease of cleaning and loading blades, the quality of the shave are on the top of their competition.  So is the price they charge.  I just sent my razor out for custom scales because the scale really annoys me.  My SS &amp; DX non folding razor handles are much better then this one.  I know that there are those who will say I should be concerned with the quality of the shave and to those I say:  I wet shave to enjoy the time, like fine wine.  Otherwise I could use a cartridge razor and a can of shaving cream.  If vendors or Feather reps read this, go back to the Japanese and tell them they are selling a product to people who like a well designed products and they are not selling to a Japanese market.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite traditional type razor.  I keep this one in my jacket pocket, and use it for shaving necks, etc.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy as hell to change out razors and clean. I just wish they would have made interchangeable stem pieces... this black one is so plain and made of a very basic plastic.</li>
            <li> Best straight razor use it daily to straighten my beard</li>
            <li> Makes shaving fun again. Excellent design and ergonomics. A well engineered product. The only shortcoming is plastic handle is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> A life changer!  I&#x27;m of indian/pakistani descent and I have the THICKEST beard hair in the world.  I think my beard grows steel needles with a very thick diameter at the base, i can poke holes in paper with my beard.  I never bothered with shaving because nothing could give me a close shave ever.  I&#x27;ve tried safety razors including merkur and edwin jaggers with all sorts of different blades, tried all the mach 3, fusions, and turbos.  Nothing worked despite proper pre shave prep and shaving technique, right after shaving it&#x27;s still rough like sandpaper and my face was still grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feather razor with the pro blades give me the best shave ever.  It&#x27;s not super smooth, but out of everything I&#x27;ve ever tried this has been the closest shave.  Just will take some practice!  It&#x27;s hard to do on neck.</li>
            <li> Awesome ! Exactly what I expected. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Started my journey to straight razor shaving with a Parker replaceable.  It was a cheap way to get started.  First one broke in a couple months.  I enjoyed the shave method, so opted for a better handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need to look further!  Absolutely love this razor!  Weight, design, construction, price....all perfect.  If you&#x27;re thinking about it, pull the trigger.  You will not regret it.  Just be mindful the blades are SHARP!  This makes shaving easier but also be prepared to bleed a bit. :-)</li>
            <li> Bought this item as my first straight razor with the expectation that a replaceable blade would give me one less excuse to accidentally cut myself.  It is amazing!  I am still working up the nerve to use it for a full shave (learning one part of my face at a time)  So far I&#x27;m 4 shaves in, there is no blade movement, and it&#x27;s is still very SHARP!</li>
            <li> A great compromise for beginning to use a straight blade razor. No extra trappings or accessories needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japanese steel is hard to beat, and it&#x27;s quality shows in this folding handle razor. Feather offers 4 different types of blades, from &amp;#34;safety&amp;#34; to incredibly unsafe if one is not accustomed to shaving with a straight blade. To start getting into traditional shaving, this is a good way to go.</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor. I use it with the Feather Pro blades. One pass, and done. Nice weight. Handles well. Only wish it came with a stand to place it it between uses.  I like it better then the Dovo Shavette in SS.</li>
            <li> I bought this Feather SS folding handle straight razor first, then I bought a conventional straight razor, which did not come shave ready.  I shaved with the Feather exclusively for the first month until I got my sharpening stones and strop setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I learn to hone and strop and try to get the conventional straight razor experience, I use the Feather&#x27;s performance as the gold standard I&#x27;m aiming for.  So far, I have not yet come close to duplicating that experience with my straight razor.  It&#x27;s all about that perfect edge, and so far I haven&#x27;t got the knack for producing it on the conventional straight, but with this Feather I just put in a new blade when the current one starts tugging, and it&#x27;s smooth as butter and extremely close and easy shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible the novelty of using a conventional straight razor will wear off someday and I&#x27;ll just fall back to using the Feather exclusively, it&#x27;s just that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion on someone just learning to shave with a straight razor is to start with the Feather.  That way you&#x27;re just concentrating on the shaving technique itself, and not simultaneously trying to learn how to generate and maintain that perfect razor edge.  And while you do working on that sharpening technique on a conventional straight, you know what a truly sharp razor shave feels like.</li>
            <li> I got this razor for Christmas, so I have been using it for a couple of months now. This is my first experience with using a straight razor. I had started using a double edged razor a few months prior to using this razor. There is definatly a steep learning curve with the Feather AC system. But if you watch a couple of videos on youtube, and practice, you&#x27;ll be rewarded with one of the best shaving experiences ever!  It took me about 7 shaves till I really felt comfortable with the razor. Now it is my go to razor to shave with. I get really close shaves without any nicks or razor burn. I use the KAI Captain Mild Pink blades with it. They are really sharp and all so smooth. I get 10 plus shaves with them. I&#x27;ve tried the Feather Professional blades, and they are sharp, but after three shaves they start tugging, and produce nicks and weepers. I also have used the Feather Lites and don&#x27;t reccommend them, they are not sharp enough, they make you push real hard in order to cut hair so you end up with real bad razor burn and still a sub par shave. So if you want to experience straight razor shaving without the honing and stropping, get this razor. From what I&#x27;ve read the feather gives an even closer shave than a traditional straight.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a razor for a fraction of the price of this one and I was very happy.  It performed a lot better than my normal Gillette.  I was curious why this razor was so much more expensive.  I ordered it along with the blades just to see the difference.  It was like night and day.  This razor is incredible.  It feels great in your hand and it gives the user great control.  The blades are amazing and they seem to last for ever.  Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Anyone looking at getting into straight razor shaving now (2014) will notice a few things.  1.) Online retailers (with the exception of a few makes and models) are generally sold out of new traditional straights. 2.) There is no shortage of online info about straights and wet shaving in general. Some is really good, while some seems quite self-obsessive.  3.) There is a wide range of Shavette style straights that use split DE blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially drawn to wet shaving and straight razors initially out of a sense of nostalgia. Having used a variety of safety, traditional straights, and Shavettes - I find the Feather to be a superior product. I don&#x27;t use the Feather exclusively, but find this product delivers.  While there is the hobby aspect to shaving that is ritualized and enjoyable - at the end of the day I&#x27;m looking for a few key elements. I want control and feedback.  I want the closest shave with the least amount of passes and irritation. I want ease of maintenance. The feather delivers on all these requirements. It is why you will see pros using these too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others and purists may vehemently disagree, but I would recommend the Feather SS to a beginning straight shaver above a cheapo Shavette and a traditional straight. This was the route I followed before getting traditional straights, hones and strops, compounds etc.  I believe this razor offers some special advantages. First and foremost, the replaceable blade platform allows the beginner to concentrate primarily on learning proper technique. Second, the blade holder itself has a profile that is like a rounded wedge, along with a rounded tip.  As one is learning how to keep their skin taut and how to shave difficult areas, this design is much more forgiving.  In addition, the handle design coupled with the long tang will easily accommodate various hand sizes.  I find traditional straights can vary. This Feather is very ergonomic.  Third, several blades are available in levels of aggressiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: The Feather SS is a home run as far as razors go. It is worth the money over cheaper Shavettes. I emphasize this to the beginner as this particular straight will deliver results and also a learned confidence to be a proficient shaver should one find they like this method of shaving and want to make the leap into a traditional straight and strop, etc.  Shavettes that use split DE blades don&#x27;t offer much leeway for mistakes and tend to produce deeper nicks IMHO.  Unless one is a professional Barber,  I would recommend the SS over the Feather DX.  Additionally, I have found this razor the most adaptable to other grooming tasks using the pro-guard blades, such as shaving the back of neck.  Each persons whiskers are different, but I get about 10-15 good shaves per blade making this rather economical as well.iveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: The Feather SS is a home run as far as razors go.

            <li> Very happy with this purchase, wish I did it sooner.</li>
            <li> I am a Master Barber in NYS, and we are not allowed to use a traditional straight blade. So having tried several other replaceable straight blades/razors, I decided to splurge and get this. I have to tell you, my clients all praise the difference and swear by how superior it is to my last razor, and I too cannot get over the quality of this razor , and the blades that come with it. It provides the best shave, and it&#x27;s super easy to use if you know how. The shave is the absolutely the closest you can get, and you never need to press hard (which is a major cause of skin irratation). I swear by this razor for all professionals ..... if you need to switch, this is what you want !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning, if you are in experienced BE CAREFUL. this is the sharpest blade you will ever use</li>
            <li> returned item.  Description left the impression blade included.  No blade included</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself to practice with before investing in a $300+ straight razor. After using this straight razor for a couple of weeks, I see no need to spend $300+ on any other straight razor. I&#x27;ll just keep using this one.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little concerned that the handle is plastic, but after using it for a few weeks I&#x27;ve shifted my focus from the plastic to the shave, which is awesome. In fact, I&#x27;ve realized that the plastic handle is actually better for a guy like me who probably should take better care of my stuff.  It won&#x27;t get damaged by water I can easily pull a small cloth through it to clean out any junk. Its my first straight razor, and I&#x27;ve gotten comfortable with it very quickly.  Once I realized that you need VERY little pressure to get a great shave, I stopped cutting myself.  The matte finish is very nice, and provides enough grip even with wet hands. I like how the head easily opens up for cleaning, yet holds the blade securely when in use.</li>
