    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>excellent product, sturdy, delivered on time</li>
            <li>Feather blades are the best and this razor was designed by people who know something about shaving.  </li>
            <li>Excellent razor for the money.</li>
            <li>Husband loves the double-sided blades so much more than the 5-blade disposable razors!!!</li>
            <li>Great Razor Awesome Price.</li>
            <li>Excellent razor for  the beginner or experienced.  </li>
            <li>Good sturdy and retro shaver!</li>
            <li>And this razor works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve learned to get a very good shave with this razor, but I&#x27;m sure I can&#x27;t get that perfect, BBS shave.  </li>
            <li>Great product, Great Seller</li>
            <li>Lightweight but excellent, case is nice for traveling</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Shaves good.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re accustomed to using with a &amp;#34;cartridge&amp;#34; razor... along with hair, you&#x27;re going to lose a good amount of blood and skin.</li>
            <li>Makes a nice travel razor.</li>
            <li>razor itself is nicely made</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t used one before, and you apply the kind of pressure</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>But for $10 more you can buy an all metal Merkur, Edwin James or Parker.</li>
            <li>The difference is that the blades are much better and produce a shave equivalent to the triple blade disposables.</li>
            <li>: its mechanism operates smoothly, it has a decently-knurled handle which provides a sure grip... and for a plastic-handled razor, it also has a fairly nice heft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>many reviewers point out, shaving with a D-E razor is an acquired skill.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a lot more Feather blades</li>
            <li>Best double edge razor I have used.</li>
            <li>Better than the $50.00 - $90.00 razors.</li>
            <li>price and seems quite sturdy - cannot ask for more than that</li>
            <li>- Thanks Amazon and Vendor, great service as always.............  </li>
            <li>I love Feather razor blades.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several others, many of which are excellent and</li>
            <li>Plastic is OK if it suits the purpose and is well engineered and manufactured.  </li>
            <li>I decided that rather spend a fair amount on a really &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; razor, I would delay the decision of which razor to buy and so bought this for the interim.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light and easy to use with a 3 inch handle.</li>
            <li>I get the feeling that the blade not held at the perfectly correct angle; perhaps the blade isn&#x27;t secure because the clamping pressure slightly compresses the plastic.  </li>
            <li>Extremely Light.</li>
            <li>cheap, a lot of the construction, including the bed of the head, is plastic.  </li>
            <li>but you will love  the shave using the right blade.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor for people who don&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money just to try wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>Love the new razor.</li>
            <li>Happily, I remembered that... and my first shave with it resulted in absolutely no nicks or blood-loss whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Love my old time razor!</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s an old design but just works better.</li>
            <li>I cannot speak to the quality of this razor as this is the first non-disposable razor I&#x27;ve owned, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with the service I received from Beauty Point, by the way... and when it comes time to purchase the all-stainless Feather, I will definitely be asking if I can order it from them.</li>
            <li>Sure brings back memories of the way my dad shaved...love it..now to get mug and brush.</li>
            <li>Razor works really well.</li>
            <li>A light touch and multiple passes are needed.</li>
            <li>so much, I&#x27;m tempted to consider purchasing the impossibly-expensive all-stainless-steel one.</li>
            <li>Although it is part plastic, it is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I received the razor on time &amp; it works very well and meets all of my expectations</li>
            <li>I really, really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle of the Schick Krona I had was plastic, and was very well done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>Not bad, considering that my shaving &amp;#34;prep&amp;#34; consists of hot water, and my &amp;#34;shaving cream&amp;#34; is simply a bar of Purpose</li>
            <li>but I finally got fed up with trying to clean the Quattro blades (and wasting tons of money on them), recalled how easy it is to clean a D-E razor (and how inexpensive the blades are), read dozens of customer reviews of different brands here on Amazon, and ultimately settled on this black-handled Feather, which I purchased from Beauty</li>
            <li>It is better than any disposable or other product I have tried.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the more expensive and heavier double edge razors.</li>
            <li>The razor is a TTO, and slightly light..the blades are all I heard they were and more.</li>
            <li>It is a butterfly design, the top opens up in the middle to allow blade insertion and removal when you rotate the knob next to the head of the razor.  </li>
            <li>Gillette Super Speed finally met its end</li>
            <li>BETTER RAZOR THAN THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONES.</li>
            <li>Looks like I&#x27;ll need to make a decision on a new main razor.</li>
            <li>so for me, its craftsmanship and heirloom quality would far outweigh the cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really liked the 4-bladed cartridges, because they get clogged up so easily... but prior to Internet shopping, &amp;#34;supply and demand&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> , we all know that old habits are hard to change...</li>
            <li> not smooth, cut skin, left rash.  </li>
            <li> I have not shaved with a double edge in at least forrty years.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive, has some plastic parts, a little lighter, but will not cut you.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it for a few days now, I have to confess that I like the Feather</li>
            <li> a few of which come close but not quite.  </li>

            <li> sorry I did not mention the name...</li>
            <li> works as expected and cheaper than those awful 5 blade cartridges</li>

            <li> Just what I was looking for and unable to find in any retail stores EVER!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Razor works really well. No problem with skin irritation. Will not go back to multi blade razors. Started shaving with this style razor and will end with this style. Good value.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  Light and easy to use with a 3 inch handle.</li>
            <li> This is an alright travel razor but I&#x27;d rather spend an extra $5-10 on something made with a bit of metal.</li>
            <li> Great Razor Awesome Price.</li>
            <li> Shaves good. Built well. Makes a nice travel razor. But for $10 more you can buy an all metal Merkur, Edwin James or Parker. Extremely Light. No objections to the razor so let your budget be your guide.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor for  the beginner or experienced.  Not aggressive but you will love  the shave using the right blade. I bought two.</li>
            <li> Great product, Great Seller</li>
            <li> Well built razor that reminds me of the razors I used to have when I was younger.  The difference is that the blades are much better and produce a shave equivalent to the triple blade disposables.</li>
            <li> excellent product, sturdy, delivered on time</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband for he was getting sick of Bic Razors.  And this razor works beautifully.  And the blades are cheaper than buying Bic.  Jane</li>
            <li> Purchased this product hoping that it would be less expensive than the disposable razors.  In theory, this is correct; however, the closeness of the shave is compromised.  The disposable three or four blade razors rank higher for close shave.  I cannot speak to the quality of this razor as this is the first non-disposable razor I&#x27;ve owned, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Decades ago, I switched from a D-E razor and started using a Gillette Trac II... but I eventually switched to a Schick Quattro, when the Trac II blades became hard to find. I&#x27;ve never really liked the 4-bladed cartridges, because they get clogged up so easily... but prior to Internet shopping, &amp;#34;supply and demand&amp;#34; ruled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, we all know that old habits are hard to change... but I finally got fed up with trying to clean the Quattro blades (and wasting tons of money on them), recalled how easy it is to clean a D-E razor (and how inexpensive the blades are), read dozens of customer reviews of different brands here on Amazon, and ultimately settled on this black-handled Feather, which I purchased from Beauty Point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is nicely made: its mechanism operates smoothly, it has a decently-knurled handle which provides a sure grip... and for a plastic-handled razor, it also has a fairly nice heft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many reviewers point out, shaving with a D-E razor is an acquired skill. If you haven&#x27;t used one before, and you apply the kind of pressure you&#x27;re accustomed to using with a &amp;#34;cartridge&amp;#34; razor... along with hair, you&#x27;re going to lose a good amount of blood and skin. A light touch and multiple passes are needed. Happily, I remembered that... and my first shave with it resulted in absolutely no nicks or blood-loss whatsoever. It also resulted in the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in the past forty years. Not bad, considering that my shaving &amp;#34;prep&amp;#34; consists of hot water, and my &amp;#34;shaving cream&amp;#34; is simply a bar of Purpose soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few days now, I have to confess that I like the Feather so much, I&#x27;m tempted to consider purchasing the impossibly-expensive all-stainless-steel one. I do tend to like super-high-precision, beautifully-crafted and well-engineered mechanisms... so for me, its craftsmanship and heirloom quality would far outweigh the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with the service I received from Beauty Point, by the way... and when it comes time to purchase the all-stainless Feather, I will definitely be asking if I can order it from them.</li>
            <li> Love the new razor. I know it&#x27;s an old design but just works better. Will save $ big time over time.</li>
            <li> not smooth, cut skin, left rash.  not happy at all</li>
            <li> I was not prepared for such a horrible experience. I have not shaved with a double edge in at least forrty years.  Sometimes you just cant go backwards!</li>
            <li> Love my old time razor!</li>
            <li> sticking to dispoasables, it tore me up</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, has some plastic parts, a little lighter, but will not cut you.  This is a great razor for people who don&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money just to try wet shaving.  Feather blades are the best and this razor was designed by people who know something about shaving.  I use it as my travel razor because it is more forgiving than the heavier, all-brass, chrome plated, expensive razors that are typically used by wet shaving enthusiasts.  The parts that need to be made of metal are made of metal - use it with feather blades and you won&#x27;t get cut.  It is a butterfly design, the top opens up in the middle to allow blade insertion and removal when you rotate the knob next to the head of the razor.  Comes in a plastic box with several blades.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the more expensive and heavier double edge razors.</li>
            <li> I was going to give up on DE shaving until I bought the razor and the two Feather blades packages with it. The razor is a TTO, and slightly light..the blades are all I heard they were and more. Now I&#x27;m sold and the combination is all I&#x27;m going to use. I&#x27;ve bought a lot more Feather blades and I&#x27;m going to continue to get 6-7 twp pass blades each blade.</li>
            <li> Good sturdy and retro shaver!</li>
            <li> Sure brings back memories of the way my dad shaved...love it..now to get mug and brush.Can&#x27;t beat the cost...Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Excellent razor for the money. Although it is part plastic, it is very sturdy. Best double edge razor I have used. Better than the $50.00 - $90.00 razors.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and unable to find in any retail stores EVER!!!  They (the stores) sell the blades but not the razors....  GO FIGURE!&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price and seems quite sturdy - cannot ask for more than that - Thanks Amazon and Vendor, great service as always.............  Just wanted to add that the vendor is Beauty Point, sorry I did not mention the name...</li>
            <li> Husband loves the double-sided blades so much more than the 5-blade disposable razors!!!</li>
            <li> I received the razor on time &amp; it works very well and meets all of my expectations</li>
            <li> I love Feather razor blades.  I&#x27;ve tried several others, many of which are excellent and a few of which come close but not quite.  I also have the Feather travel razor, which I really, really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my 1949 Gillette Super Speed finally met its end (but I won&#x27;t throw it away!) I decided that rather spend a fair amount on a really &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; razor, I would delay the decision of which razor to buy and so bought this for the interim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, a lot of the construction, including the bed of the head, is plastic.  Plastic is OK if it suits the purpose and is well engineered and manufactured.  The handle of the Schick Krona I had was plastic, and was very well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the plastic part of the head of this doesn&#x27;t seem to work well.  I get the feeling that the blade not held at the perfectly correct angle; perhaps the blade isn&#x27;t secure because the clamping pressure slightly compresses the plastic.  I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve learned to get a very good shave with this razor, but I&#x27;m sure I can&#x27;t get that perfect, BBS shave.  Looks like I&#x27;ll need to make a decision on a new main razor.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor. It is better than any disposable or other product I have tried. Makes shaving a pleasure</li>
            <li> Lightweight but excellent, case is nice for traveling</li>
            <li> works as expected and cheaper than those awful 5 blade cartridges</li>
            <li> BETTER RAZOR THAN THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONES. I bought a kit from parker and discovered that the razor is made out of brass.I dropped it twice and it broke.</li>
