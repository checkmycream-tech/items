            <li>I have used this product for more than 30 years and now Mary Kay has discontinued it.</li>
            <li>I received my first tube in a cosmetic bag during a \\&quot;Look good, feel better\\&quot; session sponsored by the AmericanCancer Society while undergoing&lt;br /&gt;treatment for breast cancer.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, takes off my make-up easily.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay for almost 70 years &amp; although I prefer the original formula, this one is super</li>
            <li>So many times I&#x27;ve been complimented about my skin being so soft and wrinkle free.</li>

            <li>Would love to find another brand like it and am looking along with many other women</li>

            <li>I believe there is more air in the tube than product for the exact same price.  </li>
            <li>Look forward to buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>It is water soluble and and is good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Since it has become difficult to find, I am delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The original formula for dry to normal cleansing cream was a more translucent type than this and worked for me for 38 years Can&#x27;t buy it anymore</li>
            <li>its not expensive, its gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>This product is a long time favorite.</li>
            <li>Totally love this product because it works miracles for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It was a discontinued product from Mary Kay and felt lucky that I was able to find it, I knew it was a good product, too bad Mary Kay stopped making it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle</li>
            <li>Also gentle on skin.  </li>

            <li>and my skin is now so soft and radiant.  </li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product, but it&#x27;s no longer being produced by Mary Kay, so getting it here may be your only option.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, non-greasy, and adds moisture to my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>However since those favor products have been removed, I found no other in the Mary Kay line that live up to the same quality, result, feeling or satisfaction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other gentle cleansers, but none left my face feeling so soft as this one did.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin out but cleans it well.</li>
            <li>However in the past years I believe I am not getting my money&#x27;s worth because the content in the tube does not feel the same.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every single over the counter and department store cleanser for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The other so-called gentle cleansers still left my face dry.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have been using Mary Kay cleanser for approx. 36 years.  I&#x27;ve tried others but always come back to this one.  I expecially love the way it removes eye make-up and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> In the past I have purchased facial cleansers in department store for a low cost price. I always loved Mary Kay products, however thought they were too pricey for my budget. Recently my niece told me that she had bought her Mary Kay products on amazon.com so I decided to give it a try. let me tell you, the Mary kay Cleansing Cream leaves my face cleansed and feeling soft and moist. I can now afford to use Mary Kay when purchased on Amazon.com. You will love being pampered also!!</li>
            <li> It is a good cleanser. I like its creamy texture and how my skin feels after. I have dry skin type, so this cleanser worked well for me: no dryness after washing the face.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay has stopped making this formula so I was glad to get it online.  I received the product and it was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay for almost 70 years &amp; although I prefer the original formula, this one is super, I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Usual fast and dependable service.  This formula cleansing cream has been discontinued.  I am happy to find a supplier and dread when all sources are depleted.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single over the counter and department store cleanser for sensitive skin. This product works without drying or irritation.  I follow it with the MK Freshener and then use the MK Balancing Moisturizer.  A great trio of products it&#x27;s taken years to find. I highly recommend all 3 products.</li>
            <li> I use to love getting this product because it works for my dry/oily skin.  However in the past years I believe I am not getting my money&#x27;s worth because the content in the tube does not feel the same.  I believe there is more air in the tube than product for the exact same price.  This is very unfair to your loyal customers.</li>
            <li> It was a discontinued product from Mary Kay and felt lucky that I was able to find it, I knew it was a good product, too bad Mary Kay stopped making it.</li>
            <li> Love Mary Kay Products used them for many years.  People want to know my secret to few wrinkles at my age.</li>
            <li> I love this product and was sad when the company discontinued both the cleansing cream and the moisturizer.  The product they are now selling does not even compare to this one.  Arrived on time and as promised.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I wish I could still get this.  I loved it but now Mary Kay switched products again and you can&#x27;t get it. Bummer!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for many years.  It is gentle, non-greasy, and adds moisture to my dry skin.  I am devastated that Mary Kay has discontinued it!</li>
            <li> Box showed a little wear, but as far as I could tell, actual product was just fine; and I have had no complaints from customer who bought it from me.</li>
            <li> The original formula for dry to normal cleansing cream was a more translucent type than this and worked for me for 38 years Can&#x27;t buy it anymore so I will look for another brand.</li>
            <li> I am discussed that Mary Kay continues to remove products that are customer favorites. Even with complaints about the discontinuation and request to call back the product, Mary Kay doesn&#x27;t seem too have a concern for customer preference. They discontinued the Advanced Moisture Renewal Creme and the Gentle Cleansing Creme Formula 1 which were two of the best products they carried. Those items were replaced with the Botanical Effects products which are like putting wax on your face. I hate to use these words, but.....they SUCK! I&#x27;ve been a Mary Kay user since 1975 and was always please with the product. So many times I&#x27;ve been complimented about my skin being so soft and wrinkle free. However since those favor products have been removed, I found no other in the Mary Kay line that live up to the same quality, result, feeling or satisfaction. That leaves me with only one choice. After all these years, I now how to shop for a different product line.......Goodbye Mary Kay. I think she would turn over I her grave if she could see what has become of her company and products. Hope the family is proud....I sure wouldn&#x27;t be if I were them.</li>
            <li> Love it and it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt; Wish I could get more with out having to take out a loan.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like I will have to try the botanical stuff. I hope its better than the samples that I tried.</li>
            <li> As always CLASSIC marykay is the best! Wish they woul keep it &amp; as always found what I neede on AMAZON!</li>
            <li> Awesome to find this again!  I was a user of this product for 17 yrs.  Only cleanser that ever worked for me!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.  Just wish Mary Kay had not discontinued it.  Would love to find another brand like it and am looking along with many other women it appears.W</li>
            <li> It just does the job. its not expensive, its gentle on my skin. my face does not feel like its craking after I use it, period!</li>
            <li> Glad to find this product online.  It is a favorite and it leaves your face silky smooth after cleansing. Great product, very gentle.</li>
            <li> Delighted to find this product on Amazon.  Have used it for 45+ years, using NOTHING else.  A shame it has been discontinued by the maker...hope  I can continue to locate &amp;#34;leftovers&amp;#34; on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I attempted to replace my  Extra Emolliant Cleansing cream that I use as an eye make up remover as well. They quit making the Extra Emolliant... this doesn&#x27;t even come close and burns my eyes badly...What a dissapointment.</li>
            <li> I loved this cleanser!  I can&#x27;t believe Mary Kay is no longer going to make it.  I&#x27;ve tried other gentle cleansers, but none left my face feeling so soft as this one did.  The other so-called gentle cleansers still left my face dry.  I guess I will have to try the department store makeup brands.</li>
            <li> I am worried that they have stopped making this brand. It is my favorite item from Mary Kay. It is so gentle</li>
            <li> Love the product, takes off my make-up easily. Look forward to buying more in the future. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find these available on Amazon. I have used this product for more than 30 years and now Mary Kay has discontinued it. I will be very disappointed when these run out!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, but it&#x27;s no longer being produced by Mary Kay, so getting it here may be your only option.</li>
            <li> Totally love this product because it works miracles for my dry skin. It does not dry my skin out but cleans it well.</li>
            <li> I received my first tube in a cosmetic bag during a \\&quot;Look good, feel better\\&quot; session sponsored by the AmericanCancer Society while undergoing&lt;br /&gt;treatment for breast cancer.  I had never used a Mary Kay product before and what a difference my face and neck felt after one use.  I use it e4very&lt;br /&gt;day and my skin is now so soft and radiant.  It was so nice to find it on Amazon and nice to my pocketbook.</li>
            <li> This product is a long time favorite. It is water soluble and and is good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Since it has become difficult to find, I am delighted to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very good cleanser. I am sorry that it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> This product is excellence for very dry skin.  Keeping face moist, it help keep the look of wrinkles down.  Also gentle on skin.  Janice Merritt</li>
            <li> The product was very runny like it had melted. It was hard to use as it poured out of the tube and had no substance.</li>
            <li> I received my product when promised and was so very glad to find this product.</li>
