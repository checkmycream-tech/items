            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This works great on my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, and it does not leave my hair sticky.</li>
            <li>This product by far is the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>This allows for a nice curling effect and many have commented on the softness and appeal of the curls as my hair lengthens.</li>
            <li>but I liked my sample better.</li>
            <li>I love the nice smell as well.</li>
            <li>I go back to this product as I think it makes my curls look almost perfect.</li>
            <li>Aquage products so much better.</li>
            <li>Use your styling gel after your hair dries for more hold.  </li>
            <li>It suits my type of hair more.</li>
            <li>What more do you want?</li>
            <li>I have used many curling products before.</li>
            <li>really glad I found it..</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It helps get the maximum curl with minimum frizz and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy like most curling balms/gels do.  </li>
            <li>The problem was the cling wrap stuff wrapped around the top of bottle</li>
            <li>After 20 minutes of wrestling with it, the top popped off and product splattered all over my kitchen.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I like my Deva Curl styling cream a lot more.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Oh yea, it has a very light fresh scent that does not compete with perfume.</li>
            <li>The product came on time and was securely packaged.</li>
            <li>blam makes my hair full, and then I can leave it wavy, or I can scrunch it up and make it curly, and it doesn’t contain a lot of alcohol, so after a month of use, I don’t see any split ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found an old sample of KMS Activator, a finishing product for natural curly hair when cleaning out a drawer, so I tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li>Use it on wet hair or dry, this stuff is awesome.  </li>
            <li>People have frequently told me how much they love my curls.  </li>
            <li>(Alcohol is the first ingredient in it, so I don’t want to use it,</li>
            <li>Don’t use too much!</li>
            <li>This is my first use of this particular curling balm.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much, either.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Buying it on-line is sooo much cheaper than at the salon.  </li>
            <li>Plus this is coming straight from the supplier.  </li>
            <li>Ive used this for many years to achieve a wet curly look for the summer.</li>
            <li>I use it before the cream after I washed my hair and my hair looks good for a few days,I don&#x27;t have to blow dry and my hair is very easy to manage,I will recommended to all those people that have long hair and curls.</li>
            <li>Only need a small amout and it leaves my curls beautifully shaped without making my hair feel stiff like so many gel products do.</li>
            <li>It can be full and wavy, or it can be flat and straight, depending on the weather, humidity, and the mood it’s in for the day.</li>
            <li>Will go back to my original product but keep as a back up product.</li>
            <li>I would suggest less wrapping at top next time.</li>
            <li>My curls are controlled, and soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years now; keeps it from getting frizzy and gives my curls soft definition.</li>
            <li>It helps my naturally curly hair to not be so frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love ordering it on Amazon because it is less expensive then getting it at a beauty store :).</li>
            <li>But if want my hair more curly, I use a little dollop on it after it’s dry, scrunch it and diffuse</li>
            <li>I have long and very curly hair that tends to get dry/frizzy at times.  </li>
            <li>Then I dry it with a diffuser and comb it out gently with a pick.</li>
            <li>have shoulder-length, rather thick hair that is somewhat fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now with consistent</li>

            <li> Aquage products so much better.</li>
            <li> This product promotes curls and has a small amount of hold, but not too much.  Works perfect on curly hair.  Use your styling gel after your hair dries for more hold.  This works perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product! If you want something to help bring out your curly or wavy hair, this is it. Unlike other products for curly hair, this is NOT to tame or tone-down your curls or to reduce frizz. It brings out my curls and waves. Plus, it doesn’t leave my hair crunchy, like the spray version does. (Alcohol is the first ingredient in it, so I don’t want to use it, anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder-length, rather thick hair that is somewhat fine. It can be full and wavy, or it can be flat and straight, depending on the weather, humidity, and the mood it’s in for the day. ☺. It’s also prone to split ends, so I have to watch using products with lots of alcohol in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blam makes my hair full, and then I can leave it wavy, or I can scrunch it up and make it curly, and it doesn’t contain a lot of alcohol, so after a month of use, I don’t see any split ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair is wet, I comb it through from my ears down. Don’t use too much! Then I dry it with a diffuser and comb it out gently with a pick. It’s super-full at this point. But if want my hair more curly, I use a little dollop on it after it’s dry, scrunch it and diffuse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used to help bring out my curls without damaging my hair.</li>

            <li> I use KMS products a lot.  This is my first use of this particular curling balm.  It&#x27;s good but I&#x27;m going back to my other KMS curling product; Curl Up wave foam, mousse.  It suits my type of hair more.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy at all. Smells good too!</li>

            <li> This may be good for some hair but it just did nothing for mine.</li>
            <li> Great product..really glad I found it..they&lt;br /&gt;No longer sell this in beauty stores...thanks</li>
            <li> Use it on wet hair or dry, this stuff is awesome.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and will continue to buy it through Amazon because the price is great.  And it&#x27;s always in stock and ships immediately.  I can&#x27;t always find it at Ulta or Trade Secret.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on reviews.  I have long and very curly hair that tends to get dry/frizzy at times.  I put a small amount into my wet hair after I wash/condition it.  I then let my hair air dry.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now with consistent results.&lt;br /&gt;After I started using this, I immediately started getting compliments!  People have frequently told me how much they love my curls.  I love this product. It&#x27;s now a standard part of my morning routine when I wear my hair curly.</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that this is an excellent product for curly haired girls.  It helps get the maximum curl with minimum frizz and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy like most curling balms/gels do.  I had to take a star off due to the packaging.  The product came on time and was securely packaged. The problem was the cling wrap stuff wrapped around the top of bottle so it wouldn&#x27;t open/leak. I could not unwrap it or cut it off because it was so tightly wrapped. After 20 minutes of wrestling with it, the top popped off and product splattered all over my kitchen. I would suggest less wrapping at top next time.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It helps my naturally curly hair to not be so frizzy.  Keeps curls separated as well.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair. This stuff gives it the right amount of control, without leaving my hair hard and crunchy.  Buying it on-line is sooo much cheaper than at the salon.  Plus this is coming straight from the supplier.  Love it!!</li>
