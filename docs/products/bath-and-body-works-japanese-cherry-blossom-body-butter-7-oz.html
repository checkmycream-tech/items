    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful stuff.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase of the body cream.</li>
            <li>All the body butter products are discontinued at Bath and Body works, which is a shame because they are really great.  </li>
            <li>Love this product - keeps my skin from racking all day and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The most delicious smell!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scent, and the body butter is just wonderful!  </li>
            <li>To be fair, though, maybe it just didn&#x27;t work with my body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it smells so good.  </li>
            <li>The best body butter a person could have in their possession by far.</li>
            <li>This was overwhelmingly fruity-floral.  </li>
            <li>The condition on delivery was great, the time it took to get it was fast.  </li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>It help keep my body smmmooth :)</li>
            <li>Great shipping time and very affordable, will not be buying these at the mall anymore:)</li>
            <li>This smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes well without leaving an oily residue, and perfect for back rubs!</li>
            <li>I put this on after my bath at night and still smelled the lovely scent in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it might be greasy if you do.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and it makes my skin soooo smooth.</li>
            <li>scent is too strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and exotic</li>
            <li>The scent is like a cheap soap.</li>
            <li>The scent smells mostly like a very light floral powder on me in the body butter form, but it&#x27;s such a lovely scent to wear to bed.  </li>
            <li>this product not only smells good but goes on like the butter</li>
            <li>I know most people love the Japanese Cherry Blossom</li>
            <li>Would very much buy again.  </li>
            <li>but I personally like something with a bit more vanilla.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance got very soft sweet flower like smell.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and did not irritate my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very creamy, smell wonder and keeps the skin soft.  </li>
            <li>i normally buy this product at bath and body,it did not smell,</li>
            <li>the plus side, it made my skin feel very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>but it is good for office wear where u require little subtle but mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>more like a very heavy, cloying perfume that bothered my sinuses.  </li>
            <li>I received the one with the black lid that is currently available in the bath &amp; body stores now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and the store by me isn&#x27;t sure if it will be carried any more :(.</li>
            <li>The thick and creamy sweet and soothing smell i was expecting.</li>

            <li> My coworker loves and went crazy when she thought she lost her all most finished jar so thought I would order it for her bday HOWEVER this isn&#x27;t the item received. The picture is misleading because the one show wasn&#x27;t the one sent. I received the one with the black lid that is currently available in the bath &amp; body stores now but the scent is very different.</li>
            <li> scent is too strong.  I like a lotion that is scented but not overpowering.  Will not buy this scent again.</li>
            <li> I got it through online purchase and using it currently. This fragrance got very soft sweet flower like smell. Stays for a longtime but u don&#x27;t find it that it is there on ur body. And later I kinda of find it is boring and stopped using it. Yeh but it is good for office wear where u require little subtle but mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> I hate writing bad reviews, but I didn&#x27;t care for this product at all.  I know most people love the Japanese Cherry Blossom but I personally like something with a bit more vanilla.  This was overwhelmingly fruity-floral.  Most descriptions make it sound like a soft floral scent, but this smelled terrible on me...more like a very heavy, cloying perfume that bothered my sinuses.  To be fair, though, maybe it just didn&#x27;t work with my body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it made my skin feel very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Love this product - keeps my skin from racking all day and smells wonderful.  Even have my husband use it on his hands from working with various computer components all day.  I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and the store by me isn&#x27;t sure if it will be carried any more :(.</li>
            <li> The condition on delivery was great, the time it took to get it was fast.  The product is so creamy and it smells so good.  I love the product and I would purchase it again from Amozon.  I recommend it to everyone that likes the scent</li>
            <li> Ordered 3 items only got one.</li>
            <li> The thick and creamy sweet and soothing smell i was expecting. I am happy with my purchase of the body cream. It help keep my body smmmooth :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff.  Very creamy, smell wonder and keeps the skin soft.  Would very much buy again.  Friend asking where I purchased.</li>
            <li> this product is well known for every body . I have been using it since long time and I recommended it for every body to use as it seems no site affect for me.</li>
            <li> I received it unsealed and half used. I am returning it. The scent is like a cheap soap.</li>
            <li> The best body butter a person could have in their possession by far. The smell stays with you all day.</li>
            <li> i normally buy this product at bath and body,it did not smell,the same.and i will not purchase this again or recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it makes my skin soooo smooth. I use is every day. My husband loves the scent also.</li>
            <li> this product not only smells good but goes on like the butter Im used to at the mall. I was afraid it would be a knock off but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be. Great shipping time and very affordable, will not be buying these at the mall anymore:)</li>
            <li> This smells lovely.  All the body butter products are discontinued at Bath and Body works, which is a shame because they are really great.  Moisturizes well without leaving an oily residue, and perfect for back rubs!</li>
            <li> The most delicious smell! It&#x27;s sweet and exotic</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent, and the body butter is just wonderful!  The scent smells mostly like a very light floral powder on me in the body butter form, but it&#x27;s such a lovely scent to wear to bed.  I put this on after my bath at night and still smelled the lovely scent in the morning.  This tub will last me a long time...I only needed a tiny bit.  Don&#x27;t go overboard on how much you put on...I&#x27;m sure it might be greasy if you do.  I didn&#x27;t find it to be greasy at all.  It absorbed quickly and did not irritate my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
