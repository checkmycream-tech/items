            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Best pencil eyeliner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It went on perfectly and lasted all day.</li>
            <li>They must have changed the formula because it no longer has these awesome qualities.</li>
            <li>I have tried Maybelline&#x27;s Great Wear and Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay</li>
            <li>This is a great eyeliner.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner works great</li>
            <li>Great buy and GREAT service from AMAZON.</li>
            <li>Prestige is great cause it doesn&#x27;t smudge and its water proof</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great price</li>
            <li>but I am happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I just ordered more!!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>Good coverage and goes on well.</li>
            <li>Really good eyeliner, wore it all day and didn&#x27;t fear it smudging</li>
            <li>Very precise and longlasting!  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was rather easy to take off as well, which was I happy for.</li>
            <li>That said, it doesn&#x27;t smudge or run on its own at all, so that shouldn&#x27;t be a concern for anyone.</li>
            <li>Nice color and texture.</li>
            <li>It shows up nicely but doesn&#x27;t wear well.</li>
            <li>It looks nice and doesn&#x27;t make eyes itchy or uncomfy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to do a cat eye shape with this.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>This is better than any brand for longevity and smoothness that I have bought.</li>
            <li>more waterproof than most</li>
            <li>I love this eye liner, i went to a bunch of store comparing prices.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love this pencil.</li>
            <li>And still love it.</li>
            <li>People with eye allergies like me will love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It has more pigmentation than brands like Covergirl, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was any better than NYX which sells eyeliner at a better price.</li>
            <li>Nice true blue-black color.</li>
            <li>I often end up rubbing it off before it wears off, so it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this eye liner and am soooooo happy i was able to order it online due to the fact that i cannot find it in stores anywhere anymore.</li>
            <li>I love this easy, long-lasting liner.</li>
            <li>I can easily smudge it with my finger - but that&#x27;s perfectly okay with me because I like makeup that I can remove easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on as easy as some others.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, lasts for hours</li>
            <li>My daughter says it&#x27;s one of the best black kohl, all day wear eyeliners on the market.</li>
            <li>So smooth going on, stays on all day, and easy to take off at night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for a more smudgy/soft line, but if you like a precision line or very intense line, this isn&#x27;t the right eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and stays in place, even under water.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and without dragging.</li>
            <li>have purchased $20 eyeliners and I have experienced the same results.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Glides on smooth and stays in place</li>
            <li>This does not go on smooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be switching from my old pencil liner to this, because I think it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li>only ordered one because it seemed too cheap to be this good.</li>
            <li>I love eyeliner, but didn&#x27;t feel like this was necessarily one of my better buys.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a more subtle look.</li>
            <li>Still smudges onto my eyelids, but it gives a great black line which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>With the others I always had to warm up the applicator first by pressing it for 30 seconds or so in my hand or holding it up next to a light bulb on my vanity.</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>It was amazing I am good for now will start back up in few months.</li>
            <li>Stays on for a good while, and doesn&#x27;t cry all down my face.</li>
            <li>Which is why it surprised me that this comes off so easily, and I feel like it might not be as waterproof as people want it to be, if that&#x27;s a quality they&#x27;re looking for in their eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Lasts the whole work day!</li>
            <li>glad I found it doesn&#x27;t end up allover my face in flakes like my former eyeliner did .</li>
            <li>Regardless, this doesn&#x27;t perform as I had hoped and I&#x27;m glad I got it for the low price I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>so therefore it doesn&#x27;t draw a nice black line.</li>
            <li>At that point, it came out as a very light gray and the point of the eyeliner felt rough and scratchy against my eye.</li>
            <li>I even have really oily skin, and it still stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and nothing had a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I used to use almay but it smudges too much.</li>
            <li>lol sorry TMI  ; )</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate and this may be why it smears.</li>
            <li>this is my new go to eyeliner .  </li>
            <li>and i live in arizona</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t glide on as smoothly as I would like, and pulls a little.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyelids and contacts</li>
            <li>After about 4 hours of wearing I have to re-apply because the color is almost completely off.</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t as dark as I would like, but it does last all day and comes off easily with make up remover.</li>
            <li>Even in cold weather this liner applies much more smoothly than similar liners I&#x27;ve been using from Estee Lauder and Lancome.</li>
            <li>It worked for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>I liked it but it smudges a little in the beginning, you have to wait for it to dry for at least 3 minutes before doing anything else with ur eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, not great.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s fine, not great.</li>
            <li> This particular one is completely dried  like an expired product .</li>
            <li> I got black, it is not a rich black, and it fades to gray very quickly ans smears.  </li>
            <li> After seeing the good reviews, I thought I would try to replace my brand name black eyeliner with a less expensive knock off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stay long time, waterproof and don&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> Contains parabens and a few other questionable ingredients ready to be absorbed by my eyes.</li>
            <li> When I got it, it seemed dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch like other eyeliners do.  </li>
            <li> Color was sharp, the eyeliner was in fact &amp;#34;self-sharpening&amp;#34; and it did everything it said it would do.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t broke at the tip like other eye liners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands that refuse to roll up -- 3 separate purchases.</li>
            <li> The only thing I might be afraid of is if the stick breaks off because its not that much product, Regardless I give it 4 stars out of 5.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they start to look gray after the makeup has worn down a bit, but that doesn&#x27;t happen to me with this at all.</li>
            <li> They always run out of the black.</li>
            <li> and it still looks black, which isn&#x27;t always the case with pencil liners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plenty black for my taste.</li>
            <li> Hard dry</li>
            <li> Would not recommend or purchase again, as I typically have one eyeliner pencil for a few months.</li>
            <li> So I have my husband  go on line and order me a few at a time.</li>
            <li> But then, after a week or two, it dried out.</li>
            <li> I wore it out a few times and looked like a raccoon by the end of the night.</li>
            <li> I usually use Revlon colorstay or Yves Roche.</li>
            <li> Hard to find at stores.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Prestige&#x27;s version does not fade or dull as the day goes by.  </li>
            <li> I got it for my mom, she loves these pencils but can&#x27;t find them at the drug store lately.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt bother me in the least.</li>
            <li> At least it rolls up.</li>
            <li> The point is blunt and makes a very thick line, it&#x27;s hard to taper.</li>
            <li> Certainly not as good as the reviews would indicate.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day and it goes on with a thin or thick line.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to stay away from waterproof makeup, because from past experience it&#x27;s really difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to put on and does not stay on.</li>
            <li> I am so very disappointed.... and will be moving on to find a new eyeliner.</li>
            <li> To me this beats expensive brands.</li>
            <li> (I hate it when a liner is too hard and just grabs my eyelid instead of smoothing the color across it.</li>
            <li> It is too bad that I cannot find Prestige in brick and mortar stores anymore.  </li>

            <li> It was amazing I am good for now will start back up in few months. Thank you no complaints. Would rate a 5 star</li>
            <li> Buy this one!  Good coverage and goes on well.</li>
            <li> Best Eyeliner I ever used. Doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch like other eyeliners do.  Hard to find at stores.&lt;br /&gt; They always run out of the black. So I have my husband  go on line and order me a few at a time.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Does not run</li>
            <li> Still smudges onto my eyelids, but it gives a great black line which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the type of girl who wears makeup even to the beach, this eyeliner is perfect for you.  It glides on smoothly and stays in place, even under water.</li>
            <li> I have been using Prestige Waterproof Automatic Eyeliners for the last 5 years.  I have tried Maybelline&#x27;s Great Wear and Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay waterproof automatic versions and neither of them can match the quality or price of Prestige.  Prestige&#x27;s version does not fade or dull as the day goes by.  Then again, it isn&#x27;t supposed to since it is waterproof, right?  This is, however, a problem I encountered with both, Maybelline and Revlon.  It is too bad that I cannot find Prestige in brick and mortar stores anymore.  But, thankfully, there is Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to stay away from waterproof makeup, because from past experience it&#x27;s really difficult to remove. Which is why it surprised me that this comes off so easily, and I feel like it might not be as waterproof as people want it to be, if that&#x27;s a quality they&#x27;re looking for in their eye makeup. I can easily smudge it with my finger - but that&#x27;s perfectly okay with me because I like makeup that I can remove easily. That said, it doesn&#x27;t smudge or run on its own at all, so that shouldn&#x27;t be a concern for anyone. I even have really oily skin, and it still stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This definitely lasts all day, too. I can wear it for hours and it still looks black, which isn&#x27;t always the case with pencil liners. Sometimes they start to look gray after the makeup has worn down a bit, but that doesn&#x27;t happen to me with this at all. I&#x27;m going to be switching from my old pencil liner to this, because I think it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li> I love this easy, long-lasting liner. Got it for next to nothing- only ordered one because it seemed too cheap to be this good. Goes on smoothly and without dragging. I usually use Revlon colorstay or Yves Roche. This is better than any brand for longevity and smoothness that I have bought. I have sensitive eyelids and contacts and it doesnt bother me in the least. No irritation. Stays put all day unless you rub it. Nice true blue-black color. Five stars!!! One lasted about 3 months. I just ordered more!!</li>
            <li> My daughter says it&#x27;s one of the best black kohl, all day wear eyeliners on the market. And she&#x27;s tried a million of them it seems.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day. I wore this to a music festival and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a truly waterproof, all day eyeliner. My biggest problem is tearing from allergies. I often end up rubbing it off before it wears off, so it works pretty good. Nice color and texture.</li>
            <li> more waterproof than most</li>
            <li> After seeing the good reviews, I thought I would try to replace my brand name black eyeliner with a less expensive knock off. It worked for the first few weeks. Color was sharp, the eyeliner was in fact &amp;#34;self-sharpening&amp;#34; and it did everything it said it would do. But then, after a week or two, it dried out. At that point, it came out as a very light gray and the point of the eyeliner felt rough and scratchy against my eye. Would not recommend or purchase again, as I typically have one eyeliner pencil for a few months.</li>
            <li> Very precise and longlasting!  Easiest eyeliner to apply that I&#x27;ve ever had .</li>
            <li> Lasts the whole work day!</li>
            <li> Really good eyeliner, wore it all day and didn&#x27;t fear it smudging everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;It was rather easy to take off as well, which was I happy for.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner. It stays on all day and it goes on with a thin or thick line. It never needs to be sharpened either.</li>
            <li> I gave this eyeliner a 4 star because it state waterproof but at the end of the day the eyeliner is under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I only place it on my upper eyelids. However, I have yet to find a smudge, waterproof, eyeliner that does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased $20 eyeliners and I have experienced the same results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week but this is awesome. Goes on smooth. Lasts all day. The biggest reservation that I have are the ingredients. Contains parabens and a few other questionable ingredients ready to be absorbed by my eyes. That said, I will probably not purchase again for this reason. If you are not bothered by ingredients, this eyeliner is a dream.</li>
            <li> this is my new go to eyeliner .  glad I found it doesn&#x27;t end up allover my face in flakes like my former eyeliner did . I no longer have to check my face constantly.</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeliner. Goes on smoothly. Very easy to do a cat eye shape with this. The only thing I might be afraid of is if the stick breaks off because its not that much product, Regardless I give it 4 stars out of 5.</li>
            <li> I love this eye liner, i went to a bunch of store comparing prices. and nothing had a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this eyeliner. It shows up nicely but doesn&#x27;t wear well. I wore it out a few times and looked like a raccoon by the end of the night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It doesn&#x27;t glide on as smoothly as I would like, and pulls a little. The color isn&#x27;t as dark as I would like, but it does last all day and comes off easily with make up remover. I won&#x27;t buy it again, but I will use it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner works great, it stays on a while, unless your eyes are watering.</li>
            <li> Certainly not as good as the reviews would indicate. I got black, it is not a rich black, and it fades to gray very quickly ans smears.  I live in a very humid climate and this may be why it smears. The point is blunt and makes a very thick line, it&#x27;s hard to taper. I tend to stay away from pencils because of this, and was under the impression that this was a liquid in a pen, my mistake. Regardless, this doesn&#x27;t perform as I had hoped and I&#x27;m glad I got it for the low price I did.</li>
            <li> I love this pencil. It&#x27;s stay long time, waterproof and don&#x27;t irritate my eyes. And you don&#x27;t have to sharpen it. Great buy and GREAT service from AMAZON. Thank you!</li>
            <li> To me this beats expensive brands. Is truly waterproof doesnt smudge and last all day. Ive been wearing this for yrs. And still love it. Glides on smooth and stays in place</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I can&#x27;t find one like that!!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this eye liner and am soooooo happy i was able to order it online due to the fact that i cannot find it in stores anywhere anymore. People with eye allergies like me will love this stuff. I used to use almay but it smudges too much. Prestige is great cause it doesn&#x27;t smudge and its water proof and i live in arizona so i sweat a lot lol sorry TMI  ; )</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, lasts for hours</li>
            <li> When I got it, it seemed dry. It is very hard to put on and does not stay on. Do not buy</li>
            <li> Best pencil eyeliner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this! So smooth going on, stays on all day, and easy to take off at night. Hasn&#x27;t broke at the tip like other eye liners.</li>
            <li> I love eyeliner, but didn&#x27;t feel like this was necessarily one of my better buys. It has more pigmentation than brands like Covergirl, but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was any better than NYX which sells eyeliner at a better price. I will use it until it is gone but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and it&#x27;s a great price (I got 2 of them for $4). I didn&#x27;t expect that but I am happy I purchased it. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> You know, I think this is the one I prefer. At least it rolls up. I&#x27;ve tried other brands that refuse to roll up -- 3 separate purchases. So I&#x27;m sticking with this one. It&#x27;s plenty black for my taste. Stays on for a good while, and doesn&#x27;t cry all down my face.</li>
            <li> I liked it but it smudges a little in the beginning, you have to wait for it to dry for at least 3 minutes before doing anything else with ur eyes. It looks nice and doesn&#x27;t make eyes itchy or uncomfy.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for 10 years. This particular one is completely dried  like an expired product . No way to use it . Hard dry</li>
            <li> Even in cold weather this liner applies much more smoothly than similar liners I&#x27;ve been using from Estee Lauder and Lancome. That alone makes me prefer it to the others. (I hate it when a liner is too hard and just grabs my eyelid instead of smoothing the color across it. With the others I always had to warm up the applicator first by pressing it for 30 seconds or so in my hand or holding it up next to a light bulb on my vanity. I don&#x27;t have to do it with this.)</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyeliner for 10 years. All my friends used to ask me which eyeliner I used. It went on perfectly and lasted all day. It never smudged. They must have changed the formula because it no longer has these awesome qualities. After about 4 hours of wearing I have to re-apply because the color is almost completely off. It smudges all the time. I am so very disappointed.... and will be moving on to find a new eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This does not go on smooth so therefore it doesn&#x27;t draw a nice black line. I would not recommend or purchase again.</li>
