            <li>, I may try it again and give it more time.</li>

            <li>Thus far, it&#x27;s been a great purchase for the price and no complaints.  </li>
            <li>also love that it is free from all those unwanted things they put in beauty products.</li>

            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Simple and easy product to use daily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It claims to be great for plumping up your skin and has anti-aging claims, which I didn&#x27;t notice because my skin is still fairly young and wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>,i can really feel my skin is getting smooth and soft, i am impressed with the result, defiantly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;called</li>
            <li>Told him this was working fine for now.  </li>
            <li>I can use it as a &amp;#34;stand alone product&amp;#34; and my skin is fine.</li>
            <li>I have found many worthy of being used but this one takes the cake.</li>
            <li>cscs kindly offer me a discount on certain items</li>
            <li>Got a sample for a HUGE discount from the company to try.</li>
            <li>I also keep mine in the fridge and enjoy the coldness of it on skin.  </li>
            <li>I did receive  this item for free for review purposes but</li>
            <li>Great product for daily use!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if anyone else experienced this reaction or similar but it was scarey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if anyone else experienced this reaction or similar but it was scarey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you like to use just products as they come to avoid any issues, hyaluronic serum is great as it is to support skin cell regeneration, elasticity, and overall skin tone.</li>
            <li>I think hyaluronic serum is a great component of my daily skincare routine.</li>
            <li>I have received this serum for free for a review.</li>

            <li>5 stars for a great moisturizer that actually works.</li>

            <li>With consistent use, bot I and my hubby have been enjoying a healthier-looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>I was also happy with how long my skin was moisturized, it lasted throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Smile!</li>
            <li>This pure hyaluronic serum is great as you could probably make some of your own homemade mixes and solutions with it, adding some other ingredients you like to make a homemade product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I tried one product before and loved it I happily said yes!&lt;br /&gt;This is just Hyaluronic Acid Serum, it is very versatile, absorbs super fast and same as the one with Vit. C</li>
            <li>I clean my face at night thoroughly with my Clairsonic then apply this serum and again in the am before applying my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this serum and recommend it for anyone who wants to keep their face healthy and wrinkle</li>
            <li>Now my skintone is more even, vibrant, and clear!&lt;br /&gt;-Wrinkles and fine lines are not as noticeable.</li>

            <li>Like any serum it takes a while to see full results</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>I did this, because I could not remember the products true effect</li>
            <li>so I treated this reaction with cool tap water compresses and a prayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I treated this reaction with cool tap water compresses and a prayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it a full month yet.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice cobalt blue bottle with a dropper, so it is very easy to use however much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quitting once and noticed I was getting the blood bruises again on my lower arms, so quickly reordered.  </li>

            <li>Non-greasy &amp; quickly absorbable</li>
            <li>It is the best Hyaluronic Acid Serum that I have used and I plan on only using this brand in the future.</li>
            <li>I prefer this over all the creams and lotion moisturizers, it dries quickly, leaves no sticky feel</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and moisturized throughout the day which is great for my sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than the high priced one I got from the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>My expectations never match most of the claims for such products, but this item seems fine, feels comfortable on the face.  </li>
            <li>I originally received this product in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion weeks back.</li>
            <li>This particular product comes in a very beautiful dark blue bottle, and a nice box.</li>
            <li>The packaging and the bottle itself is very modern, crisp, and clean!</li>
            <li>The ingredients and directions on the box and bottle are clear as day, and easy to understand!</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely dry, so I am layering on a good collagen moisturizer after applying..  </li>
            <li>First of, it doesn´t have any scent!</li>
            <li>I purchased enough for my sisters, my daughters and we all love these products!  </li>
            <li>Feels good, looks good, nice texture, less than half the price of serums that have hyaluronic acid as their main ingredient.</li>
            <li>Really fantastic product and at reasonable price.</li>
            <li>ALL opinions are my own only and are based solely off my experience with the product itself!</li>
            <li>ALL opinions are my own only and are based solely off my experience with the product itself!</li>
            <li>No artificial additives or fillers&lt;</li>
            <li>Skin is more clear, even and smoother.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary in exchange for my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li>I also talked to my dermatologist about the product and he was very positive on the benefits of hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>Right around the time that I had heard about the wonders of Hyaluronic acid, I received a sample of it from a subscription service- (the Skin Inc deluxe sized bottle) which was in mid July.</li>
            <li>one gets right after putting on a peel off mask on the face.</li>
            <li>I loved that feature because it doesn&#x27;t cause mess.</li>
            <li>My skin has been very smooth and looks relatively brighter.</li>
            <li>instantly soft, smooth, moisturized, and supple!&lt;br /&gt;-I have sensitive/combination skin.</li>
            <li>instantly soft, smooth, moisturized, and supple!&lt;br /&gt;-I have sensitive/combination skin.</li>
            <li>I´ve started using this hyaluronic serum 1 week ago twice a day and the difference in my skin is really noticeable!</li>
            <li>I have to use a moisturizer in the am before applying my makeup because once this serum dries it doesn&#x27;t work well trying to put on makeup without some type of moisturizer first.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hoping that after 2 -4 weeks I will have a better idea if this product is actually making a visible difference or not.  </li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>5 stars because it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Often I will go back and reevaluate a product that I either love or was on the fence about.</li>
            <li>I should have ceased using it when I first felt the stinging the first time.</li>
            <li>Instead I gave the product a second change and  used it again- only to experience  pain and a burning itch much like a bite of a horse fly.</li>
            <li>I should have ceased using it when I first felt the stinging the first time.</li>
            <li>Instead I gave the product a second change and  used it again- only to experience  pain and a burning itch much like a bite of a horse fly.</li>
            <li>The first two ingredients are pretty straight-forward.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for several weeks, and I find that my skin feels better and looks nicer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do need to use the product for a longer length of time to see more results such as wrinkles disappearing.</li>
            <li>The Skin inc bottle retails for approximately $45 full size and with such a price disparity, one would expect huge differences in the end results- not so.</li>
            <li>5 stars because it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This formula contains only the most high quality, stable, and pure Hyaluronic Acid which can hold up to 1000X its weight in water!</li>
            <li>This Pure Hyaluronic Serum from CSCS is one of my favorite products to use, as I find that it works the best for my sensitive and problematic skin that just can&#x27;t make up its mind if it&#x27;s dry or oily (really frustrating).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much expectation for this product because I really didn&#x27;t know what it was meant for at first.</li>
            <li>Pure Hyaluronic</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a serum that is pure and is not a combination of vitamin c &amp; hyaluronic acid</li>
            <li>(Prick the gel cap for pure form of retinol.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid thirties and use Anti Aging products to protect my skin from premature aging and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m not constantly worried about my face being oily, it use to be a huge insecurity</li>
            <li>The serum was gentle and left my skin feeling smooth and moisturized every time.</li>
            <li>This Hyaluronic Acid Serum really is pure!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ready about the wonders of Hyaluronic Serum</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic serum really works wonders to the skin.</li>
            <li>tends to give you too much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>My face had welts on it much like &amp;#34;hives&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>Im giving this 5 stars because it worked very well for my skin.</li>
            <li>and this serum really helps my skin to retain moisture.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look and feel fresh and young.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Hadn&#x27;t see much difference after a week</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I bought from the dermatologist at a far higher price.  </li>
            <li>It has the same consistency and feel but is a far better bargain.  </li>
            <li>It helps to plump up my skin so the lines on my forehead &amp; around my eyes are less noticeable, &amp; it helps make my lotions absorb better so that my skin it super soft.</li>
            <li>I believe the overall experience will be unique to each person&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Even though this serum has a thinner formula than other similar products, I find that it provides my face with a lot of moisture - which is very good for keeping my face protected all night long.</li>
            <li>The dropper is a joke as very plasticy and the serum (that is already much more liquid than other hyaluronic serums out here!)</li>
            <li>serum is very gentle and produces a natural plumping effect, smoothing lines and wrinkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how the bottle is a dark glass so that the serum stays fresher, longer.</li>
            <li>The CSCS Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum is made in the USA, and with natural and organic ingredients!</li>
            <li>an older woman, and</li>
            <li>CSCS has a number of products that I like, and one of them is their Advanced Face Serum, or in other words Pure Hyaluronic Serum.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for high end moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is packaged with very little plastic and comes in a gorgeous cobalt blue glass bottle.</li>
            <li>This was also gentle  on my sensitive  skin  </li>
            <li>I mention this because my facial skin is quite capable of throwing &#x27;a big fit &#x27;if some ingredients are not compatible with my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is more plump and firm, therefore reducing my wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;-My</li>
            <li>My skin is more plump and firm, therefore reducing my wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;-My</li>
            <li>This is after using the entire bottle on my smile and forehead lines.</li>
            <li>Use pure vitamin c powder diluted in fresh lemon juice to help remove dead cells first.</li>
            <li>The next morning, my skin feels plump, hydrated and smooth (irrespective of which brand of hyaluronic acid serum I&#x27;ve used), and over the last month and a half that I&#x27;ve been taking both the supplements and using the serum regularly, I find that I&#x27;m finally on the path to getting the kind of skin I&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
            <li>just slides down the the cheap plastic making it challenging and messy to apply without drops all over the sink.</li>
            <li>Plus, my skin is super dry</li>
            <li>Also, this Hyaluronic Acid Serum is bigger than most of the other ones you find on</li>
            <li>would NEVER buy or try this product or any product made by this company again, because of how my skin reacted to using it on the first and second time.</li>
            <li>would NEVER buy or try this product or any product made by this company again, because of how my skin reacted to using it on the first and second time.</li>
            <li>This comes in a pretty blue bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>While the Skin inc version of the serum leaves your skin feeling hydrated and supple immediately, the SCS brand&#x27;s hyaluronic serum first tightens the skin, similar to the sensation</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dry, gets red easily, and is oily around my nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dry, gets red easily, and is oily around my nose.</li>
            <li>There is not scent that I can smell and the product dried very quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>This hyaluronic is fine enough in terms of helping skin retain moisture, but I did have a slight tingle at certain areas of my skin.</li>
            <li>My dark pigmented spots have significantly diminished.</li>
            <li>It works just as good if not better than other serums I have tried.</li>
            <li>Clearly, I found some issue with this serum.</li>
            <li>This clear serum is a necessity to any skin care regimin.</li>
            <li>I´m 40 years old and I´ve</li>
            <li>I have just started using it and thus far have had no problems.</li>
            <li>but so far I like what I see.  </li>
            <li>That has nearly all gone away too.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face incredibly soft and my skin looks even in tone and texture.</li>
            <li>One thing I like to do it’s to mix some drops with my foundation for a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>what the third ingredient is but it looks like it is a preservative which is reasonable to have for any packaged product.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is common now in many skincare products I get to review these days.  </li>
            <li>The Serum helps combat acne, my blemishes are fading and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves your faces feeling soft and smooth...will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>An absolute must have for every woman&#x27;s daily skin regime.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>This also goes for my 72 year old mom....</li>
            <li>&gt; year old mom.</li>
            <li>but I sure don&#x27;t mind a girl friend that looks a few years younger!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend especially for those, like me, that are over 40 years old and need to &amp;#34;uplift&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>will update my review in some weeks to tell if I see a change on my dark spots (pretty please!).</li>
            <li>The physical difference I saw in the serum between the Skin Inc bottle and this SCS branded bottle: the former was thicker and more gel like with little beads that cannot be felt on the skin and</li>
            <li>When the hyaluronic acid is dry, moisturize with pure vitamin A.</li>
            <li>On TV, I actually paid attention to an advertisement for a  New moisturizing gel with Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li>I used a few drops and it left my normally dry skin feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>That makes it gentle enough for ANY type of skin, and for daily use!</li>
            <li>Unscented, fast acting, and its left my skin looking brighter.</li>
            <li>I applied the serum on my face in the morning and it left my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>After using it for a few days I noticed my skin seemed slightly plumped up so the fine lines didn&#x27;t show as much.</li>
            <li>Since this is a pure product, there is absolutely no scent.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for about a week thus far</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not go to the ER is that I had my 89 year old mother in law at home with me bed ridden</li>
            <li>It helps keep my facial skin glowing and young looking.  </li>
            <li>You have to be patient and use it with a clean skin twice a day for at least 2 months to notice the BIG difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within a few days my skin felt less dry and looked more refreshed.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone else experienced this reaction or similar but it was scarey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you like to use just products as they come to avoid any issues, hyaluronic serum is great as it is to support skin cell regeneration, elasticity, and overall skin tone.</li>

            <li> Smile!</li>
            <li> This pure hyaluronic serum is great as you could probably make some of your own homemade mixes and solutions with it, adding some other ingredients you like to make a homemade product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I tried one product before and loved it I happily said yes!&lt;br /&gt;This is just Hyaluronic Acid Serum, it is very versatile, absorbs super fast and same as the one with Vit. C</li>

            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> I did this, because I could not remember the products true effect</li>
            <li> so I treated this reaction with cool tap water compresses and a prayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> My skin feels soft and moisturized throughout the day which is great for my sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than the high priced one I got from the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> My expectations never match most of the claims for such products, but this item seems fine, feels comfortable on the face.  </li>
            <li> I originally received this product in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion weeks back.</li>
            <li> This particular product comes in a very beautiful dark blue bottle, and a nice box.</li>
            <li> The packaging and the bottle itself is very modern, crisp, and clean!</li>
            <li> The ingredients and directions on the box and bottle are clear as day, and easy to understand!</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry, so I am layering on a good collagen moisturizer after applying..  </li>
            <li> First of, it doesn´t have any scent!</li>
            <li> I purchased enough for my sisters, my daughters and we all love these products!  </li>
            <li> Feels good, looks good, nice texture, less than half the price of serums that have hyaluronic acid as their main ingredient.</li>
            <li> Really fantastic product and at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> ALL opinions are my own only and are based solely off my experience with the product itself!</li>
            <li> ALL opinions are my own only and are based solely off my experience with the product itself!</li>
            <li> No artificial additives or fillers&lt;</li>
            <li> Skin is more clear, even and smoother.</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary in exchange for my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> I also talked to my dermatologist about the product and he was very positive on the benefits of hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> Right around the time that I had heard about the wonders of Hyaluronic acid, I received a sample of it from a subscription service- (the Skin Inc deluxe sized bottle) which was in mid July.</li>
            <li> one gets right after putting on a peel off mask on the face.</li>
            <li> I loved that feature because it doesn&#x27;t cause mess.</li>
            <li> My skin has been very smooth and looks relatively brighter.</li>
            <li> instantly soft, smooth, moisturized, and supple!&lt;br /&gt;-I have sensitive/combination skin.</li>
            <li> instantly soft, smooth, moisturized, and supple!&lt;br /&gt;-I have sensitive/combination skin.</li>
            <li> I´ve started using this hyaluronic serum 1 week ago twice a day and the difference in my skin is really noticeable!</li>
            <li> I have to use a moisturizer in the am before applying my makeup because once this serum dries it doesn&#x27;t work well trying to put on makeup without some type of moisturizer first.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping that after 2 -4 weeks I will have a better idea if this product is actually making a visible difference or not.  </li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Often I will go back and reevaluate a product that I either love or was on the fence about.</li>
            <li> I should have ceased using it when I first felt the stinging the first time.</li>
            <li> Instead I gave the product a second change and  used it again- only to experience  pain and a burning itch much like a bite of a horse fly.</li>
            <li> I should have ceased using it when I first felt the stinging the first time.</li>
            <li> Instead I gave the product a second change and  used it again- only to experience  pain and a burning itch much like a bite of a horse fly.</li>
            <li> The first two ingredients are pretty straight-forward.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks, and I find that my skin feels better and looks nicer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do need to use the product for a longer length of time to see more results such as wrinkles disappearing.</li>
            <li> The Skin inc bottle retails for approximately $45 full size and with such a price disparity, one would expect huge differences in the end results- not so.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This formula contains only the most high quality, stable, and pure Hyaluronic Acid which can hold up to 1000X its weight in water!</li>
            <li> This Pure Hyaluronic Serum from CSCS is one of my favorite products to use, as I find that it works the best for my sensitive and problematic skin that just can&#x27;t make up its mind if it&#x27;s dry or oily (really frustrating).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much expectation for this product because I really didn&#x27;t know what it was meant for at first.</li>
            <li> Pure Hyaluronic</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a serum that is pure and is not a combination of vitamin c &amp; hyaluronic acid</li>
            <li> (Prick the gel cap for pure form of retinol.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid thirties and use Anti Aging products to protect my skin from premature aging and fine lines.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not constantly worried about my face being oily, it use to be a huge insecurity</li>
            <li> The serum was gentle and left my skin feeling smooth and moisturized every time.</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid Serum really is pure!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ready about the wonders of Hyaluronic Serum</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic serum really works wonders to the skin.</li>
            <li> tends to give you too much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> My face had welts on it much like &amp;#34;hives&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Dries fast.</li>
            <li> Im giving this 5 stars because it worked very well for my skin.</li>
            <li> and this serum really helps my skin to retain moisture.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look and feel fresh and young.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t see much difference after a week</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I bought from the dermatologist at a far higher price.  </li>
            <li> It has the same consistency and feel but is a far better bargain.  </li>
            <li> It helps to plump up my skin so the lines on my forehead &amp; around my eyes are less noticeable, &amp; it helps make my lotions absorb better so that my skin it super soft.</li>
            <li> I believe the overall experience will be unique to each person&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Even though this serum has a thinner formula than other similar products, I find that it provides my face with a lot of moisture - which is very good for keeping my face protected all night long.</li>
            <li> The dropper is a joke as very plasticy and the serum (that is already much more liquid than other hyaluronic serums out here!)</li>
            <li> serum is very gentle and produces a natural plumping effect, smoothing lines and wrinkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how the bottle is a dark glass so that the serum stays fresher, longer.</li>
            <li> The CSCS Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum is made in the USA, and with natural and organic ingredients!</li>
            <li> an older woman, and</li>
            <li> CSCS has a number of products that I like, and one of them is their Advanced Face Serum, or in other words Pure Hyaluronic Serum.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking for high end moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is packaged with very little plastic and comes in a gorgeous cobalt blue glass bottle.</li>
            <li> This was also gentle  on my sensitive  skin  </li>
            <li> I mention this because my facial skin is quite capable of throwing &#x27;a big fit &#x27;if some ingredients are not compatible with my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is more plump and firm, therefore reducing my wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;-My</li>
            <li> My skin is more plump and firm, therefore reducing my wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;-My</li>
            <li> This is after using the entire bottle on my smile and forehead lines.</li>
            <li> Use pure vitamin c powder diluted in fresh lemon juice to help remove dead cells first.</li>
            <li> The next morning, my skin feels plump, hydrated and smooth (irrespective of which brand of hyaluronic acid serum I&#x27;ve used), and over the last month and a half that I&#x27;ve been taking both the supplements and using the serum regularly, I find that I&#x27;m finally on the path to getting the kind of skin I&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
            <li> just slides down the the cheap plastic making it challenging and messy to apply without drops all over the sink.</li>
            <li> Plus, my skin is super dry</li>
            <li> Also, this Hyaluronic Acid Serum is bigger than most of the other ones you find on</li>
            <li> would NEVER buy or try this product or any product made by this company again, because of how my skin reacted to using it on the first and second time.</li>
            <li> would NEVER buy or try this product or any product made by this company again, because of how my skin reacted to using it on the first and second time.</li>
            <li> This comes in a pretty blue bottle with a dropper.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> While the Skin inc version of the serum leaves your skin feeling hydrated and supple immediately, the SCS brand&#x27;s hyaluronic serum first tightens the skin, similar to the sensation</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry, gets red easily, and is oily around my nose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry, gets red easily, and is oily around my nose.</li>
            <li> There is not scent that I can smell and the product dried very quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic is fine enough in terms of helping skin retain moisture, but I did have a slight tingle at certain areas of my skin.</li>
            <li> My dark pigmented spots have significantly diminished.</li>
            <li> It works just as good if not better than other serums I have tried.</li>
            <li> Clearly, I found some issue with this serum.</li>
            <li> This clear serum is a necessity to any skin care regimin.</li>
            <li> I´m 40 years old and I´ve</li>
            <li> I have just started using it and thus far have had no problems.</li>
            <li> but so far I like what I see.  </li>
            <li> That has nearly all gone away too.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face incredibly soft and my skin looks even in tone and texture.</li>
            <li> One thing I like to do it’s to mix some drops with my foundation for a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> what the third ingredient is but it looks like it is a preservative which is reasonable to have for any packaged product.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is common now in many skincare products I get to review these days.  </li>
            <li> The Serum helps combat acne, my blemishes are fading and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves your faces feeling soft and smooth...will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> An absolute must have for every woman&#x27;s daily skin regime.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This also goes for my 72 year old mom....</li>
            <li> &gt; year old mom.</li>
            <li> but I sure don&#x27;t mind a girl friend that looks a few years younger!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend especially for those, like me, that are over 40 years old and need to &amp;#34;uplift&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> will update my review in some weeks to tell if I see a change on my dark spots (pretty please!).</li>
            <li> The physical difference I saw in the serum between the Skin Inc bottle and this SCS branded bottle: the former was thicker and more gel like with little beads that cannot be felt on the skin and</li>
            <li> When the hyaluronic acid is dry, moisturize with pure vitamin A.</li>
            <li> On TV, I actually paid attention to an advertisement for a  New moisturizing gel with Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> I used a few drops and it left my normally dry skin feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> That makes it gentle enough for ANY type of skin, and for daily use!</li>
            <li> Unscented, fast acting, and its left my skin looking brighter.</li>
            <li> I applied the serum on my face in the morning and it left my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days I noticed my skin seemed slightly plumped up so the fine lines didn&#x27;t show as much.</li>
            <li> Since this is a pure product, there is absolutely no scent.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a week thus far</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not go to the ER is that I had my 89 year old mother in law at home with me bed ridden</li>
            <li> It helps keep my facial skin glowing and young looking.  </li>
            <li> You have to be patient and use it with a clean skin twice a day for at least 2 months to notice the BIG difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a few days my skin felt less dry and looked more refreshed.</li>
            <li> I will never mess around with other forms of hyaluronic acid again.  </li>
            <li> I only need half a dropper or less to cover my whole face and neck!</li>
            <li> After further researching in what Hyaluronic Acid does, I was pleasantly surprised by the results when I used it over a span of a week and a half.</li>
            <li> have included one normal everyday photo of</li>
            <li> a before to show my normal everyday skin/face.</li>
            <li> have included one normal everyday photo of</li>
            <li> a before to show my normal everyday skin/face.</li>
            <li> I noticed some sting early on and this time I could not ignore it or down play it.</li>
            <li> HYALURONIC ACID can be one of the finest adjuncts to moisturizing the face, neck, and dry area on upper chest.</li>
            <li> It felt slightly sticky at first but dried well.</li>
            <li> Since using it for the past few days, I have noticed a tremendous difference in house my face feels throughout the day.</li>
            <li> All these skin serums take a long tome to see a difference.</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid Serum has been formulated with high-quality hyaluronic acid that has been scientifically proven to possess fill-in properties to help improve skin texture and brightness for a youthful, radiant appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to my young age and heritage I have no fine lines, wrinkles, or spots.</li>
            <li> Switching back to the other brand I tried (skin beauty solutions).</li>
            <li> yet I would have dry spots.. until I found this product.</li>
            <li> I get immediate smoothing of dry skin and my skin drinks it up.</li>
            <li> I had small skin bumps on my nose that were similar to tiny warts.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> used every single anti aging and moisturizing cream you can imagine!</li>
            <li> I am 67 and have absolutely no wrinkles and it feels as if it tightens the skin once applied.  </li>
            <li> It was a gel like consistancy and dried well enough.</li>
            <li> It just has a few simple ingredients that work well together</li>
            <li> Not strong enough to show visible improvement  when used alone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A little goes a long way with this serum.</li>
            <li> Only con is it&#x27;s a small amount</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of the serum</li>
            <li> you desire to use, unlike some other brands that use a pump, which I find</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was like any other serum during this time.</li>
            <li> Since I have other products that I use during the day for my morning routine, I do not want to build up product on my face.</li>
            <li> Included in instructions on the box were  &amp;#34;Allow product to completely dry in skin before applying makeup.&amp;#34; This product dried rapidly on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-This serum is clear, has a thick watery consistency, and is odorless!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first...</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I  usually write my reviews with only a few days use.</li>
            <li> My skin has a smoother texture AND dark spots have lightened.  </li>
            <li> the latter seemed like slightly &#x27;thick&#x27; water.</li>
            <li> The skin does not feel as tight as with other HA sera I have used.</li>
            <li> I usually have dry spots around my nose and mouth, and with this product they&#x27;ve gone away over time.</li>
            <li> The serum in the bottle is almost transparent, and not too liquid, somewhat viscous, again typical of hyaluronic acid serums I have seen.  </li>
            <li> The excess oil in my skin is so much less</li>
            <li> On days when my skin is extra difficult and dry, I use it in conjunction with my other creams</li>
            <li> Skin feels a little softer.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for a few days now</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and see a difference already.  </li>
            <li> I recommend the combination of a few drops of the vitamin C with a few drops of the hyaluronic acid serum twice a day.</li>
            <li> and I think I can see some very slight improvement in skin tone and the area around and beneath my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Hydrates my skin throughout the day using very little product.</li>
            <li> Not more as I understand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past three months over my face and neck areas.</li>
            <li> I usually exfoliate my skin and apply a face mask, after those two things I apply the hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> I do see a slight difference in small lines which is also a plus !!</li>
            <li> These products require persistence and faith and even then it&#x27;s hard to see effects.</li>
            <li> entire time I was in pain, I splashed cold water to relieve the stinging, burning skin and lesson the hives and swelling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least two years and swear by it.</li>
            <li> Painful and red swelling.</li>
            <li> Painful and red swelling.</li>
            <li> I believe dark cold fridge can help extend the shelf life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky residue behind on skin, at all!&lt;br /&gt;-My</li>
            <li> a greasy or sticky residue behind on skin, at all!&lt;br /&gt;-My skin is</li>

            <li> Very thin serum; runs off the dropper.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly shocked by what 2 weeks has done for me.</li>
            <li> Then it progressed to a terrible itchy/painful burn.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As I age, my skin gets thinner and bruises easier.  I&#x27;ve been using this serum on face and lower arms for about 12 months now.  I&#x27;ve tried quitting once and noticed I was getting the blood bruises again on my lower arms, so quickly reordered.  I also talked to my dermatologist about the product and he was very positive on the benefits of hyaluronic acid.  Even told me he could write a prescription for me if I needed prescription strength.  Told him this was working fine for now.  Only con is it&#x27;s a small amount and I would like to be able to bathe in it, for the benefits!  Lol!  I do order two at a time.  Not more as I understand shelf life is very short for ha.  I also keep mine in the fridge and enjoy the coldness of it on skin.  I believe dark cold fridge can help extend the shelf life.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and wonderful response time.  This is my 2nd purchase of the same product.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this Serum!  And I especially LOVE the affordable price!  Being 65 years young and an avid sun worshipper, I am SO happy I found your product!  And my skin loves this stuff, too :)</li>
            <li> Great product!! I love this line of products from a great company. Makes my skin feel great</li>
            <li> The CSCS Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum is made in the USA, and with natural and organic ingredients! It does not contain any fillers, preservatives, allergens, or GMOS. This formula contains only the most high quality, stable, and pure Hyaluronic Acid which can hold up to 1000X its weight in water! Hyaluronic Acid can make skin more moisturized, smooth, bright, and improve skin&#x27;s texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Hyaluronic Acid Serum comes in a 2 fl oz dropper bottle. I love how the bottle is a dark glass so that the serum stays fresher, longer. I also love how the dropper is plastic instead of glass so there is no risk for glass breaking on accident! The packaging and the bottle itself is very modern, crisp, and clean! The ingredients and directions on the box and bottle are clear as day, and easy to understand! I have had this serum for almost a month now, and I use it twice daily. I also use CSCS Hyaluronic Acid Serum With Vitamin C, CSCS Vitamin C Serum, and CSCS Eye Gel! I feel I got faster results while using the CSCS products all together, as they work in unison with each other!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like CSCS Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum:&lt;br /&gt;-The dropper makes it easy to get out just the right amount of serum.&lt;br /&gt;-A little goes a long way with this serum. I only need half a dropper or less to cover my whole face and neck! This 2 fl oz bottle will definitely last me a while as it&#x27;s not even halfway gone yet! Also, this Hyaluronic Acid Serum is bigger than most of the other ones you find on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;-This serum literally only has 3 ingredients, which is unheard of now days! It makes me comfortable, and so happy, knowing exactly what i&#x27;m putting on my skin! This Hyaluronic Acid Serum really is pure!&lt;br /&gt;-This serum is clear, has a thick watery consistency, and is odorless! That makes it gentle enough for ANY type of skin, and for daily use! It has not irritated my skin at all!&lt;br /&gt;-It absorbs into skin quickly, which saves time in my beauty routine!&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky residue behind on skin, at all!&lt;br /&gt;-My skin is instantly soft, smooth, moisturized, and supple!&lt;br /&gt;-I have sensitive/combination skin.

            <li> This product  left my skin feeling  plump and youthful looking. I would cleanse my face, then apply this serum and then  went about with my moisturizer  and makeup. It didn&#x27;t disturb my makeup which is one of my concerns  as I am a makeup artist. This was also gentle  on my sensitive  skin  I did receive  this item for free for review purposes but my opinion  is 100% true and unbiased</li>
            <li> Very good product- serum absorbs quickly - Skin is so smooth</li>
            <li> great product and great price.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> I´m 40 years old and I´ve used every single anti aging and moisturizing cream you can imagine! I´m getting my firsts wrinkles and to be honest with you, I don´t like them. Plus, my skin is super dry and I need to feel it moitured at all times.  I´ve started using this hyaluronic serum 1 week ago twice a day and the difference in my skin is really noticeable! First of, it doesn´t have any scent! That´s a total plus. Second it´s not sticky!&lt;br /&gt;It dissapears under your skin right away! Since I´m using this serum, my skin it feels a lot more moistured, plumped and even brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I love that is a 2oz bottle instead of a 1oz&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for reviewing purposes (I´m not paid to review it), but as soon as my bottle is over I´m definitly purchasing another one!</li>
            <li> Awesome Facial and Neck Skin Product&lt;br /&gt;Simple and easy product to use daily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a convert to Hyaluronic Acid product. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past three months over my face and neck areas. The results are pleasantly surprising. So that my hubby started using it on his face as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient in this Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a potent one to take care of my skin texture. I love the ease of application and an absolute no greesiness. The only effect is silky skin. With consistent use, bot I and my hubby have been enjoying a healthier-looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;These are the features I do appreciate:&lt;br /&gt;• Non-greasy &amp; quickly absorbable&lt;br /&gt;• Creates silky texture for the skin&lt;br /&gt;• No artificial additives or fillers&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and loving it.&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for testing by the company. The opinions about this product are mine and are not influenced by the brand.</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum because I have issues with dryness in the morning on my face. Since using it for the past few days, I have noticed a tremendous difference in house my face feels throughout the day. I&#x27;ve ready about the wonders of Hyaluronic Serum but seeing and believing is something else!</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic serum really works wonders to the skin. I have used other brands of the serum and I was very happy. It came time to refill and I came across CSCS. I was drawn to the brand because of the price; I couldn&#x27;t find a better Prime price for 2oz Hyaluronic Serum. I decided to give it a try and was very satisfied. It works just as good if not better than other serums I have tried. The serum is thicker and feels richer. Makes skin feel great and will be ordering again! 5 Stars!!</li>
            <li> The dropper is a joke as very plasticy and the serum (that is already much more liquid than other hyaluronic serums out here!) just slides down the the cheap plastic making it challenging and messy to apply without drops all over the sink. Switching back to the other brand I tried (skin beauty solutions).</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, well packaged and labeled as &amp;#34;NEW. &amp;#34; The blue bottle was wrapped with bubble wrap inside the S C S &amp;#34;Advanced Serum&amp;#34; box. I felt this company cared in the packing. Included in instructions on the box were  &amp;#34;Allow product to completely dry in skin before applying makeup.&amp;#34; This product dried rapidly on my face. I have just started using it and thus far have had no problems. It felt slightly sticky at first but dried well. I am looking forward to using this product. I felt I paid a fair price. HYALURONIC ACID can be one of the finest adjuncts to moisturizing the face, neck, and dry area on upper chest. I believe the overall experience will be unique to each person&#x27;s skin. I feel No itching or discomfort of any kind. I mention this because my facial skin is quite capable of throwing &#x27;a big fit &#x27;if some ingredients are not compatible with my skin. I am looking forward to using this product, and I hope I have nothing but good things to say in the future. On TV, I actually paid attention to an advertisement for a  New moisturizing gel with Hyaluronic Acid. There is competition.</li>
            <li> No difference  in  frown lines or crows feet. Skin feels a little softer.  Vaseline works just as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited to write my review until I&#x27;ve used this product for awhile, which I&#x27;ve now used it twice daily for almost a year, and I can honestly say that it is WONDERFUl! It is the best Hyaluronic Acid Serum that I have used and I plan on only using this brand in the future. It is a great consistency, some other brands have been too watery, not this one, it&#x27;s perfect. It helps to plump up my skin so the lines on my forehead &amp; around my eyes are less noticeable, &amp; it helps make my lotions absorb better so that my skin it super soft. It comes in a nice cobalt blue bottle with a dropper, so it is very easy to use however much you desire to use, unlike some other brands that use a pump, which I find tends to give you too much. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a week thus far but so far I like what I see.  I clean my face at night thoroughly with my Clairsonic then apply this serum and again in the am before applying my makeup.  I have to use a moisturizer in the am before applying my makeup because once this serum dries it doesn&#x27;t work well trying to put on makeup without some type of moisturizer first.  At night I put it on and it dries then I put on my night cream.  I love, love the way it makes my face feel and I think I can see some very slight improvement in skin tone and the area around and beneath my eyes.  Like any serum it takes a while to see full results so I&#x27;m hoping that after 2 -4 weeks I will have a better idea if this product is actually making a visible difference or not.  Thus far, it&#x27;s been a great purchase for the price and no complaints.  I hope the results continue to improve....</li>
            <li> MY MOTHER LOVES THIS STUFF&lt;br /&gt;KEEPS HER NECK AND FACE LOOKING GREAT WRINKLE FREE IN HER 50~S TOO</li>
            <li> My girl friend made me use my amazon account to buy this for her and she loves it. I tell her she&#x27;s beautiful just the way she is, but I sure don&#x27;t mind a girl friend that looks a few years younger!</li>
            <li> love it.  Better than the high priced one I got from the dermatologist.  I have been using this product for a couple of years now.  I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  I am 67 and have absolutely no wrinkles and it feels as if it tightens the skin once applied.  Helps my makeup to go on easily.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it is free from all those unwanted things they put in beauty products.</li>
            <li> I broke out in a rash, although I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a very good product.  Please advise how to return.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin. This product has made my skin feel softer and more hydrated. I use with vit. C.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid thirties and use Anti Aging products to protect my skin from premature aging and fine lines. This Pure Hyaluronic Serum from CSCS is one of my favorite products to use, as I find that it works the best for my sensitive and problematic skin that just can&#x27;t make up its mind if it&#x27;s dry or oily (really frustrating). I can use it as a &amp;#34;stand alone product&amp;#34; and my skin is fine. At night, I use it with an overnight treatment/cream. On days when my skin is extra difficult and dry, I use it in conjunction with my other creams and I always get the results that I need/want. I love this serum - it is so versatile and most importantly, it works very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.

            <li> Great product, easy to use,i can really feel my skin is getting smooth and soft, i am impressed with the result, defiantly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;called the company before purchasing to get more information on the product and their customer service was excellent.</li>
            <li> Skin feels great!  Been using this for a few days now and I am very happy with the way my skin feels. Recommended to anyone with wrinkles like myself!</li>
            <li> 5 stars because it was exactly what I wanted. Excellent quality and super fast delivery I love the Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum and  I am sure to order one more soon. Really fantastic product and at reasonable price. Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> Feels good, looks good, nice texture, less than half the price of serums that have hyaluronic acid as their main ingredient.</li>
            <li> Great product for daily use! I combine with vitamin C serum for the best results. Great quality, easy to use, gets five stars from me.</li>
            <li> I love this acid paired with a dermal roller. I had small skin bumps on my nose that were similar to tiny warts. They are gone after one week.</li>
            <li> Very good! I have been using this product daily for over 2 weeks and it has done amazing things. I HAD combination skin that would get so incredibly oily yet I would have dry spots.. until I found this product. Now I&#x27;m not constantly worried about my face being oily, it use to be a huge insecurity but I don&#x27;t even think about it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I had some redness around my nose and that has improved greatly. That has nearly all gone away too. It leaves my face incredibly soft and my skin looks even in tone and texture. I&#x27;m truly shocked by what 2 weeks has done for me. I&#x27;m am a lifetime user.Great Product!</li>
            <li> Got a sample for a HUGE discount from the company to try. I was a little skeptical at first...I&#x27;ve used alot of products to minimize pores and to moisturize...I can honestly tell you I&#x27;m loving this stuff! Been usinv it twice daily, as directed. Unscented, fast acting, and its left my skin looking brighter. If you&#x27;re thinking of buying, I say go for it.</li>
            <li> Like everyone says.... Use moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic is fine enough in terms of helping skin retain moisture, but I did have a slight tingle at certain areas of my skin. No redness occured but I did feel a sting which I found lingered over 10 minutes or so. Once that subsided, I was good to go. Skin was not red at any point. I just had to give this a 3 star&amp;#34; it&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; because of the sting.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I  usually write my reviews with only a few days use. Often I will go back and reevaluate a product that I either love or was on the fence about. Clearly, I found some issue with this serum. I noticed a &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; when I placed it on my face and then it subsided. I did not go on further with testing- for that I am sorry. Recently, I gave it another try. I placed this product on one side of face \- justt to test the product again. I did this, because I could not remember the products true effect so I figured this would be a good idea to do this. I left the product on my face until it dried.&lt;br /&gt;It was like any other serum during this time. It was a gel like consistancy and dried well enough. I noticed some sting early on and this time I could not ignore it or down play it. My skin began to get itchy. Then it progressed to a terrible itchy/painful burn. I associate it to a bee sting feeling. That persisted for over 20 minutes, then I began to swell. My face had welts on it much like &amp;#34;hives&amp;#34;. The hives were raised and white while around them was red. My entire face was on fire. Burning persisted until finally, the itchy skin all over my face started to hurt. The hives spread to my head(scalp) and torso stopping at mid body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire time I was in pain, I splashed cold water to relieve the stinging, burning skin and lesson the hives and swelling.  I had to share this, and will post photos shortly. The only reason I did not go to the ER is that I had my 89 year old mother in law at home with me bed ridden so I treated this reaction with cool tap water compresses and a prayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NEVER buy or try this product or any product made by this company again, because of how my skin reacted to using it on the first and second time. I should have ceased using it when I first felt the stinging the first time. Instead I gave the product a second change and  used it again- only to experience  pain and a burning itch much like a bite of a horse fly. Painful and red swelling. I will post a photo or two to show the skin effects.&lt;br /&gt;PHOTO UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I have included one normal everyday photo of a before to show my normal everyday skin/face. I also posted two &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; photos which show the &amp;#34;hive&amp;#34; like raised bumps that I got upon using the product(serum) about 20 minutes or so after application. I don&#x27;t know if anyone else experienced this reaction or similar but it was scarey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^ I originally received this product in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion weeks back.so I treated this reaction with cool tap water compresses and a prayer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NEVER buy or try this product or any product made by this company again, because of how my skin reacted to using it on the first and second time.

            <li> cscs kindly offer me a discount on certain items so I could review it.&lt;br /&gt;Since I tried one product before and loved it I happily said yes!&lt;br /&gt;This is just Hyaluronic Acid Serum, it is very versatile, absorbs super fast and same as the one with Vit. C it makes my complexion look and feel healthier.One thing I like to do it’s to mix some drops with my foundation for a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review in some weeks to tell if I see a change on my dark spots (pretty please!).</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid Serum has been formulated with high-quality hyaluronic acid that has been scientifically proven to possess fill-in properties to help improve skin texture and brightness for a youthful, radiant appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to my young age and heritage I have no fine lines, wrinkles, or spots. Despite this, I still use this serum for my nighttime skin routine. Since I have other products that I use during the day for my morning routine, I do not want to build up product on my face. My nighttime skin regime is very simple. I usually exfoliate my skin and apply a face mask, after those two things I apply the hyaluronic acid serum. After applying this serum, I go to bed and that&#x27;s it! Even though this serum has a thinner formula than other similar products, I find that it provides my face with a lot of moisture - which is very good for keeping my face protected all night long. I really enjoy using this serum and recommend it for anyone who wants to keep their face healthy and wrinkle free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me at no to low cost. All thoughts are unbiased and of my own opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least two years and swear by it. Wonderful product!  I love the results.</li>
            <li> CSCS has a number of products that I like, and one of them is their Advanced Face Serum, or in other words Pure Hyaluronic Serum.  There are only 3 ingredients in this serum, i.e. de-ionized water, sodium hyaluronate, and isothiazolinones. I have no idea what the third ingredient is but it looks like it is a preservative which is reasonable to have for any packaged product. The first two ingredients are pretty straight-forward.  I have used products by CSCS before, and they are of very good quality.  This pure hyaluronic serum is great as you could probably make some of your own homemade mixes and solutions with it, adding some other ingredients you like to make a homemade product. If you like to use just products as they come to avoid any issues, hyaluronic serum is great as it is to support skin cell regeneration, elasticity, and overall skin tone. Hyaluronic acid is common now in many skincare products I get to review these days.  This particular product comes in a very beautiful dark blue bottle, and a nice box. The serum in the bottle is almost transparent, and not too liquid, somewhat viscous, again typical of hyaluronic acid serums I have seen.  Since this is a pure product, there is absolutely no scent. I like to apply hyaluronic serum twice daily to moisturize my skin.  I think hyaluronic serum is a great component of my daily skincare routine. It helps keep my facial skin glowing and young looking.  I have received this serum for free for a review.</li>
            <li> This product is great!</li>
            <li> Great hydrator. Love it.</li>
            <li> great product. my lines are disappearing. You have to be patient and use it with a clean skin twice a day for at least 2 months to notice the BIG difference.&lt;br /&gt;It works 100%</li>
            <li> I prefer this over all the creams and lotion moisturizers, it dries quickly, leaves no sticky feel and my foundation applies evenly afterwards.  My skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Makes skin dewy, i wear alone or with moisturizer</li>
            <li> I got this two days ago.  I believe that I see a difference in hydration already.  My skin is extremely dry, so I am layering on a good collagen moisturizer after applying..  I like that this is a two oz container and it seems to be a great price as well. Others are more&lt;br /&gt;expensive for 1 oz.  I may add more later, but this was a good buy!</li>
            <li> This comes in a pretty blue bottle with a dropper. It has a neutral odor which is nice. It just has a few simple ingredients that work well together so you know what your getting. After using it for a few days I noticed my skin seemed slightly plumped up so the fine lines didn&#x27;t show as much. Will continue to use to see if more improvements happen. I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Delivered on time.  I have been using it for a few weeks and see a difference already.  Skin is more clear, even and smoother.</li>
            <li> This clear serum is a necessity to any skin care regimin.</li>
            <li> This is one great serum. If you are looking for a serum that is pure and is not a combination of vitamin c &amp; hyaluronic acid this is the one I would suggest. Other than it&#x27; s great quality the packaging is absolutely gorgeous and the quantity you get for the price cannot in my opinion be beat. NO serum is a miracle in a bottle but this one I can say is quite effective and does hold up to its claims.</li>
            <li> I have used many serums over this year trying to find the best one. I have found many worthy of being used but this one takes the cake. It smells better than most and comes in  a dropper. I loved that feature because it doesn&#x27;t cause mess. My skin has been very smooth and looks relatively brighter. I definitely recommend it. I received this free but these opinions are honest and belong to me.</li>
            <li> Great Serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, really helped smooth my lines around my eyes and forehead. 5 stars. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Excellent  product and good results visible in few weeks. I will buy it again soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly for 2 months. I don&#x27;t see any improvements in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> If you expect immediate results, you won&#x27;t get it here. I haven&#x27;t used it a full month yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks, and I find that my skin feels better and looks nicer.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve gained any more wrinkles, so that is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an older woman, and I find that the skin elasticity is not as good. I think it feels better now.</li>
            <li> IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE. MAKES MY FACE GLOW. VERY GOOD HYDRANT. I HAD BOUGHT MORE EXPENSIVE ONES TOO BUT THIS ONE DOES THE SAME JOB WITH THE FRACTION OF THE COST</li>
            <li> Dries fast. Makes skin feel smooth. Worth a try.All these skin serums take a long tome to see a difference.</li>
            <li> There are no sulfates, parabens, petrochemicals, phthalates, or gmos in this HLA serum. Just water, HLA, and isothiazolinones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The softening effect ins immediate upon application and lasts for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is very gentle and produces a natural plumping effect, smoothing lines and wrinkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is packaged with very little plastic and comes in a gorgeous cobalt blue glass bottle. This is a quality product presented beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*review sample provided but I have since bought more and am continuing to use the product</li>
            <li> Im giving this 5 stars because it worked very well for my skin. I used a few drops and it left my normally dry skin feeling soft and healthy. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for high end moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been usingHyaluronic Acid Serum. The Serum helps combat acne, my blemishes are fading and my skin is soft. The excess oil in my skin is so much less it feels great. I do need to use the product for a longer length of time to see more results such as wrinkles disappearing. I do see a slight difference in small lines which is also a plus !! Super happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I do see a difference in the color of my skin. It is more even not so blotchy from the sun from tanning years ago. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my unbiased opinion and review. All opinions and words are my own.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much expectation for this product because I really didn&#x27;t know what it was meant for at first. After further researching in what Hyaluronic Acid does, I was pleasantly surprised by the results when I used it over a span of a week and a half. The serum was gentle and left my skin feeling smooth and moisturized every time. I even skipped my morning moisturizer and didn&#x27;t apply any primer before my make-up routine. There is not scent that I can smell and the product dried very quickly into the skin. It claims to be great for plumping up your skin and has anti-aging claims, which I didn&#x27;t notice because my skin is still fairly young and wrinkle free. I did notice that my skin felt noticeably softer after daily use. I usually have dry spots around my nose and mouth, and with this product they&#x27;ve gone away over time. This product would probably work amazing for those with older and drier skin, as I tend to have oily skin. Surprisingly, with oily skin, this product didn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy or oily at all.</li>
            <li> I combine this product with their vitamin C serum.  WOW!  My skin has a smoother texture AND dark spots have lightened.  I&#x27;ve never been so pleasantly surprised.  My dark pigmented spots have significantly diminished. I purchased enough for my sisters, my daughters and we all love these products!  I recommend the combination of a few drops of the vitamin C with a few drops of the hyaluronic acid serum twice a day. After a couple minutes follow with your regular day or nighttime cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to mention that I feel the price of the serum is a bargain.  I spent $600.00 for a competitor&#x27;s serum and didn&#x27;t get near the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for over a month.  I love  love love this brand!</li>
            <li> having study skin physiology &amp; esthetics I was looking for a hyaluronic acid serum to boost my skin&#x27;s hydration. My skin is combination normal/dry and this serum really helps my skin to retain moisture. After cleaning, exfoliating and toner I apply the serum and then over it my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is such a great value. Not only does it help your skin retain moisture, it also tightens up your skin. I will definitely reorder. I highly recommend especially for those, like me, that are over 40 years old and need to &amp;#34;uplift&amp;#34; your look.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I bought from the dermatologist at a far higher price.  It has the same consistency and feel but is a far better bargain.  The seller is eager to please and that is so refreshing - just like this product.  I use this as a very very light morning moisturizer and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the vitamin C serum and was very happy with the result so I decided to try the hyaluronic serum. I applied the serum on my face in the morning and it left my skin feeling very soft. I was also happy with how long my skin was moisturized, it lasted throughout the day. 5 stars for a great moisturizer that actually works.</li>
            <li> Very thin serum; runs off the dropper.  Seems to work OK. The skin does not feel as tight as with other HA sera I have used.</li>
            <li> Right around the time that I had heard about the wonders of Hyaluronic acid, I received a sample of it from a subscription service- (the Skin Inc deluxe sized bottle) which was in mid July. Based on my research at that point, I had already started taking Hyaluronic acid supplements (Hydraplenish off Amazon) at the start of July. The physical difference I saw in the serum between the Skin Inc bottle and this SCS branded bottle: the former was thicker and more gel like with little beads that cannot be felt on the skin and the latter seemed like slightly &#x27;thick&#x27; water. The Skin inc bottle retails for approximately $45 full size and with such a price disparity, one would expect huge differences in the end results- not so. While the Skin inc version of the serum leaves your skin feeling hydrated and supple immediately, the SCS brand&#x27;s hyaluronic serum first tightens the skin, similar to the sensation one gets right after putting on a peel off mask on the face. In about 5 minutes after, the skin feels as hydrated and moisturised as it felt with the Skin inc serum, which is probably the amount of time that it takes for the skin to fully absorb it. The next morning, my skin feels plump, hydrated and smooth (irrespective of which brand of hyaluronic acid serum I&#x27;ve used), and over the last month and a half that I&#x27;ve been taking both the supplements and using the serum regularly, I find that I&#x27;m finally on the path to getting the kind of skin I&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it on my face in the morning and it works wonders. My skin feels soft and moisturized throughout the day which is great for my sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow my skin feels great!</li>
            <li> I will never mess around with other forms of hyaluronic acid again.  I get immediate smoothing of dry skin and my skin drinks it up.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your faces feeling soft and smooth...will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> An absolute must have for every woman&#x27;s daily skin regime. This product used prior to your moisturizer will help your skin stay hydrated all day. it locks in the moisture leaving your skin hydrated, plump and beautiful all day. I recommend using 3-4 drops 2 times per day. Morning and evenings. Don&#x27;t forget your neck and décolleté...</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! Makes my skin look and feel fresh and young. Great value! Great price and easy transaction! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Not strong enough to show visible improvement  when used alone. Use pure vitamin c powder diluted in fresh lemon juice to help remove dead cells first. When the hyaluronic acid is dry, moisturize with pure vitamin A. (Prick the gel cap for pure form of retinol. Smile!</li>
            <li> 5 stars because it was exactly what I wanted. Hydrates my skin throughout the day using very little product. Will purchase again. Thanks</li>
            <li> My expectations never match most of the claims for such products, but this item seems fine, feels comfortable on the face.  Does it do anything?  I can&#x27;t tell if it has or if it will with more time.  These products require persistence and faith and even then it&#x27;s hard to see effects.</li>
            <li> Great Serum . Goes on nice . A bit sticky</li>
            <li> I have been using this Serum for a couple of weeks now and love it! Within a few days my skin felt less dry and looked more refreshed. Love this product. Will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> This item is not what what you think. It does not have the acid in the name and you think you&#x27;re buying Hyaluronic acid serum but you&#x27;re not don&#x27;t be fooled this is not the same product that your dermatologist recommend look at the bottle closely because the ingredients or even different than the box that it comes in</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Do not waste your money. This is after using the entire bottle on my smile and forehead lines. No change whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t see much difference after a week so i quit using it, I may try it again and give it more time.</li>
            <li> Too liquid and no results in my case</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks, I could see a difference, Will buy again.</li>
            <li> After just two days, I swear I don&#x27;t need foundation. I am 51... This also goes for my 72 year old mom....her skin appears radiant and supple. No make up needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; year old mom.</li>
