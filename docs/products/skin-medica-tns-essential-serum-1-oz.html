            <li>I have almost no wrinkles (good genetics)</li>
            <li>What can I say - I was sucked in by the good reviews.</li>

            <li>received the product quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I ordered it online and was impressed how nicely it absorbed.  </li>
            <li>I think the best description is having a freshly washed face licked by your dog.  </li>
            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and will do so until something better comes along!  </li>
            <li>This product eliminates a step (applying separate moisturizer) and I love it!  </li>
            <li>The texture of my skin is amazing.</li>
            <li>really amazing results</li>
            <li>Started using this 3 years ago and the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference even after a couple of days and have had many people even comment on how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to SkinMedica, I can honestly say my skin looks great!</li>
            <li>I purchased this serum two times from my dermatologist and liked it.  </li>
            <li>It smells kind of like valerian</li>
            <li>The real stuff works great, so make sure you buy it from a reputable dealer!!  </li>
            <li>Tremendous product for great looking skin.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed and surprised by the call.  </li>
            <li>I know I am not allergic to the \\&quot;real\\&quot; product since I have successfully used 3 bottles with good results and not so much as a spot of redness or irritation.  </li>
            <li>First review on Amazon I&#x27;ve ever written and I have purchased many great items.  </li>
            <li>This product is the best I have used so far to remove fine lines.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and more taut.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this product from my dermatologist for much more money.  </li>
            <li>I saved more than $100.00  by buying it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>I will be  purchasing more of this product as well as the others which I use.</li>
            <li>Most use a retinoid, and all of them stated that they used this skinmedica product.  </li>
            <li>Amazon got me a much better deal at $167.00.</li>
            <li>I love this product but don&#x27;t want to pay spa prices.</li>
            <li>I bought more, and I saw an almost immediate improvement in my skin texture and tone upon using it again.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this serum for 5 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>My skin has shown an improvement soon after purchasing and the texture, elasticity is much better.</li>
            <li>Skinmedica tns essential serum is the best face product I\\&quot;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t do any more for my skin than creams 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li>Im extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Now on most of Skin Medica products.</li>
            <li>Now they look better than they have in years.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love all the products.</li>
            <li>So pleased that Amazon.com carries it.  </li>
            <li>You push the top of the container and they come out side by side...</li>
            <li>I have been using it about a month and have received many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok cream.</li>
            <li>Need more time to see if I get results from it or not.</li>
            <li>better ideas out there?</li>
            <li>Hopefully not just drinking the kool-aid, but I feel my skin looks and feels better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>Purchase gold, it is a better deal.</li>
            <li>Go to skinmedica&#x27;s website and view their video; then make sure you follow the directions.</li>
            <li>No one should be okay with this, at all.</li>
            <li>When I run out I always end up ordering more.</li>
            <li>When I use this serum my skin coloring is better.</li>
            <li>Smoothed the top also.  </li>
            <li>I wish the packing was more practical also.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;We have purchased this item many times.</li>
            <li>But like most companies, they mark this up to an obscene amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also  made my skin more supple.  </li>
            <li>I do think it is an outstanding product with regard to its ease in usage.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything pretty much and this is the best skin serum.</li>
            <li>Skinmedica is a great product, highly recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>Lines are smoothing out and my complexion is becoming more even in tone and texture.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product and has really helped my skin to stay smooth and more youthful.</li>
            <li>It was becoming rougher in appearance and I was have periodic episodes of rosacea.</li>
            <li>It gets clogged easily.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes the first time you use it to kind of have to bang the container on the wall to get the product moving.  </li>
            <li>It was smoother and the fine lines were diminished.</li>
            <li>It conceals fine lines and firms the skin.</li>
            <li>This serum really works, love a product that says what it does and then does it!  </li>
            <li>I can tell a huge diff.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in a hurry and was free of defects.</li>
            <li>Worth every penney--even better at a discount.</li>
            <li>Buy it from a reputable doctor&#x27;s office where you know you are getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I know just some cheap lotion.  </li>
            <li>I think this is the key to the great results I&#x27;ve seen since my derm.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t buy more right away.  </li>
            <li>Decided to go without it for a couple of months, bought some highly rated department store stuff and used that for a couple of weeks and suddenly more wrinkles!  </li>
            <li>Really like product, worth the money, have tried countless products, this is the best, and it was shipped quickly too!</li>
            <li>The seller sent it in a timely manner and in the original package.</li>
            <li>This is an &amp;#34;Upgrade&amp;#34; from the Skinmedica Recovery Complex because it combines the same great serum with moisturizer and the results are wonderful!  </li>
            <li>it applies smoothly to face and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>after I clean the clogged side it still clogs.</li>
            <li>A combination of this serum and Retin A has really given my skin a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>I put the bottle away in my bathroom and decided to purchase another one at full price, which I used with no problems.  </li>
            <li>I am really looking forward to seeing if my skins improves more with time.</li>
            <li>It seemed to absorb so quickly, that I used about 3 pumps at each application to cover my full face and neck.</li>
            <li>As I have stated in other reviews this is a great product and I will continue to use it all the time.</li>
            <li>Although these products are very expensive, we can be thankful that Amazon provides us with excellent sellers, that are honest and carry these products at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>I went through my first bottle in 10 days!</li>
            <li>Great product even though a little spendy.</li>
            <li>The results took some time but are worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>My skin feels good and soft but as far as lines or lifting happening</li>
            <li>This product is pricey BUT worth every cent...</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old and have almost no wrinkles and my skin glows with a healthy look.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Having said though I am a SkinMedica fan and some products are worth to splurge for.</li>
            <li>worth the $$$$$...but love that this seller offers the product at a price that is affordable.  </li>
            <li>I think that the first bottle went quick because I over-applied.  </li>
            <li>Only 3 stars because of high cost and crappy dispenser, otherwise I&#x27;m pleased :).&lt;br</li>
            <li>For that price, there should really be some significant difference in my skin, and there wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The resullts were right away.</li>
            <li>and it came right away</li>
            <li>Baby boomers, don&#x27;t let yourselves get fleeced - we&#x27;re smarter than that, right?</li>
            <li>i use this right after morning shower when face is still damp.</li>
            <li>TNS Essential Serum is an amazing product--the first time I have ever spent such a huge amount on a skin cream (age 51), and I&#x27;m truly happy with the product itself.</li>
            <li>Of course this is one of those funny things where it&#x27;s hard to measure what the product is really doing, but the best way I can endorse it is to say that it certainly isn&#x27;t hurting</li>
            <li>Pores look smaller, skin is smooth and fine lines, as well as deeper lines, have diminshed...</li>
            <li>but it seems to be helping the very very fine lines around my mouth and upper eye areas.  </li>
            <li>Potential buyers should be aware that this is the controversial face cream product which is made from harvested neonatal foreskins.</li>
            <li>This is my 4th bottle of this product and the first time I ordered through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>many jobs therefore I do save money by not buying different types  of creams to address my skin issues.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my first container of SkinMedica TNS Serum from a doctor for $260.  </li>
            <li>Any product of Skinmedica not sold through an authorized dealer is most likely expired, diverted, or deleted product and will not work as it should.</li>
            <li>I love the product and would like to continue using it daily.</li>
            <li>I thought at first it might be a defective batch</li>
            <li>After the first use I noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve be using this product for years, first introduced to it from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s the first thing you should know.</li>
            <li>I have received exactly one compliment about my \\&quot;improved\\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li>Occasionally I would run out of this product and wasn&#x27;t sure I should spend the money.</li>
            <li>It takes two straight months of faithful use morning and night for the biggest difference to appear!</li>
            <li>I love how the TNS Essential Serum makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>rather expensive but occasionly pay the price to get a superior product,  great for keeping skin younger looking; always like a discount</li>
            <li>I am sure iam not the only person having this problem.  </li>
            <li>Loved the product I got from my dermatologist but feel like I wasted $150.00 on the serum I got from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Too bad our brilliant FDA doesn&#x27;t provide better regulation of the lofty, unprovable, undocumented claims of skin-care products like this.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it works very well, but it only lasted me a month before either one side ran out or the pump clogged.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and was glad to find it on line at a much cheaper price than the med-spa was charging.</li>
            <li>What kind of messed up world are we living in where we strap babies down and harvest their penis skin for makeup?</li>
            <li>An expired product is a less effective product.</li>
            <li>This is a good product but sometimes it is hard to get the cream out of the container.</li>
            <li>but when I ran out of it and went without using it, I noticed a huge difference in my appearance with the same makeup.  </li>
            <li>but my skin at age 46 has really started to bother me after years of no issues.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product, use it AM and PM.  </li>
            <li>They mark them up by as much as $100.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>I have been using skin medica for about a month and do not notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>It also has kept my wrinkles at a reasonable level for my age.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin texture or crinkles.  </li>
            <li>This serum is absolutely a must for me.</li>
            <li>I guess I expected more out of this product for the cost.</li>
            <li>This product is working very well on my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin has improved very well</li>
            <li>and it is an imatation to the real product.  </li>
            <li>have recommended this product, for people who do&#x27;t miond spending too much on beauty.</li>
            <li>One would think it&#x27;d be much easier to dip into the creams with finger or applicator.</li>
            <li>I have tried cleaning out the dispersal hole, taken off the top and now will attempt to see if it is empty on one side using tools.</li>
            <li>Finally a product that really works !!!</li>
            <li>I have purchased numerous skin care products in the past, and this is honestly a great product.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product but I am disappointed because when I ordered this I thought I was getting the original product</li>
            <li>The same hold true.  </li>
            <li>Within a week my skin started looking less healthy.</li>
            <li>Needs more product and less package.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t go wrong - great price and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>A real plus for mature skin!</li>
            <li>My aesthetician highly recommends it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Seller and this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend TNS ESS.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for skin enhancement.</li>
            <li>Although the cost of the product is high, I would recommend it, but would advise people to use it sparingly.  </li>
            <li>Regardless of seller, I still encourage everyone to call to be certain you weren&#x27;t sold old, expired product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so pleasantly surprised to see a real improvement within a week of using this, and continued improvement there after.  </li>
            <li>Great but way too expensive.  </li>
            <li>Dried out my face more than moisturize.</li>
            <li>The service is smooth, I have bought other times here and would recommend them</li>
            <li>I will live with this product from now on</li>
            <li>think your money would be better spent using proven Retinol based products and various peels/facials/fillers at the dermatologists office.  </li>
            <li>feels very natural on face.  </li>
            <li>Only use a small amount though or you will go broke buying more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 years old and need all the help I can get!</li>
            <li>(and I am 35 yrs old!)</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I figured The essential serum would do a much better job, being that it has the added benefits of a serum, which contains vitamin C, peptides, and other smoothing and anti aging ingredients.</li>
            <li>Skinmedica Tns Essential Serum was in it&#x27;s original packaging, and I received it actually earlier than they had told me.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I found it on Amazon for much less.  </li>
            <li>I am 59 years old and have rosacea.  </li>
            <li>Some pumps do not work well and in some cases, the product might be old, but unopened.  </li>
            <li>Please go to the skinmedica web site directly to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist tells me there are only 3 products in the cosmetic world that really work on lifting skin and improving texture.  </li>
            <li>There is no way to tell how much product is left.  </li>
            <li>Plus, once I was finally able to get at the two inner tubes, the red serum side still had quite a bit of product, while the cream side was almost completely empty.</li>
            <li>The red gel is much redder.  </li>
            <li>I called them directly</li>
            <li>After using it, your skin feels soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Not Green.</li>
            <li>Will wait a few more weeks and will know if I want to pay the big price.</li>
            <li>This is the exact product that works really well, sold for almost half of the amount I have seen elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Firmer skin, better skin tone, softens small wrinkles for me!</li>
            <li>It has a slightly odd smell(which goes away once you apply it) and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my skin turned red all over and remained red for 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully that last purchase was just a fluke, and IBI doesn&#x27;t normally sell expired product.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and I had a little bit of an issue with the pump, and wrote about it, questioning its authenticity.  </li>
            <li>After a few days, the product appeared to even out my skin tone, smooth my skin, and make the pores appear smaller...</li>
            <li>Since this stuff is quite pricy, you don&#x27;t exactly want to toss it, so I just use it but without the benefit of the other serum</li>
            <li>a little pricey but worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have used this product or the early version of it for ten years.</li>
            <li>I only used one pump in the am and one in the pm and at first the red serum wouldn&#x27;t come out and shortly after that not even the white serum would come out.</li>
            <li>The real serum should be orange and white in color, the stuff I got is like a red jelly and then white lotion</li>
            <li>I will be trying to contact TNS directly to discuss this issue, but I felt I should post this review to warn people that the \\&quot;bargain price\\&quot; product might not be such a bargain.</li>
            <li>And, yes, after beginning its use again recently, there was improvement in the texture  and pores of my 60 year old skin.  </li>
            <li>The problem with this product, if you want to consider it a problem, it&#x27;s effective, but expensive.  </li>
            <li>I alternate each application direct from the pump by applying to the back of my hands to mix the two ingredients.  </li>
            <li>A Dr turned me on to this when it was new and unknown.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and less $$ than my dermatologist charged me.</li>
            <li>it works so well, but hopefully this bottle will last a little longer since it costs so much.</li>
            <li>I see smaller pore size, a decrease in fine lines, decreased redness, and an overall tighter appearance.</li>

            <li> Wonderful product makes your skin so smooth</li>

            <li> I have almost no wrinkles (good genetics)</li>
            <li> What can I say - I was sucked in by the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I quickly went to Amazon to find the best price and ordered TNS.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> received the product quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I ordered it online and was impressed how nicely it absorbed.  </li>
            <li> I think the best description is having a freshly washed face licked by your dog.  </li>
            <li> Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and will do so until something better comes along!  </li>
            <li> This product eliminates a step (applying separate moisturizer) and I love it!  </li>
            <li> The texture of my skin is amazing.</li>
            <li> really amazing results</li>
            <li> Started using this 3 years ago and the difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference even after a couple of days and have had many people even comment on how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to SkinMedica, I can honestly say my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum two times from my dermatologist and liked it.  </li>
            <li> It smells kind of like valerian</li>
            <li> The real stuff works great, so make sure you buy it from a reputable dealer!!  </li>
            <li> Tremendous product for great looking skin.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed and surprised by the call.  </li>
            <li> I know I am not allergic to the \\&quot;real\\&quot; product since I have successfully used 3 bottles with good results and not so much as a spot of redness or irritation.  </li>
            <li> First review on Amazon I&#x27;ve ever written and I have purchased many great items.  </li>
            <li> This product is the best I have used so far to remove fine lines.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and more taut.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this product from my dermatologist for much more money.  </li>
            <li> I saved more than $100.00  by buying it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> I will be  purchasing more of this product as well as the others which I use.</li>
            <li> Most use a retinoid, and all of them stated that they used this skinmedica product.  </li>
            <li> Amazon got me a much better deal at $167.00.</li>
            <li> I love this product but don&#x27;t want to pay spa prices.</li>
            <li> I bought more, and I saw an almost immediate improvement in my skin texture and tone upon using it again.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for 5 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> My skin has shown an improvement soon after purchasing and the texture, elasticity is much better.</li>
            <li> Skinmedica tns essential serum is the best face product I\\&quot;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do any more for my skin than creams 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> Im extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Now on most of Skin Medica products.</li>
            <li> Now they look better than they have in years.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love all the products.</li>
            <li> So pleased that Amazon.com carries it.  </li>
            <li> You push the top of the container and they come out side by side...</li>
            <li> I have been using it about a month and have received many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok cream.</li>
            <li> Need more time to see if I get results from it or not.</li>
            <li> better ideas out there?</li>
            <li> Hopefully not just drinking the kool-aid, but I feel my skin looks and feels better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> Purchase gold, it is a better deal.</li>
            <li> Go to skinmedica&#x27;s website and view their video; then make sure you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> No one should be okay with this, at all.</li>
            <li> When I run out I always end up ordering more.</li>
            <li> When I use this serum my skin coloring is better.</li>
            <li> Smoothed the top also.  </li>
            <li> I wish the packing was more practical also.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;We have purchased this item many times.</li>
            <li> But like most companies, they mark this up to an obscene amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also  made my skin more supple.  </li>
            <li> I do think it is an outstanding product with regard to its ease in usage.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything pretty much and this is the best skin serum.</li>
            <li> Skinmedica is a great product, highly recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> Lines are smoothing out and my complexion is becoming more even in tone and texture.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product and has really helped my skin to stay smooth and more youthful.</li>
            <li> It was becoming rougher in appearance and I was have periodic episodes of rosacea.</li>
            <li> It gets clogged easily.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the first time you use it to kind of have to bang the container on the wall to get the product moving.  </li>
            <li> It was smoother and the fine lines were diminished.</li>
            <li> It conceals fine lines and firms the skin.</li>
            <li> This serum really works, love a product that says what it does and then does it!  </li>
            <li> I can tell a huge diff.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a hurry and was free of defects.</li>
            <li> Worth every penney--even better at a discount.</li>
            <li> Buy it from a reputable doctor&#x27;s office where you know you are getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I know just some cheap lotion.  </li>
            <li> I think this is the key to the great results I&#x27;ve seen since my derm.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t buy more right away.  </li>
            <li> Decided to go without it for a couple of months, bought some highly rated department store stuff and used that for a couple of weeks and suddenly more wrinkles!  </li>
            <li> Really like product, worth the money, have tried countless products, this is the best, and it was shipped quickly too!</li>
            <li> The seller sent it in a timely manner and in the original package.</li>
            <li> This is an &amp;#34;Upgrade&amp;#34; from the Skinmedica Recovery Complex because it combines the same great serum with moisturizer and the results are wonderful!  </li>
            <li> it applies smoothly to face and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> after I clean the clogged side it still clogs.</li>
            <li> A combination of this serum and Retin A has really given my skin a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li> I put the bottle away in my bathroom and decided to purchase another one at full price, which I used with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I am really looking forward to seeing if my skins improves more with time.</li>
            <li> It seemed to absorb so quickly, that I used about 3 pumps at each application to cover my full face and neck.</li>
            <li> As I have stated in other reviews this is a great product and I will continue to use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Although these products are very expensive, we can be thankful that Amazon provides us with excellent sellers, that are honest and carry these products at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I went through my first bottle in 10 days!</li>
            <li> Great product even though a little spendy.</li>
            <li> The results took some time but are worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> My skin feels good and soft but as far as lines or lifting happening</li>
            <li> This product is pricey BUT worth every cent...</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old and have almost no wrinkles and my skin glows with a healthy look.  </li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Having said though I am a SkinMedica fan and some products are worth to splurge for.</li>
            <li> worth the $$$$$...but love that this seller offers the product at a price that is affordable.  </li>
            <li> I think that the first bottle went quick because I over-applied.  </li>
            <li> Only 3 stars because of high cost and crappy dispenser, otherwise I&#x27;m pleased :).&lt;br</li>
            <li> For that price, there should really be some significant difference in my skin, and there wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The resullts were right away.</li>
            <li> and it came right away</li>
            <li> Baby boomers, don&#x27;t let yourselves get fleeced - we&#x27;re smarter than that, right?</li>
            <li> i use this right after morning shower when face is still damp.</li>
            <li> TNS Essential Serum is an amazing product--the first time I have ever spent such a huge amount on a skin cream (age 51), and I&#x27;m truly happy with the product itself.</li>
            <li> Of course this is one of those funny things where it&#x27;s hard to measure what the product is really doing, but the best way I can endorse it is to say that it certainly isn&#x27;t hurting</li>
            <li> Pores look smaller, skin is smooth and fine lines, as well as deeper lines, have diminshed...</li>
            <li> but it seems to be helping the very very fine lines around my mouth and upper eye areas.  </li>
            <li> Potential buyers should be aware that this is the controversial face cream product which is made from harvested neonatal foreskins.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th bottle of this product and the first time I ordered through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> many jobs therefore I do save money by not buying different types  of creams to address my skin issues.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my first container of SkinMedica TNS Serum from a doctor for $260.  </li>
            <li> Any product of Skinmedica not sold through an authorized dealer is most likely expired, diverted, or deleted product and will not work as it should.</li>
            <li> I love the product and would like to continue using it daily.</li>
            <li> I thought at first it might be a defective batch</li>
            <li> After the first use I noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve be using this product for years, first introduced to it from my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s the first thing you should know.</li>
            <li> I have received exactly one compliment about my \\&quot;improved\\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I would run out of this product and wasn&#x27;t sure I should spend the money.</li>
            <li> It takes two straight months of faithful use morning and night for the biggest difference to appear!</li>
            <li> I love how the TNS Essential Serum makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> rather expensive but occasionly pay the price to get a superior product,  great for keeping skin younger looking; always like a discount</li>
            <li> I am sure iam not the only person having this problem.  </li>
            <li> Loved the product I got from my dermatologist but feel like I wasted $150.00 on the serum I got from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Too bad our brilliant FDA doesn&#x27;t provide better regulation of the lofty, unprovable, undocumented claims of skin-care products like this.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it works very well, but it only lasted me a month before either one side ran out or the pump clogged.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and was glad to find it on line at a much cheaper price than the med-spa was charging.</li>
            <li> What kind of messed up world are we living in where we strap babies down and harvest their penis skin for makeup?</li>
            <li> An expired product is a less effective product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but sometimes it is hard to get the cream out of the container.</li>
            <li> but when I ran out of it and went without using it, I noticed a huge difference in my appearance with the same makeup.  </li>
            <li> but my skin at age 46 has really started to bother me after years of no issues.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product, use it AM and PM.  </li>
            <li> They mark them up by as much as $100.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have been using skin medica for about a month and do not notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> It also has kept my wrinkles at a reasonable level for my age.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin texture or crinkles.  </li>
            <li> This serum is absolutely a must for me.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected more out of this product for the cost.</li>
            <li> This product is working very well on my skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin has improved very well</li>
            <li> and it is an imatation to the real product.  </li>
            <li> have recommended this product, for people who do&#x27;t miond spending too much on beauty.</li>
            <li> One would think it&#x27;d be much easier to dip into the creams with finger or applicator.</li>
            <li> I have tried cleaning out the dispersal hole, taken off the top and now will attempt to see if it is empty on one side using tools.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that really works !!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased numerous skin care products in the past, and this is honestly a great product.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good product but I am disappointed because when I ordered this I thought I was getting the original product</li>
            <li> The same hold true.  </li>
            <li> Within a week my skin started looking less healthy.</li>
            <li> Needs more product and less package.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong - great price and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> A real plus for mature skin!</li>
            <li> My aesthetician highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Seller and this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend TNS ESS.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for skin enhancement.</li>
            <li> Although the cost of the product is high, I would recommend it, but would advise people to use it sparingly.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of seller, I still encourage everyone to call to be certain you weren&#x27;t sold old, expired product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so pleasantly surprised to see a real improvement within a week of using this, and continued improvement there after.  </li>
            <li> Great but way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Dried out my face more than moisturize.</li>
            <li> The service is smooth, I have bought other times here and would recommend them</li>
            <li> I will live with this product from now on</li>
            <li> think your money would be better spent using proven Retinol based products and various peels/facials/fillers at the dermatologists office.  </li>
            <li> feels very natural on face.  </li>
            <li> Only use a small amount though or you will go broke buying more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old and need all the help I can get!</li>
            <li> (and I am 35 yrs old!)</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I figured The essential serum would do a much better job, being that it has the added benefits of a serum, which contains vitamin C, peptides, and other smoothing and anti aging ingredients.</li>
            <li> Skinmedica Tns Essential Serum was in it&#x27;s original packaging, and I received it actually earlier than they had told me.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I found it on Amazon for much less.  </li>
            <li> I am 59 years old and have rosacea.  </li>
            <li> Some pumps do not work well and in some cases, the product might be old, but unopened.  </li>
            <li> Please go to the skinmedica web site directly to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist tells me there are only 3 products in the cosmetic world that really work on lifting skin and improving texture.  </li>
            <li> There is no way to tell how much product is left.  </li>
            <li> Plus, once I was finally able to get at the two inner tubes, the red serum side still had quite a bit of product, while the cream side was almost completely empty.</li>
            <li> The red gel is much redder.  </li>
            <li> I called them directly</li>
            <li> After using it, your skin feels soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Not Green.</li>
            <li> Will wait a few more weeks and will know if I want to pay the big price.</li>
            <li> This is the exact product that works really well, sold for almost half of the amount I have seen elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Firmer skin, better skin tone, softens small wrinkles for me!</li>
            <li> It has a slightly odd smell(which goes away once you apply it) and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my skin turned red all over and remained red for 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully that last purchase was just a fluke, and IBI doesn&#x27;t normally sell expired product.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and I had a little bit of an issue with the pump, and wrote about it, questioning its authenticity.  </li>
            <li> After a few days, the product appeared to even out my skin tone, smooth my skin, and make the pores appear smaller...</li>
            <li> Since this stuff is quite pricy, you don&#x27;t exactly want to toss it, so I just use it but without the benefit of the other serum</li>
            <li> a little pricey but worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have used this product or the early version of it for ten years.</li>
            <li> I only used one pump in the am and one in the pm and at first the red serum wouldn&#x27;t come out and shortly after that not even the white serum would come out.</li>
            <li> The real serum should be orange and white in color, the stuff I got is like a red jelly and then white lotion</li>
            <li> I will be trying to contact TNS directly to discuss this issue, but I felt I should post this review to warn people that the \\&quot;bargain price\\&quot; product might not be such a bargain.</li>
            <li> And, yes, after beginning its use again recently, there was improvement in the texture  and pores of my 60 year old skin.  </li>
            <li> The problem with this product, if you want to consider it a problem, it&#x27;s effective, but expensive.  </li>
            <li> I alternate each application direct from the pump by applying to the back of my hands to mix the two ingredients.  </li>
            <li> A Dr turned me on to this when it was new and unknown.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and less $$ than my dermatologist charged me.</li>
            <li> it works so well, but hopefully this bottle will last a little longer since it costs so much.</li>
            <li> I see smaller pore size, a decrease in fine lines, decreased redness, and an overall tighter appearance.</li>
            <li> but since I only used it for 10 days, I don&#x27;t believe that was quite long enough to critically evaluate the changes.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is not an authentic product like I purchased for full price from my dermatologist, or if this lot of cream was bad.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to testify as to whether it works or not.</li>
            <li> (Stored bottle upside down, slammed it into my hand before trying to pump, rinsed tip in hot water, picked out all dried red serum from tip, etc).</li>
            <li> I had previously been ordering directly from Skinmedica and thought I would give amazon a chance.  </li>
            <li> When I found that it was on Amazon and other sites on-line, I was pleased, but it&#x27;s still expensive</li>
            <li> Then, to get every last bit of product out of container, had to use a hammer and extreme force to break shell of bottle open.</li>
            <li> (one lotion is white, the other red).</li>
            <li> This product may do all that I have read, but after two weeks, the white side seems empty.  </li>
            <li> I hope to be a long time customer of this company.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product many years ago when it was less expensive...</li>
            <li> I previously used several SkinCeutical products, but now only need this one for the face, neck, and chest areas.</li>
            <li> I would encourage all other buyers to do the same.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for my overworked, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It does completely dry it out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle and with the last bottle I was not quick about replacing it and went a month using other products.  </li>
            <li> Have only used it for less than a month</li>
            <li> The product that arrived was 100% the same as I got at the medispa for $100 less.</li>
            <li> Stress Lines are less visual.  </li>
            <li> I shop at Amazon and the SkinMedica Essential Serum is half what I would pay at the beauty spa</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this serum from Amazon.com because it costs less than at my local Spa or Dermatologist office.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and this product works wonders on it.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this gives me small red spots after a few days of using.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to check out old skin.  </li>
            <li> I started using the TNX recovery complex a while back, but was only using it once a day.</li>
            <li> I should also emphasize for those looking to save money that you have to be careful where you purchase.  </li>
            <li> No thanks going forward.</li>
            <li> It has two little holes, one dispensing the orange goop, the other dispensing the white stuff.</li>
            <li> Yes it is pricey however a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and a little goes a long way; but it is pricey.</li>
            <li> I figured that i was wasting my money on other creams and serums-</li>
            <li> There are other products with growth factors now.</li>
            <li> I think it helps me \\&quot;maintain\\&quot; about as well as any other serum over the counter.  </li>
            <li> However, every time I have ever gotten to the end of my bottle, one of the serums has emptied out while the other is still plentiful.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> put small amount on back of hand, and mix two fluids together</li>
            <li> /&gt;FYI:  TNS Essential Serum is $100 less on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> There is no expiration date, but be careful in your decision as to where you buy and what is known about the age and condition of the product, even before you spend half the price.</li>
            <li> I looked like I had a bad sunburn or a light chemical peel.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is the expense.</li>
            <li> Certainly not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried turning it upside down overnight, slapping the bottom like a Ketchup bottle to no avail.</li>
            <li> As with a previous reviewer, this was recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> Use sparingly by applying to skin that is still slightly damp from toning (acid tone, then a hydrating toner like a floral/hyraluronic spritz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently had tons of stress and hormonal issues causing my skin to look tired and aged.  </li>
            <li> It does have an odd odor</li>
            <li> It has a rather odd odor</li>
            <li> but i found a price online that made the cost much less.</li>
            <li> SkinMedica&#x27;s number is 1-866-577-3072 - when I called someone answered immediately; took me less than 1 minute to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps skin tight and wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li> This time the smell of the product isn&#x27;t as bad, likely due to it not being old product.</li>
            <li> However, at $250 per ounce it was a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> and I would return the product to get at least a partial credit</li>
            <li> and yes I am my own worst enemy</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for a few years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 3 months &amp; has done nothing,Its a waste of money,they have got this product way over rated.what a waste</li>
            <li> One side of the pump clogs up.even after a few days between use.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried buying from Amazon, as Skin Medica claims that the product is not authentic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less expensive to purchase on line as opposed to a medical office.  </li>
            <li> At least this time, I can purchase the product for half of the price I would pay at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> However, the double barrel pump dispenser totally SUCKS!!</li>
            <li> Its expensive, however  in the short time I have been using it, I do see results.  </li>
            <li> I wish I did not love this product-</li>
            <li> and truthfully I do not see any stand out results.</li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t be that difficult to use a product or to open the container!!</li>
            <li> For $270 (at derm&#x27;s ofc) or even $150 on Amazon, it&#x27;s a ridiculously small amount of product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t purchase this again until either the amount of product fills the stupidly oversized container, or the price comes down to a reasonable amount for ONE OUNCE of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I will warn you, it has no perfumes and thus the smell is a little tough to get past.  </li>
            <li> Hard to say if everyone will like the product bc</li>
            <li> : The packaging has a flaw, in that you need to turn the bottle over and hit the bottom fairly hard -</li>
            <li> All I could think of, was that I started using the recovery complex twice a day, versus once a day.</li>
            <li> Results are nothing crazy especially for the price</li>
            <li> I have read dozens of reviews for TNS Serum and this seems to be a widespread complaint.</li>
            <li> Common sense...)</li>
            <li> (One side tends to be slow to come out.)</li>
            <li> Yes, as other reviewers have noted, the dispenser size is indeed deceptive - it contains a mere one ounce.</li>
            <li> this is a very expensive product and in order to get the results necessary, but the Lotion and the Gel have to squeeze out together......</li>
            <li> I know that sounds ridiculous, but i thought maybe the redness might have been caused by something else that I didn&#x27;t realize (and because of the cost, I didn&#x27;t want to just throw it away).  </li>
            <li> and it is probably giving me some subtle but cumulative effect since I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and I sometimes stop using it when money is tight.</li>
            <li> The swelling remained for almost 4 days (bad enought that I did not want to go out in public).  </li>
            <li> Hard plastic shards flew everywhere, almost hitting me in the eye!</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed in this product especially for what you pay for it.</li>
            <li> A product that has science behind it.</li>
            <li> Poor Poor Packaging design by Skin Medica.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obscenely overpriced; not a good value for the price or the measly amount in the dispenser.</li>
            <li> I would rather use this and age gracefully than to look unreal with botox or other alternative crap out there.</li>
            <li> This is not only disgusting but unethical.</li>
            <li> To expensive to continue use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
            <li> It is expensive.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> This is fake and for all</li>
            <li> Not Happy!</li>
            <li> Skinmedica, the manufacturer, has lousy customer service.</li>
            <li> expensive,</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> Companies are unlikely to be helpful if you admit you purchased from an unauthorized source.</li>
            <li> The texture felt sticky and weird on the skin</li>
            <li> Hi--Ladies, let&#x27;s stop buying all the false claims these products make (I am lecturing myself here too!).</li>
            <li> At $260 a pop, this seems absolutely ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> However, It&#x27;s $100.00 less expensive buying it through Amazon!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive</li>
            <li> This serum is a gimmick, a very expensive one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had a very bad experience with this cream.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These foreskins are violently taken without consent of the owner.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed becasue</li>
            <li> I notice that my skin looks 25, despite my horrible tanning background (I self-tan now!)!</li>
            <li> Plus the smell is awful!!!!</li>
            <li> The dispenser is horribly designed.</li>
            <li> The packaging of this product is terrible.  </li>
            <li> , it smells horrible , I&#x27;m not buying it again&lt;</li>
            <li> but, packaging is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product even though a little spendy.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th bottle of this product and the first time I ordered through Amazon.  Can&#x27;t go wrong - great price and fast shipping.  Hard to say if everyone will like the product bc what works for one person may not work for the next.  For me, it is great.  My skin is smoother and more taut.  It does not break me out.  My aesthetician highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> First review on Amazon I&#x27;ve ever written and I have purchased many great items.  As with a previous reviewer, this was recommended by my dermatologist.  The cost of $250 about made me have a heart attack but my skin at age 46 has really started to bother me after years of no issues.  I noticed a difference even after a couple of days and have had many people even comment on how good my skin looks.  Amazon price is great deal, would probably have to think twice if had to buy from dermatologist again at retail price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product makes your skin so smooth</li>
            <li> Really like this product, use it AM and PM.  Its expensive, however  in the short time I have been using it, I do see results.  Am saving  my pennies to buy this product again and again!  The product does  many jobs therefore I do save money by not buying different types  of creams to address my skin issues.  This does it ALL!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I noticed a difference within a matter of days.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had taken before and after pictures.  The only negative is the&lt;br /&gt;price. However, it cheaper than botox.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product from my dermatologist for much more money.  I saved more than $100.00  by buying it on Amazon.com.  It has made a big difference in my complexion.  I will be  purchasing more of this product as well as the others which I use.</li>
            <li> Skinmedica is a great product, highly recommended by my dermatologist.  However, It&#x27;s $100.00 less expensive buying it through Amazon!!!!!</li>
            <li> Really like product, worth the money, have tried countless products, this is the best, and it was shipped quickly too!</li>
            <li> I read in a magazine (forget which one) an article interviewing dermatoligist&#x27;s on what their skin care routine is.  Most use a retinoid, and all of them stated that they used this skinmedica product.  I figured that i was wasting my money on other creams and serums- why not use what the skin experts themselves use? I ordered it online and was impressed how nicely it absorbed.  After a couple weeks people actually started complimenting my skin. The longer I used it, the younger my skin looked.  After a month, scars started to fade, and pores shrunk. I think that the first bottle went quick because I over-applied.  You only need a little bit.  The second bottle I made last almost two months, also with increased effect.  Definately, no matter what your skin type, get this product.  Only use a small amount though or you will go broke buying more! This is my must have, and i think I will use this the rest of my life! Im 30, and I notice that my skin looks 25, despite my horrible tanning background (I self-tan now!)!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Skinmedica TNS Essential Serum. They sell it at their office for $250.00. Amazon got me a much better deal at $167.00. I have seen a difference in my skins texture, tone and firmness.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a hurry and was free of defects. I love this product but don&#x27;t want to pay spa prices. They mark them up by as much as $100. I&#x27;ll continue to buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> I am 57 and was recommended this by my dermatologist. I used this product for about 6 months but ran out and wanted to see if it made a difference so I didn&#x27;t buy more right away.  Mistake!  I bought more, and I saw an almost immediate improvement in my skin texture and tone upon using it again.  I am hooked. I ordered from this site and received my order promptly the last time and am going with them again.</li>
            <li> Great product and great seller. I have tried everything pretty much and this is the best skin serum. It takes care of every skin problem that you can think of.</li>
            <li> This is the exact product that works really well, sold for almost half of the amount I have seen elsewhere. The service is smooth, I have bought other times here and would recommend them</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for 5 years and love it.  A combination of this serum and Retin A has really given my skin a more youthful appearance.  My dermatologist uses it and so will I.</li>
            <li> Superb serum. Use sparingly by applying to skin that is still slightly damp from toning (acid tone, then a hydrating toner like a floral/hyraluronic spritz).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: The packaging has a flaw, in that you need to turn the bottle over and hit the bottom fairly hard - about 30 - 60 times - to get both of the serums to emerge at once. (One side tends to be slow to come out.) This is the reason I&#x27;m deducting a star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old and need all the help I can get! This product was recommended by my dematologist. I was taken back by the price, but gave it a try and now I&#x27;m hooked. Keeps skin tight and wrinkles at bay. Worth every penney--even better at a discount.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me and I purchased a bottle from his office.  I will warn you, it has no perfumes and thus the smell is a little tough to get past.  I think the best description is having a freshly washed face licked by your dog.  ew!  But my doctor explained that the smell is because of the protein content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so pleasantly surprised to see a real improvement within a week of using this, and continued improvement there after.  The problem with this product, if you want to consider it a problem, it&#x27;s effective, but expensive.  I&#x27;m on my third bottle and with the last bottle I was not quick about replacing it and went a month using other products.  My skin lost a lot of the firmness and clarity, so I&#x27;m back on it again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a year.  I previously used several SkinCeutical products, but now only need this one for the face, neck, and chest areas. You will see a noticeable difference in your skin in a couple of weeks.  People will comment on how healthly your skin looks.  It&#x27;s much less expensive to purchase on line as opposed to a medical office.  I have not noticed a difference in the products.</li>
            <li> I started with a Vitalize peel and have been using the serum for two weeks now..it must be working as today I was asked for id to purchase a lottery scratch off ticket! (and I am 35 yrs old!)</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have noticed a wonderful change in the softness of my face.  Lines are smoothing out and my complexion is becoming more even in tone and texture.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> BEWARE!  I went through my first bottle in 10 days! It seemed to absorb so quickly, that I used about 3 pumps at each application to cover my full face and neck. Using 6 pumps a day, it was gone in 10 days! OMG, that cost me $26 a day.  I am 59 years old and have rosacea.  The doctor&#x27;s office recommended I supplement with Retin-A twice a week. After a few days, the product appeared to even out my skin tone, smooth my skin, and make the pores appear smaller...but since I only used it for 10 days, I don&#x27;t believe that was quite long enough to critically evaluate the changes. Next time I will use my digital camera on MACRO to evaluate my skin before and after.  Depending on the result, I will choose to reorder or not.    I purchased my first container of SkinMedica TNS Serum from a doctor for $260.  Wow!  When I found that it was on Amazon and other sites on-line, I was pleased, but it&#x27;s still expensive and I can afford it!  At least this time, I can purchase the product for half of the price I would pay at the doctor&#x27;s office. I should also emphasize for those looking to save money that you have to be careful where you purchase.  Some pumps do not work well and in some cases, the product might be old, but unopened.  There is no expiration date, but be careful in your decision as to where you buy and what is known about the age and condition of the product, even before you spend half the price.</li>
            <li> I used this in July and was amazed at the results that showed in some photographs taken of me.  I attributed it to the makeup but when I ran out of it and went without using it, I noticed a huge difference in my appearance with the same makeup.  I just ordered a second bottle and will never not use it.  Tremendous product for great looking skin.</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations. Was recommended by my medical spa as next step up from the obagi line I was using. Noticed an improvment within weeks. I resisted the price of $260. Went to Amazon to find the product at an affordable price. Glad I did. Will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Potential buyers should be aware that this is the controversial face cream product which is made from harvested neonatal foreskins. These foreskins are violently taken without consent of the owner. This is not only disgusting but unethical.</li>
            <li> To expensive to continue use. There are other products with growth factors now.</li>
            <li> I received this and unfortunately, only one side of the product works....the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; side of the product does not come out.....I have never ordered anything off the Internet before...so I felt like I got ripped off with a bottle that was not working properly....this is a very expensive product and in order to get the results necessary, but the Lotion and the Gel have to squeeze out together......and the Gel never has worked.  So either there is a malfuncation in the bottle or the Gel was never put in the bottle.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if another bottle can be mailed to me.....I can always send back the bottle to you for examination.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debra Lampe</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this gives me small red spots after a few days of using. Heard others like it but I can&#x27;t wear it I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
            <li> Please go to the skinmedica web site directly to purchase this product. you will find a list of unauthorized retailers.  Any product of Skinmedica not sold through an authorized dealer is most likely expired, diverted, or deleted product and will not work as it should.</li>
            <li> I have purchased numerous skin care products in the past, and this is honestly a great product.  My skin has shown an improvement soon after purchasing and the texture, elasticity is much better.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it works very well, but it only lasted me a month before either one side ran out or the pump clogged.  I will order again bc it works so well, but hopefully this bottle will last a little longer since it costs so much.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell of it at all and it seemed to stay with me all day. Dried out my face more than moisturize.</li>
            <li> Skinmedica tns essential serum is the best face product I\\&quot;ve ever used. The resullts were right away. I didn&#x27;t have to wait for weeks for the product to work!!  I would recommend this product to every woman who has wrinkles!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using skin medica for about a month and do not notice much of a difference. My bottle has run out in that time. I thought it would last longer. I am quite disappointed in this product especially for what you pay for it. I was totally ripped off !!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Hi--Ladies, let&#x27;s stop buying all the false claims these products make (I am lecturing myself here too!). This product didn&#x27;t do any more for my skin than creams 1/2 the price. Plus the smell is awful!!!! For that price, there should really be some significant difference in my skin, and there wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Im extremely pleased with this product. I started using the TNX recovery complex a while back, but was only using it once a day. The moment I began using it twixe a day, ppl started commenting on how great my skin looked. They were asking if I was doing anything different. All I could think of, was that I started using the recovery complex twice a day, versus once a day. I figured The essential serum would do a much better job, being that it has the added benefits of a serum, which contains vitamin C, peptides, and other smoothing and anti aging ingredients. I&#x27;m loving this product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product or the early version of it for ten years. It is a great product and has really helped my skin to stay smooth and more youthful. It also has kept my wrinkles at a reasonable level for my age. I love the product and would like to continue using it daily.</li>
            <li> I had been on Obaji products....started using this and saw a big difference!!!! Now on most of Skin Medica products.</li>
            <li> Have only used it for less than a month but it seems to be helping the very very fine lines around my mouth and upper eye areas.  It is expensive.  Will wait a few more weeks and will know if I want to pay the big price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for four months and I can not only feel a difference but everyone is commenting on how I do not have a wrinkle.  I gave a four rating because one has to mix two compounds before applying.  I alternate each application direct from the pump by applying to the back of my hands to mix the two ingredients.  Now they look better than they have in years.  It&#x27;s not a genie in a bottle but it is a helper.  Fast shipping and less $$ than my dermatologist charged me.</li>
            <li> Thanks to SkinMedica, I can honestly say my skin looks great! Although these products are very expensive, we can be thankful that Amazon provides us with excellent sellers, that are honest and carry these products at an affordable price. I&#x27;m thankful for my dermatologist which recommended me to these products but I apologize for not buying from him ...lol *** I highly recommend this Seller and this product***</li>
            <li> My skin looks beautiful!  The results took some time but are worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is the expense.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Beauty Perfect and it came right away but it didn&#x27;t even last one month.  I only used one pump in the am and one in the pm and at first the red serum wouldn&#x27;t come out and shortly after that not even the white serum would come out. Don&#x27;t buy it from them.  It is a waste of money.  I contacted them and told them perhaps the pump was defective and I would return the product to get at least a partial credit and they wouldn&#x27;t even return my email.  Buy it from a reputable doctor&#x27;s office where you know you are getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I wish I did not love this product- it&#x27;s so expensive. But it works. The texture of my skin is amazing. I was a little worried buying from Amazon, as Skin Medica claims that the product is not authentic. The product that arrived was 100% the same as I got at the medispa for $100 less. It was actually a newer lot #! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Superb product Often recommended by plastic surgeons!</li>
            <li> I love it. I love all the products.</li>
            <li> same review as earlier.  I wrote a review earlier.  The same hold true.  This product is wonderfull and all girls, women and grandmothers should use the product.</li>
            <li> I thought at first it might be a defective batch but my dermatologist said that is how it smells. Works wonders and I am a repeat customer</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s $$$$$$$ but try it, You have to.  You will go with out eating to keep using it !!! lol !  I get compliments on my skin all the time.   Finally a product that really works !!!</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 different bottles and NONE of the pumps work.  I have opened the cap, pressed on the inside individual springs, tapped it all over, and still, only 1 serum comes out!!!! For this price, it needs to work!!!! Please revise your pump!!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, for the price, I was hoping for great things!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and and I really don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin texture or crinkles.  I think it helps me \\&quot;maintain\\&quot; about as well as any other serum over the counter.  Certainly not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This serum really works, love a product that says what it does and then does it!  Works wonders for my overworked, dry skin.  Decided to go without it for a couple of months, bought some highly rated department store stuff and used that for a couple of weeks and suddenly more wrinkles!  This serum is absolutely a must for me. So pleased that Amazon.com carries it.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I guess I expected more out of this product for the cost. I&#x27;ve used it faithfully for almost 3 weeks now and truthfully I do not see any stand out results. My skin feels good and soft but as far as lines or lifting happening I have not seen this yet.</li>
            <li> This product is working very well on my skin.  Recently had tons of stress and hormonal issues causing my skin to look tired and aged.  My skin has improved very well and I was asked if I had a facial...lady at the counter said the pigment in my skin was beautiful.  I asked her if this was selling approach but she said \\&quot;no way\\&quot;.  I do see a big difference in my skin and yes I am my own worst enemy but if I can see the differnce myself with this product that&#x27;s all that matters.  I also have been told by friends/family I have really great skin.  My skin looks radiant and heathy.  Stress Lines are less visual.  Yes it is pricey however a little goes a long way.  I would rather use this and age gracefully than to look unreal with botox or other alternative crap out there.</li>
            <li> This product is pricey BUT worth every cent...</li>
            <li> This is a very good product but I am disappointed because when I ordered this I thought I was getting the original product and it is an imatation to the real product.  Buyer Be Ware!!!!!  This is fake and for all I know just some cheap lotion.  The real stuff works great, so make sure you buy it from a reputable dealer!!  The real serum should be orange and white in color, the stuff I got is like a red jelly and then white lotion and it doesn&#x27;t feel the same on the skin.  Very disappointed becasue it still cost me almost 200!  Not Happy!</li>
            <li> This is a 5 star product.  My dermatologist tells me there are only 3 products in the cosmetic world that really work on lifting skin and improving texture.  TNS Essential Serum is one of the three.  I use it twice a day and will do so until something better comes along!  The seller sent it in a timely manner and in the original package.</li>
            <li> Great skincare that works together with Vit. C + E Serum. My skin feels smoother and  has minimized wrinkles and sun damage. Amazon.com has the best prices!</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for a few years. It&#x27;s expensive and I sometimes stop using it when money is tight.I definitely see an improvement in my skin when I use the TNS Essential serum twice a day.It has a slightly odd smell(which goes away once you apply it) and it dries quickly.I follow it up with a moisturizer. Firmer skin, better skin tone, softens small wrinkles for me! A real plus for mature skin!</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum two times from my dermatologist and liked it.  However, at $250 per ounce it was a little pricey.  I was excited when I found it on Amazon for much less.  Unfortunately, I had a very bad experience with this cream.  I am not sure if this is not an authentic product like I purchased for full price from my dermatologist, or if this lot of cream was bad.  The first time I used it, my skin turned red all over and remained red for 2-3 days.  I looked like I had a bad sunburn or a light chemical peel.  I put the bottle away in my bathroom and decided to purchase another one at full price, which I used with no problems.  I ran out of that bottle last week and remembered I still had this one, so I decided to try it again.  I know that sounds ridiculous, but i thought maybe the redness might have been caused by something else that I didn&#x27;t realize (and because of the cost, I didn&#x27;t want to just throw it away).  Within 24 hours of applying this cream my entire face was red and swollen, enough that I had difficulty opening my eyes.  The swelling remained for almost 4 days (bad enought that I did not want to go out in public).  It has been 8 days now, and my skin is still peeling and red.  I know I am not allergic to the \\&quot;real\\&quot; product since I have successfully used 3 bottles with good results and not so much as a spot of redness or irritation.  I will be trying to contact TNS directly to discuss this issue, but I felt I should post this review to warn people that the \\&quot;bargain price\\&quot; product might not be such a bargain.</li>
            <li> The TNS Essential Serum was recommended to me by my dermatologist. After turning 40 I noticed a big difference in my skin. It was becoming rougher in appearance and I was have periodic episodes of rosacea. After the first use I noticed a difference in my skin. It was smoother and the fine lines were diminished. I have now been using it for about 10 days. I see smaller pore size, a decrease in fine lines, decreased redness, and an overall tighter appearance. I am really happy with this product. The material says it takes 90 days for optimal results. I am really looking forward to seeing if my skins improves more with time. It does have an odd odor but it does not bother me and it dissipates after application. It smells kind of like valerian but I don&#x27;t see that listed in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve be using this product for years, first introduced to it from my dermatologist. It is greatly reduced in price if you buy it on-line, so that&#x27;s the first thing you should know. Of course this is one of those funny things where it&#x27;s hard to measure what the product is really doing, but the best way I can endorse it is to say that it certainly isn&#x27;t hurting and it is probably giving me some subtle but cumulative effect since I use it almost every day. My only gripe about the product is that there are two different serums that come out of neighboring spouts. You push the top of the container and they come out side by side... However, every time I have ever gotten to the end of my bottle, one of the serums has emptied out while the other is still plentiful. Since this stuff is quite pricy, you don&#x27;t exactly want to toss it, so I just use it but without the benefit of the other serum (I hope that makes sense!).</li>
            <li> Great skin product !&lt;br /&gt;This serum is the best for keeping away fine lines and wrinkles.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year.  It&#x27;s pricey $ but what isn&#x27;t these days</li>
            <li> gIVES SKIN A FLAWLESS COMPLEXION. Dr. recommended it to me, is a well-known in the industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this product, for people who do&#x27;t miond spending too much on beauty.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find this cheeper! I&#x27;m getting it for $100 cheeper on Amazon compared to my Dermatologist, but it&#x27;s still a lot, and lasts me about 1 1/2 months.  I think this is the key to the great results I&#x27;ve seen since my derm. put me on to it, but proceedure is a key factor and you need to give it 3 months using 2X/day.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a dermatologist. I have been using it about a month and have received many compliments on my skin. Pores look smaller, skin is smooth and fine lines, as well as deeper lines, have diminshed...a little pricey but worth the money.</li>
            <li> The products works fairly well, I guess - though it is somewhat drying. However, 1. It&#x27;s obscenely overpriced; not a good value for the price or the measly amount in the dispenser. 2. The dispenser is horribly designed. It has two little holes, one dispensing the orange goop, the other dispensing the white stuff. You&#x27;re supposed to blend the two goops in your hand, then apply. About 3/4 into the paltry 1 oz container, only the orange goop comes out, not  the white stuff. 3. Yes, as other reviewers have noted, the dispenser size is indeed deceptive - it contains a mere one ounce. 4. Skinmedica, the manufacturer, has lousy customer service. I sent them a polite e-mail with my concerns re the dispenser about 2 weeks ago and haven&#x27;t heard back yet. What an arrogant attitude. 5. I have received exactly one compliment about my \\&quot;improved\\&quot; skin. Too bad our brilliant FDA doesn&#x27;t provide better regulation of the lofty, unprovable, undocumented claims of skin-care products like this. Baby boomers, don&#x27;t let yourselves get fleeced - we&#x27;re smarter than that, right?</li>
            <li> The packaging of this product is terrible.  It is very expensive.  There is no way to tell how much product is left.  The nozzle is constantly clogged up.  I have switched to another product.</li>
            <li> My plastic surgeon recommended this product. After 3 months using it AM &amp; PM I can tell a huge diff. in my lines and wrinkles around my eye area &amp; forhead. I purchased online and pump did not work. Called company and they said they can&#x27;t guarentee product if it is not purchase through a Dr.office. It could be expired product being sold. I am now getting it through my Dr. and have not had a problem with the product since. I highly recommend TNS ESS. because it helps with what&#x27;s underneath and topically. When I went in for my Dysport injections the nurse said she could tell my skin elasticity and texture was improved. I also didn&#x27;t bruise or turn red after injections. I will live with this product from now on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok cream. Smell is not the same. Results are nothing crazy especially for the price</li>
            <li> I think the place on my hand where you mix the two ingredients that come out of the container is actually smoother. That is why I am on my 3rd bottle. Who knows. It&#x27;s so hard to check out old skin.  I will probably continue using it. It&#x27;s very expensive so I have given it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Need more time to see if I get results from it or not. It has a rather odd odor and I thought maybe it had expired, but I couldn&#x27;t find any date on it. I&#x27;ve gotten used to the smell--just waiting to see results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using PTR for a couple years and thought I would try one of the big boys.  Product - no change there is no improvement  in my skin after a month.  It does completely dry it out, it smells horrible , I&#x27;m not buying it again&lt;br /&gt;Any better ideas out there?</li>
            <li> TNS Essential Serum is an amazing product--the first time I have ever spent such a huge amount on a skin cream (age 51), and I&#x27;m truly happy with the product itself. Hopefully not just drinking the kool-aid, but I feel my skin looks and feels better than it has in years. However, the double barrel pump dispenser totally SUCKS!! I bought first bottle locally from a M.D. and was never able to get the red side of product to pump properly and yes, I tried everything!! (Stored bottle upside down, slammed it into my hand before trying to pump, rinsed tip in hot water, picked out all dried red serum from tip, etc). Finally ended up removing the cap and pumped each side of serum individually. Then, to get every last bit of product out of container, had to use a hammer and extreme force to break shell of bottle open. Hard plastic shards flew everywhere, almost hitting me in the eye! At $260 a pop, this seems absolutely ridiculous!! It shouldn&#x27;t be that difficult to use a product or to open the container!! Plus, once I was finally able to get at the two inner tubes, the red serum side still had quite a bit of product, while the cream side was almost completely empty. One would think it&#x27;d be much easier to dip into the creams with finger or applicator. I have read dozens of reviews for TNS Serum and this seems to be a widespread complaint. Please someone, tell me a redesigned bottle is in the works!!  Only 3 stars because of high cost and crappy dispenser, otherwise I&#x27;m pleased :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  TNS Essential Serum is $100 less on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Skinmedica Tns Essential Serum was in it&#x27;s original packaging, and I received it actually earlier than they had told me.</li>
            <li> I have used SkinMedica Essential Serum for years. I am 65 years old and have almost no wrinkles and my skin glows with a healthy look.  Occasionally I would run out of this product and wasn&#x27;t sure I should spend the money. Within a week my skin started looking less healthy. I quickly went to Amazon to find the best price and ordered TNS.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product quickly and in perfect condition. I shop at Amazon and the SkinMedica Essential Serum is half what I would pay at the beauty spa In my home town. It takes two straight months of faithful use morning and night for the biggest difference to appear!</li>
            <li> I love how the TNS Essential Serum makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I wash my face and leave it damp. Then I apply the serum to the back of my hand and mix it with my finger. I apply it under and around my eyes and on my face and neck. It conceals fine lines and firms the skin. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for skin enhancement.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be getting the same product which I got from my dermatologist.  The packaging was identical but the product is not.  The red gel is much redder.  I should have known Skinmedica would not be offering such a discount.  I called them directly and they do not sell to the vendor, NewSkin who I bought it from on Amazon.  Loved the product I got from my dermatologist but feel like I wasted $150.00 on the serum I got from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product may do all that I have read, but after two weeks, the white side seems empty.  I have tried turning it upside down overnight, slapping the bottom like a Ketchup bottle to no avail. I have tried cleaning out the dispersal hole, taken off the top and now will attempt to see if it is empty on one side using tools. A lot of money for two weeks of fluid on one side. One-half an ounce on each side. Purchase gold, it is a better deal.</li>
            <li> I was not sure about this the first time i purchased but by the end of the bottle.... I was Totally convinced!!! really amazing results</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 3 months &amp; has done nothing,Its a waste of money,they have got this product way over rated.what a waste</li>
            <li> A product that has science behind it. It works. I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and was glad to find it on line at a much cheaper price than the med-spa was charging.</li>
            <li> TNS Essential Serum feels like velvet on your skin.  My skin is very dry and this product works wonders on it.  After using it, your skin feels soft to the touch.  Although the cost of the product is high, I would recommend it, but would advise people to use it sparingly.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is a great anti-aging product.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and a little goes a long way; but it is pricey. Go to skinmedica&#x27;s website and view their video; then make sure you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> What kind of messed up world are we living in where we strap babies down and harvest their penis skin for makeup? No one should be okay with this, at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using skinmedica for a few years and it has really helped my skin.  When I run out I always end up ordering more.</li>
            <li> i use this right after morning shower when face is still damp. put small amount on back of hand, and mix two fluids together (one lotion is white, the other red). it applies smoothly to face and dries quickly. feels very natural on face.  i do think it makes skin on face and neck appear younger.  expensive, but i found a price online that made the cost much less.</li>
            <li> After using this product for several years, I didn&#x27;t reorder and went without it.  And, yes, after beginning its use again recently, there was improvement in the texture  and pores of my 60 year old skin.  Won&#x27;t let this lapse again.</li>
            <li> This is a great serum. I&#x27;m 62, and have always taken care of my skin. When I use this serum my skin coloring is better. I have almost no wrinkles (good genetics) but I can&#x27;t even see any under a magnify mirror. Expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Started using this 3 years ago and the difference is amazing.  This product works. You&#x27;ll see a difference in days. Within a 1-2 weeks, you won&#x27;t believe what this does. A Dr turned me on to this when it was new and unknown. Have never regretted it. If you stop using this for a week, you&#x27;ll notice the difference in your face. I also use it on my hands.  It took the wrinkles away from the sides of my hands. Smoothed the top also.  Give it a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> The product I received was sold by IBI. I called SkinMedica and provided the lot number on the bottom of product to find out the expiration date - 7/31/2012. I would encourage all other buyers to do the same. An expired product is a less effective product. The lot number is printed on both the bottom of the box and the bottom of the actual product. SkinMedica&#x27;s number is 1-866-577-3072 - when I called someone answered immediately; took me less than 1 minute to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have pointed out, the product does have a foul smell. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to testify as to whether it works or not. Will update review later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 3/20/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased this item again recently, and again the seller was IBI. I called SkinMedica today with a product question, and to find out the expiration date. (I wasn&#x27;t asked this time where I purchased, but if you call and are asked say you got it from a doctor. Companies are unlikely to be helpful if you admit you purchased from an unauthorized source. Common sense...) Expiration date is 12/31/14. This time the smell of the product isn&#x27;t as bad, likely due to it not being old product. Hopefully that last purchase was just a fluke, and IBI doesn&#x27;t normally sell expired product. Regardless of seller, I still encourage everyone to call to be certain you weren&#x27;t sold old, expired product.</li>
            <li> What can I say - I was sucked in by the good reviews. This serum is a gimmick, a very expensive one. The texture felt sticky and weird on the skin and I have not observed any changes in my skin&#x27; stone, lines, etc. I will not buy again. Having said though I am a SkinMedica fan and some products are worth to splurge for. This one is not one of them.</li>
            <li> Product works well but, packaging is awful. Can not recycle any part. Not Green. Needs more product and less package.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product many years ago when it was less expensive...it actually does work...worth the $$$$$...but love that this seller offers the product at a price that is affordable.  I&#x27;ll buy from her whenever my TNS SERUM runs low.</li>
            <li> Another great product. A bit too pricey for my wallet. I wish the packing was more practical also. But will purchase agaig.</li>
            <li> rather expensive but occasionly pay the price to get a superior product,  great for keeping skin younger looking; always like a discount</li>
            <li> As I have stated in other reviews this is a great product and I will continue to use it all the time.</li>
            <li> This product changes your skin&#x27;s texture miraculously! This was recommended by my Dermatologist and a plastic surgeon and I haven&#x27;t regretted using this product. I received the serum promptly, in perfect condition and the best price. Amazon rocks!</li>
            <li> Great but way too expensive.  No thanks going forward.</li>
            <li> Once you use this you can never use anything else.  Nothing compares to this!  Its the best product out there.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Skinmedica TNS Serum through IBI because of the savings.  I had previously been ordering directly from Skinmedica and thought I would give amazon a chance.  The product arrived quickly and I had a little bit of an issue with the pump, and wrote about it, questioning its authenticity.  I immediately received a phone call from IBI&#x27;s representative and was assured of the product&#x27;s quality and even suggested that I call Skinmedica to verify.  I was very impressed and surprised by the call.  I hope to be a long time customer of this company.</li>
            <li> We can only give this item One Star&lt;br /&gt;We have purchased this item many times. Every order has the same problem. One side of the pump clogs up.even after a few days between use. I am sure iam not the only person having this problem.  as I can only use one side of the TNS .even after I clean the clogged side it still clogs. wasting almost all the serum on the one side.  Poor Poor Packaging design by Skin Medica.</li>
            <li> This product would get 5 stars from me if the amount inside the giant bottle actually matched the size of the bottle.  For $270 (at derm&#x27;s ofc) or even $150 on Amazon, it&#x27;s a ridiculously small amount of product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it works well.  But like most companies, they mark this up to an obscene amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think your money would be better spent using proven Retinol based products and various peels/facials/fillers at the dermatologists office.  I won&#x27;t purchase this again until either the amount of product fills the stupidly oversized container, or the price comes down to a reasonable amount for ONE OUNCE of this stuff.</li>
            <li> If you can afford it this stuff with change your skin forever!&lt;br /&gt;Its truly regenerative!I adore it!</li>
            <li> This is an &amp;#34;Upgrade&amp;#34; from the Skinmedica Recovery Complex because it combines the same great serum with moisturizer and the results are wonderful!  This product eliminates a step (applying separate moisturizer) and I love it!  I will continue to purchase this serum from Amazon.com because it costs less than at my local Spa or Dermatologist office. BLS in Maumee, Ohio</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have used so far to remove fine lines. It also  made my skin more supple.  Use it for 3 weeks on the wrinkles around one eye or one side of the face to see the difference.  Best results seen after 3 months.  I am on my second bottle and my skin looks 10 years younger!</li>
            <li> This product agrees with me.  It makes my skin healthier and smoother looking. I do think it is an outstanding product with regard to its ease in usage.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but sometimes it is hard to get the cream out of the container. It gets clogged easily.  Always shake well before using.  Sometimes the first time you use it to kind of have to bang the container on the wall to get the product moving.  I would buy again.  It was well packaged and arrived on time.</li>
