            <li>I Wish they would put it back in the stores for easy access.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for still carrying this product.  </li>
            <li>It rolls on cool the very first time and dried immediately!</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite and what I use everyday!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightly fragrant, long lasting, non-irritating and it has never stained my clothes.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my 8 year old to use since she barely needs any.</li>
            <li>I have never used a liquid roll on before, it dries fast, last long</li>

            <li> NEVER any staining on your clothes...smells great...and definitely keeps you dry!</li>
            <li> For some crazy reason, it can&#x27;t be found in most stores anymore....</li>
            <li> It works all day long</li>
            <li> This deodorant keeps me dry</li>
            <li> As far as it working, I&#x27;ve never felt stinky or gotten sweat on my clothes, but I&#x27;m really not a particularly stinky or sweaty person, I usually don&#x27;t even bother with deodorant/antiperspirant on the weekends.  </li>
            <li> Helps prevent body odor for 12 hours, sometimes longer if you are not doing any heavy physical work out so long!</li>
            <li> Do not really know what the liquid inside of the container was.</li>
            <li> Wetter than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really tried roll ons before, but I like them now.</li>
            <li> I am an active guy and it has never let me down in any way.</li>
            <li> and i use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Ban satin breeze is hard to find so this worked out</li>
            <li> I have been using the Ban roll-ons exclusively for years, at least since college which would be about 15+ years.  </li>
            <li> The Satin Breeze is the nicest scent, but it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in stores--no doubt due to the brand having changed ownership.</li>
            <li> Sad that I can&#x27;t find this in stores anywhere in MN!</li>

            <li> Ban Satin Breeze is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, so I went to great lengths to finally find it on Amazon. For some crazy reason, it can&#x27;t be found in most stores anymore....go figure.I am an active guy and it has never let me down in any way. It&#x27;s lightly fragrant, long lasting, non-irritating and it has never stained my clothes.</li>
            <li> Ordered product as it was a great value...but discovered it was a great product as well! :) It rolls on cool the very first time and dried immediately! NEVER any staining on your clothes...smells great...and definitely keeps you dry!</li>
            <li> I was super hesitant about this but it might actually be my favorite antiperspirant ever.</li>
            <li> Ban is effective and gentle.  You can find the best deals for multipacks on Amazon.  My family only uses Ban because we have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> Does work as well as I wished</li>
            <li> I bought this ban roll on deodorant on Amazon on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell to it and works very well at  keeping the sweat down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a roll on , so easy to use..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plastic bottle well made.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Ban roll-ons exclusively for years, at least since college which would be about 15+ years.  The product glides on easily, and I have never had an issue with staining on my clothes, which are probably the most important factors for me.  This is the scent I tend to get, although I also like the cotton scent.  It smells clean, but not over-powering.  As far as it working, I&#x27;ve never felt stinky or gotten sweat on my clothes, but I&#x27;m really not a particularly stinky or sweaty person, I usually don&#x27;t even bother with deodorant/antiperspirant on the weekends.  I will search for this, for example if the store is out, I will buy it online, rather then dealing with another brand I probably won&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Repackaged item. Sold as Satin Breeze fragrance. Liquid inside smelled like regular ban product with no fragrance. Returned for a refund. Do not really know what the liquid inside of the container was. But I do know that it was not Satin Breeze. Did not want to take a chance on repackaged product.</li>
            <li> Love the scent!  Has great staying power.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of Satin Breeze Ban Roll-On Satin!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the discounted price for a wonderful product!  I just ran out of deoderant when this came - great timing.  It keeps me dry and odor free!</li>
            <li> Feels comfortable and works good.</li>
            <li> Love!! Great scent,great protection.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell and it did not work well at all on me. I gave it to my 8 year old to use since she barely needs any.</li>
            <li> As it says so it does. Helps prevent body odor for 12 hours, sometimes longer if you are not doing any heavy physical work out so long! Full value for the price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, just as describbed. One more happy customer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant.  Can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Right on time</li>
            <li> This is the deodorant I will use for the rest of my life! I love this brand of liquid roll-on but even more it has a beautiful scent, which is next to impossible to find for roll-ons. It works all day long and I feel confident wearing it. 1 bottle lasts months and i use it everyday. I hope they never discontinue this.  This is one product I will swear by. I just love love BAN satin breeze</li>
            <li> I Wish they would put it back in the stores for easy access.  Thanks for still carrying this product.  I appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Sad that I can&#x27;t find this in stores anywhere in MN! I thought they quit making the scent til I looked online. It&#x27;s the only thing that works for me! Bring it back!</li>
            <li> Just the right fragrance.  Does the job.</li>
            <li> Wetter than expected. Will save for winter time use under thicker shirts.</li>
            <li> Not going to lie, I got this because it was posted on a deal site and figured why not. So glad I did! I have never used a liquid roll on before, it dries fast, last long and I love the scent. This is now my favorite and what I use everyday!</li>
            <li> The deodorant works very well, and I&#x27;m planning to purchase this brand again, but the fragrance is so strong that I hold my breath when I apply it.  I won&#x27;t buy this fragrance again.</li>
            <li> Ban Roll-on which my family used has all but disappeared from shelves locally - a great product at a good price. Thank you all!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and this brand and scent cannot be found in stores anymore. Yes I would recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Ban Roll-On is my favourite deodorant. It is easy to apply, it goes farther than sticks and sprays, and it&#x27;s easy to tell when the bottle is low. The Satin Breeze is the nicest scent, but it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find in stores--no doubt due to the brand having changed ownership. Stock up on it... while you may.</li>
            <li> For years I used Ban Satin Breeze but then I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. I was delighted to find it again because I think of this scent as &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; scent. This deodorant keeps me dry and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant!  Smells great and works better than Secret or as well as those &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; deodorants!</li>
            <li> This keeps me nice and dry, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, doesn&#x27;t stain my cloths or leave residue and smells really nice to boot. I also like that it&#x27;s a roll on. I&#x27;ve never really tried roll ons before, but I like them now. Easier too apply and no gross goo all over the sides of the container like the gel variety sometimes gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my regular brand of deodorant now.</li>
            <li> I DID NOT NOTICE ANYTHING ESPECIAL.</li>
            <li> I really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really liked your awesome product!</li>
            <li> Ban satin breeze is hard to find so this worked out great ordering was easy got here on time would recommend to everybody</li>
            <li> I get this for my husband since he only likes Ban deodorant.  It works best for him and he has tried many different kinds but this is the one he prefers.</li>
            <li> This scent is not easy to find in my area, so I was happy to have found that it is still produced</li>
