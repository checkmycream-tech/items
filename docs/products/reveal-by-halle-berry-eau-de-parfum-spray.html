            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I feel like it is a good fit for me as I like light perfumes that aren&#x27;t too fruity or flowery.</li>
            <li>This perfume is nice and light, a flowery smell that makes you smile.</li>
            <li>Too strong and triggers my allergies.</li>
            <li>Was a gift and the recipient liked it very much.</li>
            <li>I picked this one because not only does it smell great, it does not bother my senses.</li>
            <li>I love this one very much.  </li>

            <li>The price is too high for a small bottle that you spray on and a hour later you have to spray more.</li>

            <li> Got a gift set instead of just perfume came with body wash and potion along with a free gift a compact mirror!</li>
            <li> I normally do not purchase perfumes made by entertainers; so I tired it. It has a strong scent and not necessarily my cup of tea, but I gifted it to a friend and she loves the smell. Her words not mine, she graduated from college and she feels intelligent, important to be admired. My Friend loves this perfume, and stated that she was going to try Halle other perfumes...</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, the scent of this seems substantially stronger than when it arrived.

            <li> Smells great! Great price!</li>
            <li> I cant say enough how much I love her perfumes, I came across by accident in store and loved!!! I now have all three of her perfumes. And The Price is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> what can i say, this is a product with the face of the number star how could i pass this up?</li>
            <li> Does not smell the same</li>
            <li> Great size, perfume and perfect for our purse! Great product, inexpensive for my mom too for mothers day! Good product</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Halle hit a homerun with this fragrance! It smells wonderful, not too heavy and lasts for my entire shift at work! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> This perfume is nice and light, a flowery smell that makes you smile. I really like it as I do all her perfumes.</li>
            <li> I thought this order was late; but my fault ! It had been sitting on a horse saddle on my porch ! My wife loves it !!! She&#x27;s happy ---- I&#x27;m happy !</li>
            <li> the fragancy is nice. but for me is too much little. the next time i don&#x27;t buyed</li>
            <li> I have tried many of her fragrances and this one it okay. It don&#x27;t last. I wish they would make it so they last more than a couple of hours. The price is too high for a small bottle that you spray on and a hour later you have to spray more. The bottle are pretty maybe that&#x27;s what we are paying for.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like the original. Think it was fake.</li>
            <li> I love this one very much.  Both are pleasing and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I feel like it is a good fit for me as I like light perfumes that aren&#x27;t too fruity or flowery. I get compliments on it often and only put it on in the morning with three spritzes. I do notice that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day and if I&#x27;m going out after work, I will put it on again. So that would be my one complaint.</li>
