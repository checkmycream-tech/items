            <li>The Good</li>
            <li>I had acrylic nails for over two months, and tonight I decided to remove them because they just didn&#x27;t look good anymore.</li>
            <li>and I am good to go.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good product time will tell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this polish for many years, and have beautiful nails.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job of protecting them and keeping them strong and letting them grow!</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff my nails are stronger and look so much healthier#!!</li>
            <li>Very pleased, Sally Hansen makes some great products :)</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I want 10 more bottles!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any of the Sally Hansen products really effective.</li>
            <li>But truly and honestly my nails are longer than ever before.</li>
            <li>Use this in the beginning to gain strength then switch to a nice strengthener to maintain the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They split and break very easily.</li>
            <li>Leaves nail very strong.</li>
            <li>And so I find just slapping on clear nail polish willy nilly basically works the best for me and helps with this condition.</li>
            <li>I have to say that my nail did better on its own that with this polish.</li>
            <li>but I love, love, love this one!</li>
            <li>You must reapply polish more than every three days if your hands are in water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nail polish or decals will not chip if two or more coats are used.</li>
            <li>I used this product, and not only did my nails look better (beautiful shine!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to many adhesives including a non latex acrylic adhesive by Nexus (3M) product</li>
            <li>there is a hint here :)</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>works better for me than the $10+ boutique nail coatings.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m constantly searching for the perfect top coat</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I love this nail hardener.</li>
            <li>I never use it as a top coat</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it, Love it, Love it.  </li>
            <li>the more you want to have nails</li>
            <li>I work at Costco and if it can hold up there it can hold up anywhere :)  </li>
            <li>and I still love them, I purchased this polish while searching for a gel nail kit for my sister for Christmas, it arrived on time and packaged well</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you follow the directions on the bottle</li>
            <li>More efficient under a color.</li>
            <li>My nails are strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>, I love this stuff, my nails are strong, with no cracking or breaking.</li>
            <li>so make sure you check out this company they are good with reasonable prices also.</li>
            <li>My nail polish didn&#x27;t chip for seven days, which is incredible, considering I could only go two days without it chipping.</li>
            <li>It makes a great top coat for a french manicure.</li>
            <li>and they break easily.  </li>
            <li>Makes your nails strong just like it says it does.</li>
            <li>triple strong)</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Triple Strong Nail has protected my nails from breaking</li>
            <li>I used to have really strong nails.  </li>
            <li>At first I was loving this.</li>
            <li>But, when I&#x27;d check my nails, they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>purchased the Sally Hansen Triple Strong Advanced Gel hardener about three weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if Triple Strong will be as effective as a top coat as opposed to being applied directly to the nail, but I&#x27;ll give it a shot and monitor the results.</li>
            <li>Thank you amazon for making this product available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this nail hardener a few times now and I am impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bench jeweler by day and spend my free time doing yard work and gardening...</li>
            <li>Super Strong.</li>
            <li>and all my nails never have been good enough for that.</li>
            <li>Loved how shinny it left my nails.</li>
            <li>I now have strong, long nails and love it!</li>
            <li>SH Triple Strong has made my nails that much stronger and has reduced breakage and splitting, hence my having longer nails.     </li>
            <li>Great for natural nails, bu not so hot if  you are transitioning from acrylic to natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  never found a nail hardener or top coat that really made much of a difference until I tried this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;and said that her old nail polish was sooooo much better (</li>
            <li>, It was WELL worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t really do much more than provide a clear coat which peels and chips pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I have to say, when I ordered this product I was really excited to try it out because my nails are so very prone to chipping and peeling</li>
            <li>I could never imagine growing out my nails because they would always tear right away.</li>
            <li>and I deliver packages for a living right on</li>
            <li>Small smell for a great product.  </li>
            <li>Time will tell how effective this product is long term.</li>
            <li>When I used my old strengthener, my nails would chip easily.  </li>
            <li>Much to my surprise it worked and I was able to protect my fingernail until I could finally completely cut off the damaged section.</li>
            <li>super shiny, holds up really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now and my nails are now long and very, very strong</li>
            <li>I let the nail polish dry for a day, and then I applied Sally Hansen Super Shine Top Coat.</li>
            <li>It was better, but still too thick and therefore chipped very easily.</li>
            <li>I TRIED SO MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Im now using the nail polish strips with the polish and the designs last for three weeks or more.</li>
            <li>It does give a lot of shine at first</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working</li>
            <li>The only thing that&#x27;s working for me is &amp;#34;No More Wraps&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>First purchased from Amazon and the bottle appeared to have been sitting around a while.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m a guy.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to actually bend my nails over my finger because they were so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>polish doesn&#x27;t help with the life of any polish, but since you are suppose to use it every three days with a fresh application, I guess that doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>Even though the directions say to reapply the gel every three-four days, by the third time I had used it, the gel still worked it&#x27;s magic on the seventh day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rarely did I need to use nail polish remover that can dry out your nails more.</li>
            <li>I NEVER thought I could actually have nice natural nails.</li>
            <li>I have made several other purchases from that company with great results</li>
            <li>After drying a full day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it still was soft and thats with a lite to med coat.</li>
            <li>I apply 2-3 coats, allowing it to dry in between and redo it about 2-3 times a week (I want to make sure it stays well on the tips of my nails, where I&#x27;m prone to breaking them.)</li>
            <li>: This product actually makes my nails strong.</li>
            <li>It is certainly overrated.</li>
            <li>I had nothing on them they would certainly rip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very hard on nails works great.</li>
            <li>I now use it once a week, only one coat and its just fine.  </li>
            <li>AND THIS WORK REALLY WELL,</li>
            <li>and she absolutely LOVES this stuff for her nails.....</li>
            <li>and it is very strong!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been having trouble finding Triple Strength in the stores, so was glad to purchase this online, best product for me for base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li>Really keeps manicure longer.</li>
            <li>and it does strengthen my nails really well.</li>
            <li>and it really ruined my nails.</li>
            <li>1000% recommend this product if you really want to stop biting ur nails.....</li>
            <li>I have not broken a nail  </li>
            <li>since then, my nails feel stronger, and they don&#x27;t split and peel nearly as much as they used to (one or two fingers might peel every couple of weeks.)</li>
            <li>Must use two coats &amp; really prevents chipping.</li>
            <li>Works far better for me than the gel polish which I can&#x27;t make last a week.  </li>
            <li>They are strong and smooth again and growing out past my nail beds without all the splitting.</li>
            <li>I ever find myself in similar circumstances, or if I want to dress in drag, I will certainly reach for the Sally Hansen Triple Strong Advanced Gel Nail Hardener once again.</li>
            <li>My nails have never grown so long so quickly!</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need to have a light to dry it under.</li>
            <li>Not only did my nails feels stronger almost instantly, but it has a lovely high shine to it.</li>
            <li>I started getting gel manicures every two weeks, and I loved how the color stayed on my weak nails.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a product to protect your nails by itself I would highly recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products as I try to grow my own nails out after wearing fake nails for about 20 years.</li>
            <li>It worked better for my needs than the extreme shine variety by same manufacturer.</li>
            <li>but it looked like you had clear nail polish on.</li>
            <li>far I have used it as directed</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s far cheaper than the gel polishes and goes on easier.</li>
            <li>I have natural nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had soft nails that would peel as soon as they got any length to them.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 20s, and I go to school and work.</li>
            <li>I tried several different brands of nail polish/hardener lent to me by women I know; but none of them was worth a sheat.</li>
            <li>My nails haven&#x27;t chipped in a long time, and they seem to be getting back to my normal strong, long nails.  </li>
            <li>This time, however, I waited one full day for the gel to dry, then applied regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used this for 2 weeks on my nails and barely see a difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It removes really well - just like a regular topcoat, so there&#x27;s no extra work to get it off your nails.</li>
            <li>it worked well on my nails made them grow quick with in a few days</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey but worth the the money.</li>
            <li>I told the company and they handled my problem in such a professional  way that they deserve the five stars I gave them.</li>
            <li>I switched back to this and 2 weeks later my nails were back to normal, stronger and no longer peeling off in layers.</li>
            <li>It last much longer than any other polish</li>
            <li>out 4 coats on a long natural nail</li>
            <li>At first I followed the directions on the bottle, put one coat everyday, but as soon as the Polish starts to peel it peels of my nail with it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this nail hardener a few times now and I am impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bench jeweler by day and spend my free time doing yard work and gardening...</li>
            <li> Super Strong.</li>
            <li> and all my nails never have been good enough for that.</li>
            <li> Loved how shinny it left my nails.</li>
            <li> I now have strong, long nails and love it!</li>
            <li> SH Triple Strong has made my nails that much stronger and has reduced breakage and splitting, hence my having longer nails.     </li>
            <li> Great for natural nails, bu not so hot if  you are transitioning from acrylic to natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  never found a nail hardener or top coat that really made much of a difference until I tried this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;and said that her old nail polish was sooooo much better (</li>
            <li> , It was WELL worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t really do much more than provide a clear coat which peels and chips pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I have to say, when I ordered this product I was really excited to try it out because my nails are so very prone to chipping and peeling</li>
            <li> I could never imagine growing out my nails because they would always tear right away.</li>
            <li> and I deliver packages for a living right on</li>
            <li> Small smell for a great product.  </li>
            <li> Time will tell how effective this product is long term.</li>
            <li> When I used my old strengthener, my nails would chip easily.  </li>
            <li> Much to my surprise it worked and I was able to protect my fingernail until I could finally completely cut off the damaged section.</li>
            <li> super shiny, holds up really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now and my nails are now long and very, very strong</li>
            <li> I let the nail polish dry for a day, and then I applied Sally Hansen Super Shine Top Coat.</li>
            <li> It was better, but still too thick and therefore chipped very easily.</li>
            <li> I TRIED SO MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Im now using the nail polish strips with the polish and the designs last for three weeks or more.</li>
            <li> It does give a lot of shine at first</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working</li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s working for me is &amp;#34;No More Wraps&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> First purchased from Amazon and the bottle appeared to have been sitting around a while.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a guy.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to actually bend my nails over my finger because they were so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> polish doesn&#x27;t help with the life of any polish, but since you are suppose to use it every three days with a fresh application, I guess that doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> Even though the directions say to reapply the gel every three-four days, by the third time I had used it, the gel still worked it&#x27;s magic on the seventh day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rarely did I need to use nail polish remover that can dry out your nails more.</li>
            <li> I NEVER thought I could actually have nice natural nails.</li>
            <li> I have made several other purchases from that company with great results</li>
            <li> After drying a full day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it still was soft and thats with a lite to med coat.</li>
            <li> I apply 2-3 coats, allowing it to dry in between and redo it about 2-3 times a week (I want to make sure it stays well on the tips of my nails, where I&#x27;m prone to breaking them.)</li>
            <li> : This product actually makes my nails strong.</li>
            <li> It is certainly overrated.</li>
            <li> I had nothing on them they would certainly rip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very hard on nails works great.</li>
            <li> I now use it once a week, only one coat and its just fine.  </li>
            <li> AND THIS WORK REALLY WELL,</li>
            <li> and she absolutely LOVES this stuff for her nails.....</li>
            <li> and it is very strong!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble finding Triple Strength in the stores, so was glad to purchase this online, best product for me for base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li> Really keeps manicure longer.</li>
            <li> and it does strengthen my nails really well.</li>
            <li> and it really ruined my nails.</li>
            <li> 1000% recommend this product if you really want to stop biting ur nails.....</li>
            <li> I have not broken a nail  </li>
            <li> since then, my nails feel stronger, and they don&#x27;t split and peel nearly as much as they used to (one or two fingers might peel every couple of weeks.)</li>
            <li> Must use two coats &amp; really prevents chipping.</li>
            <li> Works far better for me than the gel polish which I can&#x27;t make last a week.  </li>
            <li> They are strong and smooth again and growing out past my nail beds without all the splitting.</li>
            <li> I ever find myself in similar circumstances, or if I want to dress in drag, I will certainly reach for the Sally Hansen Triple Strong Advanced Gel Nail Hardener once again.</li>
            <li> My nails have never grown so long so quickly!</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need to have a light to dry it under.</li>
            <li> Not only did my nails feels stronger almost instantly, but it has a lovely high shine to it.</li>
            <li> I started getting gel manicures every two weeks, and I loved how the color stayed on my weak nails.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product to protect your nails by itself I would highly recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products as I try to grow my own nails out after wearing fake nails for about 20 years.</li>
            <li> It worked better for my needs than the extreme shine variety by same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> but it looked like you had clear nail polish on.</li>
            <li> far I have used it as directed</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s far cheaper than the gel polishes and goes on easier.</li>
            <li> I have natural nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had soft nails that would peel as soon as they got any length to them.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 20s, and I go to school and work.</li>
            <li> I tried several different brands of nail polish/hardener lent to me by women I know; but none of them was worth a sheat.</li>
            <li> My nails haven&#x27;t chipped in a long time, and they seem to be getting back to my normal strong, long nails.  </li>
            <li> This time, however, I waited one full day for the gel to dry, then applied regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used this for 2 weeks on my nails and barely see a difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It removes really well - just like a regular topcoat, so there&#x27;s no extra work to get it off your nails.</li>
            <li> it worked well on my nails made them grow quick with in a few days</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey but worth the the money.</li>
            <li> I told the company and they handled my problem in such a professional  way that they deserve the five stars I gave them.</li>
            <li> I switched back to this and 2 weeks later my nails were back to normal, stronger and no longer peeling off in layers.</li>
            <li> It last much longer than any other polish</li>
            <li> out 4 coats on a long natural nail</li>
            <li> At first I followed the directions on the bottle, put one coat everyday, but as soon as the Polish starts to peel it peels of my nail with it.</li>
            <li> diamond hard stuff was not working right etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they began to grown back but would never grow past a certain length.</li>
            <li> And about every three days to every other day the piled on clear acrylic would fall off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard like a regular topcoat, so it allows your nails to bend a little bit without cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to coat the nail and protect it until it grew long enough for me to trim off the damage.</li>
            <li> It reccomends 2 coats of polish right off the bat, but if your nails are really weak, I would put another 3rd coat on.</li>
            <li> By the late third week I could really appreciate the difference.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base coat and it goes on very smoothly and it dries in a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Item doesn&#x27;t dry at all.. left to dry for a long time and still smudged my nail polish</li>
            <li> Nails change so much through the seasons and activities you partake in that its hard to say.</li>
            <li> - I can play my guitar again with my long nails as picks.</li>
            <li> I have to cut them periodically because they grow so long.</li>
            <li> nails are getting long and have been asked who does them...  </li>
            <li> But the splitting and cracking is new over the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> I have extremely weak nails, which have constantly peeled my whole life.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had long nails in my life until this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to sound so mean and negative</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds of hardeners over the years with little to no success.</li>
            <li> (I do take biotin at 10,000 units a day which may or may not really help this issue.</li>
            <li> My nails have gone from fragile (from all the fake acrylic nails) to hard and super long.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who has weak, flaky, and peeling nails like I had.</li>
            <li> Though not pretty as a manicured nail with polish</li>
            <li> /&gt;This usually allows a manicure to last 4-5 days without chipping.  </li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME OR EFFORT ORERING, IT TAKES FOREVER TO DRY.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because of the positive reviews I read about it, but I was still skeptical that it could work for MY flaky nails.</li>
            <li> prefer the regular, no addition, Sally Hansen Hard As Nails.</li>
            <li> Your nails will be rock solid and really hard to break</li>
            <li> Not worth the time or the money.</li>
            <li> I do this at least twice a week if possible.</li>
            <li> Meantime it doesn&#x27;t fix what of course is a metabolic problem with my nails which were soft and thin as I was born with them that way.</li>
            <li> When I do not have time to put a color and a top coat I just put this base coat</li>
            <li> I hate this product I never liked Sally Hansen regular nail polish line but for some reason I thought her gel nail polish would be a lot better</li>
            <li> the less</li>
            <li> Every five days I remove the previous coat and apply two coats to my nails.</li>
            <li> On a whim a few weeks back I bought this, and figured I&#x27;d at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying it but remember that with all hardeners you can&#x27;t use it all the time because while it may harden in the beginning but over time it will break down the chemical composition of the nail and possibly make them worse than when you started.</li>
            <li> getting little ridges.  </li>
            <li> have been using this for a little while now</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time growing my nails- especially in winter when the weather gets colder.</li>
            <li> My nails are very hard now and can actually withstand some abuse with out breaking off.</li>
            <li> I use this as my base coat, apply a color, and then a top coat I use Sally Hansen Hard as Nails.</li>
            <li> They were soft, peeling in layers, chipping and overall bad shape.</li>
            <li> My nails always crack at work, this helped my nails hold up picking up lots of heavy plane engine parts without ever cracking them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Mega Shine as a nail hardener to apply daily and as needed to broken and split nails.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few others</li>
            <li> I just put a few coats on a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> That just left me with worse nails than I began with.</li>
            <li> this product was a waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> This as a base coat on clean nails and then follow up use with the Mega shine.</li>
            <li> So not sure if this works</li>
            <li> The Bad: When I use it as a base coat, my manicures do not last more than a couple of days before the polish begins to chip off.</li>
            <li> But this I do need the nail remover because it builds up but doesn&#x27;t usually drop off.</li>
            <li> probably no magic pill is going to fix it.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2-3 of these over the past year.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; formula made a really thick coat and trying to apply polish over that was just really messy and it took forever to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work miracles for my soft nails that peel like crazy at the ends.</li>
            <li> Having tried Sally Hansen products in the past I wasn&#x27;t too hopeful of this working all that well..</li>
            <li> They are hard and do not easily chip or break.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stronger than your average base coat , but it didn&#x27;t improve nail strength with continued use and it took off some of my natural nail when it would chip.</li>
            <li> BUT WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT ON MY NAIL NOT AS HARD.</li>
            <li> Keeps nails hard.</li>
            <li> but it goes a bit dull over 3 layers time.</li>
            <li> This polish is now hard to find in the city.</li>
            <li> It was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot taking care of a disabled bunny, which makes it worse.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and leaves an almost plastic-like coating.  </li>
            <li> Too thick.</li>
            <li> Its a slow process, but considering what they were before</li>
            <li> I have trouble growing my nails, they are thin and weak and break a lot.</li>
            <li> its now been 4 months and my are so long i have to keep cutting them.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Teflon  is very slick</li>
            <li> Its not as hard or slick as advertised !!</li>
            <li> There have been times where I&#x27;ve banged my fingers into something hard that I knew would result in a broken nail.</li>
            <li> My nails were always splitting, cracking, bending, just weak in every way.</li>
            <li> I was born with weak nails.</li>
            <li> My nails were weak, thin, and pathetic-looking, as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> and still I have had three broken nails.  </li>
            <li> My nails were as thin as paper and bent like paper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Sally Hansen nail hardeners as a base coat (which is listed as one of the uses on the back of all of them.)</li>
            <li> My nails tend to be extremely thin as it is, so even when I&#x27;m not working I&#x27;m prone to breaking or splitting my nails.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t broken or chipped a nail since using it.</li>
            <li> so I stay away from false nails too and wraps.</li>
            <li> Also, I sealed the bottle well after each use and it still turned very thick and difficult to apply before the bottle even ran out.</li>
            <li> They were weak and very thin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my sad nails.</li>
            <li> I was born with sad nails and thus it is what it is and</li>
            <li> After a series of moving and helping friends move...it was terrible.. and left my nails chipping all the time.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product since I have weak nails that are very difficult to grow out.</li>
            <li> I have very thin nails</li>
            <li> I have very thin nails</li>
            <li> Helped me get my nails recovered from artificial nails.</li>
            <li> They were eating my nails so bad that they would break below my fingers.</li>
            <li> Rather than run the risk of having the nail get hooked on something and tearing off completely -- a painful proposition --</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I had a horrible experience with this Sally Hansen gel nail hardener</li>
            <li> I use this regularly, as a base coat for my nail polish which I change 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> It works as a base coat, a topcoat, or 2 coats by itself.</li>
            <li> I hate it</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail growth/strengthener line is somewhat pathetic.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> well the bottle says it will strengthen your nails  when you follow directions.&lt;br /&gt;It does put a coating on your nails, but it will not keep them from breaking on the sides nor will it stop the nail&lt;br /&gt;from getting little ridges.  You must reapply polish more than every three days if your hands are in water.&lt;br /&gt;So far I have used it as directed and still I have had three broken nails.  So not sure if this works</li>
            <li> Makes your nails strong just like it says it does.</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time growing my nails- especially in winter when the weather gets colder. They split and break very easily. I wash my hands a lot taking care of a disabled bunny, which makes it worse. I&#x27;ve  never found a nail hardener or top coat that really made much of a difference until I tried this product. I now have strong, long nails and love it!</li>
            <li> Great for natural nails, bu not so hot if  you are transitioning from acrylic to natural.</li>
            <li> I TRIED SO MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCT AND THIS WORK REALLY WELL, BUT WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT ON MY NAIL NOT AS HARD.</li>
            <li> My nails always crack at work, this helped my nails hold up picking up lots of heavy plane engine parts without ever cracking them.  So it worked for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 10+ years. My nails are strong and healthy. Nail polish or decals will not chip if two or more coats are used. Im now using the nail polish strips with the polish and the designs last for three weeks or more.</li>
            <li> The Good: This product actually makes my nails strong. There have been times where I&#x27;ve banged my fingers into something hard that I knew would result in a broken nail. But, when I&#x27;d check my nails, they&#x27;re fine. SH Triple Strong has made my nails that much stronger and has reduced breakage and splitting, hence my having longer nails.     The Bad: When I use it as a base coat, my manicures do not last more than a couple of days before the polish begins to chip off. Constant touch-ups are necessary. I don&#x27;t know if Triple Strong will be as effective as a top coat as opposed to being applied directly to the nail, but I&#x27;ll give it a shot and monitor the results.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product after removing the acrylics I&#x27;d been wearing for over a year. My nails were weak, thin, and pathetic-looking, as you&#x27;d expect. I used this product, and not only did my nails look better (beautiful shine!), they are noticeably stronger and are growing out!</li>
            <li> For once I found a polish that does not chip or peel for an entire week and my nails started to grwo at last.  Works far better for me than the gel polish which I can&#x27;t make last a week.  And it&#x27;s far cheaper than the gel polishes and goes on easier.</li>
            <li> Small smell for a great product.  Worked in one week!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my sad nails. It is certainly overrated. Not worth the time or the money. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> This is  awesome . Keeps nails hard. No breakages</li>
            <li> Great product. Have used for years.</li>
            <li> Not only did my nails feels stronger almost instantly, but it has a lovely high shine to it. My nails look great even with out any polish on them. It reccomends 2 coats of polish right off the bat, but if your nails are really weak, I would put another 3rd coat on. I love this product! I want 10 more bottles!</li>
            <li> No clue if this made a difference. Nails change so much through the seasons and activities you partake in that its hard to say. But didnt not work either.</li>
            <li> It worked better for my needs than the extreme shine variety by same manufacturer. I&#x27;d been using Mega Shine as a nail hardener to apply daily and as needed to broken and split nails. And about every three days to every other day the piled on clear acrylic would fall off and I&#x27;d start all over. Rarely did I need to use nail polish remover that can dry out your nails more. But this I do need the nail remover because it builds up but doesn&#x27;t usually drop off. I find it tends to gray or yellow a bit and not quite as shiny as the Mega product but I like the way it clings to the nail itself. Maybe I&#x27;ll try a combination of the two. This as a base coat on clean nails and then follow up use with the Mega shine. Meantime it doesn&#x27;t fix what of course is a metabolic problem with my nails which were soft and thin as I was born with them that way. But the splitting and cracking is new over the past 5 years. And so I find just slapping on clear nail polish willy nilly basically works the best for me and helps with this condition. Though not pretty as a manicured nail with polish and all my nails never have been good enough for that. I&#x27;m allergic to many adhesives including a non latex acrylic adhesive by Nexus (3M) product so I stay away from false nails too and wraps. I do a lot of dishes by hand too and in and out of water daily so this is works well with that too. It does give a lot of shine at first but it goes a bit dull over 3 layers time. Try it it might work for you...it might not! (I do take biotin at 10,000 units a day which may or may not really help this issue. I was born with sad nails and thus it is what it is and probably no magic pill is going to fix it.)</li>
            <li> what can i say she kept talking about how this nail polish etc. diamond hard stuff was not working right etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and said that her old nail polish was sooooo much better (triple strong) so i went online to amazon and found it and she absolutely LOVES this stuff for her nails.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and if she is happy well then so am i lol.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;guys  there is a hint here :)</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails for over two months, and tonight I decided to remove them because they just didn&#x27;t look good anymore. My nails were as thin as paper and bent like paper.&lt;br /&gt;If I had nothing on them they would certainly rip.&lt;br /&gt;I out 4 coats on a long natural nail and it is very strong!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend for brittle and acrylic damaged nails</li>
            <li> My nails were always splitting, cracking, bending, just weak in every way. I could never imagine growing out my nails because they would always tear right away. At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working but I followed the instructions with two applications a week. By the late third week I could really appreciate the difference. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now and my nails are now long and very, very strong - I can play my guitar again with my long nails as picks. I use this regularly, as a base coat for my nail polish which I change 1-2 times a week. I don&#x27;t think I can do my manicures without it anymore. Very pleased, Sally Hansen makes some great products :)</li>
            <li> When I used my old strengthener, my nails would chip easily.  With this, i haven&#x27;t had a chip incident yet.  Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. works better for me than the $10+ boutique nail coatings.</li>
            <li> This product does just what it promises, I would not use anything else ever on my nail&#x27;s. Try it and you will be hooked on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2-3 of these over the past year. I feel like I&#x27;m constantly searching for the perfect top coat and I think I&#x27;ve found it.  It goes on thick and leaves an almost plastic-like coating.  It&#x27;s not hard like a regular topcoat, so it allows your nails to bend a little bit without cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This usually allows a manicure to last 4-5 days without chipping.  It&#x27;s glossy and evens out your nail color so that it looks like a salon manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It removes really well - just like a regular topcoat, so there&#x27;s no extra work to get it off your nails.</li>
            <li> I told the company and they handled my problem in such a professional  way that they deserve the five stars I gave them. I have made several other purchases from that company with great results so make sure you check out this company they are good with reasonable prices also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products as I try to grow my own nails out after wearing fake nails for about 20 years. This one didn&#x27;t really do much more than provide a clear coat which peels and chips pretty quickly. I haven&#x27;t found any of the Sally Hansen products really effective. The only thing that&#x27;s working for me is &amp;#34;No More Wraps&amp;#34; nail laminate.</li>
            <li> Very hard on nails works great.</li>
            <li> I have to say, when I ordered this product I was really excited to try it out because my nails are so very prone to chipping and peeling so I thought maybe this hardener will help. At first I followed the directions on the bottle, put one coat everyday, but as soon as the Polish starts to peel it peels of my nail with it. I didn&#x27;t think it was the Polish so I tried it again and again it happened. I have to say that my nail did better on its own that with this polish. It was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Too thick. First purchased from Amazon and the bottle appeared to have been sitting around a while. The second bottle was from Rite Aide. It was better, but still too thick and therefore chipped very easily.</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble finding Triple Strength in the stores, so was glad to purchase this online, best product for me for base coat and top coat. Really keeps manicure longer.</li>
            <li> I have always used Sally Hansen products. I have natural nails. This product works. Does not cause my nails to peel. I have to cut them periodically because they grow so long. Puts a protective coating on my nails.  I like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> At first I was loving this. If you&#x27;re looking for a product to protect your nails by itself I would highly recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wasn&#x27;t the case for me. I use Sally Hansen nail hardeners as a base coat (which is listed as one of the uses on the back of all of them.) This &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; formula made a really thick coat and trying to apply polish over that was just really messy and it took forever to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the regular, no addition, Sally Hansen Hard As Nails. It works as a base coat, a topcoat, or 2 coats by itself. Your nails will be rock solid and really hard to break</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I THOUGHT. DID NOTHING FOR ME. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME OR EFFORT ORERING, IT TAKES FOREVER TO DRY. ALMOST LIKE YOU ARE PAINTING YOUR NAILS WITH HOUSE PAINT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Item doesn&#x27;t dry at all.. left to dry for a long time and still smudged my nail polish</li>
            <li> This polish is now hard to find in the city. Thank you amazon for making this product available. Polish is great for making nails thicker and stronger. It is a little pricey but worth the the money.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works great!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work miracles for my soft nails that peel like crazy at the ends. It helps if used as directed.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite nail polish.  I have very thin nails and this helps strengthen them</li>
            <li> Great nail strengthener! It provides a great protective seal. My nails have never grown so long so quickly!</li>
            <li> My nails are starting to grow and not break.</li>
            <li> The Product was received promptly and  in great condition.  It was everything it was advertised&lt;br /&gt;to be and I am very happy with both the quality of the product as well as the excellent&lt;br /&gt;service I received.</li>
            <li> I love this nail hardener. I have tried quite a few others but I love, love, love this one! I use this as my base coat, apply a color, and then a top coat I use Sally Hansen Hard as Nails. I do this at least twice a week if possible. My nails have gone from fragile (from all the fake acrylic nails) to hard and super long. I have NEVER had long nails in my life until this product! When I do not have time to put a color and a top coat I just put this base coat and I am good to go. I love this product! I highly recommend. I wish I could include a picture for all to see. But truly and honestly my nails are longer than ever before. Longer than my acrylic nails at that! They are hard and do not easily chip or break. Highly Recommend!!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff my nails are stronger and look so much healthier#!!</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Triple Strong Nail has protected my nails from breaking</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was recommended in a video on nail care. The person recommending this sold it as a strengthener and not hardener but It works well enough. I use it as a base coat and it goes on very smoothly and it dries in a decent amount of time. I never use it as a top coat so no idea how it performs in that capacity. I would recommend trying it but remember that with all hardeners you can&#x27;t use it all the time because while it may harden in the beginning but over time it will break down the chemical composition of the nail and possibly make them worse than when you started. Use this in the beginning to gain strength then switch to a nice strengthener to maintain the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update 4/13/2014*&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a little while now and it does strengthen my nails really well. I stopped using this at one point and started using Nail Tek Formula 2 and it really ruined my nails. They were soft, peeling in layers, chipping and overall bad shape. I switched back to this and 2 weeks later my nails were back to normal, stronger and no longer peeling off in layers. I have purchased a second bottle to keep in my arsenal. This is not the only product I use. I use Sally Hansen \\&quot;Thicken Up\\&quot; as well as Nailtique Formula 2 Plus. Both products works well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Very good but my nail are still break</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have trouble growing my nails, they are thin and weak and break a lot. and I am always working with plaster and cement and it takes a toll on my nails. This product does a great job of protecting them and keeping them strong and letting them grow! I just put a few coats on a couple times a week. just to keep them covered. Works Great!</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a guy. I damaged one of my finger nails while working on a project. Rather than run the risk of having the nail get hooked on something and tearing off completely -- a painful proposition -- I decided to coat the nail and protect it until it grew long enough for me to trim off the damage. I tried several different brands of nail polish/hardener lent to me by women I know; but none of them was worth a sheat. After reviewing various products on Amazon I decided to give this stuff a try. Much to my surprise it worked and I was able to protect my fingernail until I could finally completely cut off the damaged section. I did have to remove the hardener on occasion and reapply, but that was do to damage I caused while performing various tasks such as training circus elephants and refueling intergalactic space probes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever find myself in similar circumstances, or if I want to dress in drag, I will certainly reach for the Sally Hansen Triple Strong Advanced Gel Nail Hardener once again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had soft nails that would peel as soon as they got any length to them. I&#x27;ve used this nail hardener a few times now and I am impressed. I NEVER thought I could actually have nice natural nails. My nails are very hard now and can actually withstand some abuse with out breaking off. I used to be able to actually bend my nails over my finger because they were so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish doesn&#x27;t help with the life of any polish, but since you are suppose to use it every three days with a fresh application, I guess that doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, Love it.  If your a lady that has tried every product out there and still have week nails, this product has titanium in it.  Super Strong.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent. I&#x27;ve used this polish for many years, and have beautiful nails. It makes a great top coat for a french manicure.</li>
            <li> 1000% recommend this product if you really want to stop biting ur nails..... its now been 4 months and my are so long i have to keep cutting them..... the more you want to have nails the less you&#x27;ll bite them after they grow TRUST ME!!!</li>
            <li> love it! super shiny, holds up really well. I work at Costco and if it can hold up there it can hold up anywhere :)  nails are getting long and have been asked who does them...  ME! paint n go gel nails... awesome</li>
            <li> I purchased this product since I have weak nails that are very difficult to grow out. It&#x27;s stronger than your average base coat , but it didn&#x27;t improve nail strength with continued use and it took off some of my natural nail when it would chip. That just left me with worse nails than I began with. Also, I sealed the bottle well after each use and it still turned very thick and difficult to apply before the bottle even ran out. I&#x27;m definitely not purchasing again... Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail growth/strengthener line is somewhat pathetic.</li>
            <li> I work in an industry that requires me to wear gloves (vinyl, latex) all day. They were eating my nails so bad that they would break below my fingers. Within 7 days of using this according to directions my nails are actually starting to show. Its a slow process, but considering what they were before, It was WELL worth the purchase. BTW, I tried ALL of Sally&#x27;s Nail miracle, and nail growth stuff. This is the BEST. It&#x27;s like Teflon for your nails.</li>
            <li> this product worked perfect I have not broken a nail  and I deliver packages for a living right on</li>
            <li> I have extremely weak nails, which have constantly peeled my whole life. I am in my early 20s, and I go to school and work. My nails experience quite a lot of wear and tear, so I didn&#x27;t paint them that often because they would chip within a couple days. I started getting gel manicures every two weeks, and I loved how the color stayed on my weak nails. However, every time I got the gel taken off, my nails became weaker. I had enough of spending $25 every two weeks just for my nails to become weaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Sally Hansen Triple Strong Advanced Gel hardener about three weeks ago. I purchased it because of the positive reviews I read about it, but I was still skeptical that it could work for MY flaky nails. However, it actually worked WONDERS.  I applied the gel to my nails and left it on for three days, as instructed. I removed the gel on the fourth day and reapplied it, leaving it on again for three days. After the three days, I removed the gel, cut and filed my nails, and reapplied it for a third time. This time, however, I waited one full day for the gel to dry, then applied regular nail polish. I let the nail polish dry for a day, and then I applied Sally Hansen Super Shine Top Coat. My nail polish didn&#x27;t chip for seven days, which is incredible, considering I could only go two days without it chipping. Even though the directions say to reapply the gel every three-four days, by the third time I had used it, the gel still worked it&#x27;s magic on the seventh day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since then, my nails feel stronger, and they don&#x27;t split and peel nearly as much as they used to (one or two fingers might peel every couple of weeks.) I highly recommend this product for anyone who has weak, flaky, and peeling nails like I had. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product time will tell</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all in my nails after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have very thin nails and they break easily.  The product did not seem to do anything but it looked like you had clear nail polish on.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sally Hansen products for years and I still love them, I purchased this polish while searching for a gel nail kit for my sister for Christmas, it arrived on time and packaged well, I love this stuff, my nails are strong, with no cracking or breaking. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Works great! Helped me get my nails recovered from artificial nails. They are strong and smooth again and growing out past my nail beds without all the splitting.</li>
            <li> awesome product.  I do not have the time or money to get manicures like my coworkers...my nails look great</li>
            <li> Its not as hard or slick as advertised !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teflon  is very slick this is not.  After drying a full day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it still was soft and thats with a lite to med coat.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used this for 2 weeks on my nails and barely see a difference.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> It last much longer than any other polish and you don&#x27;t need to have a light to dry it under.</li>
            <li> I use to bite my nails until all I had were nubs on the tips of my fingers. When I finally stopped biting my nails they began to grown back but would never grow past a certain length. They were weak and very thin. I bought this product on a whim. Every five days I remove the previous coat and apply two coats to my nails. It has been a couple of weeks since my purchase and I can say that I am happy with the results. My nails have not only grown in length, but they are also stronger. They are even starting to grown over the tips of my fingers! I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to help their nails gain some strength. Just make sure that you follow the directions on the bottle and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> SOFTENED MY NAILS INSTEAD OF HARDEN</li>
            <li> Seems to have stopped my nails from splitting and breaking. I was born with weak nails. Time will tell how effective this product is long term.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bench jeweler by day and spend my free time doing yard work and gardening... so you can imagine my nails just don&#x27;t last. My nails tend to be extremely thin as it is, so even when I&#x27;m not working I&#x27;m prone to breaking or splitting my nails. I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds of hardeners over the years with little to no success. On a whim a few weeks back I bought this, and figured I&#x27;d at least give it a try. Having tried Sally Hansen products in the past I wasn&#x27;t too hopeful of this working all that well.. but I haven&#x27;t broken or chipped a nail since using it. I&#x27;ve tried it alone and with nail polish and it works great. I apply 2-3 coats, allowing it to dry in between and redo it about 2-3 times a week (I want to make sure it stays well on the tips of my nails, where I&#x27;m prone to breaking them.)</li>
            <li> Must use two coats &amp; really prevents chipping. More efficient under a color.</li>
            <li> Leaves nail very strong. Loved how shinny it left my nails.</li>
            <li> I used to have really strong nails.  After a series of moving and helping friends move...it was terrible.. and left my nails chipping all the time.  I bought this after weeks of frusteration.  Its amazing!!  It makes such a difference.  I started by using it as recommended.  The bottle recommends two coats and then reapply once every 3 days.  I now use it once a week, only one coat and its just fine.  My nails haven&#x27;t chipped in a long time, and they seem to be getting back to my normal strong, long nails.  For the price, its amazing!</li>
            <li> it worked well on my nails made them grow quick with in a few days and they dont peel chip or break</li>
            <li> I hate this product I never liked Sally Hansen regular nail polish line but for some reason I thought her gel nail polish would be a lot better it&#x27;s not I purchased the products used it it never cured I use gel nail polish for over 10 years I know how to cure it for some reason this Sally Hansen nail polish never cured  I hate it I can not even use it this product was a waste of my money and time.I don&#x27;t want to sound so mean and negative but unfortunately I had a horrible experience with this Sally Hansen gel nail hardener</li>
