            <li>recommend this product to all my friends with chronic illnesses.&lt;br /&gt;I am not associated with Results RNA or Amazon.com and the opinions in this review are my own based on my use of this product.</li>
            <li>After a year of antibiotics it was nice to change to a healthier bactericidal product and feel covered.</li>
            <li>Very strong CS...</li>
            <li>My wife and I have had excellent results with this product so far.  </li>
            <li>It is very good product, easy to use and has very fast effect</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gotten so much better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also more convenient to take, with the sprays, than liquid colloidal silver where you have to measure it into a spoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Since 2002 I have been plagued with this and antibiotics have not been able to do the job.</li>
            <li>Now my joints and knees are feeling much better.  </li>
            <li>I begin feeling better.</li>
            <li>I love this silver.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite colloidal silver.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite silver supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>just wish the price was a bit less...or you got more product.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND</li>
            <li>Results RNA products are very high quality and very effective.  </li>
            <li>Works well and is safe and easy to use:)</li>
            <li>Very effective and easy to use as it comes ready to use in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Happily, the very same day, I came across Results RNA&#x27;s Cellular Silver, and I am finding it to be a very effective, and MUCH cheaper alternative to IV colloidal silver therapy!</li>
            <li>it is very very true.  </li>
            <li>This product, ACS 200 Advanced Cellular Silver has been more like a miracle to me compared to any prescription that I&#x27;ve taken.  </li>
            <li>Very quickly acted upon whatever was going on in there (within 10 minutes)</li>
            <li>I sprayed it in their water bowl and they were fine in two days.</li>
            <li>The two ounce size is great to carry in your purse...or have several throughout the house.</li>
            <li>I have remained &amp;#34;common cold&amp;#34; free while others cough around me at work.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a great improvement in my skin and overall health.</li>
            <li>might be a buncha hoopla, but you be the judge, and make sure you get a fresh product by date.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is probably more consistent than mine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now the first time in years that I have been able to breath thru my nose.</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>There is a slight metallic taste that goes away if you eat or drink after using it, but wait a full two minutes before washing it out of your mouth as it is best absorbed by your mouth lining.&lt;br /&gt;Among</li>
            <li>So far I am impressed and feel it will be a daily routine to keep my microbiomes in balance.</li>
            <li>Was at a seminar with twelve of the most advanced holistic m.d.&#x27;s and this was highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Works great as expected.  </li>
            <li>Wound healed very rapidly in just matter of 2-3 days, redness was practically gone, wound tracks returned to naturally healthy color, no scarring.</li>
            <li>and by morning she appeared to have almost full reversal of infection symptoms.  </li>
            <li>I think I got much greater results from vitamin C which is also much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I only gave him one more spray the following day for good measure, but the skin began to scab by then and it didn&#x27;t return!  </li>
            <li>I have added ACS-200 to our daily regimen for whole the family and have seen great results.</li>
            <li>Not a terribly unpleasant taste.</li>
            <li>THE SUPPLIER WAS EXTREMELY FAST AND ACCURATE.</li>
            <li>initially cleaned with warm soap/water, sterile dressing applied</li>
            <li>Useful for long-term immunity.</li>
            <li>My dad had shingles about a year ago and had a recurrence right after having received the ACS 200.</li>
            <li>and this cleared it right up.  </li>
            <li>This product keeps my lyme in check and killed off many bacterial infections I have had.it works as well or better then antibiotics and is safer .I</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my wife&#x27;s sinus infection (using her Prime account); she had fluid backed into her eustacean tube which appeared to cause an infection near the ear drum (bright red and inflamed as viewed from within the ear canal), causing strong, persistent headache, dizziness/difficulty concentrating and mild fever.  </li>
            <li>A friend applied some of this to a burn I had on my hand that want healing very fast, by the next day it was already looking and feeling so much better.</li>
            <li>and I could tell a difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for almost a year and have avoided some pretty persistant bugs</li>
            <li>He said that many people who believe they have cancer actually have parasites.  </li>
            <li>This product really works and I received it right away.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind.  </li>
            <li>Great against a wide array of pathogens&lt;br /&gt;Experienced skin infection from deep cat scratch.</li>
            <li>Really great stuff... for her situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months, she tried another product that had far less silver parts per million in it (effectively lowering her dosage).</li>
            <li>product did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Some colloidal silver I can&#x27;t feel, but this stuff I can really</li>
            <li>This a very easy-to-take silver product I am using for a lyme co-infection.</li>
            <li>Very wierd..</li>
            <li>I am very allergic to silver, yet I can use this product.  </li>
            <li>but the reviews about this is really &amp;#34; amazing&amp;#34; from the website.</li>
            <li>It killed a rare form of Staph that the doctors haven&#x27;t been able to do.</li>
            <li>I was told that you know this is the right stuff if it is clear.  </li>
            <li>I usually make my own and wanted to try this to see the difference.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, read all the reviews, all the research on their website but know how research can be slanted.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Now, I take high doses and have no symptoms.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a perfect sign that it was doing it&#x27;s job, killing the bad bacteria.</li>
            <li>I now have normal elimination.  </li>
            <li>She still has fluid trapped in the ear; but without the pain she seems much more willing to address the blockage via mechanical means over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am finding new things I can do that</li>
            <li>Since she was new to the job and there was no one else to teach the class, she came in to teach, with the flu.</li>
            <li>It is the exact product recommended to me by my medical practitioner.</li>
            <li>It has consistently returned and remained a constant problem.</li>
            <li>recommend spraying a small amount on the underside of your arm before taking it to make sure you don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction</li>
            <li>so the jury is still out on the effectiveness of this product, but we both are positive about its potential.</li>
            <li>They were of little value to wipe out the organism, Borrelia burgdorferi, which according to some experts is one of the primary causes of Lyme Disease.  </li>
            <li>This brand is clear when you look inside the bottle.</li>
            <li>As far as can feel, it seemed to work; but can any of us truly say what works and what doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll update when it&#x27;s completely gone.  </li>
            <li>She is 92 years old and has a nightmarish history of those infections.  </li>
            <li>Unexpected side effect: 1.</li>
            <li>it is helping more than taking any type of anti allergy medicine with their negative side effects of sleepiness or jitteriness.</li>
            <li>I used the full dosage and feel much less sluggish than before taking it.</li>
            <li>and after only 4 days of 2x a day my lungs are clearer than they have been since these allergies developed!</li>
            <li>I am doing this in conjunction with the nasal spray, which is helping to clear constantly stuffed up sinuses.</li>
            <li>My 1 year old for various colds and ear infections.</li>
            <li>e.g. I gave my bottle to an 80yr old diabetic friend of mine to take home and spray it on the open sores of her legs.</li>
            <li>Suspecting an antibiotic resistant strain, I bought this product and she used it with an ultrasonic nebulizer to try to deliver the product as direct as possible to the affected tissue.  </li>
            <li>so i cant say totally yes its good or no its bad .</li>

            <li> She still has fluid trapped in the ear; but without the pain she seems much more willing to address the blockage via mechanical means over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am finding new things I can do that</li>
            <li> Since she was new to the job and there was no one else to teach the class, she came in to teach, with the flu.</li>
            <li> It is the exact product recommended to me by my medical practitioner.</li>
            <li> It has consistently returned and remained a constant problem.</li>
            <li> recommend spraying a small amount on the underside of your arm before taking it to make sure you don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction</li>
            <li> so the jury is still out on the effectiveness of this product, but we both are positive about its potential.</li>
            <li> They were of little value to wipe out the organism, Borrelia burgdorferi, which according to some experts is one of the primary causes of Lyme Disease.  </li>
            <li> This brand is clear when you look inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> As far as can feel, it seemed to work; but can any of us truly say what works and what doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll update when it&#x27;s completely gone.  </li>
            <li> She is 92 years old and has a nightmarish history of those infections.  </li>
            <li> Unexpected side effect: 1.</li>
            <li> it is helping more than taking any type of anti allergy medicine with their negative side effects of sleepiness or jitteriness.</li>
            <li> I used the full dosage and feel much less sluggish than before taking it.</li>
            <li> and after only 4 days of 2x a day my lungs are clearer than they have been since these allergies developed!</li>
            <li> I am doing this in conjunction with the nasal spray, which is helping to clear constantly stuffed up sinuses.</li>
            <li> My 1 year old for various colds and ear infections.</li>
            <li> e.g. I gave my bottle to an 80yr old diabetic friend of mine to take home and spray it on the open sores of her legs.</li>
            <li> Suspecting an antibiotic resistant strain, I bought this product and she used it with an ultrasonic nebulizer to try to deliver the product as direct as possible to the affected tissue.  </li>
            <li> so i cant say totally yes its good or no its bad .</li>
            <li> I became a bit skeptical about it specially knowing that it hasn&#x27;t been approved by the American authorities, however, due to all positive reviews I decided to give it a try as I had some mouth ulcers and guess what ?</li>
            <li> The only thing I can give you is a scenario to judge from: my early indicate of a flu is usually a fever, when I catch that I spray the thing under my tongue, and within an hour it just goes away, as opposed to my usual remedy, which is to begin taking high doses of Vitamin Cs, and still end up battling for three days to fight off the flu.</li>
            <li> Long shelf life .</li>
            <li> mg antibiotic for about a week; no change; her Ear/Nose/Throat doc upped to 3x2kmg for a few days; no apparent change after 2nd day/night.  </li>
            <li> ACS 200 silver is easy to use: depressing the spray plunger delivers a measured amount of product.</li>
            <li> Within ten days of taking this product I noticed mood improvement and less anxiety and depression.  </li>
            <li> I was just hoping for a little relief, now thou I feel 20 years younger.</li>
            <li> Upon adding it to my arsenal, I had a slight flare of symptoms (considered a Herxheimer reaction) which subsided within a week of use along with a subsidence of several other symptoms which had been increasing and restricting my activities before I began using ACS 200.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My wife and I have primarily used it when we felt a cold or soar throat coming on, and it nips it in the bud.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve treated my boys for strep throat, ear infections and pink eye.</li>
            <li> I apparently contracted Lyme Disease sometime this past April.  </li>
            <li> Be careful when using.  </li>
            <li> I immediately felt my skin improving after spraying directly on my skin - no more burning or itching!</li>
            <li> Have had a raw, itchy spot on my back for months.</li>
            <li> Not certain if I noticed any results from this other than it made my teeth hurt.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> However, anecdotaly, she was not in a state of mind where she seemed to be \\&quot;anticipating\\&quot; that the other product would not work.)</li>
            <li> Needed to start on very low dose ( 1 Spray per day) and build up slowly.</li>
            <li> A few sprays in my cats water bowl helped heal his gums in a few days so I ordered another bottle for myself and to use a few sprays in other bowls.  </li>
            <li> but I pour a little out and use a syringe to administer drops into eyes or ears.</li>
            <li> It has also killed my gluten problem.</li>
            <li> i have been using this brand of Silver for a few years now and it keeps me and my family healthier throughout the winter.</li>
            <li> A few sprays in your mouth, swish, then swallow.</li>
            <li> i have done a lot of research into this product, and im quite surprised that it not only didnt work well, but i was using it to treat a cold, and it just made it worse.</li>
            <li> I had a small abscess and almost immediately the swelling subsided and it was gone.</li>
            <li> You should do this to prevent excessive herxing.</li>
            <li> It should not build up in the body like colloidal silver because the particles are so small, but I won&#x27;t use it every day anyway.  </li>
            <li> Definitely shortened a cold I caught and when both my cats started sneezing</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before reading the negative reviews, once I read them</li>
            <li> and it defiantly delivers at least some of what it promises to do, anyways</li>
            <li> My wife tends to poo-poo natural remedies, but last week she woke up feeling terrible, her glands in her neck were swollen,</li>
            <li> I had just been discussing, with my doctor, going to IV colloidal silver for my chronic late stage Lyme.  </li>
            <li> other problems, I am troubled by chronic Lyme disease (CLD), and this is one of an arsenal of supplements that I use to control the symptoms of my problems.</li>
            <li> The classroom was very small.</li>
            <li> It probably would help any bad infection, especially wounds.</li>
            <li> The taste is awful but bought two bottles and used them to the very end</li>
            <li> and their response was laughable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended (although expensive)!</li>
            <li> Some have complained about having a horrible \\&quot;reaction&#x27; that includes flu like symptoms.</li>
            <li> bad headache, etc.,</li>
            <li> My cats gums were so bad he was scheduled to have a bunch of teeth pulled</li>
            <li> Im feeling like I maybe getting sick and during the course of the illness.</li>
            <li> This has kept our family from getting sick this winter.  </li>
            <li> The minute I started to feel sick and had a sore throat</li>
            <li> I had been to the doctor and given prescriptions for steroids and a couple others with horrible side effects for a bad allergic reaction which we still haven&#x27;t figured out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste bad either!</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best colloidal silver market. is of the highest quality</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by our Dr. I have used it personally anytime Im feeling like I maybe getting sick and during the course of the illness. I&#x27;ve treated my boys for strep throat, ear infections and pink eye. My 1 year old for various colds and ear infections. My hubby even used it for a bout of cellulitis which cleared up within 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;Generally speaking I don&#x27;t use antibiotic&#x27;s for my family, so this is a great product for us to have around our home.&lt;br /&gt;just a note I don&#x27;t spray into the ears or eyes but I pour a little out and use a syringe to administer drops into eyes or ears.</li>
            <li> As far as can feel, it seemed to work; but can any of us truly say what works and what doesn&#x27;t. The only thing I can give you is a scenario to judge from: my early indicate of a flu is usually a fever, when I catch that I spray the thing under my tongue, and within an hour it just goes away, as opposed to my usual remedy, which is to begin taking high doses of Vitamin Cs, and still end up battling for three days to fight off the flu. So, with that I can only calculate that it does work.</li>
            <li> ACS 200 silver is easy to use: depressing the spray plunger delivers a measured amount of product. There is a slight metallic taste that goes away if you eat or drink after using it, but wait a full two minutes before washing it out of your mouth as it is best absorbed by your mouth lining.&lt;br /&gt;Among other problems, I am troubled by chronic Lyme disease (CLD), and this is one of an arsenal of supplements that I use to control the symptoms of my problems. While ACS 200 can not be considered a cure for CLD, it does reduce the severity of symptoms for me. Upon adding it to my arsenal, I had a slight flare of symptoms (considered a Herxheimer reaction) which subsided within a week of use along with a subsidence of several other symptoms which had been increasing and restricting my activities before I began using ACS 200.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to all my friends with chronic illnesses.&lt;br /&gt;I am not associated with Results RNA or Amazon.com and the opinions in this review are my own based on my use of this product.</li>
            <li> Works great. Very effective.</li>
            <li> Great product at great price and delivered right to my home.  I love it.  It is the exact product recommended to me by my medical practitioner.</li>
            <li> Have had a raw, itchy spot on my back for months. I sprayed ACS 200 E.S. on it and the itching stopped. Ahhh... How do I spell relief? A-C-S-2-0-0-E-t-r-a-S-t-r-e-n-g-t-h . . . ! We&#x27;ll just have to wait and see if it cures it, update to follow...</li>
            <li> This has kept our family from getting sick this winter.  Amazing stuff!    I use it on the dog as well.  He has an infection in his eye that the vet couldn&#x27;t get rid of with antibiotics.  This seems to be doing the trick.  It&#x27;s gotten so much better.  We&#x27;ll update when it&#x27;s completely gone.  Along with his eye treatment twice a day with an eye dropper, we also give him 4 squirts which he licks from the palm of my hand.  He thinks it&#x27;s a treat.  The two ounce size is great to carry in your purse...or have several throughout the house.</li>
            <li> Definitely shortened a cold I caught and when both my cats started sneezing (some viruses  cross species) I sprayed it in their water bowl and they were fine in two days.</li>
            <li> Amazing OTC  silver /  water based oral spray antimicrobial. Long shelf life . Take it with me wherever I go. Great against a wide array of pathogens&lt;br /&gt;Experienced skin infection from deep cat scratch. Wound , surrounding area  initially cleaned with warm soap/water, sterile dressing applied then only used ACS 200 ES oral spray. Wound healed very rapidly in just matter of 2-3 days, redness was practically gone, wound tracks returned to naturally healthy color, no scarring. Amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark  RN,RNP</li>
            <li> product did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before reading the negative reviews, once I read them I became a bit skeptical about it specially knowing that it hasn&#x27;t been approved by the American authorities, however, due to all positive reviews I decided to give it a try as I had some mouth ulcers and guess what ? they totally disappeared in a matter of two days ! therefor, I do believe this product has something going for it and it defiantly delivers at least some of what it promises to do, anyways, I would not swallow it after knowing that the silver particles would accumulate inside your body and won&#x27;t be expelled out of it, so the way I use it I only spray it a couple of times wait for a minute or two and then rinse it off</li>
            <li> I had a herxing response and after a week started hacking up phlem like I&#x27;ve never known!  I used the full dosage and feel much less sluggish than before taking it. My dad had shingles about a year ago and had a recurrence right after having received the ACS 200. I sprayed it once on the only flare-up he had on his upper arm and told him to keep it out of sunlight (look into that), two hours later it stopped throbbing in pain! I only gave him one more spray the following day for good measure, but the skin began to scab by then and it didn&#x27;t return!  Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This seems to work for use when we are under the weather.  Have been buying this for three years now.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, read all the reviews, all the research on their website but know how research can be slanted.  I was hoping it would help my recurring infection.  The taste is awful but bought two bottles and used them to the very end and it did not help with the infections.  I even called customer service and asked them why it was not working and their response was laughable.  &amp;#34;Not everything works on all people&amp;#34;  it is very very true.  I want a refund!!!!  Was very disappointed. Did not work for me!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Needed to start on very low dose ( 1 Spray per day) and build up slowly. Improved energy and Chronic health issues are lessened</li>
            <li> This is like a wonder drug.  I recommend it to everyone and can&#x27;t say enough for it.  I will definitely  purchase it again and will be back.  The product arrived before the date promised.  I am very happy with this supplier.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I apparently contracted Lyme Disease sometime this past April.  I was put on antibiotics.  They were of little value to wipe out the organism, Borrelia burgdorferi, which according to some experts is one of the primary causes of Lyme Disease.  This product, ACS 200 Advanced Cellular Silver has been more like a miracle to me compared to any prescription that I&#x27;ve taken.  I highly recommend this product.  My mother is now taking it for chronic urinary tract infections.  She is 92 years old and has a nightmarish history of those infections.  She just begun taking it so the jury is still out on the effectiveness of this product, but we both are positive about its potential.</li>
            <li> Saved my life, killing an infection when nothing else worked.  Useful for long-term immunity.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product! (40yrs experience w/Silver) e.g. I gave my bottle to an 80yr old diabetic friend of mine to take home and spray it on the open sores of her legs. She forgot what I said...read the instructions and sprayed it under her tongue. The open sores in her mouth (years) were healed in three days!</li>
            <li> I usually make my own and wanted to try this to see the difference. I feel like this is probably more consistent than mine and I like that. I&#x27;ll use this for my personal needs and my homemade for my household disinfecting.</li>
            <li> Some colloidal silver I can&#x27;t feel, but this stuff I can really feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives me herxing symptoms almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also more convenient to take, with the sprays, than liquid colloidal silver where you have to measure it into a spoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this stuff. Just have something on hand (alka seltzer gold, sarsaparilla, coffee enemas, etc.) to deal with the herxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably good for mold too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife&#x27;s sinus infection (using her Prime account); she had fluid backed into her eustacean tube which appeared to cause an infection near the ear drum (bright red and inflamed as viewed from within the ear canal), causing strong, persistent headache, dizziness/difficulty concentrating and mild fever.  She&#x27;d been on about 3x1000mg antibiotic for about a week; no change; her Ear/Nose/Throat doc upped to 3x2kmg for a few days; no apparent change after 2nd day/night.  Suspecting an antibiotic resistant strain, I bought this product and she used it with an ultrasonic nebulizer to try to deliver the product as direct as possible to the affected tissue.  After 2 doses about 3 hours apart, she appeared to have some relief in symptoms.  A third dose before bed - this time both oral and with the nebulizer - and by morning she appeared to have almost full reversal of infection symptoms.  She still has fluid trapped in the ear; but without the pain she seems much more willing to address the blockage via mechanical means over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> I think the ACS produces a good boost to my immune system. I have remained &amp;#34;common cold&amp;#34; free while others cough around me at work.</li>
            <li> This a very easy-to-take silver product I am using for a lyme co-infection. After a year of antibiotics it was nice to change to a healthier bactericidal product and feel covered. No side effects and no taste, pleasant and easy to use, I am getting good results..</li>
            <li> This cured (the symptoms of) my wife&#x27;s Lyme disease in a couple days. Really great stuff... for her situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months, she tried another product that had far less silver parts per million in it (effectively lowering her dosage). When she made the switch, the symptoms started to re-emerge (Psychosomatic? Possibly. However, anecdotaly, she was not in a state of mind where she seemed to be \\&quot;anticipating\\&quot; that the other product would not work.) When she reverted back to the ACS 200, her symptoms again went away.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It killed a rare form of Staph that the doctors haven&#x27;t been able to do. Since 2002 I have been plagued with this and antibiotics have not been able to do the job. It has consistently returned and remained a constant problem. I thought it was going to kill me eventually.  I had all but given up until a friend told me about this. I tried it and I could tell a difference the first time I used it.  I continue to improve day and after day as I use this daily as a nasal spray. It&#x27;s now the first time in years that I have been able to breath thru my nose. I must say this is the best. It has also killed my gluten problem. Stopped my Lyme disease, and cured the pain I was having from what I thought to be artritis. Now my joints and knees are feeling much better.  I was just hoping for a little relief, now thou I feel 20 years younger. At 66 yrs ole that&#x27;s a great thing I must say! I am finding new things I can do that I thought I had loss the abilitily to do, just from killing and cleaning up my system.  Great product. I plan to continue using it daily from now on!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have had excellent results with this product so far.  My wife and I have primarily used it when we felt a cold or soar throat coming on, and it nips it in the bud.  My wife tends to poo-poo natural remedies, but last week she woke up feeling terrible, her glands in her neck were swollen, bad headache, etc., but after using the ACS Cellular Silver several times throughout the day her symptoms were gone by the next morning.</li>
            <li> This gets a ONE Star because when I opened the product to check the color there was a piece of something inside floating around that looks like a piece of mold .. Very wierd.. That is what my experience is with this PRODUCT</li>
            <li> For external use, kills everything as advertised. Great for all fungual use. Also use on wounds to prevent infection and speed up healing. Put the pharmaceuticals away whenever possible. ACS will help</li>
            <li> I use it on myself and my dogs!</li>
            <li> Still working with it. I had a small abscess and almost immediately the swelling subsided and it was gone. Pricey, yes, but it is the only one that has research and documentation. So far I am impressed and feel it will be a daily routine to keep my microbiomes in balance.</li>
            <li> This product really works and I received it right away. The minute I started to feel sick and had a sore throat I use this and within about 20 minutes I begin feeling better. Use it all the time even for precaution!</li>
            <li> i use this as soon as i feel a sore throat.  I have been using this product for almost a year and have avoided some pretty persistant bugs</li>
            <li> I had just been discussing, with my doctor, going to IV colloidal silver for my chronic late stage Lyme.  Happily, the very same day, I came across Results RNA&#x27;s Cellular Silver, and I am finding it to be a very effective, and MUCH cheaper alternative to IV colloidal silver therapy!</li>
            <li> Not certain if I noticed any results from this other than it made my teeth hurt.  That lets me know there is metal of some sort in the product, but I can&#x27;t say it helped with my lung infection.  I think I got much greater results from vitamin C which is also much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love this silver. I have noticed a great improvement in my skin and overall health. I will buy it for the rest of my life, I just wish it came in  a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite colloidal silver. Very effective and easy to use as it comes ready to use in a spray bottle. Doesn&#x27;t taste bad either!</li>
            <li> i have been using this brand of Silver for a few years now and it keeps me and my family healthier throughout the winter.</li>
            <li> Was at a seminar with twelve of the most advanced holistic m.d.&#x27;s and this was highly recommended. I am very allergic to silver, yet I can use this product.  Wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind.  Great for bacteria, yeast and viruses.</li>
            <li> I had been to the doctor and given prescriptions for steroids and a couple others with horrible side effects for a bad allergic reaction which we still haven&#x27;t figured out. A family member told me about colloidal silver, I tried this brand based on reviews and it has been the best treatment!! I immediately felt my skin improving after spraying directly on my skin - no more burning or itching! I&#x27;ve continued to take it both internally and externally and all my symptoms are gone, including the embarrassing red patches on my skin.</li>
            <li> Be careful when using.  It stains your counters if you let it drip onto it.  Seems to be good!</li>
            <li> Great product! Felt better in no time! I have added ACS-200 to our daily regimen for whole the family and have seen great results.</li>
            <li> No colds or flu since I have been using this product. Was introduced to this product in October 2012. In January of 2013, I was in a class for 4 months. The instructor got the flu, 2 weeks into the class. Since she was new to the job and there was no one else to teach the class, she came in to teach, with the flu. The classroom was very small. Only 6 students in the class. She was coughing for 3 weeks. I never got the flu!</li>
            <li> Works great as expected.  I&#x27;ve used it on scraps and cuts to heal faster. Also take it internally to fight off colds / flu bugs.</li>
            <li> Since hearing from a medical doctor that colloidal silver is a known preventative and cure for ebola, we purchased this item to protect ourselves. A few sprays in your mouth, swish, then swallow. Not a terribly unpleasant taste.</li>
            <li> It is very good product, easy to use and has very fast effect</li>
            <li> A friend applied some of this to a burn I had on my hand that want healing very fast, by the next day it was already looking and feeling so much better. So I ordered this to keep on hand just for such an emergency.</li>
            <li> very good price, the product also very good.</li>
            <li> Within ten days of taking this product I noticed mood improvement and less anxiety and depression.  After years of chronic constipation I now have normal elimination.  It is going on three weeks and so far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, must have product!!!  Works well and is safe and easy to use:)</li>
            <li> I had a doctor recommend this to me.  His specialty is dealing with Lyme Disease.  He said that many people who believe they have cancer actually have parasites.  I was told that you know this is the right stuff if it is clear.  This brand is clear when you look inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite silver supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend spraying a small amount on the underside of your arm before taking it to make sure you don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction (it would create a rash on your arm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When starting, only start with 1 spray per day. The next week, do 2. The third week, do 3. You should do this to prevent excessive herxing. Some have complained about having a horrible \\&quot;reaction&#x27; that includes flu like symptoms. This is almost undoubtedly the product taking effect and herxing causing these symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when I first started on a small dose it felt like I had a fever. This was a perfect sign that it was doing it&#x27;s job, killing the bad bacteria. Now, I take high doses and have no symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take this in combination with their cellular zeolite supplement and it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended (although expensive)!</li>
            <li> Results RNA products are very high quality and very effective.  They taste good as well.</li>
            <li> A few sprays in my cats water bowl helped heal his gums in a few days so I ordered another bottle for myself and to use a few sprays in other bowls.  Silver was used before antibiotics came out and it does not make the bacteria become resistant.  It should not build up in the body like colloidal silver because the particles are so small, but I won&#x27;t use it every day anyway.  It probably would help any bad infection, especially wounds.My cats gums were so bad he was scheduled to have a bunch of teeth pulled but they only pulled one after I used the ACS 200 silver.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my lyme in check and killed off many bacterial infections I have had.it works as well or better then antibiotics and is safer .I love ACS!</li>
            <li> I used the spray for a persistent upper respiratory cough (from constant allergy sinus drainage) by inhaling deeply while spraying into the back of my mouth. Very quickly acted upon whatever was going on in there (within 10 minutes) and after only 4 days of 2x a day my lungs are clearer than they have been since these allergies developed! I am doing this in conjunction with the nasal spray, which is helping to clear constantly stuffed up sinuses. Unexpected side effect: 1. my energy level is way up which 2. has been great for my mood :) and 3. it is helping more than taking any type of anti allergy medicine with their negative side effects of sleepiness or jitteriness. Very happy with ACS200!</li>
            <li> Very strong CS...perhaps the strongest I have ever found.  A little goes a long way...but it is $$$.  I had some skin blemishes..and this cleared it right up.  I think you will be happy with the product...just wish the price was a bit less...or you got more product.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND THE SUPPLIER WAS EXTREMELY FAST AND ACCURATE. ty!</li>
            <li> i have done a lot of research into this product, and im quite surprised that it not only didnt work well, but i was using it to treat a cold, and it just made it worse. i later looked at the expiration date and saw it was 2013. i purchased it in feb 2015. so i cant say totally yes its good or no its bad . but the reviews about this is really &amp;#34; amazing&amp;#34; from the website. might be a buncha hoopla, but you be the judge, and make sure you get a fresh product by date.</li>
            <li> This is a great, great product.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my integrated physician. I also add to my dogs water bowl which he loves. Will buy this strength again.</li>
