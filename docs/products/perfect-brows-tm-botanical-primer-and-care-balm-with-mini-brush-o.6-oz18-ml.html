            <li>very good item, I love it.</li>
            <li>Great product and has nice spicy smell.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as advertisement.</li>

            <li>It does do a good job at growing hair</li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Despite now having exactly the kind of eyebrows I wanted, I think I will continue to apply Perfect Brows Balm once or twice a week to maintain that look.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing</li>
            <li>(I prefer to sleep longer in the morning, to be honest), but</li>
            <li>And I kind of like the scent.  </li>
            <li>It’s really nice.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows haven&#x27;t looked this nice in years—</li>
            <li>No noticeable improvement with eyebrow growth however, it is a nice balm.</li>
            <li>My own serum seems to produce faster results and doesn&#x27;t have an off-putting smell.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>It’s important to me that I know a product works well before i recommend it to others, and I’ve confidently recommended Perfect Brows balm to anyone who asks me what they can do to help their eyebrows look better.  </li>
            <li>This is one product that I can honestly say works as described.</li>
            <li>product has a nice citrus scent,  </li>
            <li>I gave it one star because it does smell nice.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kind of a trigger to help me fall asleep.</li>
            <li>IF the hair follicles are healthy and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using this for 2 + weeks and loving the results.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice, and the included applicator is convenient.</li>
            <li>The jar is a nice size.</li>
            <li>It is also a great and considerate company that really takes care of their customers with great customer service.</li>
            <li>It smells nice too.  </li>
            <li>great product really active ingredients inside for the money, and great value well works awesome and will be buying some more from this store.</li>
            <li>Also, somebody please post a comparison between Eyebrow Growth Accelerator Balm PERFECT BROWS compared to NEW!</li>
            <li>I loved the original formula!...</li>
            <li>Great for gifts or use of yourself, priced right!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to recover from over plucking/over waxing -- All the best, I know your pain all too well and can say that this is a good safe product to stick with to help your body recover naturally over time.</li>
            <li>After using a full jar of this product I was somewhat happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I tried Perfect Brows Growth Accelerator Balm after reading reviews online, because I was looking for a new eyebrow growth treatment I could recommend to my clients.  </li>
            <li>I work as a brow and lash technician, so I know how important it is to many people to have great looking eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>They were more than happy to send me another product, free of charge.</li>
            <li>It is not yet substantial but every day I notice more and more hairs growing in!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to everyone as it is cheap and a good product.</li>
            <li>Very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>I decided to try a accelerator and went with the Perfect Brows Growth Balm because it is a natural and botanical  product.</li>
            <li>i &#x27;m about halfway through the jar (and by the way the stuff is really fun - great texture,</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want top spend my own money.</li>
            <li>The hairs on my brows are growing but very light.</li>
            <li>What I did like was the fact that the product was tinted and easy to apply and smelled nice…spicy but nice nonetheless.</li>
            <li>I realized there is a huge difference already!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that I can get them to the point so that they will look more like they did before I started tweezing them altogether.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping with the more time that this product will continue to help and continue to make them grow faster, thicker, darker.</li>
            <li>and so after about 4 weeks I am really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I’m glad I have it now, and I don’t plan to stop.</li>
            <li>Glad it works for some people, wish I had been one of them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite light, it&#x27;s a serum!</li>
            <li>Another thing I love is that it&#x27;s not waxy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always felt my face would look a lot better</li>
            <li>Not like Magic</li>
            <li>my eyebrows are looking better, fuller, darker than they have in years.</li>
            <li>Smells really, really great too, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>All of them reviewed only their two product :-D</li>
            <li>I mostly found use in this product by applying it</li>
            <li>had to use it consistently​ for a month 2 times a day but my eye brows grew back :) so happy with the results!!!</li>
            <li>My brows have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I am applying it twice a day on most days, although some days I forget.</li>
            <li>Using a growth accelerator balm like Perfect Brows can eliminate the need for eyebrow tinting or drawing eyebrows in, and I can definitely tell the difference in my clients who are using this product and those who aren’t.  </li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t HAVE to fill them in with makeup to leave the house anymore.</li>
            <li>I am very happy how it worked for me growing back over plucked spots.  </li>
            <li>Regardless I&#x27;m pleased with the results thus far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No issues love the product will be buying more of this soon...</li>
            <li>at the same time the perfect amount.</li>
            <li>Like many I over-plucked my eyebrows as a teenager and have been searching for a product that will work.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who has had many years of over plucking.</li>
            <li>I will be buying on the regular until my eyebrows are perfect without any pencil</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell of herbs.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied with Perfect Brow and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased I am that a product that came as a free gift is so effective.</li>
            <li>From there on in, they just kept getting better and better.</li>
            <li>Taking vitamins that support healthy hair growth doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li>Ordered another because my eyebrows are tore up from the floor up and will probably take more than one pot to fix them.</li>
            <li>Hopefully in a couple of more months I can see even more improvement.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more as soon as this one runs out.</li>
            <li>and after about 6 weeks I noticed that my eyebrows were more symmetrical and even fuller than before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unusual to say that eyebrows are attractive, but I now think that about my eyebrows :)</li>
            <li>Perhaps more time is needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to report that this product works, which is why I wanted to leave a review.</li>
            <li>Its like a brown paste oil(not sure how to describe it)</li>
            <li>it came with all over my brows and mostly in the areas</li>
            <li>and I am much, much more confident about the way they look.</li>
            <li>I finally found the best way to apply it was with the tip of my pinky finger.</li>
            <li>and my expectations were greater than my results.</li>
            <li>There should also be a better way to apply because I felt</li>
            <li>I have been using this more almost two months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen improvements after 2 weeks of using: more hair, darker, healthier.</li>
            <li>I could tell Perfect Brows was different from the moment I opened the jar—that spicy scent had me at hello.</li>
            <li>I over plucked for many years and needed a solution to regrow my brows</li>
            <li>I think i might see some results, but I can&#x27;t be sure yet.  </li>
            <li>Im sure that is just the oils stimulation the blood circulation or something though</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it takes more time</li>
            <li>I even emailed the seller to make sure I was using it correctly.</li>
            <li>Better off taking Biotin supplements</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product!</li>
            <li>I do really like it!!!!.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to have an all in one product to use to thicken my over tweezed brows.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be a long time user of Perfect Brows growth balm.</li>
            <li>Hormones were all perfect and after months of taking Biotin my hair on my head has grown in long</li>
            <li>I am beyond excited!</li>
            <li>I love that Perfect Brows balm is made from high quality natural ingredients and contains so many vitamins.  </li>
            <li>I also love the scent – some sweet geranium and herbs, smells like sophisticated product.  </li>
            <li>I did listen to him and I am in love with my eyebrows now and the best thing about this product is that it is cheaper than most of the products I would usually buy.</li>
            <li>Other than that I would not be able to honestly give it any stars!!</li>
            <li>I had no hair on the tail of my brows and now they are getting so full!</li>
            <li>I love touching my brows because they feel so much thicker!!</li>
            <li>Now I notice that I need to get the clean up wax about every 1.5 months which shows that my brows are growing more.</li>
            <li>The smell does not bother me and It has been easy with a Q</li>
            <li>The extracts absorb into brows easily and leave it feeling moisturized and growing.</li>
            <li>I think it is easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a strong Brazillian nut scent.</li>
            <li>I got nice results using this product with pretty good new brow hair growth.</li>
            <li>The seller is fine.</li>
            <li>I pulled out a picture I took when I first started using Perfect Brows, for reference, and there was definitely some growth there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She has used many products before with some degree of improvement but the ease of use, pleasant smell and results she got from this product (and the low price!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super excited to see the progress in a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li>Item received on time and product discription was accurate.</li>
            <li>I started using it 6 weeks ago when I got a tube as a free gift with purchase.</li>
            <li>It has some herbal and honey scent which I enjoy a lot.</li>
            <li>No growth from product, but did enjoy the moisture I recieved from using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to keep it from the eyes while applying it.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a cheap product either.</li>
            <li>This product has filled in all the bald spots and has made my eyebrows fuller.  </li>
            <li>I have light brown eyebrows</li>
            <li>No growth after two months, but enjoy the color/filler aspect.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t go on smoothly at all.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a cheap purchase.</li>
            <li>she even threw in a free hair growth bottle</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Ok that was a step in the right direction I thought and maybe this was indeed doing some work on my brows.</li>
            <li>I have tried soooo many other products and none of them seem to work as great as this one does, I will be buying from them again</li>
            <li>Of course you&#x27;re going to see brow growth after 2 months, but who wants to wait 2 months for them to grow!!!</li>
            <li>Very strong smell but actually somehow nice.</li>
            <li>I bought Perfect Brows balm after comparing the ingredients and price of other comparable eyebrow treatments, and decided that this balm was the right choice.  </li>
            <li>It also just makes my eyebrows a bit sticky, but it really smells nice and sweet.</li>
            <li>I can definitely notice a difference, smells amazing !</li>
            <li>sometimes so I will persevere although unless there is a significant growth after I have finished the bottle</li>
            <li>product itself is worth it!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure it&#x27;s working - causing eyebrow hairs to grow.  </li>
            <li>I got with the original....</li>
            <li>It gave me hope I will be able to reshape my brows (a lady (&amp;#34;well experimented&amp;#34;) &amp;#34;took</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, I dont usually write reviews on things...</li>
            <li>I would return this product but we don&#x27;t have the original packaging</li>
            <li>The Perfect Brows Growth Accelerator solves almost every issue of growing back even stubborn eyebrows, and it is even helpful for those with sensitive skin or allergies.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product because of the overwhelming number of positive reviews</li>
            <li>Very Good product ,i can see my eyebrow growing and also it gives a nice brown colour ,very healthy ingredients specially formulated for hair growth, will defenely purchase again of course in a year time because that long will last me based on the amount ,so glad that I finally find the right product</li>
            <li>Works right away!</li>
            <li>New, strong hairs are growing again and I am absolutely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Before the perfect brow balm my brows were skimpy short patches of hair that barely grew and would fall out at the slightest provocation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update my review after 2 months on that but love that there so much softer.</li>
            <li>After 4 months, I think it is safe to say this balm really works.</li>
            <li>Some people don&#x27;t like the smell of it, but I liked the natural smell that the product had.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in it are really excellent, but it’s a bit slow to be working despite all the tingling I get from it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 2 months (this is my second purchase of this product) and I am  beginning to see good results.</li>
            <li>They are full without having a unibrow.</li>
            <li>, now I have perfect thick eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has a lot of natural which is great for the overall health of your brows.</li>
            <li>I honestly think I got an old jar.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells strongly, not bad, but</li>
            <li>It took a good full year for them to come back in</li>
            <li>I purchased Perfect Brows growth ointment based on positive online reviews, and now that I’ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li>It is not a bad smell really, just strong, but it is worth it because this stuff works!</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are becoming more filled in and there is a big difference in the quality of my brows.</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s free&#x27; infomercial product, but if you&#x27;re willing to take time and commit for real results, you can&#x27;t do better.</li>
            <li>This is the only glitch I see with the product, but I&#x27;m sure the helpful customer service staff at Amazon will be more then helpful if a return is needed.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ve taken on a healthier, more vibrant color since I began using it.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a tremendous change in brows.</li>
            <li>As I’m getting older, I’m taking more of an interest in quality skincare products.  </li>
            <li>and I now have a set of wiggle worthy brows that stand out on my face instead of disappearing into the background.</li>
            <li>Luckily, she gave me the spare</li>
            <li>I love the way they look, now - this order is mainly to maintain existing growth.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results, and wanted to add my recommendation on here for the next woman looking to improve her brows.</li>
            <li>but since I felt that I was destined to spend my life with barely any eyebrows I am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>I just got my eyebrows waxed and ruined for the very first time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant to use, and I&#x27;ve been faithful about using it twice a day for about a month.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Ok, after using it for about 15 days I can see tiny new hairs growing from my eyebrows, but nothing amazing like full thickness .</li>
            <li>So happy and can&#x27;t wait to worry less about my brows and all the weekly tinting I used to do to give them shape.</li>
            <li>Fast results!!</li>
            <li>First month I saw results!</li>
            <li>but so far i&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>has made it her favorite treatment so far.</li>
            <li>I have not had success in that area with growth using this product.</li>
            <li>What I like most is that this product is all natural and is packed with the vitamins that my skin needs.</li>
            <li>Love it for being natural and soothing on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li>So nice when a product actually does what it claims to do;  I will never be without this stuff.</li>
            <li>They are becoming thicker and fuller, which is really what I wanted from this product in the first place.</li>
            <li>I have noticed my brows are thicker and the individual hairs have grown longer in length, providing a nice appearance.  </li>
            <li>Figured this was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I love the creamy texture and the smell of the natural herbs.</li>
            <li>They are becoming thicker and fuller, which is really what I wanted from this product in the first place.</li>
            <li>But, as for up until now .... it doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE --- Ok its been nearly 3 months now and no difference whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Ok its been nearly 3 months now and no difference whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I saw this product dropped a rating since I last checked and RevitaBrows ratings rose.</li>
            <li>The balm feels wonderful when applied, and the next morning, my brows are much easier to tame, so I am completely in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I noticed that they are becoming much shiny and dense, creating the effect of healthy looking eyes and face overall.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot for this item, it&#x27;s really worth it !</li>
            <li>and when I use a qtip a lot of it falls right off my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I found the easiest way to get the product on was to dip the q tip then press product on, I didn&#x27;t care for it right off the bat compared to another product I had used years ago.</li>
            <li>One my right brow</li>
            <li>The whole container lasted a good four months, and by then I was sure it had helped, because my eyebrows have not only grown back, but thicker than they were before the accident.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m barely shading in my brow any more.</li>
            <li>I had naturally beautiful and thick brows that I used to get threaded about once a month.</li>
            <li>Costs a little more, but works better and doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell like a refreshing natural lotion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it until the jar is empty for sure though!</li>
            <li>pretty inconvenience.</li>
            <li>I have had much better results than I ever thought possible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also worn this UNDERNEATH my eyebrow pencil but logically, since growth hormone is highest at night, it makes sense to nourish that growth when you go to bed.</li>
            <li>If you are willing to give it a try</li>
            <li>First product of many I have used that actually works!  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t exactly convinced that it would work, but I read a lot of the reviews on here and decided to give it a try anyway.</li>
            <li>This product is doing exactly what I purchased it for.</li>
            <li>This product has so many mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I have noticed,  however, that there has been no hair regrowth in areas that have been tweezed consistently throughout the years.</li>
            <li>Really hope this works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m barely starting to notice more fullness in growth in my eyebrows then before.</li>
            <li>i was able to noticed a big difference.  </li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written for a beauty product.</li>
            <li>When I read the ingredients though all the natural extracts seemed like they might be fairly light</li>
            <li>I would rate this higher if it didn&#x27;t come in a glass container that broke into pieces when it accidentally hit the ground.</li>
            <li>I asked several friends if they knew anything and many of them didn’t</li>
            <li>By the way it tingles at first when you put it on.</li>
            <li>I absolutely swear by this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First of all, this company is a pleasure to deal with.</li>
            <li>I had an issue with my first order, which wasn&#x27;t a fault of the seller but the fault of my mailman instead.</li>
            <li>this product works very well !</li>
            <li>However, I kept putting it on consistently</li>
            <li>When I first received it I did not think it was going to work.</li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>I only used this product two to three times a day, but its effect has surely been taking place.</li>
            <li>So I love the product and definitely see the difference</li>
            <li>I have been used for many weeks, but didn&#x27;t see a different.</li>
            <li>I mayself broke out in acne around my eyebrows for the first 2 months, I also lost eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>HOWEVER it will grow them much thicker!</li>
            <li>I purchased this item over a month ago and finally got it, which is ok because it was amazons issue not this sellers.</li>
            <li>I believe to have seen results within the first month.</li>
            <li>a few months in, hairs began popping up here and there at a surprising pace.</li>
            <li>After using this on my brows I experienced contact dermatitis all over my brow area, it&#x27;s very red, inflamed, itchy, and dry.</li>
            <li>Leaving it on overnight might have some type of positive effect.</li>
            <li>My course eyebrows feel so much softer from first use.</li>
            <li>Used the whole container exactly how I was supposed to, and nothing.</li>
            <li>I would say I&#x27;ve had more success with this than taking hair, skin and nails vitamins with other name brand eyebrow regrowth products</li>
            <li>but little by little they were waxing off more than they should have and ruining the shape each time more and more.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product consistently, twice a day, for almost 2 months and absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>This is because the consistency of the product is so thick it can actually stay within your brow hairs and cause more harm than good.</li>
            <li>:) the instructions say to apply using a qtip, but I use my fingers cause the stuff is kinda dry and crumbley</li>
            <li>I honestly see a slight difference- not buy a bunch.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought sliding this lightly colored wax type substance on my brows every day seemed silly, downright frivolous even; until the end of the first two weeks when I noticed that even before the balm went on my hairs looked a bit more filled in.</li>
            <li>Overall my eyebrows look darker, shiny and easy to brush in shape.</li>
            <li>It is dry on the top and somewhat ..</li>
            <li>I probably would... get better results if I remembered to use it every single night.</li>
            <li>I am writing this review after eight weeks of use, I will admit that I did not use it twice a day every single day, but I never missed more than one day at a time.</li>
            <li>If something miraculous happens in terms of the product doing what it claims, I will certainly update my review.</li>
            <li>I will admit, it was a very strong scent the first few times that I used it.</li>
            <li>I usually have good experiences with high rates products on amazon.</li>
            <li>About a month or so ago I added biotin and keratin to my daily vitamin routine and noticed a huge  uptake in the speed of eyebrow recovery.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference in hair growth</li>
            <li>did absolutely nothin</li>
            <li>but, just as I stated before, I don&#x27;t have a whole lot to begin with genetically</li>
            <li>When I had a couple real stubborn hairs that stuck straight out, I plucked them out and kept using the balm and they grew in correctly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pricey for it not to give you results within a month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to put on too much makeup</li>
            <li>but since I paid so much for it, I may as well use it up.  </li>
            <li>but I really believe that the reviews are phoney.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really have time like that, so i&#x27;ve been applying it to my brows before bed and leave it on until morning.</li>
            <li>so bothersome, and i really wish this product worked to darken the hair, but c&#x27;est la vie.</li>
            <li>After years of doing the whole skinny brows the trend changes to fuller brows.</li>
            <li>I have very sparse eyebrows, nothing on the ends (over plucking as a teenager)  </li>
            <li>This accelerator has my eyebrows much fuller.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>really recxommend this balm</li>
            <li>I am really eager to get started and gain some progress.</li>
            <li>This helps stimulate the area, but it has not helped growth as fast as it says.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows, seemed to just be growing in patches with this and not in the whole eyebrow area.  </li>
            <li>It grew very well in the front ends of my eyebrows-</li>
            <li>The smell of very offputting.  </li>
            <li>but I wasn’t&#x27; ready to admit to myself</li>
            <li>Really working.</li>
            <li>Been a month, seeing real progress.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have darker and fuller eyebrows thanks to this product</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know yet if this product really works.  </li>
            <li>It probably started growing sooner than that, but that was when it really became noticeable.</li>
            <li>Or is it a result of me applying too much?</li>
            <li>Any answers would be greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>However, because of the reasonable price, and the all-natural ingredients, I decided to try it.    </li>
            <li>I really like the tingling feeling and the smell.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really tried that one.</li>
            <li>The only thing it helped me do was become more cognizant about not tweezing so frequently.</li>
            <li>I clicked on a bunch of the positive reviews and discovered that, in most cases, the people doing the review had no other product reviews, only the one for this product.</li>
            <li>been using only once a day since June 4th and look how much progress already!!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just going to keep using this because it&#x27;s just part of my routine now, feels good and makes my now soft brows lay flat and properly.</li>
            <li>But I was willing to live with it for thicker brow hair</li>
            <li>While my eyebrows grew back, I wasn&#x27;t sure entirely how much it was thanks to this rather than just my body, at first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m half way through my first jar and there&#x27;s a very noticeable difference!!!!</li>
            <li>During the two months I did not use tweezers, I only used the eyebrow razor to clean up the hairs that were obviously very out of place.</li>
            <li>I have found other products like Godfrey products on Amazon to work better.</li>
            <li>The product has worked okay, but not according to my expectations from other online reviews.</li>
            <li>The product needs time to work, but if you wait and use it long enough, it’ll definitely make your eyebrows look great again.</li>
            <li>I now have NORMAL eye brows!</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are nearly back to their original shape and glory.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure that many of the reviews on here are fake.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other brow treatments and never saw results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly confident that after several more months of using this product, I bet they will either be to my desired result, or they will at least be to the point that they are as full and as thick as I want and the most I would need to do is either tint them a darker color, or pencil them in every day for the simple fact that they may be too light.</li>
            <li>It spreads nicely so it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>, I dont mind the smell but its pretty strong and bothersome for putting on at night because it&#x27;s hard to sleep when you keep smelling a super pungent smell on your face.</li>
            <li>I was leery at first because I wasn&#x27;t seeing results super quickly (but I&#x27;m impatient) yet after putting my photos together</li>
            <li>You could really see new hair growing where she hasn’t had much in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although this seemed to arrive as a VERY old product, kind of dried up.</li>
            <li>you’re willing to feed your brows every day and be patient with them while they adjust naturally, this is just the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna</li>
            <li>Pretty wild reviews I thought.  </li>
            <li>Nothing to do with not having enough or them not being the right shape but for the simple fact that they&#x27;re too light.</li>
            <li>Not as good just a little hair grew but not enough</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad that this balm wasn&#x27;t one of those things that said it was not good enough to be true, because it really is.</li>
            <li>In fact, it actually did the opposite of what it promised, it caused me to lose more eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li>I honestly do not feel it was worth the price I paid and not being able to see results.</li>
            <li>Came in DRY, don&#x27;t understand why the brush comes with it if I barely was able to scoop it with my finger</li>
            <li>so I bought this product with high hopes.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The first few times it went fine</li>
            <li>So far it doesn&#x27;t make too much difference on my brows...</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t review items.</li>
            <li>Sure a few hairs grew in but nothing like what the description says.</li>
            <li>Personally, this wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it consistently (for the simple reason that I didn&#x27;t give it too much credit</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price even though the jar is tiny.</li>
            <li>Is this normal?</li>
            <li>and so my eyebrows pretty much stopped growing, this definitely works.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say when I first noticed a change, but writing this review on January 13, 2015, I can say that my eyebrows are back to normal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unfortunate because I don&#x27;t have very much to begin with, but I&#x27;m slightly OCD in the sense that I want everything perfect.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell of full results yet, But after only using for a couple of weeks can already see new growth in areas that have been severely over plucked for years.</li>
            <li>The last time (about a year ago, they nearly waxed off half my eyebrows...and then went on to assure me that all was fine!!</li>
            <li>and well this lady took off more than half of my eyebrow because she said the think brow was in!</li>
            <li>My eyebrows started looking healthier very quickly, and after a few weeks I noticed how fast my eyebrows seemed to be growing.  </li>
            <li>but right at my arch, it would not grow back).</li>
            <li>I drew my brows on for years because they wouldn&#x27;t grow back right.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take them weeks to get back to me either, they responded right away.</li>
            <li>A mixture of flowers, herbs, and honey worthy of any spa professional has resulted in my eyebrows coming back in nice and thick, just like when I was young.</li>
            <li>I kept trying to be patient and hoping that they would grow back and in the meantime, I had to pretty much draw them on completely because they were non-existent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it will grow new eyebrows.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are fuller and I&#x27;m seeing new hair growth.</li>
            <li>I have not notice not one new hair.</li>
            <li>and I can see new hair growth in the beginning of my brows and my brows look fuller and darker.</li>
            <li>Hopefully she will be more careful about over-plucking in the future!</li>
            <li>It only has been a couple of weeks, can&#x27;t really say much about it yet.</li>
            <li>I use it not only to give them a little more depth, a little more volume and to darken them.</li>
            <li>It made a small amount of difference - maybe if I used it twice a day it would work better.</li>
            <li>I did use it religiously night and day to be exact.</li>
            <li>A few weeks in, I noticed my eyebrows were becoming smoother and shinier, and</li>
            <li>but after the first 2 weeks i can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li>so far nahhhh!</li>
            <li>Hair will grow back just have to be consistent.</li>
            <li>but I decided to try a full second jar before I made my final decision.</li>
            <li>My brows looked gradually more nourished, conditioned, and full week after week and slowly the bare spots in them got smaller and smaller until I couldn&#x27;t really tell where they had been anymore.</li>
            <li>I started looking for something to help them grow back, and this had plenty of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 7 months and about half of the bottle is still left too :)</li>
            <li>This actually comes down to your own personal DNA structure.  </li>
            <li>This actually comes down to your own personal DNA structure.  </li>
            <li>The product needs time to work, probably a few weeks, but if you wait and use it long enough, it’ll definitely make your eyebrows look great again.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT: you might want to apply this with a q tip because if its still on your fingers a little bit</li>
            <li>Starting out my eyebrows were very sparse from over tweezing when I was in my teens and early twenties.</li>
            <li>As far as making them grow, it really hasn&#x27;t done that, though I only have been using maybe 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Clearly others in my life had noticed them too and it was time for me to do something about them.</li>
            <li>So far I see a difference.</li>
            <li>Take it from a born skeptic and give this product a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised as I have.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised at how well this worked.</li>
            <li>i really do hope it works, will be back here for areview update.</li>
            <li>I think it was an old product that they passed on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a considerable eyebrow growth since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>The 3 stars are for the moisture that my brows got from the quality (all natural) ingredients used in the  product.</li>
            <li>and I have been so amazed with the results so far.</li>
            <li>By the time I hit forty years old, my eyebrows had gotten even thinner</li>
            <li>Did not work so far.</li>
            <li>I do have before and after photos if anyone wants to see them, and you can definitely tell there is no difference in growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My eyebrow hair is growing back much healthier than before.</li>
            <li>where near done with the jar but have seen noticable improvement.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and  there is no irritation</li>
            <li>, I can tell it is already beginning to help my eyebrows appear fuller and darker, and has nearly eliminated the need for me to pencil in my eyebrows to darken them.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t give a complete review.  </li>
            <li>Smells natural and herbal.</li>
            <li>I am not yet finished with the second jar, but it really did it.</li>
            <li>I do want to note that it did not bring back much if any color and my eyebrows are gray and dye resistant.</li>
            <li>stated, this product does not offer miraculous results in a week because the ingredients are all natural.  </li>
            <li>use nothing but all natural products on my skin and hair, plus vitamin E and Castor for my lashes.  </li>
            <li>it is my natural color.  </li>
            <li>balm is everything I wanted when I set out to buy something to help restore my ailing brows to their old glamor.</li>
            <li>Old product I guess.  </li>
            <li>So far I have seen my eyebrows become fuller.</li>
            <li>I then tried to grow them out, and they did over time naturally</li>
            <li>I believe its been 8-10 years now since my eyebrows have completely stopped growing.  </li>

            <li>Improve Thinning Eyebrows with this Natural Treatment Enriched with Provitamin B5, Vitamins A &amp; E</li>
            <li>I used to pluck the life out of my eyebrows and now I really want to.grow them back.</li>
            <li>So finding out about this product, about how it makes the eyebrows grow fuller thicker and has natural ingredients, I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>No results so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised by the reviews, will post again but</li>
            <li>After a month I notice that my brows were naturally darker.</li>
            <li>On top of it all, I emailed Green Touch Beauty about my issue and received no such reply.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this product for a few more weeks, as I still have plenty of it left.</li>
            <li>, they look a lot more natural and thick.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows look twice as thick and they feel really healthy.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical at first and didn&#x27;t think it would work this good</li>
            <li>My advice if you are contemplating using this would be: Don&#x27;t expect an overnight miracle, eyebrow regrowth is a slow, painstaking process that can take a year or more</li>
            <li>They are filling in slowly but surely.  </li>
            <li>After the minor burns were taken care of, my eyebrows were, more or less, gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second product and still seeing new growth!</li>
            <li>Finally my brows look decent.</li>
            <li>Not working yet, been using for about 4-5 weeks, hoping for some decent results sooner then later!</li>
            <li>Will keep using it until I run out which may be long time since its a large jar.</li>
            <li>So far I have only seen a couple of new hairs in my brow line.  </li>
            <li>so I cant say much about long term, but I can already see  a difference.</li>
            <li>I was using another product, a serum, that was a part of my normal facial routine.</li>
            <li>I have one prefect full eyebrow and one with a few bald spots from pencil shading.</li>
            <li>Green Touch has been extremely helpful and kind to me during an order mishap which she graciously remedied, and sent a gift which included a decadent facial oil that is to die for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the icing on the cake was when I noticed tiny new bald spots in my eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li>I am in my 50&#x27;s and finding not only have my brows are turning grey, they have been thinning out pretty rapidly too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m making my third order, and I almost look like a different person, my brows have grown so much thicker.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t love it because it worked for the first month with pretty slow results and, when I hit the second month using this product, it seemed to have worked less and less with no major noticeable difference from the first month.</li>
            <li>but I fear it will not due to severely damaged hair follicles.</li>
            <li>Caused major irritation have to return</li>
            <li>but I have one major concern.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how you keep this on your eyebrows as it is so oddly textured and doesn&#x27;t sit right.</li>
            <li>the new formula with the cocoa is super hard to use...</li>
            <li>The little tingle you feel when applied is well worth it when you start to see the results.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s generally when I apply.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working well so far I&#x27;ve only been using it a while I wish I would&#x27;ve known about this years ago</li>
            <li>and I never expected there would be.</li>
            <li>apparently the restoration is happening from the inside out to the edges.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 26 years old</li>
            <li>I overplucked my eyebrows to many times thinking thin</li>
            <li>I usually make my own eyelash/eyebrow growth serum with multiple oils including coconut, avocado, argan, joba joba, jamacain black castor, and vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>There was some obvious new growth and what was left of my eyebrows were growing in faster.</li>
            <li>.. Seems pretty odd.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t really work and it stings the eyes due to the smell.</li>
            <li>,I really must check your other products.thank you</li>
            <li>I purchased after reading other positive reviews but no such luck for me.</li>
            <li>This is kind of sad especially for the cost.</li>
            <li>All positive reviews for this product are fake- all written in same grammatical style, all similar tone, similar punctuation, mostly all written in blocks on the same day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks now and my eyebrows have definitely grown back to what they were previously before over tweezing them, and even a little more.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading all the positive reviews and the fact that it had natural ingredients, but when I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference to my naked eyes within a few weeks, I tried to send it back.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are not soft and brown like they were when I was a  young man</li>
            <li>Thanks, but no thanks!!</li>
            <li>Not a single extra hair grows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from sparse eyebrows since high school due to over-plucking.</li>
            <li>The product is dry and seems old.</li>
            <li>Although it goes on dark, it doesn&#x27;t really matter because you tissue it off within ten minutes or so, per the instructions.</li>
            <li>Is this actually a positive thing (getting rid of the dead follicles?)?</li>
            <li>It’s pretty difficult to see the results right away, but I continued to see what would happen.</li>
            <li>resell?I did loose out on the return postage of nearly $7.00.</li>
            <li>resell?I did loose out on the return postage of nearly $7.00.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 5 months and about half of the bottle is still left too, but that’s because I don’t use too much of it.</li>
            <li>Over all I have never gone this long without trying to shape my eyebrows so it is hard to judge whether or not the product had any true effect to the growth.</li>
            <li>And I use the product every other day just because my skin is very sensitive to anything, but this product hasn&#x27;t caused sensetivity.</li>
            <li>Now what I will give a try is the original eyebrow cure...which is the TROPIC ISLE LIVING JAMAICAN BLACK CASTOR OIL which is sold here on AMAZON for only a few dollars for 4 OZ.  </li>

            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Despite now having exactly the kind of eyebrows I wanted, I think I will continue to apply Perfect Brows Balm once or twice a week to maintain that look.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> (I prefer to sleep longer in the morning, to be honest), but</li>
            <li> And I kind of like the scent.  </li>
            <li> It’s really nice.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows haven&#x27;t looked this nice in years—</li>
            <li> No noticeable improvement with eyebrow growth however, it is a nice balm.</li>
            <li> My own serum seems to produce faster results and doesn&#x27;t have an off-putting smell.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> It’s important to me that I know a product works well before i recommend it to others, and I’ve confidently recommended Perfect Brows balm to anyone who asks me what they can do to help their eyebrows look better.  </li>
            <li> This is one product that I can honestly say works as described.</li>
            <li> product has a nice citrus scent,  </li>
            <li> I gave it one star because it does smell nice.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kind of a trigger to help me fall asleep.</li>
            <li> IF the hair follicles are healthy and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using this for 2 + weeks and loving the results.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice, and the included applicator is convenient.</li>
            <li> The jar is a nice size.</li>
            <li> It is also a great and considerate company that really takes care of their customers with great customer service.</li>
            <li> It smells nice too.  </li>
            <li> great product really active ingredients inside for the money, and great value well works awesome and will be buying some more from this store.</li>
            <li> Also, somebody please post a comparison between Eyebrow Growth Accelerator Balm PERFECT BROWS compared to NEW!</li>
            <li> I loved the original formula!...</li>
            <li> Great for gifts or use of yourself, priced right!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to recover from over plucking/over waxing -- All the best, I know your pain all too well and can say that this is a good safe product to stick with to help your body recover naturally over time.</li>
            <li> After using a full jar of this product I was somewhat happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I tried Perfect Brows Growth Accelerator Balm after reading reviews online, because I was looking for a new eyebrow growth treatment I could recommend to my clients.  </li>
            <li> I work as a brow and lash technician, so I know how important it is to many people to have great looking eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> They were more than happy to send me another product, free of charge.</li>
            <li> It is not yet substantial but every day I notice more and more hairs growing in!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to everyone as it is cheap and a good product.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a accelerator and went with the Perfect Brows Growth Balm because it is a natural and botanical  product.</li>
            <li> i &#x27;m about halfway through the jar (and by the way the stuff is really fun - great texture,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want top spend my own money.</li>
            <li> The hairs on my brows are growing but very light.</li>
            <li> What I did like was the fact that the product was tinted and easy to apply and smelled nice…spicy but nice nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I realized there is a huge difference already!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that I can get them to the point so that they will look more like they did before I started tweezing them altogether.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping with the more time that this product will continue to help and continue to make them grow faster, thicker, darker.</li>
            <li> and so after about 4 weeks I am really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I’m glad I have it now, and I don’t plan to stop.</li>
            <li> Glad it works for some people, wish I had been one of them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite light, it&#x27;s a serum!</li>
            <li> Another thing I love is that it&#x27;s not waxy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always felt my face would look a lot better</li>
            <li> Not like Magic</li>
            <li> my eyebrows are looking better, fuller, darker than they have in years.</li>
            <li> Smells really, really great too, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> All of them reviewed only their two product :-D</li>
            <li> I mostly found use in this product by applying it</li>
            <li> had to use it consistently​ for a month 2 times a day but my eye brows grew back :) so happy with the results!!!</li>
            <li> My brows have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I am applying it twice a day on most days, although some days I forget.</li>
            <li> Using a growth accelerator balm like Perfect Brows can eliminate the need for eyebrow tinting or drawing eyebrows in, and I can definitely tell the difference in my clients who are using this product and those who aren’t.  </li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t HAVE to fill them in with makeup to leave the house anymore.</li>
            <li> I am very happy how it worked for me growing back over plucked spots.  </li>
            <li> Regardless I&#x27;m pleased with the results thus far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No issues love the product will be buying more of this soon...</li>
            <li> at the same time the perfect amount.</li>
            <li> Like many I over-plucked my eyebrows as a teenager and have been searching for a product that will work.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has had many years of over plucking.</li>
            <li> I will be buying on the regular until my eyebrows are perfect without any pencil</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell of herbs.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied with Perfect Brow and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased I am that a product that came as a free gift is so effective.</li>
            <li> From there on in, they just kept getting better and better.</li>
            <li> Taking vitamins that support healthy hair growth doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> Ordered another because my eyebrows are tore up from the floor up and will probably take more than one pot to fix them.</li>
            <li> Hopefully in a couple of more months I can see even more improvement.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more as soon as this one runs out.</li>
            <li> and after about 6 weeks I noticed that my eyebrows were more symmetrical and even fuller than before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unusual to say that eyebrows are attractive, but I now think that about my eyebrows :)</li>
            <li> Perhaps more time is needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased to report that this product works, which is why I wanted to leave a review.</li>
            <li> Its like a brown paste oil(not sure how to describe it)</li>
            <li> it came with all over my brows and mostly in the areas</li>
            <li> and I am much, much more confident about the way they look.</li>
            <li> I finally found the best way to apply it was with the tip of my pinky finger.</li>
            <li> and my expectations were greater than my results.</li>
            <li> There should also be a better way to apply because I felt</li>
            <li> I have been using this more almost two months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen improvements after 2 weeks of using: more hair, darker, healthier.</li>
            <li> I could tell Perfect Brows was different from the moment I opened the jar—that spicy scent had me at hello.</li>
            <li> I over plucked for many years and needed a solution to regrow my brows</li>
            <li> I think i might see some results, but I can&#x27;t be sure yet.  </li>
            <li> Im sure that is just the oils stimulation the blood circulation or something though</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it takes more time</li>
            <li> I even emailed the seller to make sure I was using it correctly.</li>
            <li> Better off taking Biotin supplements</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product!</li>
            <li> I do really like it!!!!.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to have an all in one product to use to thicken my over tweezed brows.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be a long time user of Perfect Brows growth balm.</li>
            <li> Hormones were all perfect and after months of taking Biotin my hair on my head has grown in long</li>
            <li> I am beyond excited!</li>
            <li> I love that Perfect Brows balm is made from high quality natural ingredients and contains so many vitamins.  </li>
            <li> I also love the scent – some sweet geranium and herbs, smells like sophisticated product.  </li>
            <li> I did listen to him and I am in love with my eyebrows now and the best thing about this product is that it is cheaper than most of the products I would usually buy.</li>
            <li> Other than that I would not be able to honestly give it any stars!!</li>
            <li> I had no hair on the tail of my brows and now they are getting so full!</li>
            <li> I love touching my brows because they feel so much thicker!!</li>
            <li> Now I notice that I need to get the clean up wax about every 1.5 months which shows that my brows are growing more.</li>
            <li> The smell does not bother me and It has been easy with a Q</li>
            <li> The extracts absorb into brows easily and leave it feeling moisturized and growing.</li>
            <li> I think it is easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a strong Brazillian nut scent.</li>
            <li> I got nice results using this product with pretty good new brow hair growth.</li>
            <li> The seller is fine.</li>
            <li> I pulled out a picture I took when I first started using Perfect Brows, for reference, and there was definitely some growth there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She has used many products before with some degree of improvement but the ease of use, pleasant smell and results she got from this product (and the low price!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super excited to see the progress in a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li> Item received on time and product discription was accurate.</li>
            <li> I started using it 6 weeks ago when I got a tube as a free gift with purchase.</li>
            <li> It has some herbal and honey scent which I enjoy a lot.</li>
            <li> No growth from product, but did enjoy the moisture I recieved from using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to keep it from the eyes while applying it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a cheap product either.</li>
            <li> This product has filled in all the bald spots and has made my eyebrows fuller.  </li>
            <li> I have light brown eyebrows</li>
            <li> No growth after two months, but enjoy the color/filler aspect.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t go on smoothly at all.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a cheap purchase.</li>
            <li> she even threw in a free hair growth bottle</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Ok that was a step in the right direction I thought and maybe this was indeed doing some work on my brows.</li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many other products and none of them seem to work as great as this one does, I will be buying from them again</li>
            <li> Of course you&#x27;re going to see brow growth after 2 months, but who wants to wait 2 months for them to grow!!!</li>
            <li> Very strong smell but actually somehow nice.</li>
            <li> I bought Perfect Brows balm after comparing the ingredients and price of other comparable eyebrow treatments, and decided that this balm was the right choice.  </li>
            <li> It also just makes my eyebrows a bit sticky, but it really smells nice and sweet.</li>
            <li> I can definitely notice a difference, smells amazing !</li>
            <li> sometimes so I will persevere although unless there is a significant growth after I have finished the bottle</li>
            <li> product itself is worth it!</li>
            <li> Pretty sure it&#x27;s working - causing eyebrow hairs to grow.  </li>
            <li> I got with the original....</li>
            <li> It gave me hope I will be able to reshape my brows (a lady (&amp;#34;well experimented&amp;#34;) &amp;#34;took</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I dont usually write reviews on things...</li>
            <li> I would return this product but we don&#x27;t have the original packaging</li>
            <li> The Perfect Brows Growth Accelerator solves almost every issue of growing back even stubborn eyebrows, and it is even helpful for those with sensitive skin or allergies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product because of the overwhelming number of positive reviews</li>
            <li> Very Good product ,i can see my eyebrow growing and also it gives a nice brown colour ,very healthy ingredients specially formulated for hair growth, will defenely purchase again of course in a year time because that long will last me based on the amount ,so glad that I finally find the right product</li>
            <li> Works right away!</li>
            <li> New, strong hairs are growing again and I am absolutely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Before the perfect brow balm my brows were skimpy short patches of hair that barely grew and would fall out at the slightest provocation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update my review after 2 months on that but love that there so much softer.</li>
            <li> After 4 months, I think it is safe to say this balm really works.</li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t like the smell of it, but I liked the natural smell that the product had.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in it are really excellent, but it’s a bit slow to be working despite all the tingling I get from it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 months (this is my second purchase of this product) and I am  beginning to see good results.</li>
            <li> They are full without having a unibrow.</li>
            <li> , now I have perfect thick eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has a lot of natural which is great for the overall health of your brows.</li>
            <li> I honestly think I got an old jar.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells strongly, not bad, but</li>
            <li> It took a good full year for them to come back in</li>
            <li> I purchased Perfect Brows growth ointment based on positive online reviews, and now that I’ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It is not a bad smell really, just strong, but it is worth it because this stuff works!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are becoming more filled in and there is a big difference in the quality of my brows.</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s free&#x27; infomercial product, but if you&#x27;re willing to take time and commit for real results, you can&#x27;t do better.</li>
            <li> This is the only glitch I see with the product, but I&#x27;m sure the helpful customer service staff at Amazon will be more then helpful if a return is needed.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ve taken on a healthier, more vibrant color since I began using it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a tremendous change in brows.</li>
            <li> As I’m getting older, I’m taking more of an interest in quality skincare products.  </li>
            <li> and I now have a set of wiggle worthy brows that stand out on my face instead of disappearing into the background.</li>
            <li> Luckily, she gave me the spare</li>
            <li> I love the way they look, now - this order is mainly to maintain existing growth.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results, and wanted to add my recommendation on here for the next woman looking to improve her brows.</li>
            <li> but since I felt that I was destined to spend my life with barely any eyebrows I am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> I just got my eyebrows waxed and ruined for the very first time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant to use, and I&#x27;ve been faithful about using it twice a day for about a month.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ok, after using it for about 15 days I can see tiny new hairs growing from my eyebrows, but nothing amazing like full thickness .</li>
            <li> So happy and can&#x27;t wait to worry less about my brows and all the weekly tinting I used to do to give them shape.</li>
            <li> Fast results!!</li>
            <li> First month I saw results!</li>
            <li> but so far i&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> has made it her favorite treatment so far.</li>
            <li> I have not had success in that area with growth using this product.</li>
            <li> What I like most is that this product is all natural and is packed with the vitamins that my skin needs.</li>
            <li> Love it for being natural and soothing on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> So nice when a product actually does what it claims to do;  I will never be without this stuff.</li>
            <li> They are becoming thicker and fuller, which is really what I wanted from this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my brows are thicker and the individual hairs have grown longer in length, providing a nice appearance.  </li>
            <li> Figured this was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I love the creamy texture and the smell of the natural herbs.</li>
            <li> They are becoming thicker and fuller, which is really what I wanted from this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> But, as for up until now .... it doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE --- Ok its been nearly 3 months now and no difference whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Ok its been nearly 3 months now and no difference whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I saw this product dropped a rating since I last checked and RevitaBrows ratings rose.</li>
            <li> The balm feels wonderful when applied, and the next morning, my brows are much easier to tame, so I am completely in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I noticed that they are becoming much shiny and dense, creating the effect of healthy looking eyes and face overall.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot for this item, it&#x27;s really worth it !</li>
            <li> and when I use a qtip a lot of it falls right off my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I found the easiest way to get the product on was to dip the q tip then press product on, I didn&#x27;t care for it right off the bat compared to another product I had used years ago.</li>
            <li> One my right brow</li>
            <li> The whole container lasted a good four months, and by then I was sure it had helped, because my eyebrows have not only grown back, but thicker than they were before the accident.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m barely shading in my brow any more.</li>
            <li> I had naturally beautiful and thick brows that I used to get threaded about once a month.</li>
            <li> Costs a little more, but works better and doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell like a refreshing natural lotion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it until the jar is empty for sure though!</li>
            <li> pretty inconvenience.</li>
            <li> I have had much better results than I ever thought possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also worn this UNDERNEATH my eyebrow pencil but logically, since growth hormone is highest at night, it makes sense to nourish that growth when you go to bed.</li>
            <li> If you are willing to give it a try</li>
            <li> First product of many I have used that actually works!  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t exactly convinced that it would work, but I read a lot of the reviews on here and decided to give it a try anyway.</li>
            <li> This product is doing exactly what I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> This product has so many mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I have noticed,  however, that there has been no hair regrowth in areas that have been tweezed consistently throughout the years.</li>
            <li> Really hope this works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m barely starting to notice more fullness in growth in my eyebrows then before.</li>
            <li> i was able to noticed a big difference.  </li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written for a beauty product.</li>
            <li> When I read the ingredients though all the natural extracts seemed like they might be fairly light</li>
            <li> I would rate this higher if it didn&#x27;t come in a glass container that broke into pieces when it accidentally hit the ground.</li>
            <li> I asked several friends if they knew anything and many of them didn’t</li>
            <li> By the way it tingles at first when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely swear by this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First of all, this company is a pleasure to deal with.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with my first order, which wasn&#x27;t a fault of the seller but the fault of my mailman instead.</li>
            <li> this product works very well !</li>
            <li> However, I kept putting it on consistently</li>
            <li> When I first received it I did not think it was going to work.</li>
            <li> Really works!  </li>
            <li> I only used this product two to three times a day, but its effect has surely been taking place.</li>
            <li> So I love the product and definitely see the difference</li>
            <li> I have been used for many weeks, but didn&#x27;t see a different.</li>
            <li> I mayself broke out in acne around my eyebrows for the first 2 months, I also lost eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> HOWEVER it will grow them much thicker!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item over a month ago and finally got it, which is ok because it was amazons issue not this sellers.</li>
            <li> I believe to have seen results within the first month.</li>
            <li> a few months in, hairs began popping up here and there at a surprising pace.</li>
            <li> After using this on my brows I experienced contact dermatitis all over my brow area, it&#x27;s very red, inflamed, itchy, and dry.</li>
            <li> Leaving it on overnight might have some type of positive effect.</li>
            <li> My course eyebrows feel so much softer from first use.</li>
            <li> Used the whole container exactly how I was supposed to, and nothing.</li>
            <li> I would say I&#x27;ve had more success with this than taking hair, skin and nails vitamins with other name brand eyebrow regrowth products</li>
            <li> but little by little they were waxing off more than they should have and ruining the shape each time more and more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product consistently, twice a day, for almost 2 months and absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> This is because the consistency of the product is so thick it can actually stay within your brow hairs and cause more harm than good.</li>
            <li> :) the instructions say to apply using a qtip, but I use my fingers cause the stuff is kinda dry and crumbley</li>
            <li> I honestly see a slight difference- not buy a bunch.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought sliding this lightly colored wax type substance on my brows every day seemed silly, downright frivolous even; until the end of the first two weeks when I noticed that even before the balm went on my hairs looked a bit more filled in.</li>
            <li> Overall my eyebrows look darker, shiny and easy to brush in shape.</li>
            <li> It is dry on the top and somewhat ..</li>
            <li> I probably would... get better results if I remembered to use it every single night.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review after eight weeks of use, I will admit that I did not use it twice a day every single day, but I never missed more than one day at a time.</li>
            <li> If something miraculous happens in terms of the product doing what it claims, I will certainly update my review.</li>
            <li> I will admit, it was a very strong scent the first few times that I used it.</li>
            <li> I usually have good experiences with high rates products on amazon.</li>
            <li> About a month or so ago I added biotin and keratin to my daily vitamin routine and noticed a huge  uptake in the speed of eyebrow recovery.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference in hair growth</li>
            <li> did absolutely nothin</li>
            <li> but, just as I stated before, I don&#x27;t have a whole lot to begin with genetically</li>
            <li> When I had a couple real stubborn hairs that stuck straight out, I plucked them out and kept using the balm and they grew in correctly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pricey for it not to give you results within a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to put on too much makeup</li>
            <li> but since I paid so much for it, I may as well use it up.  </li>
            <li> but I really believe that the reviews are phoney.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really have time like that, so i&#x27;ve been applying it to my brows before bed and leave it on until morning.</li>
            <li> so bothersome, and i really wish this product worked to darken the hair, but c&#x27;est la vie.</li>
            <li> After years of doing the whole skinny brows the trend changes to fuller brows.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse eyebrows, nothing on the ends (over plucking as a teenager)  </li>
            <li> This accelerator has my eyebrows much fuller.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> really recxommend this balm</li>
            <li> I am really eager to get started and gain some progress.</li>
            <li> This helps stimulate the area, but it has not helped growth as fast as it says.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows, seemed to just be growing in patches with this and not in the whole eyebrow area.  </li>
            <li> It grew very well in the front ends of my eyebrows-</li>
            <li> The smell of very offputting.  </li>
            <li> but I wasn’t&#x27; ready to admit to myself</li>
            <li> Really working.</li>
            <li> Been a month, seeing real progress.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have darker and fuller eyebrows thanks to this product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know yet if this product really works.  </li>
            <li> It probably started growing sooner than that, but that was when it really became noticeable.</li>
            <li> Or is it a result of me applying too much?</li>
            <li> Any answers would be greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> However, because of the reasonable price, and the all-natural ingredients, I decided to try it.    </li>
            <li> I really like the tingling feeling and the smell.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t really tried that one.</li>
            <li> The only thing it helped me do was become more cognizant about not tweezing so frequently.</li>
            <li> I clicked on a bunch of the positive reviews and discovered that, in most cases, the people doing the review had no other product reviews, only the one for this product.</li>
            <li> been using only once a day since June 4th and look how much progress already!!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just going to keep using this because it&#x27;s just part of my routine now, feels good and makes my now soft brows lay flat and properly.</li>
            <li> But I was willing to live with it for thicker brow hair</li>
            <li> While my eyebrows grew back, I wasn&#x27;t sure entirely how much it was thanks to this rather than just my body, at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half way through my first jar and there&#x27;s a very noticeable difference!!!!</li>
            <li> During the two months I did not use tweezers, I only used the eyebrow razor to clean up the hairs that were obviously very out of place.</li>
            <li> I have found other products like Godfrey products on Amazon to work better.</li>
            <li> The product has worked okay, but not according to my expectations from other online reviews.</li>
            <li> The product needs time to work, but if you wait and use it long enough, it’ll definitely make your eyebrows look great again.</li>
            <li> I now have NORMAL eye brows!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are nearly back to their original shape and glory.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure that many of the reviews on here are fake.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other brow treatments and never saw results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly confident that after several more months of using this product, I bet they will either be to my desired result, or they will at least be to the point that they are as full and as thick as I want and the most I would need to do is either tint them a darker color, or pencil them in every day for the simple fact that they may be too light.</li>
            <li> It spreads nicely so it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> , I dont mind the smell but its pretty strong and bothersome for putting on at night because it&#x27;s hard to sleep when you keep smelling a super pungent smell on your face.</li>
            <li> I was leery at first because I wasn&#x27;t seeing results super quickly (but I&#x27;m impatient) yet after putting my photos together</li>
            <li> You could really see new hair growing where she hasn’t had much in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although this seemed to arrive as a VERY old product, kind of dried up.</li>
            <li> you’re willing to feed your brows every day and be patient with them while they adjust naturally, this is just the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna</li>
            <li> Pretty wild reviews I thought.  </li>
            <li> Nothing to do with not having enough or them not being the right shape but for the simple fact that they&#x27;re too light.</li>
            <li> Not as good just a little hair grew but not enough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad that this balm wasn&#x27;t one of those things that said it was not good enough to be true, because it really is.</li>
            <li> In fact, it actually did the opposite of what it promised, it caused me to lose more eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> I honestly do not feel it was worth the price I paid and not being able to see results.</li>
            <li> Came in DRY, don&#x27;t understand why the brush comes with it if I barely was able to scoop it with my finger</li>
            <li> so I bought this product with high hopes.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The first few times it went fine</li>
            <li> So far it doesn&#x27;t make too much difference on my brows...</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t review items.</li>
            <li> Sure a few hairs grew in but nothing like what the description says.</li>
            <li> Personally, this wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it consistently (for the simple reason that I didn&#x27;t give it too much credit</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price even though the jar is tiny.</li>
            <li> Is this normal?</li>
            <li> and so my eyebrows pretty much stopped growing, this definitely works.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say when I first noticed a change, but writing this review on January 13, 2015, I can say that my eyebrows are back to normal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate because I don&#x27;t have very much to begin with, but I&#x27;m slightly OCD in the sense that I want everything perfect.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell of full results yet, But after only using for a couple of weeks can already see new growth in areas that have been severely over plucked for years.</li>
            <li> The last time (about a year ago, they nearly waxed off half my eyebrows...and then went on to assure me that all was fine!!</li>
            <li> and well this lady took off more than half of my eyebrow because she said the think brow was in!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows started looking healthier very quickly, and after a few weeks I noticed how fast my eyebrows seemed to be growing.  </li>
            <li> but right at my arch, it would not grow back).</li>
            <li> I drew my brows on for years because they wouldn&#x27;t grow back right.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take them weeks to get back to me either, they responded right away.</li>
            <li> A mixture of flowers, herbs, and honey worthy of any spa professional has resulted in my eyebrows coming back in nice and thick, just like when I was young.</li>
            <li> I kept trying to be patient and hoping that they would grow back and in the meantime, I had to pretty much draw them on completely because they were non-existent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will grow new eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are fuller and I&#x27;m seeing new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I have not notice not one new hair.</li>
            <li> and I can see new hair growth in the beginning of my brows and my brows look fuller and darker.</li>
            <li> Hopefully she will be more careful about over-plucking in the future!</li>
            <li> It only has been a couple of weeks, can&#x27;t really say much about it yet.</li>
            <li> I use it not only to give them a little more depth, a little more volume and to darken them.</li>
            <li> It made a small amount of difference - maybe if I used it twice a day it would work better.</li>
            <li> I did use it religiously night and day to be exact.</li>
            <li> A few weeks in, I noticed my eyebrows were becoming smoother and shinier, and</li>
            <li> but after the first 2 weeks i can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> so far nahhhh!</li>
            <li> Hair will grow back just have to be consistent.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try a full second jar before I made my final decision.</li>
            <li> My brows looked gradually more nourished, conditioned, and full week after week and slowly the bare spots in them got smaller and smaller until I couldn&#x27;t really tell where they had been anymore.</li>
            <li> I started looking for something to help them grow back, and this had plenty of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 7 months and about half of the bottle is still left too :)</li>
            <li> This actually comes down to your own personal DNA structure.  </li>
            <li> This actually comes down to your own personal DNA structure.  </li>
            <li> The product needs time to work, probably a few weeks, but if you wait and use it long enough, it’ll definitely make your eyebrows look great again.</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT: you might want to apply this with a q tip because if its still on your fingers a little bit</li>
            <li> Starting out my eyebrows were very sparse from over tweezing when I was in my teens and early twenties.</li>
            <li> As far as making them grow, it really hasn&#x27;t done that, though I only have been using maybe 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Clearly others in my life had noticed them too and it was time for me to do something about them.</li>
            <li> So far I see a difference.</li>
            <li> Take it from a born skeptic and give this product a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised as I have.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised at how well this worked.</li>
            <li> i really do hope it works, will be back here for areview update.</li>
            <li> I think it was an old product that they passed on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a considerable eyebrow growth since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> The 3 stars are for the moisture that my brows got from the quality (all natural) ingredients used in the  product.</li>
            <li> and I have been so amazed with the results so far.</li>
            <li> By the time I hit forty years old, my eyebrows had gotten even thinner</li>
            <li> Did not work so far.</li>
            <li> I do have before and after photos if anyone wants to see them, and you can definitely tell there is no difference in growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyebrow hair is growing back much healthier than before.</li>
            <li> where near done with the jar but have seen noticable improvement.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and  there is no irritation</li>
            <li> , I can tell it is already beginning to help my eyebrows appear fuller and darker, and has nearly eliminated the need for me to pencil in my eyebrows to darken them.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t give a complete review.  </li>
            <li> Smells natural and herbal.</li>
            <li> I am not yet finished with the second jar, but it really did it.</li>
            <li> I do want to note that it did not bring back much if any color and my eyebrows are gray and dye resistant.</li>
            <li> stated, this product does not offer miraculous results in a week because the ingredients are all natural.  </li>
            <li> use nothing but all natural products on my skin and hair, plus vitamin E and Castor for my lashes.  </li>
            <li> it is my natural color.  </li>
            <li> balm is everything I wanted when I set out to buy something to help restore my ailing brows to their old glamor.</li>
            <li> Old product I guess.  </li>
            <li> So far I have seen my eyebrows become fuller.</li>
            <li> I then tried to grow them out, and they did over time naturally</li>
            <li> I believe its been 8-10 years now since my eyebrows have completely stopped growing.  </li>
            <li> Improve Thinning Eyebrows with this Natural Treatment Enriched with Provitamin B5, Vitamins A &amp; E</li>
            <li> Improve Thinning Eyebrows with this Natural Treatment Enriched with Provitamin B5, Vitamins A &amp; E</li>
            <li> I used to pluck the life out of my eyebrows and now I really want to.grow them back.</li>
            <li> So finding out about this product, about how it makes the eyebrows grow fuller thicker and has natural ingredients, I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> No results so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the reviews, will post again but</li>
            <li> After a month I notice that my brows were naturally darker.</li>
            <li> On top of it all, I emailed Green Touch Beauty about my issue and received no such reply.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product for a few more weeks, as I still have plenty of it left.</li>
            <li> , they look a lot more natural and thick.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look twice as thick and they feel really healthy.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first and didn&#x27;t think it would work this good</li>
            <li> My advice if you are contemplating using this would be: Don&#x27;t expect an overnight miracle, eyebrow regrowth is a slow, painstaking process that can take a year or more</li>
            <li> They are filling in slowly but surely.  </li>
            <li> After the minor burns were taken care of, my eyebrows were, more or less, gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second product and still seeing new growth!</li>
            <li> Finally my brows look decent.</li>
            <li> Not working yet, been using for about 4-5 weeks, hoping for some decent results sooner then later!</li>
            <li> Will keep using it until I run out which may be long time since its a large jar.</li>
            <li> So far I have only seen a couple of new hairs in my brow line.  </li>
            <li> so I cant say much about long term, but I can already see  a difference.</li>
            <li> I was using another product, a serum, that was a part of my normal facial routine.</li>
            <li> I have one prefect full eyebrow and one with a few bald spots from pencil shading.</li>
            <li> Green Touch has been extremely helpful and kind to me during an order mishap which she graciously remedied, and sent a gift which included a decadent facial oil that is to die for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the icing on the cake was when I noticed tiny new bald spots in my eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and finding not only have my brows are turning grey, they have been thinning out pretty rapidly too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m making my third order, and I almost look like a different person, my brows have grown so much thicker.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t love it because it worked for the first month with pretty slow results and, when I hit the second month using this product, it seemed to have worked less and less with no major noticeable difference from the first month.</li>
            <li> but I fear it will not due to severely damaged hair follicles.</li>
            <li> Caused major irritation have to return</li>
            <li> but I have one major concern.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how you keep this on your eyebrows as it is so oddly textured and doesn&#x27;t sit right.</li>
            <li> the new formula with the cocoa is super hard to use...</li>
            <li> The little tingle you feel when applied is well worth it when you start to see the results.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s generally when I apply.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well so far I&#x27;ve only been using it a while I wish I would&#x27;ve known about this years ago</li>
            <li> and I never expected there would be.</li>
            <li> apparently the restoration is happening from the inside out to the edges.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 26 years old</li>
            <li> I overplucked my eyebrows to many times thinking thin</li>
            <li> I usually make my own eyelash/eyebrow growth serum with multiple oils including coconut, avocado, argan, joba joba, jamacain black castor, and vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> There was some obvious new growth and what was left of my eyebrows were growing in faster.</li>
            <li> .. Seems pretty odd.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t really work and it stings the eyes due to the smell.</li>
            <li> ,I really must check your other products.thank you</li>
            <li> I purchased after reading other positive reviews but no such luck for me.</li>
            <li> This is kind of sad especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> All positive reviews for this product are fake- all written in same grammatical style, all similar tone, similar punctuation, mostly all written in blocks on the same day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks now and my eyebrows have definitely grown back to what they were previously before over tweezing them, and even a little more.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all the positive reviews and the fact that it had natural ingredients, but when I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference to my naked eyes within a few weeks, I tried to send it back.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are not soft and brown like they were when I was a  young man</li>
            <li> Thanks, but no thanks!!</li>
            <li> Not a single extra hair grows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from sparse eyebrows since high school due to over-plucking.</li>
            <li> The product is dry and seems old.</li>
            <li> Although it goes on dark, it doesn&#x27;t really matter because you tissue it off within ten minutes or so, per the instructions.</li>
            <li> Is this actually a positive thing (getting rid of the dead follicles?)?</li>
            <li> It’s pretty difficult to see the results right away, but I continued to see what would happen.</li>
            <li> resell?I did loose out on the return postage of nearly $7.00.</li>
            <li> resell?I did loose out on the return postage of nearly $7.00.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 months and about half of the bottle is still left too, but that’s because I don’t use too much of it.</li>
            <li> Over all I have never gone this long without trying to shape my eyebrows so it is hard to judge whether or not the product had any true effect to the growth.</li>
            <li> And I use the product every other day just because my skin is very sensitive to anything, but this product hasn&#x27;t caused sensetivity.</li>
            <li> Now what I will give a try is the original eyebrow cure...which is the TROPIC ISLE LIVING JAMAICAN BLACK CASTOR OIL which is sold here on AMAZON for only a few dollars for 4 OZ.  </li>
            <li> Now what I will give a try is the original eyebrow cure...which is the TROPIC ISLE LIVING JAMAICAN BLACK CASTOR OIL which is sold here on AMAZON for only a few dollars for 4 OZ.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve been gliding this balm over them for a few months they&#x27;ve plumped up more than I could&#x27;ve thought possible with thick roots that don&#x27;t budge when I comb them.</li>
            <li> I have the most difficult eyebrows imaginable, and this stuff really helped to tame them.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product, I was skeptical about all of the positive reviews; they all seemed written in a pretty similar style/context.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small container, but it lasts a very long time if you use it right,</li>
            <li> I have had very thin eyebrows for many years after plucking them away in highschool.</li>
            <li> Of course I was skeptical at first, but I took a chance because I really needed something to help my eyebrows a bit.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t do it right, you look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Not really sure I saw any real improvement in the brow growth?</li>
            <li> I plan to keep using this for as long as possible!</li>
            <li> So, long story short, I had an accident at a bonfire one night.</li>
            <li> And as long as the follicles aren&#x27;t too damaged, they will grow back with this balm.</li>
            <li> Definitely make my grey, thinning brows darker and fuller</li>
            <li> Ihave not used it long enough to know if its working its suppose to make your eye brows grow thicker  </li>
            <li> If you want the product to work faster leave it on for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> You still have to be careful not to mess your pillow if overnight, but it adsorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I am going to be honest, i was very skeptical about using this</li>
            <li> Patience is necessary with this product and any other similar hair growth related product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t panic, those are just dead hairs falling out making room for new hairs.</li>
            <li> now I just use it to help maintain my eyebrows, knowing that there may be no major results like the full, thick, dark eyebrows I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product, I would only need to get an eyebrow wax (to clean up random stray eyebrow hairs) about every 3 months.</li>
            <li> So long story long, I felt it was necessary to return the product to the seller.</li>
            <li> I went through a few crappy eyebrows serums and such first, ones that did little to nothing for me—</li>
            <li> My only disappointment with the product is the strong odor, so only use in the morning if I am remaining at home.</li>
            <li> The containter is small but you only need a small amount for each application so I really think it will last me several months.</li>
            <li> hav&#x27;nt had the product for that long, so I don&#x27;t know yet</li>
            <li> For some strange reason my eyebrows stopped growing,  so I tried this</li>
            <li> Package is smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s a long marathon, not a sprint).</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a long process.  </li>
            <li> But they are few and far between.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps over a long period of time it&#x27;ll improve the condition of my hair follicles.</li>
            <li> After 4 months of using this, my face is finally framed with the thick, dark brows I&#x27;ve always wanted, and I look so pretty.</li>
            <li> This product works for me and it worth trying if you are not happy how your eyebrows look like.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my eyebrows were starting to become sparse due to my hypothyroidism.  </li>
            <li> this is expensive but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> On the dry side.</li>
            <li> It was crusty and dry.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift as a secret Santa gift exchange at my office, and while I was offended at first, I took a long look in the mirror when I got home and thought “what could it hurt?”  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few others but this is the only one to show obvious results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any of the tingling sensation others have mentioned, and have seen no new growth on my brows.</li>
            <li> No new growth, no added fullness, no nothing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this balm every single night since I rec&#x27;d it on 7/21.</li>
            <li> only thing I can say is that the color is listed here as dark brown</li>
            <li> So far all I&#x27;ve noticed is that small hairs seem to be growing in spots where they wouldn&#x27;t before.  </li>
            <li> My old brows were sorry sights that dragged my entire face down and made me look haggard and older than my years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product last May and have been using it daily before bed for the past 7 months.</li>
            <li> In less than a month they were fully grown back.</li>
            <li> cause they&#x27;re naturally blonde and my hair is black</li>
            <li> Has an odd smell, similar to vapor rub.</li>
            <li> Finally after over a month and a half, I started to see my brows regrow rapidly.</li>
            <li> Finally after over a month and a half, I started to see my brows regrow rapidly.</li>
            <li> My eyebrow hair was already a giant mess</li>
            <li> I over plucked for years and eventually just had to shave off the little bit of hair I had left.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for about 3 weeks and already can see a little a bit of growth , its not fast growing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Considering buying the other version of this product, in the hopes that it is less time consuming but gives me the same results.</li>
            <li> If any of you reading this are unfortunate enough to have some of the similar issues that I have, such as very lights / blonde eyebrows, very thin or sparse eyebrows to begin with, and a little bit of OCD that causes you to other tweeze then, I highly recommend you to try this project.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows were thinning, then adding insult to injury, I received a bad eyebrow grooming which left a gap that I had to lightly pencil in.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, this one wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 3 weeks and have seen absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> I thought nothing could really help with my naturally thin eyebrows</li>
            <li> Had absolutely no result at all.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen absolutely no improvement in my eyebrow growth.  </li>
            <li> I have seen absolutely no difference at all.</li>
            <li> So, I started using it every day, for the next few months.</li>
            <li> After a week they did look fuller but not much visible re-growth.</li>
            <li> Also, I recommend being careful when applying it before bed, as it can get on your sheets.</li>
            <li> It crumbles like a cookie, so you have to be careful,  but once it makes contact with the skin it turns into an oil.</li>
            <li> I received an empty jar - as soon as I receive the product I paid for, I will give it another review.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in the next few weeks; at this rate, I&#x27;ll have the eyebrows of a 20-something within a month.</li>
            <li> This product lasts about 3 months which is a lot longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> This product works well, it&#x27;s not immediate results but that shouldn&#x27;t be expected as the product doesn&#x27;t indicate that it will produce immediate results.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> like I wasted a lot of the product white using a q tip and had quite a bit of &#x27;fallout&#x27;.</li>
            <li> But I have seen absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> All I got was an EMPTY JAR, July 14, 2014&lt;</li>
            <li> (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;I received an empty jar -</li>
            <li> Also there is ROGIANE, in which I&#x27;ve read to buy the TARGET MALE VERSION and apply a few drops a day to each eyebrow  </li>
            <li> Also there is ROGIANE, in which I&#x27;ve read to buy the TARGET MALE VERSION and apply a few drops a day to each eyebrow  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003COAFPQ/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_sfl_title_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;A3QW7GNYQZLDG1</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t not work whatsoever, once I opened it it dried up the next day !!!</li>
            <li> so I will inform you the public in a few months</li>
            <li> Absolutely no irritation.</li>
            <li> I was encouraged by all the positive online reviews, and like others, I’ve had dramatic eyebrow growth after using this balm for only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows were a mess, I am getting older and they were getting thick and sticking out, and they had been overplucked.  </li>
            <li> I opened mine up and was missing a big chunk of the cream and the bottle is small enough as it is for the price.</li>
            <li> but if i did you would have had to use the other end to dig it out.</li>
            <li> You can tell from other customer review photos.  </li>
            <li> Now im using once a day or one day yes other not.</li>
            <li> other reviewers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using this regularly for the past six weeks has had results beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> Had a scar on one side and over-tweezing on the other.</li>
            <li> I had no hope for my other at home naturals</li>
            <li> I usually go to a eyebrow threader for my eyes, but last month I decided to try and do my eyebrows myself.</li>
            <li> must say that at first I was skeptical since it didn&#x27;t appear to be working.</li>
            <li> Usually i apply twice a day sometimes only once.</li>
            <li> Also, there were no before/after photos from anyone other than the seller, and there weren&#x27;t any reviews on any other site except for Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be sticking to tweezing very minimally and then using hair shears to trim my brows into a pleasing shape.</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on the positive reviews, and because it’s so much less expensive than other eyebrow growth treatments out there.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have not seen much progression as other people have posted.</li>
            <li> The chemical color is too dark.</li>
            <li> I often forget and on average I&#x27;m probably using it 3 or 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> It was definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my late 20s, they have not grown back in the patchy areas.</li>
            <li> I started feeling like it was a waste of time after a while, but thought there was no harm in keeping it up until it was empty.</li>
            <li> The balm looks and feels like thick vasaline, except its dark mustard yellow color.  </li>
            <li> Where my eyebrows have been over plucked ( just at the arch and down the side of my eye )</li>
            <li> There are no genuine reviews for this product on any other websites either</li>
            <li> It was expensive- and not worth the high cost.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable after a few minutes, so not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have been blessed with my dads very very light hair and my mother who has very thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for perhaps a month and a half and have forgotten some nights</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and a half now.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within a month and a half.</li>
            <li> After tissuing off, it leaves a slightly brown tint.  </li>
            <li> My eyes seemed to slightly burn no matter how I used it</li>
            <li> It has slightly tingling effect on skin.</li>
            <li> You can feel that it is working with the slight tingle it sends off.</li>
            <li> It oddly does seem like it is assisting in growing hair.</li>
            <li> This product has a bit of an odd smell ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s been about 2 and a half months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m desperate and need results FAST!</li>
            <li> I did have to return the empty bottle for a refund, not sure why?  </li>
            <li> I did have to return the empty bottle for a refund, not sure why?  </li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that other customers that have suspected fake reviews have had their comments marked as unhelpful up to 60 times..</li>
            <li> I received my refund less than a few days after I sent in that email.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had a little hair there,</li>
            <li> It helped them to stay in and made  them grow a little.</li>
            <li> that reminds me a little bit of the scent in goo</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product hoping for my brow hairs to be a little thicker and darker.</li>
            <li> It came with a little brush and I appreciate that cuz I did not want to find one.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I applied it with the little brush</li>
            <li> Works, takes a little time.</li>
            <li> I like this product because I&#x27;ve seen results with my eyebrows growing in sparse areas and growing a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not so bad; you might be the lucky few that can relate to the photo.</li>
            <li> It was almost like it was frozen, very hard and didn&#x27;t apply well, guess I was expecting something different or creamier.</li>
            <li> I also believe the reason people think their brows look darker is because it has a very, very dark hue to it which makes the brows look darker while it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if it works but after reading the reviews and comments I do understand it takes a few months</li>
            <li> ,I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again, its certainly not cheap</li>
            <li> I also, unfortunately, do something that a lot of us do far too often</li>
            <li> my hair was quite thin towards the middle.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a month and determined I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> so I feel like it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but one friend suggested  I check out the products from Green Touch Beauty.</li>
            <li> I am seeing a few results.</li>
            <li> It is messy and a waste.</li>
            <li> I called my friend up crying that I messed up</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Got two layers of eye lash in just a few months.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times per the instructions to apply it and leave it on for about 10 minutes and then wipe it off ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed so far ....</li>
            <li> When I received it, it looked like dried up coffee grounds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had short, thin eyebrows I didn&#x27;t like, and I found this in a friend&#x27;s medicine cabinet while I was visiting.</li>
            <li> It actually is thinning my thin brows</li>
            <li> You have to dig a piece out then let in sit on your eyebrow for a few seconds to soften it before spreading it around.</li>
            <li> Some reviews said this product worked anywhere from just a few days, 1 week, 6 weeks, and at 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Quite alot of reviews said after using this product in eather a few days to a few weeks they got darker eyebrows, thicker eyebrows, and</li>
            <li> Like the product states it takes a few months to notice results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had naturally thick eyebrows but recently over pluck them unevenly, so was very anxious to reshape my brows.</li>
            <li> I have very thick eye brow to the point where when I was younger, I almost have a &amp;#34;uni-brow&amp;#34;, anyways throughout my highschool years, I craved a new look, so i tweezer my eyebrows thinner, and thinner, until I had a very depressing looking what was left to be called, eyebrows...</li>
            <li> I had naturally thick eyebrows, but I started getting eyebrow hair loss about an year ago due to stress, and before I started using this product, the outer halves of my eyebrows were almost invisible in photos.</li>
            <li> This does not work for me, and is not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have used for a month, and my friend told me that your eyebrows look dark and thick.</li>
            <li> I purchase this balm because I had a very bad bought of acne about 3 years ago and because of the large pimples that I was getting around and under my eyebrow, the eyebrow hairs fell out and never came back</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad jar, but it is so dry I can barely get any out to use.</li>
            <li> There is no magic.</li>
            <li> I usually put a lot and give it 30 min to absorb.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works.</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of waiting and not seeing any re-growth (I waited over a year and nothing!).</li>
            <li> Just came in and is rather small but</li>
            <li> Even I don&#x27;t use it often, I usually use it overnight.</li>
            <li> I think if I use it often in day time and night time everyday, it will make my eyebrows thick faster.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s kinda pointless.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is doing anything to my brow.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows haven&#x27;t been growing in correctly for the past 6 months or so now.</li>
            <li> I had usually applied a small amount two times a day, for about 20-30 minutes each time I use it.</li>
            <li> I have forgotten to use it quite a few times but it DOES work!</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost 4 weeks, not sure I&#x27;m seeing any results yet or not...</li>
            <li> I had much better luck with that within a month vs. This crap!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who is 66 and frustrated with the loss of her eyebrow hair from over-plucking and getting older.</li>
            <li> I applied the treatment (which is ridiculously thick) for the past three months</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed to say that there was absolutely no difference in my eyebrows from when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> I found this rather hard to apply.</li>
            <li> hard to apply and no hair grow in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It was like a rock and so hard to work with,nothing like was advertised.</li>
            <li> I purchased the balm in October when I had hardly any eyebrows now in January</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you find it hard to go to sleep at night</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard as heck though.</li>
            <li> came in all dry....can hardly apply.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t put a liberal amount on eyebrow as it&#x27;s too hard.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the product is hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> Too clumpy and hard to apply</li>
            <li> it will burn the hell out it, i learned that the hard way.</li>
            <li> So thick and hard to put it on that I stop using it.</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old and my once bushy Italian eyebrows decided to become sparse and pathetic..</li>
            <li> Immediately I was not thrilled over the texture of the product while applying.</li>
            <li> I use this at least 4-5 times a week at night and leave it on as I sleep.</li>
            <li> but you have to wait at least a week to see a difference.  </li>
            <li> Well, that was even more annoying because this stuff stinks and it somewhat feels like a burning sensation after I apply it...not tingling, but burning.  </li>
            <li> I have always had thick eyebrows</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow but it is working.</li>
            <li> The balm is too thick and causes it to fall off the applicator.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are stubborn , thick and I have grown-ins.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are so thick</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick eyebrows</li>
            <li> but it works slowly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slow process</li>
            <li> and it is a bit greasy and thick .....</li>
            <li> It stayed slow throughout, but picked up as I drew closer and closer to running out.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thin eyebrows to where I have to draw them in everyday.  </li>
            <li> UNTIL RECENTLY, I used one of those awful eyebrow shaping razors... and me being the clutz that I am, I shaved nearly half my eyebrow off by accident, ANYWAY, long story short, I was desperate for a product to help these dang brows to grow...</li>
            <li> This is a very thick paste and is not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> NO MORE!  </li>
            <li> Insane right!</li>
            <li> No more thin eyebrows for me.</li>
            <li> This product is impossible to apply, it stinks, and after being persistent for 2 months, there was absolutely no improvement, except that you felt gross because of the smell.</li>
            <li> I tried the growth accelerator when I got a gift card to amazon just because I was a little skeptical</li>
            <li> It is a HARD wax...doesn&#x27;t go on well and has a gritty texture :(</li>
            <li> Overall bad experience.</li>
            <li> product is no good</li>
            <li> This product is no good</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little odd, bad habit.</li>
            <li> Not one hair grew back and I&#x27;m highly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got an old or bad batch of this stuff, but it is rock hard and nearly impossible to apply.  </li>
            <li> It works, but very slow...</li>
            <li> This seems to be a product that results come in very very slow or just does not work-</li>
            <li> I noticed that it was helping to restore my brow, however at a very slow rate.</li>
            <li> Worse yet, I think my eyebrows is getting thinner.</li>
            <li> My mother got this for me after hearing me complain about my over plucked thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are naturally thin</li>
            <li> im really not happy with it, I am using it to the directions.</li>
            <li> Someone like me who is acne-prone, I have not experienced any breakouts with this product.</li>
            <li> I have always had thin brows and with aging they have become almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was tired of stenciling in my brows all the time and found this product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> Not a happy incident.</li>
            <li> but the eyebrows hair is worse than it was before.</li>
            <li> and I  used to have thin over plucked eyebrows</li>
            <li> I appreciate that, it means that a company stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thin eyebrows and instead of growing</li>
            <li> I have extremely thin eyebrows and instead of growing</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really starting to get annoying doing it all the time.</li>
            <li> Cara Delevingne eyebrows if you have naturally thin brows</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are so thin</li>
            <li> , I started seeing dramatic results after about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with my purchase, it only caused me problems now</li>
            <li> It gives some color to my eyebrows without looking fake.</li>
            <li> but I have a feeling they may be fake.  </li>
            <li> Hi so I am one of the people who got their eyebrows waxed by the wrong person.</li>
            <li> product has a weird consistency.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did not work.</li>
            <li> i am skeptical about hair growing potions -</li>
            <li> For years I have struggled with lousy eyebrows and didn’t know what to do to enhance them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a :before&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Weird smell</li>
            <li> I had to cease using this product unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It comes with an applicator that I found absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> sadly...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month and SHOCKINGLY, my brows are growing back!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guilty of over plucking</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> People who say you can tell it is working because it tingles are being silly.  </li>
            <li> but ill write another update review with my consensus.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and did a lot of searching for something to help my eyebrows grow out, and decided on this product.</li>
            <li> I have always had very thin eyebrows</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyebrows</li>
            <li> With that said I did see a very small amount of growth but not the growth you see in the photo :(</li>
            <li> It looks like the seeds of strawberries all clumped up in this brown thick waxy-like crap.</li>
            <li> but due to my horrible waxing jobs I did as a teenager</li>
            <li> I was losing hair every other day which is horrible for $35 for nothing</li>
            <li> I was losing hair every other day which is horrible for $35 for nothing</li>
            <li> but I am afraid I might have another reaction to it.</li>
            <li> so I was in desperate need of something to help them look fuller.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will grow new eyebrows. I have used it every day since I got it and I don&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work I been using it for almost 2 1/2 months and no results yet so disappointed. ...I won&#x27;t  recommend it to anyone. ...</li>
            <li> My course eyebrows feel so much softer from first use. I don&#x27;t see much difference in hair growth but I&#x27;m only using for a week. I&#x27;ll update my review after 2 months on that but love that there so much softer.</li>
            <li> The product does not work. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months. Not a single extra hair grows. The chemical color is too dark. You&#x27;ll have to wait and rub it off before leaving your house; pretty inconvenience. Overall bad experience. I would not recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> I hav&#x27;nt had the product for that long, so I don&#x27;t know yet how well it works</li>
            <li> I kept using this product for a month and it didn&#x27;t work at all.  Worse yet, I think my eyebrows is getting thinner. How can I get refund?</li>
            <li> it made my eyebrow hairs fall off</li>
            <li> Sorry, this one wasn&#x27;t worth it. The product is dry and seems old. Hasn&#x27;t helped.</li>
            <li> did absolutely nothin</li>
            <li> So far I see a difference. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 3 weeks and have seen absolutely no results. Will keep using it until I run out which may be long time since its a large jar. Will keep you posted and updated.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible! I applied the treatment (which is ridiculously thick) for the past three months and it did not help eyebrow growth. In fact, it actually did the opposite of what it promised, it caused me to lose more eyebrow hair. This is because the consistency of the product is so thick it can actually stay within your brow hairs and cause more harm than good. On top of it all, I emailed Green Touch Beauty about my issue and received no such reply. Save your $$$ and stay away from this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product last May and have been using it daily before bed for the past 7 months. It took a while but I have definitely noticed a difference with my brows. Starting out my eyebrows were very sparse from over tweezing when I was in my teens and early twenties. After using this product for several months my eyebrows have become thicker, longer, and softer. Prior to using this product, I would only need to get an eyebrow wax (to clean up random stray eyebrow hairs) about every 3 months. Now I notice that I need to get the clean up wax about every 1.5 months which shows that my brows are growing more. I have been using this product for about 7 months and about half of the bottle is still left too :)</li>
            <li> I had to lay off the product for 2 days it made me break out with bad bumps around my eye brows. I am hoping to see results once I can begin applying it again. I just went from twice a day to once a day but I am afraid I might have another reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as directed religiously for 3 weeks and have not seen any difference in my eyebrows at all ... I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if it works but after reading the reviews and comments I do understand it takes a few months sometimes so I will persevere although unless there is a significant growth after I have finished the bottle ,I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again, its certainly not cheap</li>
            <li> Results after a week - I cant believe it. Very strong smell but actually somehow nice. And a bit tickeling on the skin after applying. Also has a brown colour.</li>
            <li> does not work. Have been applying for over 2 months and nothing changed</li>
            <li> I am giving this a neutral vote because it may work for others. Used this product as directed and it did nothing for me accept give me a rash on my brows.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when buying this product but I was at the point that I had nothing to lose. Unfortunately I have been blessed with my dads very very light hair and my mother who has very thin eyebrows. I also, unfortunately, do something that a lot of us do far too often and that is over tweeze my eyebrows. It&#x27;s unfortunate because I don&#x27;t have very much to begin with, but I&#x27;m slightly OCD in the sense that I want everything perfect. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks now and my eyebrows have definitely grown back to what they were previously before over tweezing them, and even a little more. At this point I am still having to fill them in with a pencil. I use it not only to give them a little more depth, a little more volume and to darken them. I&#x27;m fairly confident that after several more months of using this product, I bet they will either be to my desired result, or they will at least be to the point that they are as full and as thick as I want and the most I would need to do is either tint them a darker color, or pencil them in every day for the simple fact that they may be too light. Nothing to do with not having enough or them not being the right shape but for the simple fact that they&#x27;re too light. I&#x27;m hoping that I can get them to the point so that they will look more like they did before I started tweezing them altogether. I&#x27;m definitely still going to shape them and everything but, just as I stated before, I don&#x27;t have a whole lot to begin with genetically so I have to compromise. I&#x27;m hoping with the more time that this product will continue to help and continue to make them grow faster, thicker, darker. I know that after over tweezing your eyebrows they take several months (sometimes up to 6 months) to grow back or to even start growing back and so after about 4 weeks I am really pleased with the results. I probably would... get better results if I remembered to use it every single night. I often forget and on average I&#x27;m probably using it 3 or 4 times a week. I would recommend this product to someone else... a family member, a friend. I have had much better results than I ever thought possible. If any of you reading this are unfortunate enough to have some of the similar issues that I have, such as very lights / blonde eyebrows, very thin or sparse eyebrows to begin with, and a little bit of OCD that causes you to other tweeze then, I highly recommend you to try this project. I challenge you to use it every night and give it some time to work because eyebrows are stubborn and don&#x27;t grow back over night. Take it from a born skeptic and give this product a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised as I have.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product with patience for 6 months, twice a day as suggested.  My eyebrows were a mess, I am getting older and they were getting thick and sticking out, and they had been overplucked.  I never thought I would like my brows again, but I have to say this stuff works.  You have to be diligent and use it twice a day and give it some time.  When I had a couple real stubborn hairs that stuck straight out, I plucked them out and kept using the balm and they grew in correctly.  It&#x27;s making me feel more beautiful to have my thicker brows now and I&#x27;m just going to keep using this because it&#x27;s just part of my routine now, feels good and makes my now soft brows lay flat and properly. And I&#x27;m getting hair in the over-plucked areas too which is nothing short of a miracle.  USE WITH PATIENCE and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It smells really good, and I feel it works!</li>
            <li> There are many product that I have tried but all were fake. But then one day my friend told me to buy this balm and guess what. I did listen to him and I am in love with my eyebrows now and the best thing about this product is that it is cheaper than most of the products I would usually buy. I would recommend it to everyone as it is cheap and a good product.</li>
            <li> I found this rather hard to apply. Thought it made be like a gel. On the dry side.</li>
            <li> Not as good just a little hair grew but not enough I will give it another month than I will order something else!</li>
            <li> It made a small amount of difference - maybe if I used it twice a day it would work better.</li>
            <li> When you find a product like the Perfect Brows eyebrow growth balm that smells great, makes your eyebrows look fantastic and lives up to all the hype. I started using it 6 weeks ago when I got a tube as a free gift with purchase. I thought nothing could really help with my naturally thin eyebrows so I had never bothered to try, but since I had it, I figured why not? I don’t know why I didn’t find this sooner, but I’m glad I have it now, and I don’t plan to stop.</li>
            <li> For some strange reason my eyebrows stopped growing,  so I tried this and they started growing within a week.  In less than a month they were fully grown back. Works right away!</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised at how well this worked. I wanted me eyebrows to be closer together in the middle and I&#x27;ve always had a little hair there, but due to my horrible waxing jobs I did as a teenager my hair was quite thin towards the middle. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and the hair is thicker and longer, and though I still have to fill my brows in cause they&#x27;re naturally blonde and my hair is black, they look a lot more natural and thick. :) the instructions say to apply using a qtip, but I use my fingers cause the stuff is kinda dry and crumbley and when I use a qtip a lot of it falls right off my eyebrows. Using my fingers, it warms and softens and I&#x27;m not wasting any product. Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> Before the perfect brow balm my brows were skimpy short patches of hair that barely grew and would fall out at the slightest provocation. Now that I&#x27;ve been gliding this balm over them for a few months they&#x27;ve plumped up more than I could&#x27;ve thought possible with thick roots that don&#x27;t budge when I comb them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ok, after using it for about 15 days I can see tiny new hairs growing from my eyebrows, but nothing amazing like full thickness .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and no results. Perhaps I need to use it for longer. But as of now I&#x27;ve seen no difference. Save your money. It&#x27;s very pricey for it not to give you results within a month.</li>
            <li> Although this seemed to arrive as a VERY old product, kind of dried up. I do like it. It gives some color to my eyebrows without looking fake. As far as making them grow, it really hasn&#x27;t done that, though I only have been using maybe 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> hard to apply and no hair grow in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> still watching, haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable difference yet. i bought this based on the review i read,  i really do hope it works, will be back here for areview update.</li>
            <li> Had absolutely no result at all. I tried it for a month and determined I wasted my money. Glad it works for some people, wish I had been one of them. I have thrown it out.</li>
            <li> It was like a rock and so hard to work with,nothing like was advertised. Oh and the brush. never got that but if i did you would have had to use the other end to dig it out. would not recommend spending youre money. I think it was an old product that they passed on</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month and it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Great product and has nice spicy smell. Package is smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Used twice a day for over a month with no results. The only thing it helped me do was become more cognizant about not tweezing so frequently.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t review items. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now (I have not posted a review because I wanted to see if there would be any results). Unfortunately, I have not seen much progression as other people have posted. That&#x27;s why I rate it a 1.</li>
            <li> Really a great product. Seems like this is going to last me a while as well. I keep forgetting to put it on every night...but that&#x27;s generally when I apply. I&#x27;ve also worn this UNDERNEATH my eyebrow pencil but logically, since growth hormone is highest at night, it makes sense to nourish that growth when you go to bed. In the morning, I wake up and there is no serum wiped onto my sheets but I imagine if you put a lot (which isn&#x27;t necessary) it could potentially (?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can say is that the color is listed here as dark brown so I was under the impression that this would replace the need for me to pencil in my brows. That&#x27;s NOT the case!!! It&#x27;s quite light, it&#x27;s a serum! You can tell from other customer review photos.  Another thing I love is that it&#x27;s not waxy and it&#x27;s very easy to apply so it will not pull out any existing growth we want to hold onto!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for perhaps a month and a half and have forgotten some nights and I DO NOTICE A DIFFERENCE!  My brows are so sparse so I&#x27;ll be sticking to tweezing very minimally and then using hair shears to trim my brows into a pleasing shape. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be returning to get my eyebrows threaded or waxed again.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few weeks and I see no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product because of the overwhelming number of positive reviews but I have a feeling they may be fake.  I clicked on a bunch of the positive reviews and discovered that, in most cases, the people doing the review had no other product reviews, only the one for this product. Suspicious.</li>
            <li> I have never been one to try anything like this product before but I had heard such wonderful things about your Perfect Brows from friends who had tried it and also from reading the reviews. I have been using the Perfect Brows for about a month now and I am so impressed with the results. I will be letting my friends know that they should try it and I will be re-ordering again.</li>
            <li> very very tiny jar. smells terrible but i am optimistic. can&#x27;t say if it works yet or not.</li>
            <li> Hi so I am one of the people who got their eyebrows waxed by the wrong person. So I got my eyebrows waxed and well this lady took off more than half of my eyebrow because she said the think brow was in! Insane right! Well since the. My eyebrows have had the hardest time growing back and it&#x27;s so painful to see them this thin :( so I bought this product with high hopes. As a matter of fact I bought it 3x. I did use it religiously night and day to be exact. With that said I did see a very small amount of growth but not the growth you see in the photo :( I wish it would&#x27;ve helped me that way but it does help. If you are willing to give it a try it&#x27;s not so bad; you might be the lucky few that can relate to the photo. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I love it! Getting my second one! I used 2 times a day for 3 weeks until start seeing the results. Now im using once a day or one day yes other not. Even my friends notice the difference. Awesome</li>
            <li> It probably would work if you do it every day, twice a day or so and for a while ......months! There is no magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to put on too much makeup (I prefer to sleep longer in the morning, to be honest), but I&#x27;ve always felt my face would look a lot better if I just had fuller, darker eyebrows. I decided to try this balm after my co-worker showed me how well it had worked for her, and I&#x27;m happy to say it&#x27;s worked just as well for me. After 4 months of using this, my face is finally framed with the thick, dark brows I&#x27;ve always wanted, and I look so pretty.</li>
            <li> Great balm. LOVE IT! Helped me a lot. I can see a difference just after applying it to my eyebrows two or three weeks in a row before going to bed. You still have to be careful not to mess your pillow if overnight, but it adsorbs fast. I usually put a lot and give it 30 min to absorb. It has some herbal and honey scent which I enjoy a lot.</li>
            <li> The seller is fine. Product is gimmic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice a day, every day, for 6 months and I&#x27;ve seen absolutely no improvement in my eyebrow growth.  I&#x27;m disappointed but since I paid so much for it, I may as well use it up.  There is quite a bit left.  And I kind of like the scent.  It&#x27;s like a strong Brazillian nut scent.</li>
            <li> It took a while but I have definitely noticed a difference with my brows. After using this product, my eyebrows have become thicker, longer, and softer. I have been using this product for about 5 months and about half of the bottle is still left too, but that’s because I don’t use too much of it. I like the scent of it as well. It’s really nice.</li>
            <li> Appears to work. Not like Magic but I see improvement</li>
            <li> This product was rock hard when I received it and had an awful odor. Could it have just been expired? I don&#x27;t know, but do not care to try it again!</li>
            <li> I had overplucked my eyebrows once again so I decided to give this a try. I purchased the balm in October when I had hardly any eyebrows now in January my eyebrows are looking better, fuller, darker than they have in years. I plan to keep using this for as long as possible! Smells really, really great too, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have seen absolutely no difference at all. Still waiting but doubt I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s all I have to say.</li>
            <li> First product of many I have used that actually works!  I&#x27;ve seen a considerable eyebrow growth since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell but it smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used a balm like this before so I wasn&#x27;t exactly convinced that it would work, but I read a lot of the reviews on here and decided to give it a try anyway. After 4 months, I think it is safe to say this balm really works. My eyebrows haven&#x27;t looked this nice in years—they&#x27;re both thicker and darker than they were even like 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> No noticeable improvement with eyebrow growth however, it is a nice balm.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week but It does promote growth. I usually make my own eyelash/eyebrow growth serum with multiple oils including coconut, avocado, argan, joba joba, jamacain black castor, and vitamin E oil. My own serum seems to produce faster results and doesn&#x27;t have an off-putting smell. My friend says it smells great, I dont mind the smell but its pretty strong and bothersome for putting on at night because it&#x27;s hard to sleep when you keep smelling a super pungent smell on your face. Don&#x27;t buy if you find it hard to go to sleep at night LOL</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old and my once bushy Italian eyebrows decided to become sparse and pathetic.. NO MORE!  This stuff began working after one week. This stuff is no joke, do it twice a day and you won&#x27;t be sorry! So happy!!</li>
            <li> This product is a total scam. Just look at those 5 star reviews and you will see that a company is writing those. All of them reviewed only their two product :-D Doesn&#x27;t work. Buy castor oil instead and save yourself some cash.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews but I really believe that the reviews are phoney. When I received my product it contained a note that says before giving a bad review please contact company. Why would I do that? Either it works or it doesn&#x27;t. I have always had thick eyebrows but I over plucked them over the years and wanted my eyebrows back. I was looking for a product that would help grow them back and ran across this product.  I been using the product for two weeks now and I don&#x27;t see any difference. I&#x27;m disappointed. I will keep using it to see if any change occurs and if so I will update my response.</li>
            <li> No growth from product, but did enjoy the moisture I recieved from using it. The 3 stars are for the moisture that my brows got from the quality (all natural) ingredients used in the  product. I mostly found use in this product by applying it do keep my brows in place. Some people don&#x27;t like the smell of it, but I liked the natural smell that the product had.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well so far I&#x27;ve only been using it a while I wish I would&#x27;ve known about this years ago</li>
            <li> had to use it consistently​ for a month 2 times a day but my eye brows grew back :) so happy with the results!!!</li>
            <li> I liked it. It helped them to stay in and made  them grow a little. But I am still using it.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it didn&#x27;t do anything. Used the whole container exactly how I was supposed to, and nothing.</li>
            <li> The balm does take a while to work because eye, following the directions doesn’t make it all appear within one day.  It&#x27;s important to keep it from the eyes while applying it. It is an excellent product and seems to add fullness to the eyebrow hair. But use with caution because it can and does stings the eyes. It also just makes my eyebrows a bit sticky, but it really smells nice and sweet. The ingredients in it are really excellent, but it’s a bit slow to be working despite all the tingling I get from it. I’ll keep trying it but it definitely needs perseverance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad that this balm wasn&#x27;t one of those things that said it was not good enough to be true, because it really is. Of course I was skeptical at first, but I took a chance because I really needed something to help my eyebrows a bit. This product is absolutely amazing</li>
            <li> I have seen progress with this product. It&#x27;s slow but it is working. Very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it.  I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product nightly since Feb15 but have not seen a bit result. Not working, but no longer returnable :(</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m amazed. this stuff actually works. i&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks but so far i&#x27;m pleased. the instructions say to put it on twice a day and remove after ten minutes. i don&#x27;t really have time like that, so i&#x27;ve been applying it to my brows before bed and leave it on until morning. the hair has started growing in where i applied the product only after a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;as some have mentioned the smell isn&#x27;t great. but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable after a few minutes, so not a big deal. i wouldn&#x27;t have mentioned it at all if it hadn&#x27;t have been brought up by other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;the only reason i give it four stars instead of five is it does not darken my brows. i still need to dye them to get rid of all of TWO gray hairs. so bothersome, and i really wish this product worked to darken the hair, but c&#x27;est la vie. it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience and i still plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> The balm is too thick and causes it to fall off the applicator.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for that perfect gift for someone I have to say the Perfect Brows are definitely the gift. I purchased these about a month ago and I have been so amazed with the results so far. I am so happy. My brows have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 months (this is my second purchase of this product) and I am  beginning to see good results. I am applying it twice a day on most days, although some days I forget. My eyebrows are becoming more filled in and there is a big difference in the quality of my brows. Before using this product the ends of my eyebrows were almost gone from over plucking and threading.  Now I do not have to fill in my eyebrows with a brow pencil like I had to do before. I definitely see that my brows are continuing to improve with use.</li>
            <li> This product is doing exactly what I purchased it for. My eyebrows are fuller and I&#x27;m seeing new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell of full results yet, But after only using for a couple of weeks can already see new growth in areas that have been severely over plucked for years. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> nothing happened to my brows. they just remained as it is.</li>
            <li> This product does work. I&#x27;ve always had naturally thick eyebrows but recently over pluck them unevenly, so was very anxious to reshape my brows. It took me about 6 weeks to get my brows back.</li>
            <li> All positive reviews for this product are fake- all written in same grammatical style, all similar tone, similar punctuation, mostly all written in blocks on the same day.There are no genuine reviews for this product on any other websites either.. Seems pretty odd. Also, I noticed that other customers that have suspected fake reviews have had their comments marked as unhelpful up to 60 times.. Hmm..What a joke.</li>
            <li> So thick and hard to put it on that I stop using it.</li>
            <li> Has an odd smell, similar to vapor rub. Looks brown in the jar but comes on transparent. You can feel a bit of a tingly sensation after applying it. It&#x27;s a bit of a pain to use seeing that you have to use a separate brush. Haven&#x27;t used it consistently enough to see results.</li>
            <li> So, long story short, I had an accident at a bonfire one night. Alcohol was involved. After the minor burns were taken care of, my eyebrows were, more or less, gone. I started looking for something to help them grow back, and this had plenty of positive reviews. Plus, it was made by the same company that I buy my conditioner from. That conditioner helped strengthen my frail hair, so I have some faith in the brand. And even if it didn&#x27;t work for me, since it says in the information it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, it&#x27;s cheap enough it was no great financial loss. So, I started using it every day, for the next few months. While my eyebrows grew back, I wasn&#x27;t sure entirely how much it was thanks to this rather than just my body, at first. So, I kept on using until the end. The whole container lasted a good four months, and by then I was sure it had helped, because my eyebrows have not only grown back, but thicker than they were before the accident. They&#x27;ve actually improved, and I&#x27;m taking out a second order because I want to see this growth continue.</li>
            <li> I work as a brow and lash technician, so I know how important it is to many people to have great looking eyebrows.  I tried Perfect Brows Growth Accelerator Balm after reading reviews online, because I was looking for a new eyebrow growth treatment I could recommend to my clients.  I chose this product based on the positive reviews, and because it’s so much less expensive than other eyebrow growth treatments out there.  I love that Perfect Brows balm is made from high quality natural ingredients and contains so many vitamins.  My eyebrows started looking healthier very quickly, and after a few weeks I noticed how fast my eyebrows seemed to be growing.  Using a growth accelerator balm like Perfect Brows can eliminate the need for eyebrow tinting or drawing eyebrows in, and I can definitely tell the difference in my clients who are using this product and those who aren’t.  It’s important to me that I know a product works well before i recommend it to others, and I’ve confidently recommended Perfect Brows balm to anyone who asks me what they can do to help their eyebrows look better.  I will definitely be a long time user of Perfect Brows growth balm.</li>
            <li> works well saw growth</li>
            <li> I opened mine up and was missing a big chunk of the cream and the bottle is small enough as it is for the price. The scent isn&#x27;t all that great but I do feel the tingling sensation so I hope it works.</li>
            <li> Started trying this accelerator..Will be back later to give my review</li>
            <li> It works, but very slow... it took me 3 months to grow back my eyebrows, if it could work within weeks it will be wonder in a jar.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works.</li>
            <li> After years of doing the whole skinny brows the trend changes to fuller brows. I went about 3 months without tweezing and could not get my brows to grow in fuller. I decided to try a accelerator and went with the Perfect Brows Growth Balm because it is a natural and botanical  product. I am starting to notice that my brows are getting thicker and darker. The little tingle you feel when applied is well worth it when you start to see the results. I would recommend this for anyone needing some help getting fuller eye brows.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who is 66 and frustrated with the loss of her eyebrow hair from over-plucking and getting older. She was quite happy to get this and try it out. After a week they did look fuller but not much visible re-growth. She kept at it and by week 4 there was a visible difference! You could really see new hair growing where she hasn’t had much in years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has used many products before with some degree of improvement but the ease of use, pleasant smell and results she got from this product (and the low price!) has made it her favorite treatment so far. Hopefully she will be more careful about over-plucking in the future!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my eyebrows. I have very sparse eyebrows, nothing on the ends (over plucking as a teenager)  I used it as instructed and it just hasn&#x27;t made any improvement at all.  It wasn&#x27;t a cheap product either.</li>
            <li> My mother got this for me after hearing me complain about my over plucked thin eyebrows. This product has so many mixed reviews. For me this product has and has not worked.... Let me explain. Where my eyebrows want to grow it has definitely thickened them. Where my eyebrows have been over plucked ( just at the arch and down the side of my eye ) I have not had success in that area with growth using this product. The smell does not bother me and It has been easy with a Q~tip to apply. I will keep using as it has helped but let&#x27;s face it ladies, there is NO such thing as a miracle in a bottle and I never expected there would be. For what it is, it has helped and I like everyone else wish it were that &#x27;Miracle&#x27; OR go back in time and undue the damage I did. So I do recommend this product if you have eyebrows and want to thicken them. If your looking for a fix it to damaged over plucked eyebrows that won&#x27;t grow, let me know where I can get some !!</li>
            <li> I have purchased and used two jars of this product now. And I plan to buy a third! My eyebrows are the best they&#x27;ve ever looked. I love that I don&#x27;t HAVE to fill them in with makeup to leave the house anymore. I still have a couple spots that are a bit thinner than others, but I think continuing to use the product should fix that! I recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> After using this on my brows I experienced contact dermatitis all over my brow area, it&#x27;s very red, inflamed, itchy, and dry. I have no idea why I&#x27;m experiencing this I&#x27;ve never had this happen before. I am very disappointed with my purchase, it only caused me problems now I have to pay to go see a dermatologist because it&#x27;s out of control.</li>
            <li> I am one of the most skeptical buyers when it comes to beauty products and their claims. This is one product that I can honestly say works as described. My eyebrows are naturally thin and I figured I would have to draw them on for the rest of my life. Not only that time consuming but if you don&#x27;t do it right, you look ridiculous. This accelerator has my eyebrows much fuller. Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Before I got it I was concerned how it will work for me.  My eyebrows are stubborn , thick and I have grown-ins. This is the one of BEST brow balms I was using. I am using it for 2 month and the jar is not even half-way done. I think it will last 3-4 month or so. I am very happy how it worked for me growing back over plucked spots.  I will have thicker brows sooner than I thought.</li>
            <li> I have always had very thin eyebrows so this product was great for me! By the time I hit forty years old, my eyebrows had gotten even thinner so I was in desperate need of something to help them look fuller. After using this product for about 6 weeks, I started seeing drastic results! My eyebrows look twice as thick and they feel really healthy. What I like most is that this product is all natural and is packed with the vitamins that my skin needs. I will be reordering again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got an old or bad batch of this stuff, but it is rock hard and nearly impossible to apply.  Also, it smells strongly, not bad, but not something you want to apply in the morning.  I have no idea if it works because I couldn&#x27;t get it onto the brush.I tried warming it up, but that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> buy it and do not work for me but my mom again regain her eyebrows, she is happy about it. I change my score</li>
            <li> This works! I&#x27;m 36. Tried to grow back in alone. Didn&#x27;t work. This helped!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and a half now. I was leery at first because I wasn&#x27;t seeing results super quickly (but I&#x27;m impatient) yet after putting my photos together I realized there is a huge difference already! I&#x27;m not even 1/3 of the way through the balm (and I missed a couple of nights putting this on) but wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is worth it! You just need patience when trying it out. Also, I recommend being careful when applying it before bed, as it can get on your sheets.</li>
            <li> It was almost like it was frozen, very hard and didn&#x27;t apply well, guess I was expecting something different or creamier.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my eyebrows were starting to become sparse due to my hypothyroidism.  I&#x27;ve been using the product twice a day,  three times a week for three weeks. This product has filled in all the bald spots and has made my eyebrows fuller.  I have noticed,  however, that there has been no hair regrowth in areas that have been tweezed consistently throughout the years. It maybe take months to see those results. Regardless I&#x27;m pleased with the results thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a nice citrus scent,  that reminds me a little bit of the scent in goo gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a weird consistency.  It crumbles like a cookie, so you have to be careful,  but once it makes contact with the skin it turns into an oil. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the application. I&#x27;m Considering buying the other version of this product, in the hopes that it is less time consuming but gives me the same results.</li>
            <li> This balm works great on my skinny over-plucked eyebrows. It softens stubborn hair and I noticed it easier to style my eyebrows now. I have light brown eyebrows and I noticed that they are becoming much shiny and dense, creating the effect of healthy looking eyes and face overall. This product works for me and it worth trying if you are not happy how your eyebrows look like. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I purchase this balm because I had a very bad bought of acne about 3 years ago and because of the large pimples that I was getting around and under my eyebrow, the eyebrow hairs fell out and never came back (I had eyebrow hair closest to my nose but right at my arch, it would not grow back). I kept trying to be patient and hoping that they would grow back and in the meantime, I had to pretty much draw them on completely because they were non-existent. I finally got tired of waiting and not seeing any re-growth (I waited over a year and nothing!). I have been using this balm every single night since I rec&#x27;d it on 7/21. I started seeing growth probably about 1 1/2 weeks into using it. It is not yet substantial but every day I notice more and more hairs growing in! I am beyond excited! Now, I had read some of the reviews about the scent and thought they were probably exaggerating. I will admit, it was a very strong scent the first few times that I used it. It actully sort of freaked me out initially because I swear that i smelled sort of like Nair! I would say that it took me about 3-4 days to get used to the scent but I don&#x27;t even notice it anymore. It is not a bad smell really, just strong, but it is worth it because this stuff works! The containter is small but you only need a small amount for each application so I really think it will last me several months. I will definately recommend this to everyone for regrowth of eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Did not work so far. It&#x27;s been 1 month and I see no improvement</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything, was I to receive another product with it, I thought I had seen 2.  im really not happy with it, I am using it to the directions.</li>
            <li> great product really active ingredients inside for the money, and great value well works awesome and will be buying some more from this store. really recxommend this balm</li>
            <li> The Perfect Brows Growth Accelerator solves almost every issue of growing back even stubborn eyebrows, and it is even helpful for those with sensitive skin or allergies. No issues love the product will be buying more of this soon...Great for gifts or use of yourself, priced right!</li>
            <li> I have been using this religiously twice a day since I have received it! I have not notice not one new hair. This is kind of sad especially for the cost. I gave it one star because it does smell nice. Other than that I would not be able to honestly give it any stars!!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I see results but it takes time</li>
            <li> Just came in and is rather small but at the same time the perfect amount. I am really eager to get started and gain some progress. Really hope this works! Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This helps stimulate the area, but it has not helped growth as fast as it says.  I have found other products like Godfrey products on Amazon to work better. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on ratings hoping that this would work for me. My eyebrows are light and thin (I&#x27;m Asian), and I over-plucked some areas hoping for some regrowth with this product. When I received the product, I noticed the smell. I know some people like it, but it wasn&#x27;t for me. It&#x27;s an odor very similar to what you can smell in L&#x27;Occitane products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product twice a day as directed, every day for two months. Once in the morning and once at night for about 10-15 minutes each time. I am very disappointed to say that there was absolutely no difference in my eyebrows from when I first started using it. I intentionally didn&#x27;t pluck my eyebrows for two months while I was using this product to see what differences it would make. I do have before and after photos if anyone wants to see them, and you can definitely tell there is no difference in growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Green Touch Beauty, and they were very prompt about refunding the total cost to me. I received my refund less than a few days after I sent in that email. Kudos on their responsiveness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Like many I over-plucked my eyebrows as a teenager and have been searching for a product that will work. Unfortunately this did not work. Sure a few hairs grew in but nothing like what the description says. I will use the entire container but am not seeing the results I hoped for. Maybe there&#x27;s no hope for my brows but I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure it&#x27;s working - causing eyebrow hairs to grow.  i &#x27;m about halfway through the jar (and by the way the stuff is really fun - great texture, a tiny bit grainy, pungent aroma that isn&#x27;t noticeable after a minute).  i am skeptical about hair growing potions - but when i realized  my eyebrows had nearly totally disappeared i decided to give stuff a try.  May be age, and may be deficiency who knows.  point is that, my eyebrow hair is blond, i&#x27;ve always darkened them with mascara.  When i realized i was actually putting mascara on my skin (!) , not on hairs, i started looking around.&lt;br /&gt;i give this 5 stars simply because i am again darkening hairs - apparently the restoration is happening from the inside out to the edges.  we&#x27;re about halfway there lol</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has had many years of over plucking. Love it for being natural and soothing on the eyebrows. My eyebrow hair is growing back much healthier than before. I would say I&#x27;ve had more success with this than taking hair, skin and nails vitamins with other name brand eyebrow regrowth products combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to massage it in your eyebrows and wipe it off after ten minutes. I leave mine on overnight vs. applying morning and evening. I don&#x27;t think anyone has time for that in the morning. Someone like me who is acne-prone, I have not experienced any breakouts with this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!!  I was very skeptical at first and didn&#x27;t think it would work this good and this is my second purchase of it.... I will be buying on the regular until my eyebrows are perfect without any pencil</li>
            <li> I received an empty jar - as soon as I receive the product I paid for, I will give it another review.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I have one prefect full eyebrow and one with a few bald spots from pencil shading. This balm has really helped my missing hair grow back in and I&#x27;m barely shading in my brow any more. It&#x27;s a small container, but it lasts a very long time if you use it right, oh and it smells great! I use it before bed and it&#x27;s kind of a trigger to help me fall asleep. Definitely buying again once I run out.</li>
            <li> The product has worked okay, but not according to my expectations from other online reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been using the growth accelerator for close to 2 months now. I&#x27;m barely starting to notice more fullness in growth in my eyebrows then before. One thing I do have to say is that when I was a teenager I did sort of burn my eyebrows off (on accident of course) and though they&#x27;d never grow back. It took a good full year for them to come back in but there were still some bald batches. I tried the growth accelerator when I got a gift card to amazon just because I was a little skeptical I didn&#x27;t want top spend my own money. I&#x27;m no where near done with the jar but have seen noticable improvement. I will keep using until contents of jar are gone which I estimate to be in about 3 months. And I use the product every other day just because my skin is very sensitive to anything, but this product hasn&#x27;t caused sensetivity. Also I do like that this product has a money back guarantee, although there are no instructions in the packaging as to how to return if needed. This is the only glitch I see with the product, but I&#x27;m sure the helpful customer service staff at Amazon will be more then helpful if a return is needed. overall I would reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about 3 weeks now. Not so bad. The hairs on my brows are growing but very light. I will continue to use this product hoping for my brow hairs to be a little thicker and darker.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item a while back, but waited until I can fully try it.  It has been over  3 months now. I honestly see a slight difference- not buy a bunch.  This seems to be a product that results come in very very slow or just does not work- could be one of those that takes time. I honestly do not feel it was worth the price I paid and not being able to see results. My eyebrows, seemed to just be growing in patches with this and not in the whole eyebrow area.  It grew very well in the front ends of my eyebrows- only place i was able to noticed a big difference.  My overall opinion i would rather stick with my coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I do really like it!!!!. I have used for a month, and my friend told me that your eyebrows look dark and thick. I am so happy with that. Even I don&#x27;t use it often, I usually use it overnight. I think if I use it often in day time and night time everyday, it will make my eyebrows thick faster. Thanks a lot for this item, it&#x27;s really worth it !</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written for a beauty product. But after using this for 2-3 weeks, I&#x27;m amazed at the results. I&#x27;m 52, and my eyebrows were thinning rapidly. Using this twice a day, they are filling in beautifully. And now when I use an eyebrow pencil, I&#x27;m SHADING instead of full-on DRAWING! I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in the next few weeks; at this rate, I&#x27;ll have the eyebrows of a 20-something within a month. So nice when a product actually does what it claims to do;  I will never be without this stuff. (And no, I don&#x27;t work for the company).</li>
            <li> Great seller. Product didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> very good item, I love it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Finally my brows look decent. Thank you for making this possible!</li>
            <li> It is not as good as advertisement. It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Waxy. Won&#x27;t absorb. Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have notice no difference at all so I feel like it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It only has been a couple of weeks, can&#x27;t really say much about it yet.</li>
            <li> Perfect Brows has been a part of my morning routine for months, now, and I love it. My eyebrows are so thick and they&#x27;ve taken on a healthier, more vibrant color since I began using it.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that I received this vegan Perfect Brows product as a gift. I have very thin eyebrows and I don&#x27;t like drawingf them in with eyeliner. I got this 2 months ago and I am finally seeing some growth. They are full without having a unibrow. I only use it once a day and I love the smell of herbs. So it looks like it will last for awhile. No more thin eyebrows for me. I have sensitive skin and  there is no irritation</li>
            <li> This did not help my brows grow, it did make them shiny, but since I need brow growth....this is not the product for that.</li>
            <li> This organic product is great :-) I do see a difference you just have to be patient. I noticed a difference within a month and a half. It came with a little brush and I appreciate that cuz I did not want to find one. It spreads nicely so it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> My eyebrow hair was already a giant mess and I didn&#x27;t want to end up with a grease smeared all over my face. When I read the ingredients though all the natural extracts seemed like they might be fairly light so I tried. This exceeded my expectations, it&#x27;s not oily at all. The extracts absorb into brows easily and leave it feeling moisturized and growing. Finally after over a month and a half, I started to see my brows regrow rapidly. They are becoming thicker and fuller, which is really what I wanted from this product in the first place. The product needs time to work, but if you wait and use it long enough, it’ll definitely make your eyebrows look great again.</li>
            <li> After using it for 3 months, I can say that the product does come upto the expectations and I can observe the difference. Great product.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. I have noticed a tremendous change in brows. Follow directions takes abiut a month to see results</li>
            <li> As I’m getting older, I’m taking more of an interest in quality skincare products.  I purchased Perfect Brows growth ointment based on positive online reviews, and now that I’ve been using it for a few weeks, I can tell it is already beginning to help my eyebrows appear fuller and darker, and has nearly eliminated the need for me to pencil in my eyebrows to darken them.</li>
            <li> Excelent product. Fast results!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders! I over plucked for years and eventually just had to shave off the little bit of hair I had left. I drew my brows on for years because they wouldn&#x27;t grow back right. I now have NORMAL eye brows! It took about 2 months to grow 100% in but it definitely works!</li>
            <li> The smell of very offputting.  And it lingers and lingers......  Gave up after 3 weeks or so and went back to Revitabrow.  Costs a little more, but works better and doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> I would rate this higher if it didn&#x27;t come in a glass container that broke into pieces when it accidentally hit the ground. Also? The product doesn&#x27;t really work and it stings the eyes due to the smell.</li>
            <li> Item received on time and product discription was accurate. I have always had thin brows and with aging they have become almost non-existent. I was using another product, a serum, that was a part of my normal facial routine. I noticed that it was helping to restore my brow, however at a very slow rate. I ordered the Perfect Brow in the hopes of accelerating the process. I have been using the product for about two weeks and can see a difference. Do not expect this to be an overnight process as some reviewers seem to expect. I am using twice daily as suggested.  My only disappointment with the product is the strong odor, so only use in the morning if I am remaining at home. Overall, I am satisfied with Perfect Brow and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> For years I have struggled with lousy eyebrows and didn’t know what to do to enhance them. I asked several friends if they knew anything and many of them didn’t but one friend suggested  I check out the products from Green Touch Beauty. I did some research online and found the Perfect Brows growth accelerator balm, and after reading the reviews and decided to give it a try. I am very pleased with the results, and wanted to add my recommendation on here for the next woman looking to improve her brows.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased I am that a product that came as a free gift is so effective. Using this regularly for the past six weeks has had results beyond my expectations. A mixture of flowers, herbs, and honey worthy of any spa professional has resulted in my eyebrows coming back in nice and thick, just like when I was young. Trust in this brow balm!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The product has a unpleasant smell that I can take it.</li>
            <li> This product works great! I have a nervous bad habit of pulling out my eyebrows. Yes, it&#x27;s a little odd, bad habit. Anyway, I was tired of stenciling in my brows all the time and found this product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using only once a day since June 4th and look how much progress already!!! I know the instructions say use twice a day, but I prefer to do my beauty regime at night.&lt;br /&gt;It looks drastic going on (see pic) and tingles a bit, so be prepared for that.</li>
            <li> It works! Had a scar on one side and over-tweezing on the other. And now I have the beginnings of hair growth on both sides</li>
            <li> smells so bad that I start sneezing after I put it</li>
            <li> My old brows were sorry sights that dragged my entire face down and made me look haggard and older than my years. I knew it but I wasn’t&#x27; ready to admit to myself I needed something till my sister handed me a bottle of this perfect brow eyebrow balm as a gift. Clearly others in my life had noticed them too and it was time for me to do something about them. At first I thought sliding this lightly colored wax type substance on my brows every day seemed silly, downright frivolous even; until the end of the first two weeks when I noticed that even before the balm went on my hairs looked a bit more filled in. Ok that was a step in the right direction I thought and maybe this was indeed doing some work on my brows. From there on in, they just kept getting better and better. My brows looked gradually more nourished, conditioned, and full week after week and slowly the bare spots in them got smaller and smaller until I couldn&#x27;t really tell where they had been anymore. It&#x27;s been four months and I now have a set of wiggle worthy brows that stand out on my face instead of disappearing into the background.</li>
            <li> I had naturally beautiful and thick brows that I used to get threaded about once a month. Last year, my nail place talked me into letting them wax my &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; eyebrows. The first few times it went fine but little by little they were waxing off more than they should have and ruining the shape each time more and more. The last time (about a year ago, they nearly waxed off half my eyebrows...and then went on to assure me that all was fine!! I was devastated. I bought this product after reading all the positive reviews and the fact that it had natural ingredients, but when I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference to my naked eyes within a few weeks, I tried to send it back. The company wrote to me and urged me to stick with it, I decided to listen to them and am so glad I did!! My eyebrows are nearly back to their original shape and glory. Unfortunately eyebrow hairs don&#x27;t grow like hairs on the rest of our body, there are fewer follicles and once they get destroyed from over plucking/waxing/threading, they stop growing altogether! I have been patiently applying this product at night and in the morning and after several months (I think it has been over a year now) of this routine, they are back. My advice if you are contemplating using this would be: Don&#x27;t expect an overnight miracle, eyebrow regrowth is a slow, painstaking process that can take a year or more (It&#x27;s a long marathon, not a sprint). And as long as the follicles aren&#x27;t too damaged, they will grow back with this balm. Taking vitamins that support healthy hair growth doesn&#x27;t hurt either. About a month or so ago I added biotin and keratin to my daily vitamin routine and noticed a huge  uptake in the speed of eyebrow recovery. If you&#x27;re trying to recover from over plucking/over waxing -- All the best, I know your pain all too well and can say that this is a good safe product to stick with to help your body recover naturally over time. Attached is current &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; picture. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a :before&amp;#34; photo -- I was too distraught after the over-waxing!have a :before&amp;#34; photo -- I was too distraught after the over-waxing!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it. It just hasn&#x27;t worked. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month day and night.</li>
            <li> I loved the original formula!...why change it?...the new formula with the cocoa is super hard to use...I have to literally dig in the jar to scrape some out because it&#x27;s so solid.... And I don&#x27;t get that tingling feeling I got with the original.... Please bring it back!</li>
            <li> I have been using it and I haven&#x27;t a difference yet-- but I am going to give it a bit longer... sometimes it takes time...</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about a week, but I can already see some results...I will keep you posted!</li>
            <li> I am seeing a few results. I know it&#x27;s a long process.  Ordered another because my eyebrows are tore up from the floor up and will probably take more than one pot to fix them.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any growth. I put it on religiously, ever day and night, for a month.</li>
            <li> I have no clue what this is. Stumped. Dumbfounded. It looks like the seeds of strawberries all clumped up in this brown thick waxy-like crap. I don&#x27;t know how you keep this on your eyebrows as it is so oddly textured and doesn&#x27;t sit right. I also believe the reason people think their brows look darker is because it has a very, very dark hue to it which makes the brows look darker while it&#x27;s on. I don&#x27;t know how anyone could wear this outside of their home. It is messy and a waste.</li>
            <li> No growth after two months, but enjoy the color/filler aspect. Can get cheaper options at supermarket.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure that many of the reviews on here are fake. I realized this AFTER buying it. Still, it&#x27;s got good quality ingredients. It&#x27;s hard as heck though. Lol. You have to dig the brush in there to get any. It is reddish, so it kinda needs to be used at night. Leaving it on for 15 minutes would do nothing. Leaving it on overnight might have some type of positive effect. It was expensive- and not worth the high cost. My eyebrows look thicker with it on. But not afterwards. Lol. So it&#x27;s kinda pointless. I used it for almost a month. Now it&#x27;s just sitting in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I will not order any more of this product! I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This does not work for me, and is not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It has only been a month but I started to notice a difference in my eyebrows already. Hopefully in a couple of more months I can see even more improvement. By the way it tingles at first when you put it on.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works. I had no hope for my other at home naturals so I was desperate. this is expensive but it&#x27;s worth it! First month I saw results! I have naturally thick eyebrows but I OVERLY plucked then into lines when I was younger and I ruined my eyebrows to where they almost never grew back properly.now I do not need to draw in my eyebrows as they are back!!!</li>
            <li> Weird smell but it works slowly. It has now been 4 weeks and I do see brow growth.</li>
            <li> So far it doesn&#x27;t make too much difference on my brows... I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see if it truly works.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for the regrowing.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is doing anything to my brow. I do like the way it make my brow looks well groomed after applying.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Although it goes on dark, it doesn&#x27;t really matter because you tissue it off within ten minutes or so, per the instructions. After tissuing off, it leaves a slightly brown tint.  I have noticed my brows are thicker and the individual hairs have grown longer in length, providing a nice appearance.  I noticed results within two weeks.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely swear by this product! I have had very thin eyebrows for many years after plucking them away in highschool. I had no hair on the tail of my brows and now they are getting so full! I have been using this religiously every morning and night, I started seeing dramatic results after about 6 weeks. This product lasts about 3 months which is a lot longer than I expected. I am now on my second bottle! I have tried many other brow treatments and never saw results. I recommend this product to anyone who has been struggling to regrow their brows! Do remember to give it some time, and don&#x27;t give up, you will love this product!</li>
            <li> I had to cease using this product unfortunately. I was very excited to have an all in one product to use to thicken my over tweezed brows. My eyes seemed to slightly burn no matter how I used it but twice I also accidentally must have gotten some on a towel and then got some residue in my eye and they felt as if they were on fire. Not a happy incident. But I was willing to live with it for thicker brow hair (oh what we women will endure LOL). But the icing on the cake was when I noticed tiny new bald spots in my eyebrow hairs. By the by...I&#x27;d also had my hormones checked into just in case it was physiological rather than over tweezing that was the cause of the hair not growing in again as they should. Hormones were all perfect and after months of taking Biotin my hair on my head has grown in long but the eyebrows hair is worse than it was before. So long story long, I felt it was necessary to return the product to the seller. What I did like was the fact that the product was tinted and easy to apply and smelled nice…spicy but nice nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Worked great!!!!!!! Took two months and I  used to have thin over plucked eyebrows, now I have perfect thick eyebrows. So happy will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product works well, it&#x27;s not immediate results but that shouldn&#x27;t be expected as the product doesn&#x27;t indicate that it will produce immediate results.  Patience is necessary with this product and any other similar hair growth related product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It honestly made my eyebrows grow in thicker! Love this!!!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Really working. Been a month, seeing real progress.</li>
            <li> It has slightly tingling effect on skin. I also love the scent – some sweet geranium and herbs, smells like sophisticated product.  This balm I have been using this for 3 weeks, and I can definitely see a re-growth in my eyebrows. Overall my eyebrows look darker, shiny and easy to brush in shape. Very happy with the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use it for a month &amp; have seen some results .&lt;br /&gt;Just have to be Patiencet .&lt;br /&gt;😤</li>
            <li> First of all, this company is a pleasure to deal with. I had an issue with my first order, which wasn&#x27;t a fault of the seller but the fault of my mailman instead. They were more than happy to send me another product, free of charge. It didn&#x27;t take them weeks to get back to me either, they responded right away. I appreciate that, it means that a company stands behind their product. As for the treatment itself; it does work. I have the most difficult eyebrows imaginable, and this stuff really helped to tame them. I plan on ordering more as soon as this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Starting to see my eyebrows filling in. It&#x27;s a slow process but it&#x27;s working. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> this product works very well !</li>
            <li> I tried 4 moth according to the instruction but I lose my eyebrow at the end instead growing.</li>
            <li> I usually go to a eyebrow threader for my eyes, but last month I decided to try and do my eyebrows myself. That was a horrible mistake! They were lopsided and asymmetrical and I must admit that I panicked. I called my friend up crying that I messed up and she told me she uses this eyebrow enhancer. Luckily, she gave me the spare she keeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that at first I was skeptical since it didn&#x27;t appear to be working. However, I kept putting it on consistently and after about 6 weeks I noticed that my eyebrows were more symmetrical and even fuller than before. It&#x27;s unusual to say that eyebrows are attractive, but I now think that about my eyebrows :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been an eyebrow saver!</li>
            <li> Have faithful to use as directed; for 3 weeks or so, but do not see results.  Perhaps more time is needed.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows haven&#x27;t been growing in correctly for the past 6 months or so now. I have no idea what happened or why they are so uneven, but It&#x27;s very unflattering. I came across Perfect Brows and figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt giving them a try. After about 2 months, my eyebrows are finally even again and they are growing in correctly. I&#x27;m pleased to report that this product works, which is why I wanted to leave a review. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Figured this was worth a try. Not sure if I got a bad jar, but it is so dry I can barely get any out to use. I haven&#x27;t noticed any of the tingling sensation others have mentioned, and have seen no new growth on my brows. It was definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a month so I can&#x27;t give a complete review.  The directions say that you will notice the difference in two months.  So far all I&#x27;ve noticed is that small hairs seem to be growing in spots where they wouldn&#x27;t before.  But they are few and far between.  I&#x27;ll do another review in a month.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll see a big difference.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed. I used it twice a day and it didn&#x27;t work. The smell is terrible.</li>
            <li> came in all dry....can hardly apply.  I would not buy item again. Ended up trrowing it away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only on my 1st week so I cant say much about long term, but I can already see  a difference. When I first received it I did not think it was going to work. Its like a brown paste oil(not sure how to describe it) and it just didn&#x27;t look like it was going to do anything. Anyway, I applied it with the little brush it came with all over my brows and mostly in the areas I wanted them to grow and fill in. It leaves a brown sheen on your eyebrows which I like because it makes them appear fuller and darker. Its been a week and I can see new hair growth in the beginning of my brows and my brows look fuller and darker. I&#x27;m super excited to see the progress in a couple more weeks.Some people don&#x27;t like the smell but I like it. Smells natural and herbal. I love the fact that it has a lot of natural which is great for the overall health of your brows. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. I purchased after reading other positive reviews but no such luck for me. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> After using a full jar of this product I was somewhat happy with the results. There was some obvious new growth and what was left of my eyebrows were growing in faster. I was thinking maybe giving it 3 stars. I think it said one jar would do it but I decided to try a full second jar before I made my final decision.I am not yet finished with the second jar, but it really did it. My eyebrows are not soft and brown like they were when I was a  young man but they have definitely grown back and I am much, much more confident about the way they look. This is a very thick paste and is not easy to apply. It comes with an applicator that I found absolutely useless. Q-tips also did not work. I finally found the best way to apply it was with the tip of my pinky finger. So it is not a miracle but since I felt that I was destined to spend my life with barely any eyebrows I am thrilled with the results. I do want to note that it did not bring back much if any color and my eyebrows are gray and dye resistant. But I am very happy and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not working yet, been using for about 4-5 weeks, hoping for some decent results sooner then later!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am in my 50&#x27;s and finding not only have my brows are turning grey, they have been thinning out pretty rapidly too.I don&#x27;t have the time or patience to draw on brows with a pencil, also don&#x27;t have the time or money to get tattoos. so I found this wonderful product Perfect Brows and have been using it nightly for a month. I love the creamy texture and the smell of the natural herbs. It works! I have had to actually trim them already.You can feel that it is working with the slight tingle it sends off.I jar lasts a month.</li>
            <li> If you are patient, and care about the products you use on your skin, buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;Anna @ Green Touch has been extremely helpful and kind to me during an order mishap which she graciously remedied, and sent a gift which included a decadent facial oil that is to die for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated, this product does not offer miraculous results in a week because the ingredients are all natural.  It takes time for the body to adjust to being pampered and nurtured before seeing the desired results.  The balm feels wonderful when applied, and the next morning, my brows are much easier to tame, so I am completely in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;I use nothing but all natural products on my skin and hair, plus vitamin E and Castor for my lashes.  This balm is now going to be a permanent part of my daily regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re willing to feed your brows every day and be patient with them while they adjust naturally, this is just the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anna, it’s been a pleasure, and thank you again for all of your assistance.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for about 3 weeks and already can see a little a bit of growth , its not fast growing but there is growth where there wasnt before</li>
            <li> It oddly does seem like it is assisting in growing hair.</li>
            <li> Came in DRY, don&#x27;t understand why the brush comes with it if I barely was able to scoop it with my finger</li>
            <li> Really works!  Got two layers of eye lash in just a few months.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review after eight weeks of use, I will admit that I did not use it twice a day every single day, but I never missed more than one day at a time. Immediately I was not thrilled over the texture of the product while applying. It is dry on the top and somewhat .. Beady.. As it crumbled while applying with a q tip. I now see it is sold with a brush, it was not in November. I found the easiest way to get the product on was to dip the q tip then press product on, I didn&#x27;t care for it right off the bat compared to another product I had used years ago. During the two months I did not use tweezers, I only used the eyebrow razor to clean up the hairs that were obviously very out of place. In the before photo my eye brows had been lightened so I would not say the product itself darkened my brows at all as in the after photo it is my natural color.  Over all I have never gone this long without trying to shape my eyebrows so it is hard to judge whether or not the product had any true effect to the growth. However I have obvious gaps that still have no growth and my expectations were greater than my results. There should also be a better way to apply because I felt like I wasted a lot of the product white using a q tip and had quite a bit of &#x27;fallout&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I had usually applied a small amount two times a day, for about 20-30 minutes each time I use it. It’s pretty difficult to see the results right away, but I continued to see what would happen. Finally after over a month and a half, I started to see my brows regrow rapidly. They are becoming thicker and fuller, which is really what I wanted from this product in the first place. The product needs time to work, probably a few weeks, but if you wait and use it long enough, it’ll definitely make your eyebrows look great again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from sparse eyebrows since high school due to over-plucking. Now that I&#x27;m in my late 20s, they have not grown back in the patchy areas. I was hoping that this product would grow back the patchy areas but I fear it will not due to severely damaged hair follicles. It does do a good job at growing hair IF the hair follicles are healthy and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have the product and will continue to use it as a daily regiment. Perhaps over a long period of time it&#x27;ll improve the condition of my hair follicles.</li>
            <li> Although it takes time, this product helps my eyebrows to go back .. Very very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using this more almost two months. Usually i apply twice a day sometimes only once. But I have seen absolutely no results. Personally, this wasn&#x27;t worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This product has a bit of an odd smell .... and it is a bit greasy and thick ..... I have used it a few times per the instructions to apply it and leave it on for about 10 minutes and then wipe it off .... (I have only used it once per day in the morning while I&#x27;m getting dressed and before applying my make up) .... I&#x27;m not impressed so far .... I have not seen a difference in my brows after a couple weeks of use .... I will need to give it a longer try before saying whether or not it works. But, as for up until now .... it doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23-year-old​ male. I had naturally thick eyebrows, but I started getting eyebrow hair loss about an year ago due to stress, and before I started using this product, the outer halves of my eyebrows were almost invisible in photos. I only used this product two to three times a day, but its effect has surely been taking place. New, strong hairs are growing again and I am absolutely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift as a secret Santa gift exchange at my office, and while I was offended at first, I took a long look in the mirror when I got home and thought “what could it hurt?”  Not a thing as it turns out, I still don’t know who gave me this, but with the way my eyebrows are looking now, I couldn’t be happier.  I’m on my second jar now, and it won’t be the last.</li>
            <li> I got this for quite some time. I didn&#x27;t use it consistently (for the simple reason that I didn&#x27;t give it too much credit and I didn&#x27;t think it will work), but it actually does! I&#x27;ve seen improvements after 2 weeks of using: more hair, darker, healthier. It gave me hope I will be able to reshape my brows (a lady (&amp;#34;well experimented&amp;#34;) &amp;#34;took care&amp;#34; of them).</li>
            <li> balm is everything I wanted when I set out to buy something to help restore my ailing brows to their old glamor. I went through a few crappy eyebrows serums and such first, ones that did little to nothing for me—one even triggered a nasty allergic reaction. I could tell Perfect Brows was different from the moment I opened the jar—that spicy scent had me at hello. A few weeks in, I noticed my eyebrows were becoming smoother and shinier, and a few months in, hairs began popping up here and there at a surprising pace. Despite now having exactly the kind of eyebrows I wanted, I think I will continue to apply Perfect Brows Balm once or twice a week to maintain that look.</li>
            <li> I have darker and fuller eyebrows thanks to this product</li>
            <li> Definitely make my grey, thinning brows darker and fuller</li>
            <li> After losing my eyebrows to chemo, and having them not fully return, I wanted this product to work. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and have not had any change. When I received it, it looked like dried up coffee grounds. I never got the tingling feeling that others got. I honestly think I got an old jar. It didn&#x27;t go on smoothly at all. It was crusty and dry. This isn&#x27;t a cheap purchase. I am highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and a half. I have forgotten to use it quite a few times but it DOES work!</li>
            <li> Old product I guess.  Can&#x27;t put a liberal amount on eyebrow as it&#x27;s too hard.  Must dig out with fingernail and let it melt on eyebrow and then massage.</li>
            <li> I got nice results using this product with pretty good new brow hair growth. I am using it for 3 weeks and see that it&#x27;s working, but still wish it would grow back my eyebrows in shorter time frame. I&#x27;m desperate and need results FAST!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Not really sure I saw any real improvement in the brow growth?</li>
            <li> I am going to be honest, i was very skeptical about using this but after the first 2 weeks i can definitely see a difference. I have tried soooo many other products and none of them seem to work as great as this one does, I will be buying from them again</li>
            <li> I could not get beyond the  odor of this.  I tried it once, but just couldn&#x27;t go back to it another night.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t work and too messy.</li>
            <li> So far I have seen my eyebrows become fuller. I over plucked for many years and needed a solution to regrow my brows this is definitely working. It tingles while on but no biggy. Totally worth the price even though the jar is tiny.</li>
            <li> Works, takes a little time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know yet if this product really works.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant to use, and I&#x27;ve been faithful about using it twice a day for about a month.  I think i might see some results, but I can&#x27;t be sure yet.  Still hoping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had short, thin eyebrows I didn&#x27;t like, and I found this in a friend&#x27;s medicine cabinet while I was visiting. They had never used it, and I asked if I could try it - they agreed, and I began using it regularly. I started feeling like it was a waste of time after a while, but thought there was no harm in keeping it up until it was empty. Then, when I was maybe halfway, two thirds of the way through it, I noticed something. I pulled out a picture I took when I first started using Perfect Brows, for reference, and there was definitely some growth there. It probably started growing sooner than that, but that was when it really became noticeable. It stayed slow throughout, but picked up as I drew closer and closer to running out. I decided to take the plunge and purchase a second order. Now? I&#x27;m making my third order, and I almost look like a different person, my brows have grown so much thicker. I love the way they look, now - this order is mainly to maintain existing growth. It&#x27;s not a miracle &#x27;growth in thirty minutes or it&#x27;s free&#x27; infomercial product, but if you&#x27;re willing to take time and commit for real results, you can&#x27;t do better.</li>
            <li> I have very thick eye brow to the point where when I was younger, I almost have a &amp;#34;uni-brow&amp;#34;, anyways throughout my highschool years, I craved a new look, so i tweezer my eyebrows thinner, and thinner, until I had a very depressing looking what was left to be called, eyebrows... I then tried to grow them out, and they did over time naturally it took almost a year... sadly... UNTIL RECENTLY, I used one of those awful eyebrow shaping razors... and me being the clutz that I am, I shaved nearly half my eyebrow off by accident, ANYWAY, long story short, I was desperate for a product to help these dang brows to grow... I have been using this product for almost a month and SHOCKINGLY, my brows are growing back!!! I love touching my brows because they feel so much thicker!! This product is awesome, I dont usually write reviews on things... I am very happy. The only thing I dont like is the hint of a burning/tingling sensation it gives you... Im sure that is just the oils stimulation the blood circulation or something though</li>
            <li> I would return this product but we don&#x27;t have the original packaging</li>
            <li> So far I have only seen a couple of new hairs in my brow line.  I don&#x27;t know if it takes more time but it has been a couple of months that I am using this product.</li>
            <li> Caused major irritation have to return</li>
            <li> So I love the product and definitely see the difference but I have one major concern. Sometimes I see eyebrow hairs falling out when I am applying it? Is this normal? Has anyone else had this? Is this actually a positive thing (getting rid of the dead follicles?)? Or is it a result of me applying too much? Any answers would be greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> Using this for 2 + weeks and loving the results. I can&#x27;t believe that after that short a time I am already seeing the hair fill in where it was sparse. So happy and can&#x27;t wait to worry less about my brows and all the weekly tinting I used to do to give them shape.</li>
            <li> It actually is thinning my thin brows I can definitely notice a difference, smells amazing ! I still have plenty left and have been using it 2 mos now.</li>
            <li> I have been used for many weeks, but didn&#x27;t see a different.</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost 4 weeks, not sure I&#x27;m seeing any results yet or not...I&#x27;ll keep using it until the jar is empty for sure though!</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product, I was skeptical about all of the positive reviews; they all seemed written in a pretty similar style/context. Also, there were no before/after photos from anyone other than the seller, and there weren&#x27;t any reviews on any other site except for Amazon. Fishy. However, because of the reasonable price, and the all-natural ingredients, I decided to try it.    Yes, the product is hard as a rock. You have to dig a piece out then let in sit on your eyebrow for a few seconds to soften it before spreading it around. No big deal. The packaging is nice, and the included applicator is convenient. The jar is a nice size. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or had any bad reactions. It just hasn&#x27;t worked for me. At all. I have been using this product consistently, twice a day, for almost 2 months and absolutely nothing. No new growth, no added fullness, no nothing. I even emailed the seller to make sure I was using it correctly. Nope. Nada.    I will continue using this product for a few more weeks, as I still have plenty of it left. If something miraculous happens in terms of the product doing what it claims, I will certainly update my review.</li>
            <li> Just like the rest of you girls I overplucked my eyebrows to many times thinking thin was in.  I believe its been 8-10 years now since my eyebrows have completely stopped growing.  Ugh, I didnt know I was damaging my eyebrows.  The balm looks and feels like thick vasaline, except its dark mustard yellow color.  I really like the smell like a refreshing natural lotion.  I will be using twice a day.  Some reviews said this product worked anywhere from just a few days, 1 week, 6 weeks, and at 2 months.  Quite alot of reviews said after using this product in eather a few days to a few weeks they got darker eyebrows, thicker eyebrows, and their eyebrows  resembled bushes! Pretty wild reviews I thought.  So I will use as directed and will hold my breath in anticipation....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REGARDING THE JAR SIZE.... This is a tinnie tiny jar.  My jar was about 80% full.&lt;br /&gt;And from another reviewer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.0 out of 5 stars All I got was an EMPTY JAR, July 14, 2014&lt;br /&gt;By G. Koster \\&quot;Gabby\\&quot; (Ft.

Basically after some research, and from the sellers email.  This actually comes down to your own personal DNA structure.  If you weren&#x27;t supposed to have darker, thicker, bushy eyebrows you won&#x27;t get them.  Now there&#x27;s probably houndreds of these type of lotions, oils, creams out there all claiming to restore, repair, grow faster or whatever for your eyebrows...so buyer beware.  I did have to return the empty bottle for a refund, not sure why?  Did the seller want to see that I had used the bottle? Or maybe fill it back up and resell?I did loose out on the return postage of nearly $7.00. I am all for the natutral vitamins and such, but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.  Now what I will give a try is the original eyebrow cure...which is the TROPIC ISLE LIVING JAMAICAN BLACK CASTOR OIL which is sold here on AMAZON for only a few dollars for 4 OZ.  Also there is ROGIANE, in which I&#x27;ve read to buy the TARGET MALE VERSION and apply a few drops a day to each eyebrow  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003COAFPQ/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_sfl_title_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;A3QW7GNYQZLDG1other day which is horrible for $35 for nothing    UPDATE --- Ok its been nearly 3 months now and no difference whatsoever.

            <li> Great product! and it works! got a lot of compliments how my brows look!</li>
            <li> This product is no good I have extremely thin eyebrows and instead of growing I was losing hair every other day which is horrible for $35 for nothing</li>
            <li> My brows have not looked this good in years! I appreciate the all-natural ingredients, and after about 2 weeks, I can already see a difference in my brows. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m hypothyroid or not (I suspect so), but I could tell that my brows were growing thinner and thinner, especially at the outer edges. I can already see an improvement in this area, and my brows just look healthier and fuller.</li>
            <li> I used to pluck the life out of my eyebrows and now I really want to.grow them back. I&#x27;m only 26 years old and I&#x27;ve been drawing them in with an eyebrow pencil and it&#x27;s really starting to get annoying doing it all the time. So finding out about this product, about how it makes the eyebrows grow fuller thicker and has natural ingredients, I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s been about 4 to 5 weeks and I can already see a difference. I really like the tingling feeling and the smell.</li>
            <li> Been using this twice a day for about two months however I have yet to see any growth.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t not work whatsoever, once I opened it it dried up the next day !!! Thought it was a horrible waste of money and time</li>
            <li> I usually have good experiences with high rates products on amazon. Not this one!!! Of course you&#x27;re going to see brow growth after 2 months, but who wants to wait 2 months for them to grow!!! Better off taking Biotin supplements I had much better luck with that within a month vs. This crap!!!!!</li>
            <li> Ihave not used it long enough to know if its working its suppose to make your eye brows grow thicker  i have not seen any think yet</li>
            <li> Not for me. It is a HARD wax...doesn&#x27;t go on well and has a gritty texture :(</li>
            <li> I bought Perfect Brows balm after comparing the ingredients and price of other comparable eyebrow treatments, and decided that this balm was the right choice.  I was encouraged by all the positive online reviews, and like others, I’ve had dramatic eyebrow growth after using this balm for only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this when I ordered it. But it&#x27;s been about 2 and a half months and this stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not going to give you Cara Delevingne eyebrows if you have naturally thin brows HOWEVER it will grow them much thicker! It&#x27;s amazing! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two months now following all of the instructions on the label. I like this product because I&#x27;ve seen results with my eyebrows growing in sparse areas and growing a little bit longer. But I don&#x27;t love it because it worked for the first month with pretty slow results and, when I hit the second month using this product, it seemed to have worked less and less with no major noticeable difference from the first month. Recently, I cut my use of applying this product twice a day, morning and night, to once a day, mornings only, to see if it will help in any way and it doesn&#x27;t. Now I feel like because it&#x27;s worked to it&#x27;s best ability with my eyebrows then now I just use it to help maintain my eyebrows, knowing that there may be no major results like the full, thick, dark eyebrows I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
            <li> Very Good product ,i can see my eyebrow growing and also it gives a nice brown colour ,very healthy ingredients specially formulated for hair growth, will defenely purchase again of course in a year time because that long will last me based on the amount ,so glad that I finally find the right product,I really must check your other products.thank you</li>
            <li> Despite raving reviews the product did not work for me. I was sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;m half way through my first jar and there&#x27;s a very noticeable difference!!!! I&#x27;m guilty of over plucking and so my eyebrows pretty much stopped growing, this definitely works.</li>
            <li> This product smells like tiger balm. Dense orange substance that will last me all my life. No results so far. I&#x27;m surprised by the reviews, will post again but so far nahhhh! Keep your money.</li>
            <li> This product is impossible to apply, it stinks, and after being persistent for 2 months, there was absolutely no improvement, except that you felt gross because of the smell. Don&#x27;t waist your money!</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Could be a scam like the rest of the products. I was informed that no product could bring back thicker brows. Maybe save what you have left by using these products...word from the Dr.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now it definitely works with time. After a month I notice that my brows were naturally darker. One my right brow it was shorter than the left brow and it&#x27;s been like that for a year or so. I would have to fill it in. By me using this eyebrow  accelerator it has finally even out with my left brow. I use this at least 4-5 times a week at night and leave it on as I sleep. This stuff defineltly works!!!!!</li>
            <li> Personally I think my eyebrows look thicker. They are filling in slowly but surely.  My eyebrows are so thin it looks like I do not have any.  People who say you can tell it is working because it tingles are being silly.  You can tell it tingles when it is tingling but you have to wait at least a week to see a difference.  I think it is easy to use and, if you give it time, works well.</li>
            <li> Made brows fall out, had to return..</li>
            <li> it works...I believe I saw results after two months</li>
            <li> Too clumpy and hard to apply</li>
            <li> Till now, I used it for about two month, and no result. I don&#x27;t like the smell. Doubt it...</li>
            <li> I purchased this item over a month ago and finally got it, which is ok because it was amazons issue not this sellers. she even threw in a free hair growth bottle so thank you &amp;#60;3 IMPORTANT: you might want to apply this with a q tip because if its still on your fingers a little bit and you touch your eye it will burn the hell out it, i learned that the hard way. Just started using it so i don&#x27;t know if it works or not but ill write another update review with my consensus.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  Used it for about two months and saw zilch results.  Thanks, but no thanks!!</li>
            <li> this is too expensive everyone please use castor oil !!!</li>
            <li> this is very horrible and nasty product very very very very very difficult to use hard like rock the product smell nasty and very grease give me a bad headache and i got breakout on my eyebrow</li>
            <li> I have naturally thin eyebrows to where I have to draw them in everyday.  It got annoying after all these years so I decided to give this a try.  After almost 2 months of use (using it twice a day, every day and sometimes even just once a day because I would forget), I didn&#x27;t see ANY results!  Nothing!  Not one hair grew back and I&#x27;m highly disappointed.  It comes in a very tiny container being that it&#x27;s $35.00. I would just use a q-tip to rub the cream onto my eyebrows and let it sit for 10 minutes like the directions say.  Well, that was even more annoying because this stuff stinks and it somewhat feels like a burning sensation after I apply it...not tingling, but burning.  So I immediately stopped using it. I gave this one extra star because the seller refunded my money just like it stated with no questions asked.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows were thinning, then adding insult to injury, I received a bad eyebrow grooming which left a gap that I had to lightly pencil in.  I received the product on October 25, 2014 and started using it immediately.  Initially I used the balm twice a day as recommended.  I really can&#x27;t say when I first noticed a change, but writing this review on January 13, 2015, I can say that my eyebrows are back to normal.  I use it now maybe twice a week for maintenance and nourishment.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product! I was skeptical and did a lot of searching for something to help my eyebrows grow out, and decided on this product. I&#x27;ve tried a few others but this is the only one to show obvious results. I believe to have seen results within the first month. I&#x27;m on my second product and still seeing new growth! It is also a great and considerate company that really takes care of their customers with great customer service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s A good conditioner for brows. Hair will grow back just have to be consistent. You will see results about two months.</li>
            <li> I saw this product dropped a rating since I last checked and RevitaBrows ratings rose. I did not like that. Here is my comparison since I have used both products.  RevitaBrow WILL NOT promote eyebrow hair growth, it will only darken and thicken the eyebrows.  Eyebrow Growth Accelerator Balm PERFECT BROWS does indeed promote eyebrow hair growth. Like the product states it takes a few months to notice results. The package states apply for 10 minutes only. That is a bulls*** marketing technique. If you want the product to work faster leave it on for as long as possible. You will see hairs falling out. Don&#x27;t panic, those are just dead hairs falling out making room for new hairs. I just got my eyebrows waxed and ruined for the very first time so I will inform you the public in a few months how well it works after waxing. The product feels quite pleasant on the skin. Absolutely no irritation. It smells nice too.  If anyone has any additional comparisons please add them. We are all looking for ways to have thicker beautiful eyebrows. Also, somebody please post a comparison between Eyebrow Growth Accelerator Balm PERFECT BROWS compared to NEW! Eyebrows SERUM Growth Accelerator PERFECT BROWS. The same company makes both the products but I haven&#x27;t really tried that one. I am going to be critical and give it only 4 stars because it takes forever to work, but if the hair follicles can grow, they will grow.</li>
            <li> does not work as claimed  have not seen any change after using every day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the Fop (or Dapper Dan) for eye brows, plus it makes them grow!</li>
    </ol>
