            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I can get better sharpeners from the dollar store (as a two pack!).</li>
            <li>that I don&#x27;t even bother to put my eyeliner pencils in the fridge before sharpening any more!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Perfect size and works very well!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I like it better!</li>
            <li>Packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>and it seemed like 99% of reviewers liked it.</li>
            <li>It makes the tip nice and pointy without eating away at it.</li>
            <li>Loving this product.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice point</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it catches the shavings for disposal.</li>
            <li>It sharpens everything nicely.</li>
            <li>Be gentle when sharpening and don&#x27;t jam the pencil in and it will work wonderfully!</li>
            <li>rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon and they were happy to send me a replacement at no cost to me and did not ask me to return the original, which I thought was extremely kind of them considering the sharpener does work.</li>
            <li>This is very nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it just works so perfectly because I use NYX pencils or what, but this is the best sharpener I have ever used in my life!  </li>
            <li>The product came quickly and it works great.</li>
            <li>Very easy to sharpen.  </li>
            <li>Finally, a good cheap sharpener.  </li>
            <li>however they have a lot of good cheap makeup</li>
            <li>i swear its awesome, and to my surprise it comes with a lil stick to clear corrossions.....</li>
            <li>works great, easy to sanitize, and very useful with duel sized sharpener</li>
            <li>Very smooth, and doesn&#x27;t chop up your pencil.</li>
            <li>Fit my new lip crayon perfect.</li>
            <li>I froze my eyeshadow pencil for the day before sharpening and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>so much better than the elf sharpener i had.</li>
            <li>so glad i have this now.</li>
            <li>great price and fast shipping as always through amazon prime.</li>
            <li>I love this sharpener more than my MAC pencil sharpener.  </li>
            <li>Sharpens them without a problem :)     </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better from the vendor.</li>
            <li>the top pops off in my make up bag and spills the shavings everywhere which can be a pain.</li>
            <li>I love NYX.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i love that it has 2 sized holes</li>
            <li>Before I write my review, I want to state that I love the company NYX and</li>
            <li>had there not been so many complications with my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish the top of the sharpener would stay on better.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that I&#x27;m going to buy two more . . .</li>
            <li>I love it, all my pencils now in order</li>
            <li>cuz it makes them literally perfect, no ruff edges or anything, love this tiny thing!</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it has two sizes and holds a the remnants.</li>
            <li>Not only does it have dual (slim/fat) sharpeners, but a protective cover and great price!</li>
            <li>Love NYX products.</li>
            <li>love this pencil sharpener for all kinds of beauty tools</li>
            <li>I got a package of like 20 which is WAY more than I will ever need.</li>
            <li>I like being able to contain the shavings and not get them everywhere.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to use my eye pencils again!</li>
            <li>The sharpener has a piece that flattens put the top of the pencil a bit.</li>
            <li>Really really love it.</li>
            <li>I love the two sizes in one sharpener.  </li>
            <li>I love the NYX sharpener.</li>
            <li>It has 2 sizes to sharpen the jumbo ans the smaller pencils - just perfect!</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I think that is more Bc of the creamy glossy formula to them rather than the sharpener.</li>
            <li>Also be prepared to have shavings fall out all four sides when you pop the lid off the top.</li>
            <li>This was bought as a backup/travel sharpener to a dual unit I bought many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my larger eyebrow wax pencils.</li>
            <li>Love them both.</li>
            <li>There is nothing more to it.</li>
            <li>so I could be sure it would be compatible with my NYX pencils.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I have ruined many eye pencils on shrapeners that \\&quot;chewed up\\&quot; the pencils.</li>
            <li>Getting a point on my eyeliner, eyebrow and lipliner pencils has been a challenging experience.</li>
            <li>very easy to pop the top off and clean out.</li>
            <li>Got it a long time ago and still works great!</li>
            <li>I also live that the shreads are self-contained so this a great sharpener to keep in your purse for on the go.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a cheap yet great quality sharpener that gets the job done well.</li>
            <li>Many of the newer lip and eye pencils are softer and don&#x27;t quite fit into most of the sharpeners on the market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works fine though.</li>
            <li>This is just a really nice sharpener and it&#x27;s perfect for large and regular sized pencils.</li>
            <li>NYX&#x27;s sharpener was made in Germany, so I expected excellent craftsmanship.  </li>
            <li>It great because its compact, clear lid makes it easy to tell when it needs to be emptied.  </li>
            <li>The lid pops off easily, but stays put while in use.</li>
            <li>This is a great sharp sharpener way better than I thought!</li>
            <li>It shaves easily</li>
            <li>It does a great job on the big eye pencils that I love to use and also on the thinner ones for my brows.  </li>
            <li>I took the top and bottom covers off, so I can clean the sharpener easily, and so doesn&#x27;t leave the shavings sitting in the unit, accumulating.</li>
            <li>Easy lid snaps off to dump out shavings.</li>
            <li>This one sharpens my chubby pencils just fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine, she looks like a Disney witch now.</li>
            <li>sharpens my eyebrow pencils to a fine point.</li>
            <li>It sharpens just fine.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This little sharpener is the best I&#x27;ve found for eye liner/brow pencils.</li>
            <li>and everybody said this one was so huge</li>
            <li>it comes free.</li>
            <li>This item definitely sharpened the way I needed it to, and I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It makes a nice point, without sacrificing too much product.</li>
            <li>All sizes fit into this</li>
            <li>I wanted this one to sharpen lip pencils which are larger than eye pencils, and it works great.</li>
            <li>great for my big fat pencils</li>
            <li>great for 2 different types of  pencil or my eye liner pencils.</li>
            <li>Also works great for sharpening NARS lip pencils and regular sized pencils.</li>
            <li>The NYX sharpener works so smoothly</li>
            <li>After reviewing what I could use or How I should sharpen those types of liners, I found out great reviews about the urban decay that costs $20 dlls.</li>
            <li>Can anyone tell me if this will fit a 1/2 in lipstick.</li>
            <li>Not that cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I thought it was maybe just the way that the NYX pencils were since they&#x27;re on the cheap side.  </li>
            <li>--it makes it easy to clean out the inside when the tip of a pencil breaks off and gets stuck.</li>
            <li>and it fit the biggest pencils</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick, only took two days, product was exactly as described and works great!</li>
            <li>After trying many devices this little guy works beautifully.</li>
            <li>This is such a good eyeliner sharpener - I love that the lid holds in the shavings and you can quick release them into the trash.</li>
            <li>Needed a new sharpener and I love this one!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly even on some eyeliner pencils that I&#x27;ve had tremendous trouble with.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for travel as well as use at home since it small.  </li>
            <li>comes with a needle-like to clean the sharpener.</li>
            <li>Not the easiest to clean, but it does have a nifty tool that helps get the gunk out.</li>
            <li>Sharpens perfectly and holds the mess in the case until your ready to get rid of it!</li>
            <li>Very cheap and worth it if you consistently use pencils for your eyes, brows, etc.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as expected for a great price.</li>
            <li>I wish it weren&#x27;t true, but each makeup manufacturer does seem to sell a specialized sharpener for it&#x27;s lip and eye pencils.</li>
            <li>Simple, functional and dirt-cheap despite good quality.</li>
            <li>this is a good sharpener for the nyx jumbo pencils and as a regular eye pencil sharpener.</li>
            <li>I especially needed a good one for \\&quot;fat\\&quot; pencils.  </li>
            <li>For the price, its not bad,</li>
            <li>I was looking all over for a sharpener that would sharpen very large eye shadow pencils - this is it!  </li>
            <li>great quality Will buy another one for my other make up bag</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good sharper worth the extra money .</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super creamy</li>
            <li>I had bought the L&#x27;oreal Liquid Pencil Eyeliner and though I loved how pigmented it was; I wasted most of the pencil trying to get it sharpened as the liner tip kept on getting botched or breaking off.</li>
            <li>Am very pleased with this simple product!</li>
            <li>After searching and searching, I have finally found The One: a pencil sharpener in which my extra large eyeshadow pencils fit perfectly!</li>
            <li>The large side has no problem with sharpening my wax tool and the small side was perfect for my mini eyeliner from a Halloween makeup kit.  </li>
            <li>It works perfectly for my pencils both small and large sizes and hasn&#x27;t yet clogged up.</li>
            <li>and it was VERY INEXPENSIVE!!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I need it to do!</li>
            <li>Sharpens my eye pencils very precisely compared to my old sharpener.</li>
            <li>This is a great little eyeliner sharpener.</li>
            <li>This sharpener is one great little tool for sharpening eye pencils of every kind.....narrow and chubby pencils, alike.</li>
            <li>My Girlfriend is finally glad to have a decent sharpener that doesn&#x27;t break on first couple uses.</li>
            <li>it sharpened easily and amazingly for my tarte pencils, and my other pencils as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li>I really like this sharpener because it is practical and cheap.</li>
            <li>Worked fabulous and reasonable price as well.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>but for the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li>I am getting more to replace my old ones.  </li>
            <li>I got this to sharpen regular pencils and more importantly, my Nars velvet matte lips pencils.</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and I have had no issues getting a nice fine point.</li>
            <li>the other is for my mom, she loved it.</li>
            <li>The price was right knowing that I might not need it after the show.</li>
            <li>Great little sharpener!</li>
            <li>Sharpens nice and smooth and even, and doesn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li>I broke the tips of my new NARS lip pencils and didn&#x27;t have a sharpener that fit them.</li>
            <li>When the product is on the waxy side, the product sometimes gets stuck but easy enough to clean the sharpener out with a q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have some jumbo eye liners that didn&#x27;t fit in my normal eye liner sharpener, so I could never sharpen them, now I can thanks to this jumbo opening in the sharpener!</li>
            <li>Does a great job on my Wet and Wild pencils</li>
            <li>For something as simply as a sharpener I never would usually write a product review, but seriouselybthis sharpener out of sooo many I&#x27;ve used my whole life, is really really good!</li>
            <li>This came very fast.</li>
            <li>it sharpens very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t struggle to sharpen bigger eye pencils.</li>
            <li>smooth, sharp, and fits all sizes (purchased specifically for nyx eyebrow wax pencil — perfict fit!).</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the cover falls off super easily.  </li>
            <li>Great sharpener for both large and small pencils.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking hard for a great sharpener.</li>
            <li>They both work great on hard to sharpener make-up pencils.</li>
            <li>It catches the shavings so you don&#x27;t make a mess while you&#x27;re sharpening, and both the top and bottom panels are removable for easy emptying and cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I guess the angle of the sharpener is the best part since it doesn&#x27;t turn my pencils into weird shapes...</li>
            <li>a real jumbo sharpener!</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>I was hunting for a sharpener big enough for my Urban Decay eye shadow pencils, and this fits them perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love that I can sharpen different sized pencils with it.</li>
            <li>Thanks in advance!</li>
            <li>If you have tried the sharpeners from the drug store and your big eye pencils don&#x27;t fit, buy this sharpener!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just gonna sell them for a dollar each though haha!</li>
            <li>Sharpener is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>When I got this I was surprise that I could actually use it and have not problems. :)</li>
            <li>It sharpens the eye liners &amp; the lip liners pretty well.</li>
            <li>At first I thought perhaps they are in the box, but I couldn&#x27;t find them..</li>
            <li>Top pops open while in use.</li>
            <li>Now I have dragon lady red lips again:)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It was wrapped up in a cardboard box with no padding which caused the sharpener to get pretty scratched up making it look used.</li>
            <li>NYX sharpener was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Sharpens all my pencils very well without over sharpening!</li>
            <li>After going through several cheap sharpeners, which became dull or fell apart, this NYX is a good product and sharpens eyeliner and lipliner pencils to a fine point.  </li>
            <li>Love that this fits us to 3 different sizes of pencils, and is nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>Never too much taken offf or too little, it sharpens it perfectly and evenly, I&#x27;m impressed with this little sucker here!</li>
            <li>It sharpens really nicely also, doesn&#x27;t catch like other sharpeners.</li>
            <li>My lip liners are nice and sharp again.</li>
            <li>It consistently takes a large chuck off one side and then the pencil will spin, never sharpening the rest of the pencil.  </li>
            <li>The size is a little off for other large shadow pencils but it is perfect for its purpose.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast efficient service!</li>
            <li>It came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made as well, had bought the NYX eyeshadow pencils and nothing was big enough to sharpen them, I waited because I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much on this thing!!!!</li>
            <li>so I could sharpen my NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil Shadow Liner, but I love how it has a smaller sharpener hole for normal sized pencil liners.</li>
            <li>It even has a back that keeps all the shavings in one place and easy to dump.  </li>
            <li>I needed a large sharpener for my NYX wax brow pencil and this one fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>Would certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>/o&#x27;s large pencils</li>
            <li>But she&#x27;s dead sexy, and that&#x27;s all that counts!</li>
            <li>The sharpener work very well.</li>
            <li>So make sure you empty it before putting it bag in your cosmetics bag</li>
            <li>So basically I really like this</li>
            <li>What else can you really ask of a sharpener?</li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t disappoint and yet again, they didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The item was sent with free 2 day shipping, and I often hound the tracking numbers when I order items and noticed that this second sharpener had also become damaged in transit</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and it looked very crappy.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much that I can really say.</li>
            <li>It works really well...</li>
            <li>, it wouldn&#x27;t really &#x27;catch&#x27; onto the pencil and start sharpening.</li>
            <li>This is a nice sharpener with two different sizes to sharpen, however I think I could have found one cheeper at my local discount store or beauty supply.</li>
            <li>It also helps me to reach that $35 needed when I&#x27;m just a little short for free shipping!!!</li>
            <li>So far, the blades are nice and sharp and perform well.</li>
            <li>Perfect for jumbo pencils, others that I&#x27;ve bought in the past were not big enough.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other sharpener I have used over the years.</li>
            <li>The product came as shown and the shipping was fast; this seller is also highly recommended as a result.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, just a sharpener, but works for smaller makeup pencils and thicker ones, sharpens well, does the job, recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It works even better than some of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected, really works and a snap to clean out shavings, takes less than 1/2 a second to remove shavings and put plastic top back on!</li>
            <li>If you too have been having this problem, I highly recommend this sharpener.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The tip of the eyeliner gets flattened, not sharp enough to make a fine line, which is what I need.</li>
            <li>My new favorite and only sharpener, I use this only for my eyebrow pencils.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it came with a little pick to remove excess product, but I like that you can remove the top to get into hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>sharpens to a sharp point, it is designed to easily catch the shavings and keep things neat.  </li>
            <li>Wow this really does work.  </li>
            <li>There are a few top rated ones that come up through Amazon search - a few cheaper than this one, but this one had the most reviews, so I thought &amp;#34;why not.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>NYX is a very smart company that made a jumbo pencil that would not fit any other sharpener but their own brand.</li>
            <li>and they were tossed into a LARGE Manila envelope with no other protection</li>
            <li>I needed a large sharpener for my NARS lip pencil, but didn&#x27;t want to spend much on something I will inevitably lose, so I skipped the NARS one this time around and got this one.  </li>
            <li>it is huge, sharp and comes with biult-in shaving collector.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed for my new NYX jumbo lip liners.  </li>
            <li>so to speak...needed a new one and ordered this one.  </li>
            <li>so I knew it was time to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>the lid at first is hard to come off but easy on and off.</li>
            <li>Great for extra hard traditional pencils.</li>
            <li>I got this Nyx sharpener to sharpen my Urban Decay, L&#x27;Oreal Paris, Bobbi Brown, NYX, and many other brands of eyeliners, eyebrow pencils, and lip liners.</li>
            <li>I have bought many other sharpener before, including some big brand product.</li>
            <li>No uneven sharpening, wish I would have bought this years ago!</li>
            <li>It works exactly the same!  </li>
            <li>This way, I can empty the shaved contents into the trash when it&#x27;s full.</li>
            <li>so I tried doing it lightly and the tip would still break, I got halfway down the pencil.</li>
            <li>DOES NOT WORK WITH EXTRA LARGE PENCILS</li>
            <li>It accommodates the large liner pencils and the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to buy this because I thought that it would be cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super sharp.</li>
            <li>Does its job without chopping off the soft pencil part.</li>
            <li>Again I have several of these when I order a whole kit</li>
            <li>but this one catches everything until you&#x27;re ready to open and discard the remaining pieces.</li>
            <li>A THIRD sharpener was sent to me, again at no additional cost with free 2 day shipping, and when I received it it was all in one piece but the only packaging it had was some standard cardboard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really needed a pencil sharpener for a big liner that I have.</li>
            <li>I needed a sharpener to replace my old one that I probably had for 5 + years.</li>
            <li>This sharpener works on fat pencils, like the Urban Decay lip pencil and Benefit High Brow.</li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low, and this one works so well.  </li>
            <li>I mean, the Scrooge in me agonized over shelling out $26 for a lip pencil (if only the Dolce Vita wasn&#x27;t so amazing), so I definitely didn&#x27;t want to pay the premium for the jumbo sharpener from Nars.</li>
            <li>It is essential to have specially if you use ÑYX jumbo pens as it is the only way to sharpen such  big a pen.</li>
            <li>This sharpener and the Maybelline New York Expert Tools Dual Sharpener are very similar.</li>
            <li>Mine didn&#x27;t fit, I bought it for my lipstick of the same brand, for some reason it does not fit.</li>
            <li>This is the only sharpener that can sharpen my NYX Jumbo pencils and it comes with a little stick like object to clean excess product out of the sharpener.</li>
            <li>I have bought several other make up pencil sharpeners to sharpen my NYX jumbo pencils and haven&#x27;t had any success with them.</li>
            <li>Most other sharpeners will not fit their pencils.</li>
            <li>It was delivered super quick and it couldn&#x27;t go wrong with that price.</li>
            <li>It also came carefully packaged and within a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Finally, one that works on soft pencils.</li>
            <li>Both thick and thinner eye pencils fit to sharpen with this tool.</li>
            <li>Knowing that one day mine will quit working, and having been severly disappointed with the Cover Girl sharpener I bought recently (made in China), I saw that this NYX one has German-made blades -- as does my original -- and knew THAT was the secret to a perfect cut.  </li>
            <li>What can I say, it is a makeup sharpener, lol, how can you go wrong, it doesn&#x27;t mess up your pencils and leave you with split or chipped wood.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, my issue is not with the item, and not even with the customer support as it was stellar the whole time, my issue is with the fact that two items had to break before I received my item in one piece, not to mention the third could have very well broken the same way since it had no protective bubble wrap or anything.</li>
            <li>I did throw out the oldest eye liner sharpeners, they didn&#x27;t sharp very well</li>
            <li>I suspect I could have gotten this a little cheaper at a big box store, but it was worth it not to have to hunt for it in the makeup section with kids in tow.</li>
            <li>Although I did find exact sharpener but with different logo on it for $2 less</li>
            <li>I had an old Avon Big Color Eye Pencil that my dad used to have to sharpen for me with a blade because no commercial eye pencil sharpener was big enough, until I bought this one!</li>
            <li>so it catches the loose parts obviously, &amp; like how it&#x27;s clear, unlike some</li>
            <li>I bought a Tweezerman and my large pencils from Smashbox did not fit.  </li>
            <li>i dont know how it could be good or bad, it sharpens.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth to operate and truly does the best at its job!</li>
            <li> As good as the designer brands.</li>
            <li> good for the price</li>
            <li> Good sharpener.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product it sharpens all kinds of different brands perfectly and even fits jumbo eyeliners perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Got it to sharpen my Nyx Eyebrow Push Up Bra doublesided pencil (which I&#x27;m in love with) and it works great for that.</li>
            <li> I am VERY VERY PLEASED with this sharpener.  </li>
            <li> This one fits and I am so happy :)</li>
            <li> Lol :))</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> This is a great seller, two thumbs way up :]</li>
            <li> Very pleased</li>
            <li> I love that it has the outer case so the shavings don&#x27;t go everywhere!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I can get better sharpeners from the dollar store (as a two pack!).</li>
            <li> that I don&#x27;t even bother to put my eyeliner pencils in the fridge before sharpening any more!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect size and works very well!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I like it better!</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> and it seemed like 99% of reviewers liked it.</li>
            <li> It makes the tip nice and pointy without eating away at it.</li>
            <li> Loving this product.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice point</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it catches the shavings for disposal.</li>
            <li> It sharpens everything nicely.</li>
            <li> Be gentle when sharpening and don&#x27;t jam the pencil in and it will work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon and they were happy to send me a replacement at no cost to me and did not ask me to return the original, which I thought was extremely kind of them considering the sharpener does work.</li>
            <li> This is very nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it just works so perfectly because I use NYX pencils or what, but this is the best sharpener I have ever used in my life!  </li>
            <li> The product came quickly and it works great.</li>
            <li> Very easy to sharpen.  </li>
            <li> Finally, a good cheap sharpener.  </li>
            <li> however they have a lot of good cheap makeup</li>
            <li> i swear its awesome, and to my surprise it comes with a lil stick to clear corrossions.....</li>
            <li> works great, easy to sanitize, and very useful with duel sized sharpener</li>
            <li> Very smooth, and doesn&#x27;t chop up your pencil.</li>
            <li> Fit my new lip crayon perfect.</li>
            <li> I froze my eyeshadow pencil for the day before sharpening and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> so much better than the elf sharpener i had.</li>
            <li> so glad i have this now.</li>
            <li> great price and fast shipping as always through amazon prime.</li>
            <li> I love this sharpener more than my MAC pencil sharpener.  </li>
            <li> Sharpens them without a problem :)     </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better from the vendor.</li>
            <li> the top pops off in my make up bag and spills the shavings everywhere which can be a pain.</li>
            <li> I love NYX.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i love that it has 2 sized holes</li>
            <li> Before I write my review, I want to state that I love the company NYX and</li>
            <li> had there not been so many complications with my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish the top of the sharpener would stay on better.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that I&#x27;m going to buy two more . . .</li>
            <li> I love it, all my pencils now in order</li>
            <li> cuz it makes them literally perfect, no ruff edges or anything, love this tiny thing!</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it has two sizes and holds a the remnants.</li>
            <li> Not only does it have dual (slim/fat) sharpeners, but a protective cover and great price!</li>
            <li> Love NYX products.</li>
            <li> love this pencil sharpener for all kinds of beauty tools</li>
            <li> I got a package of like 20 which is WAY more than I will ever need.</li>
            <li> I like being able to contain the shavings and not get them everywhere.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to use my eye pencils again!</li>
            <li> The sharpener has a piece that flattens put the top of the pencil a bit.</li>
            <li> Really really love it.</li>
            <li> I love the two sizes in one sharpener.  </li>
            <li> I love the NYX sharpener.</li>
            <li> It has 2 sizes to sharpen the jumbo ans the smaller pencils - just perfect!</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> I think that is more Bc of the creamy glossy formula to them rather than the sharpener.</li>
            <li> Also be prepared to have shavings fall out all four sides when you pop the lid off the top.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a backup/travel sharpener to a dual unit I bought many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my larger eyebrow wax pencils.</li>
            <li> Love them both.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more to it.</li>
            <li> so I could be sure it would be compatible with my NYX pencils.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have ruined many eye pencils on shrapeners that \\&quot;chewed up\\&quot; the pencils.</li>
            <li> Getting a point on my eyeliner, eyebrow and lipliner pencils has been a challenging experience.</li>
            <li> very easy to pop the top off and clean out.</li>
            <li> Got it a long time ago and still works great!</li>
            <li> I also live that the shreads are self-contained so this a great sharpener to keep in your purse for on the go.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a cheap yet great quality sharpener that gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> Many of the newer lip and eye pencils are softer and don&#x27;t quite fit into most of the sharpeners on the market.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works fine though.</li>
            <li> This is just a really nice sharpener and it&#x27;s perfect for large and regular sized pencils.</li>
            <li> NYX&#x27;s sharpener was made in Germany, so I expected excellent craftsmanship.  </li>
            <li> It great because its compact, clear lid makes it easy to tell when it needs to be emptied.  </li>
            <li> The lid pops off easily, but stays put while in use.</li>
            <li> This is a great sharp sharpener way better than I thought!</li>
            <li> It shaves easily</li>
            <li> It does a great job on the big eye pencils that I love to use and also on the thinner ones for my brows.  </li>
            <li> I took the top and bottom covers off, so I can clean the sharpener easily, and so doesn&#x27;t leave the shavings sitting in the unit, accumulating.</li>
            <li> Easy lid snaps off to dump out shavings.</li>
            <li> This one sharpens my chubby pencils just fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine, she looks like a Disney witch now.</li>
            <li> sharpens my eyebrow pencils to a fine point.</li>
            <li> It sharpens just fine.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This little sharpener is the best I&#x27;ve found for eye liner/brow pencils.</li>
            <li> and everybody said this one was so huge</li>
            <li> it comes free.</li>
            <li> This item definitely sharpened the way I needed it to, and I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It makes a nice point, without sacrificing too much product.</li>
            <li> All sizes fit into this</li>
            <li> I wanted this one to sharpen lip pencils which are larger than eye pencils, and it works great.</li>
            <li> great for my big fat pencils</li>
            <li> great for 2 different types of  pencil or my eye liner pencils.</li>
            <li> Also works great for sharpening NARS lip pencils and regular sized pencils.</li>
            <li> The NYX sharpener works so smoothly</li>
            <li> After reviewing what I could use or How I should sharpen those types of liners, I found out great reviews about the urban decay that costs $20 dlls.</li>
            <li> Can anyone tell me if this will fit a 1/2 in lipstick.</li>
            <li> Not that cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I thought it was maybe just the way that the NYX pencils were since they&#x27;re on the cheap side.  </li>
            <li> --it makes it easy to clean out the inside when the tip of a pencil breaks off and gets stuck.</li>
            <li> and it fit the biggest pencils</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick, only took two days, product was exactly as described and works great!</li>
            <li> After trying many devices this little guy works beautifully.</li>
            <li> This is such a good eyeliner sharpener - I love that the lid holds in the shavings and you can quick release them into the trash.</li>
            <li> Needed a new sharpener and I love this one!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly even on some eyeliner pencils that I&#x27;ve had tremendous trouble with.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for travel as well as use at home since it small.  </li>
            <li> comes with a needle-like to clean the sharpener.</li>
            <li> Not the easiest to clean, but it does have a nifty tool that helps get the gunk out.</li>
            <li> Sharpens perfectly and holds the mess in the case until your ready to get rid of it!</li>
            <li> Very cheap and worth it if you consistently use pencils for your eyes, brows, etc.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as expected for a great price.</li>
            <li> I wish it weren&#x27;t true, but each makeup manufacturer does seem to sell a specialized sharpener for it&#x27;s lip and eye pencils.</li>
            <li> Simple, functional and dirt-cheap despite good quality.</li>
            <li> this is a good sharpener for the nyx jumbo pencils and as a regular eye pencil sharpener.</li>
            <li> I especially needed a good one for \\&quot;fat\\&quot; pencils.  </li>
            <li> For the price, its not bad,</li>
            <li> I was looking all over for a sharpener that would sharpen very large eye shadow pencils - this is it!  </li>
            <li> great quality Will buy another one for my other make up bag</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good sharper worth the extra money .</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super creamy</li>
            <li> I had bought the L&#x27;oreal Liquid Pencil Eyeliner and though I loved how pigmented it was; I wasted most of the pencil trying to get it sharpened as the liner tip kept on getting botched or breaking off.</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with this simple product!</li>
            <li> After searching and searching, I have finally found The One: a pencil sharpener in which my extra large eyeshadow pencils fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> The large side has no problem with sharpening my wax tool and the small side was perfect for my mini eyeliner from a Halloween makeup kit.  </li>
            <li> It works perfectly for my pencils both small and large sizes and hasn&#x27;t yet clogged up.</li>
            <li> and it was VERY INEXPENSIVE!!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I need it to do!</li>
            <li> Sharpens my eye pencils very precisely compared to my old sharpener.</li>
            <li> This is a great little eyeliner sharpener.</li>
            <li> This sharpener is one great little tool for sharpening eye pencils of every kind.....narrow and chubby pencils, alike.</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend is finally glad to have a decent sharpener that doesn&#x27;t break on first couple uses.</li>
            <li> it sharpened easily and amazingly for my tarte pencils, and my other pencils as we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> I really like this sharpener because it is practical and cheap.</li>
            <li> Worked fabulous and reasonable price as well.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> but for the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li> I am getting more to replace my old ones.  </li>
            <li> I got this to sharpen regular pencils and more importantly, my Nars velvet matte lips pencils.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and I have had no issues getting a nice fine point.</li>
            <li> the other is for my mom, she loved it.</li>
            <li> The price was right knowing that I might not need it after the show.</li>
            <li> Great little sharpener!</li>
            <li> Sharpens nice and smooth and even, and doesn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> I broke the tips of my new NARS lip pencils and didn&#x27;t have a sharpener that fit them.</li>
            <li> When the product is on the waxy side, the product sometimes gets stuck but easy enough to clean the sharpener out with a q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have some jumbo eye liners that didn&#x27;t fit in my normal eye liner sharpener, so I could never sharpen them, now I can thanks to this jumbo opening in the sharpener!</li>
            <li> Does a great job on my Wet and Wild pencils</li>
            <li> For something as simply as a sharpener I never would usually write a product review, but seriouselybthis sharpener out of sooo many I&#x27;ve used my whole life, is really really good!</li>
            <li> This came very fast.</li>
            <li> it sharpens very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t struggle to sharpen bigger eye pencils.</li>
            <li> smooth, sharp, and fits all sizes (purchased specifically for nyx eyebrow wax pencil — perfict fit!).</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the cover falls off super easily.  </li>
            <li> Great sharpener for both large and small pencils.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking hard for a great sharpener.</li>
            <li> They both work great on hard to sharpener make-up pencils.</li>
            <li> It catches the shavings so you don&#x27;t make a mess while you&#x27;re sharpening, and both the top and bottom panels are removable for easy emptying and cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I guess the angle of the sharpener is the best part since it doesn&#x27;t turn my pencils into weird shapes...</li>
            <li> a real jumbo sharpener!</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> I was hunting for a sharpener big enough for my Urban Decay eye shadow pencils, and this fits them perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love that I can sharpen different sized pencils with it.</li>
            <li> Thanks in advance!</li>
            <li> If you have tried the sharpeners from the drug store and your big eye pencils don&#x27;t fit, buy this sharpener!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just gonna sell them for a dollar each though haha!</li>
            <li> Sharpener is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> When I got this I was surprise that I could actually use it and have not problems. :)</li>
            <li> It sharpens the eye liners &amp; the lip liners pretty well.</li>
            <li> At first I thought perhaps they are in the box, but I couldn&#x27;t find them..</li>
            <li> Top pops open while in use.</li>
            <li> Now I have dragon lady red lips again:)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It was wrapped up in a cardboard box with no padding which caused the sharpener to get pretty scratched up making it look used.</li>
            <li> NYX sharpener was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Sharpens all my pencils very well without over sharpening!</li>
            <li> After going through several cheap sharpeners, which became dull or fell apart, this NYX is a good product and sharpens eyeliner and lipliner pencils to a fine point.  </li>
            <li> Love that this fits us to 3 different sizes of pencils, and is nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> Never too much taken offf or too little, it sharpens it perfectly and evenly, I&#x27;m impressed with this little sucker here!</li>
            <li> It sharpens really nicely also, doesn&#x27;t catch like other sharpeners.</li>
            <li> My lip liners are nice and sharp again.</li>
            <li> It consistently takes a large chuck off one side and then the pencil will spin, never sharpening the rest of the pencil.  </li>
            <li> The size is a little off for other large shadow pencils but it is perfect for its purpose.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast efficient service!</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made as well, had bought the NYX eyeshadow pencils and nothing was big enough to sharpen them, I waited because I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much on this thing!!!!</li>
            <li> so I could sharpen my NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil Shadow Liner, but I love how it has a smaller sharpener hole for normal sized pencil liners.</li>
            <li> It even has a back that keeps all the shavings in one place and easy to dump.  </li>
            <li> I needed a large sharpener for my NYX wax brow pencil and this one fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> Would certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> /o&#x27;s large pencils</li>
            <li> But she&#x27;s dead sexy, and that&#x27;s all that counts!</li>
            <li> The sharpener work very well.</li>
            <li> So make sure you empty it before putting it bag in your cosmetics bag</li>
            <li> So basically I really like this</li>
            <li> What else can you really ask of a sharpener?</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t disappoint and yet again, they didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The item was sent with free 2 day shipping, and I often hound the tracking numbers when I order items and noticed that this second sharpener had also become damaged in transit</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and it looked very crappy.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much that I can really say.</li>
            <li> It works really well...</li>
            <li> , it wouldn&#x27;t really &#x27;catch&#x27; onto the pencil and start sharpening.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sharpener with two different sizes to sharpen, however I think I could have found one cheeper at my local discount store or beauty supply.</li>
            <li> It also helps me to reach that $35 needed when I&#x27;m just a little short for free shipping!!!</li>
            <li> So far, the blades are nice and sharp and perform well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for jumbo pencils, others that I&#x27;ve bought in the past were not big enough.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other sharpener I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> The product came as shown and the shipping was fast; this seller is also highly recommended as a result.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, just a sharpener, but works for smaller makeup pencils and thicker ones, sharpens well, does the job, recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It works even better than some of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected, really works and a snap to clean out shavings, takes less than 1/2 a second to remove shavings and put plastic top back on!</li>
            <li> If you too have been having this problem, I highly recommend this sharpener.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The tip of the eyeliner gets flattened, not sharp enough to make a fine line, which is what I need.</li>
            <li> My new favorite and only sharpener, I use this only for my eyebrow pencils.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came with a little pick to remove excess product, but I like that you can remove the top to get into hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> sharpens to a sharp point, it is designed to easily catch the shavings and keep things neat.  </li>
            <li> Wow this really does work.  </li>
            <li> There are a few top rated ones that come up through Amazon search - a few cheaper than this one, but this one had the most reviews, so I thought &amp;#34;why not.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> NYX is a very smart company that made a jumbo pencil that would not fit any other sharpener but their own brand.</li>
            <li> and they were tossed into a LARGE Manila envelope with no other protection</li>
            <li> I needed a large sharpener for my NARS lip pencil, but didn&#x27;t want to spend much on something I will inevitably lose, so I skipped the NARS one this time around and got this one.  </li>
            <li> it is huge, sharp and comes with biult-in shaving collector.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my new NYX jumbo lip liners.  </li>
            <li> so to speak...needed a new one and ordered this one.  </li>
            <li> so I knew it was time to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> the lid at first is hard to come off but easy on and off.</li>
            <li> Great for extra hard traditional pencils.</li>
            <li> I got this Nyx sharpener to sharpen my Urban Decay, L&#x27;Oreal Paris, Bobbi Brown, NYX, and many other brands of eyeliners, eyebrow pencils, and lip liners.</li>
            <li> I have bought many other sharpener before, including some big brand product.</li>
            <li> No uneven sharpening, wish I would have bought this years ago!</li>
            <li> It works exactly the same!  </li>
            <li> This way, I can empty the shaved contents into the trash when it&#x27;s full.</li>
            <li> so I tried doing it lightly and the tip would still break, I got halfway down the pencil.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK WITH EXTRA LARGE PENCILS</li>
            <li> It accommodates the large liner pencils and the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this because I thought that it would be cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super sharp.</li>
            <li> Does its job without chopping off the soft pencil part.</li>
            <li> Again I have several of these when I order a whole kit</li>
            <li> but this one catches everything until you&#x27;re ready to open and discard the remaining pieces.</li>
            <li> A THIRD sharpener was sent to me, again at no additional cost with free 2 day shipping, and when I received it it was all in one piece but the only packaging it had was some standard cardboard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really needed a pencil sharpener for a big liner that I have.</li>
            <li> I needed a sharpener to replace my old one that I probably had for 5 + years.</li>
            <li> This sharpener works on fat pencils, like the Urban Decay lip pencil and Benefit High Brow.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low, and this one works so well.  </li>
            <li> I mean, the Scrooge in me agonized over shelling out $26 for a lip pencil (if only the Dolce Vita wasn&#x27;t so amazing), so I definitely didn&#x27;t want to pay the premium for the jumbo sharpener from Nars.</li>
            <li> It is essential to have specially if you use ÑYX jumbo pens as it is the only way to sharpen such  big a pen.</li>
            <li> This sharpener and the Maybelline New York Expert Tools Dual Sharpener are very similar.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t fit, I bought it for my lipstick of the same brand, for some reason it does not fit.</li>
            <li> This is the only sharpener that can sharpen my NYX Jumbo pencils and it comes with a little stick like object to clean excess product out of the sharpener.</li>
            <li> I have bought several other make up pencil sharpeners to sharpen my NYX jumbo pencils and haven&#x27;t had any success with them.</li>
            <li> Most other sharpeners will not fit their pencils.</li>
            <li> It was delivered super quick and it couldn&#x27;t go wrong with that price.</li>
            <li> It also came carefully packaged and within a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Finally, one that works on soft pencils.</li>
            <li> Both thick and thinner eye pencils fit to sharpen with this tool.</li>
            <li> Knowing that one day mine will quit working, and having been severly disappointed with the Cover Girl sharpener I bought recently (made in China), I saw that this NYX one has German-made blades -- as does my original -- and knew THAT was the secret to a perfect cut.  </li>
            <li> What can I say, it is a makeup sharpener, lol, how can you go wrong, it doesn&#x27;t mess up your pencils and leave you with split or chipped wood.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, my issue is not with the item, and not even with the customer support as it was stellar the whole time, my issue is with the fact that two items had to break before I received my item in one piece, not to mention the third could have very well broken the same way since it had no protective bubble wrap or anything.</li>
            <li> I did throw out the oldest eye liner sharpeners, they didn&#x27;t sharp very well</li>
            <li> I suspect I could have gotten this a little cheaper at a big box store, but it was worth it not to have to hunt for it in the makeup section with kids in tow.</li>
            <li> Although I did find exact sharpener but with different logo on it for $2 less</li>
            <li> I had an old Avon Big Color Eye Pencil that my dad used to have to sharpen for me with a blade because no commercial eye pencil sharpener was big enough, until I bought this one!</li>
            <li> so it catches the loose parts obviously, &amp; like how it&#x27;s clear, unlike some</li>
            <li> I bought a Tweezerman and my large pencils from Smashbox did not fit.  </li>
            <li> i dont know how it could be good or bad, it sharpens.</li>
            <li> The only thing in my collection that had trouble were some high saturated lipglosses by urban decay.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this little tool.</li>
            <li> But this one finally did the job in a couple seconds flat!</li>
            <li> The Cover Girl tool was more $$ and ate away chunks of the pencil, leaving a jagged, splintery mess easily capable of cutting a lip or eyelid.  </li>
            <li> It does not sharpen correctly, no matter how hard I tried to sharpen my pencil eyeliner, the tip would break, at first</li>
            <li> I had a few regular large pencil sharpeners from other brands</li>
            <li> I can tell that it will last for a really long time!</li>
            <li> One tip... put the pencils in the freezer for 15 minutes or so, that way the soft colored part doesn&#x27;t make a mess in the sharpener.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s staying in my makeup bag until I loose it because that&#x27;s the only way I could imagine parting with it.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t see how this one would be $2.00 more expensive than other to rated sharpeners.</li>
            <li> There are two slots...one for sharpening smaller sized pencils and the other for bigger sized ones.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my delicate eye pencils.</li>
            <li> But with any sharpener you have to be careful how you use it because there is that potential of splintering with either your eye liner or lip liner.</li>
            <li> I need to order another one for as long as it took me to get one.</li>
            <li> How long it lasts we&#x27;ll have to see.</li>
            <li> the lid stays on tight until you empty, so no more shaving busting out of there and making a huge mess.</li>
            <li> Also has a built in scraper/cleaner that I didn&#x27;t notice for a long time!</li>
            <li> Not enough sharp.</li>
            <li> This sharpener was super-sharp and sharpened the entire set, plus all my other eye pencils without any breakage.</li>
            <li> this product!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is not only for NYX pencils but for other eye liners as well</li>
            <li> Have used them for few months and this thing still sharp my pencils like brand new.</li>
            <li> Is much less expensive than other brands but is actually the Very Same sharpener sold for much more by other brands!</li>
            <li> I recently bought a nyx jumbo eyeliner pencil and bought this a few days later.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t lost a single point off my eye pencils, fat or slim.  </li>
            <li> No idea how long it will last (had it a few months)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the larger one yet, just the small one for my Urban Decay eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see if they are full or how deep I&#x27;m putting the pencil in, &amp; not only on NYX pencils, but every brand I use thin or thick it sharpens it to a perfection!</li>
            <li> or you will have a big mess on your hands.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific little sharpener.  </li>
            <li> I have a few of the big NYX sticks and pencil liners.</li>
            <li> so my guess would be that it was crushed by the rest of the items in my order or a postman</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered, just what I expected.</li>
            <li> so I thought), only to find out that it was not missing but had broken on the way to my home.</li>
            <li> It actually sharpens the big, thick eye color pencils that i have, which have proven a challenge to sharpen.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled with how fast it came, unfortunately when I opened the packaging and found the item I was disappointed to see that the plastic cover was missing(or</li>
            <li> I learned after breaking a pencil that other sharpeners just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Also it can be used for other eye liner pencils besides NYX brand.</li>
            <li> This sharpener sharpens a lot cleaner than any other one I have.</li>
            <li> I use it for my NYX eyebrow wax pencil and for other eyelines pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My other sharpeners let the shaved pieces fall off</li>
            <li> This sharpener works with MAC pencils that contain plastic (the ones that tend to get eaten up by other sharpeners).</li>
            <li> Blade is sharp and durable.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get a sharp point when I used other sharpeners.</li>
            <li> so they were thrown from one end to the other in the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other sharpeners just crush and ruin the pencil.</li>
            <li> They make their pencils so that they can&#x27;t sharpen in other pencil sharpeners, but this one does the trick for their pencils</li>
            <li> I needed this to sharpen NYC longwear pencils because my other sharpener didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> So sharp.</li>
            <li> I tried using a standard pencil sharpener like I have done in the past to sharpen it and broke my sharpener.</li>
            <li> Buy it, eye liners &amp; lip liners sharpens well than any other sharpeners.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break my eye pencils and gives a sharp point every time.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my MAC lip liners and almost every other line of cosmetic pencil.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try any other one as I read</li>
            <li> but when I opened it, it was just like all the other ones at the store.  </li>
            <li> They are big, the outerpart is a hard plastic.</li>
            <li> My eyeliner is really sharp and the shavings are captured by the lid, keeping the mess in.</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> the Milani Liquif&#x27;eye range, which always breaks when I try to sharpen it on other sharpeners!)</li>
            <li> It works well and my eye pencil is sharp again!  </li>
            <li> Sharpened lip pencils without waste or making the tip break off like some other sharpeners do.  </li>
            <li> I read a few reviews, stating that this shapener creates a sharp point.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, doesn&#x27;t tear up my pencils, and</li>
            <li> It is so very very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Which was not true in my case.</li>
            <li> it holds the sharpenings so that you aren&#x27;t making a mess.</li>
            <li> it will mess your pencils up.</li>
            <li> Was having problems sharpening my kohl eyeliners, using other sharpeners the tip of my eyeliners will break or ended up with a fragile, thick tip hard to use.</li>
            <li> Finally I can sharpen all my dull liners and use them again!</li>
            <li> I got it because I use NYX Jumbo Eye Pencils and other chubby pencils and my usual cosmetic sharpener</li>
            <li> had been a little too</li>
            <li> even has this little stick that comes out to get any leftovers out of the cracks and crevices</li>
            <li> So it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and maybe a few for friends.  </li>
            <li> After a few searches I saw that this nyx sharpener was identical.</li>
            <li> What a joke, I bought this to go with my jumbo NYX eyeliner pencils (black bean, and the turqoise one) and this didn&#x27;t even work with them!</li>
            <li> I like to order these periodically because when they get dull they mess up the cosmetics.</li>
            <li> It sharpens both little and jumbo eye pencils with no problems!  </li>
            <li> I had an old Lancome one that wasn&#x27;t doing too well and broke and wasn&#x27;t cutting it...</li>
            <li> Works just as well if not better than some</li>
            <li> No more ragged make up pencils...</li>
            <li> After using it a few times, I agree with other reviewers in that all the other random sharpeners that have been junking up my makeup case are now absolute crap and have been tossed out.  </li>
            <li> I previously purchased about 4 sharpeners before I found one that fits both my nyx jumbo pencils and my Victorias secret chubby eye sticks.</li>
            <li> After a few uses it became dull and had a hard time sharpening my NYX pencils which it is made for, HUH!</li>
            <li> Now I do not have to throw my dull eyeliner pencils away and buy another one until it is not pointy anymore.</li>
            <li> I thought I was sharpening really hard</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s a bar that keeps cutting off the tips of my pencils which isn&#x27;t a big deal</li>
            <li> I would have thought after two items breaking in the mail Amazon would have at least thought to wrap the thing in SOMETHING to protect it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same, dirty eyeliner pencil sharpener for years -</li>
            <li> /&gt;They arrive in terrible condition, one had the top holding the shavings broken in THREE pieces</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not perfect as it wastes a bit of product when you sharpen</li>
            <li> have send reviews about the terrible packing on other products but NEVER hear back from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Too weak.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical because I bought a couple of sharpeners and they were too small for some of the things that are jumbo size like the eyebrow wax jumbo pencil.</li>
            <li> It has two holes, one for thin pencils and one for the thicker ones.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully, not just on my NYX pencils but on all my pencils.  </li>
            <li> It made the eyeliner messy and kinda melted it :(</li>
            <li> but it can get annoying and messy</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry you purchased this.</li>
            <li> That was even worse than the Revlon!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> This product is not too bad, it is just a pencil shaperner to shapen a pencil.</li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hate shavings.</li>
            <li> Annoyingly you need this for NYX</li>
            <li> I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I would give this Sharpener a FIVE except the packaging was terrible, I ordered two</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Sharpens both NYX jumbo and regular sized pencils! I love that it has the outer case so the shavings don&#x27;t go everywhere! Also has a built in scraper/cleaner that I didn&#x27;t notice for a long time!</li>
            <li> I guess the angle of the sharpener is the best part since it doesn&#x27;t turn my pencils into weird shapes... Also works perfectly with the NYX jumbo pencils... I learned after breaking a pencil that other sharpeners just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Durable. Good price. Perfect for jumbo pencils, others that I&#x27;ve bought in the past were not big enough.</li>
            <li> Does its job without chopping off the soft pencil part. I am impressed!!</li>
            <li> Again I have several of these when I order a whole kit it comes free.The sharpener work very well.But with any sharpener you have to be careful how you use it because there is that potential of splintering with either your eye liner or lip liner.</li>
            <li> I suspect I could have gotten this a little cheaper at a big box store, but it was worth it not to have to hunt for it in the makeup section with kids in tow. I froze my eyeshadow pencil for the day before sharpening and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> works perfectly;cleaning a breeze</li>
            <li> I previously purchased about 4 sharpeners before I found one that fits both my nyx jumbo pencils and my Victorias secret chubby eye sticks. Finally I can sharpen all my dull liners and use them again!</li>
            <li> sharpens my jumbo pencils and lip pencils perfectly. so much better than the elf sharpener i had. but there&#x27;s a bar that keeps cutting off the tips of my pencils which isn&#x27;t a big deal but it can get annoying and messy</li>
            <li> Finally, a sharpener that I can use for my NYX Jumbo pencils.</li>
            <li> a real jumbo sharpener! this is exactly what i was looking for. it is huge, sharp and comes with biult-in shaving collector. i couldnt find one in any store even though they sell jumbo pencils. so glad i have this now.</li>
            <li> I like the concept with the two different sized sharpeners in one.  The only problem is that the cover falls off super easily.  So make sure you empty it before putting it bag in your cosmetics bag or you will have a big mess on your hands.</li>
            <li> I got this Nyx sharpener to sharpen my Urban Decay, L&#x27;Oreal Paris, Bobbi Brown, NYX, and many other brands of eyeliners, eyebrow pencils, and lip liners. I am very pleased with this product it sharpens all kinds of different brands perfectly and even fits jumbo eyeliners perfectly. Great product!</li>
            <li> I got this for some NYX pencils I bought AND for the Avon and Urban Decay eyeliners I have. It sharpened ALL of them perfectly! I&#x27;m very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> best sharpener i&#x27;ve ever used! smooth, sharp, and fits all sizes (purchased specifically for nyx eyebrow wax pencil — perfict fit!). great price and fast shipping as always through amazon prime.</li>
            <li> Is much less expensive than other brands but is actually the Very Same sharpener sold for much more by other brands!</li>
            <li> The product came quickly and it works great. My eyeliner is really sharp and the shavings are captured by the lid, keeping the mess in. The lid pops off easily, but stays put while in use.</li>
            <li> I was hunting for a sharpener big enough for my Urban Decay eye shadow pencils, and this fits them perfectly.  It catches the shavings so you don&#x27;t make a mess while you&#x27;re sharpening, and both the top and bottom panels are removable for easy emptying and cleaning.  The NYX sharpener is now one of my makeup bag essentials.</li>
            <li> Finally, a good cheap sharpener.  I need to order another one for as long as it took me to get one.</li>
            <li> This is just a really nice sharpener and it&#x27;s perfect for large and regular sized pencils. So basically I really like this, this is probably the best sharpener I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this sharpener. I got it because I use NYX Jumbo Eye Pencils and other chubby pencils and my usual cosmetic sharpener couldn&#x27;t handle the thicker size. This one sharpens my chubby pencils just fine. It has two holes, one for thin pencils and one for the thicker ones. The blades are sharp and I have had no issues getting a nice fine point. It&#x27;s just a simple basic sharpener that does what it is made to do. The shavings do drop off as one would expect so I sharpen the pencils over a paper towel or a wastebasket and I am good to go. No complaints.</li>
            <li> It is essential to have specially if you use ÑYX jumbo pens as it is the only way to sharpen such  big a pen.</li>
            <li> I was looking all over for a sharpener that would sharpen very large eye shadow pencils - this is it!  Perfect sharpener - already ordered a spare!</li>
            <li> This sharpener is perfect for sharpening liner pencils jumbo or slim.  Although I did find exact sharpener but with different logo on it for $2 less it is still a good sharpener and now I have one for home and one for traveling.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality sharpener and it works well, like it.</li>
            <li> I love this sharpener more than my MAC pencil sharpener.  It seems to help save the pencil and not shave off a lot of the pencil.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Very easy to sharpen.  Have used them for few months and this thing still sharp my pencils like brand new.</li>
            <li> I am using this sharpener for an Urban Decay Super-Satursted lip color.  It works well and is the prefect size!!</li>
            <li> Does exactly as expected for a great price.</li>
            <li> After searching and searching, I have finally found The One: a pencil sharpener in which my extra large eyeshadow pencils fit perfectly! If you too have been having this problem, I highly recommend this sharpener.</li>
            <li> Good product, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, IT SHARPENS!! Also it can be used for other eye liner pencils besides NYX brand.</li>
            <li> This sharpener is great for those who own the jumbo NYX eyeliner pencils. Sharpens them without a problem :)     Didn&#x27;t like the way the smaller side sharpened my Milani liquif&#x27; eyeliner. It made the eyeliner messy and kinda melted it :(</li>
            <li> I wish it weren&#x27;t true, but each makeup manufacturer does seem to sell a specialized sharpener for it&#x27;s lip and eye pencils. I have a few of the big NYX sticks and pencil liners. This item definitely sharpened the way I needed it to, and I am happy with the results. It makes a nice point, without sacrificing too much product. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I like the product but did not like being charged twice.</li>
            <li> PERFECT to Sharpen my NYX Eyeliner. Couldn&#x27;t find one in the stores. But HERE I DID!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that it was just a simple pencil sharpener, I would of bought one from office depot for 28 cents. Not 4.95 cents&lt;br /&gt;But it is a good sharpener</li>
            <li> Great sharpener! Use this of my Urban Decay 24/7 concealer pencil, and for my regular eyeliner pencils. Perfect lil&#x27; addition to my makeup collection :)</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my new NYX jumbo lip liners.  This sharpener sharpens a lot cleaner than any other one I have.</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend is finally glad to have a decent sharpener that doesn&#x27;t break on first couple uses. I thought the price and the speed of the shipping were great. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better from the vendor.</li>
            <li> Got it to sharpen my Nyx Eyebrow Push Up Bra doublesided pencil (which I&#x27;m in love with) and it works great for that. Haven&#x27;t tried it on anything else. Only reason 4 vs. 5 stars is sometimes the top pops off in my make up bag and spills the shavings everywhere which can be a pain.</li>
            <li> What else can you really ask of a sharpener? It sharpens even the softest of eyeliners (i.e. urban decay 24/7) to a point.</li>
            <li> After going through several cheap sharpeners, which became dull or fell apart, this NYX is a good product and sharpens eyeliner and lipliner pencils to a fine point.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This works for regular sized and jumbo sized pencils. I use it for my NYX eyebrow wax pencil and for other eyelines pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not perfect as it wastes a bit of product when you sharpen but it&#x27;s not too bad. When the product is on the waxy side, the product sometimes gets stuck but easy enough to clean the sharpener out with a q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a solid product.</li>
            <li> I am VERY VERY PLEASED with this sharpener.  It sharpens both little and jumbo eye pencils with no problems!  All sizes fit into this and it was VERY INEXPENSIVE!!</li>
            <li> Great sharpener for both large and small pencils.  I wanted this one to sharpen lip pencils which are larger than eye pencils, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I love NYX. They really don&#x27;t disappoint and yet again, they didn&#x27;t disappoint. This is a great sharpener. I totally suggest buying it.</li>
            <li> This is such a good eyeliner sharpener - I love that the lid holds in the shavings and you can quick release them into the trash. No idea how long it will last (had it a few months) but for the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I had an old Lancome one that wasn&#x27;t doing too well and broke and wasn&#x27;t cutting it...so to speak...needed a new one and ordered this one.  It is phenenomal!!  I haven&#x27;t used the larger one yet, just the small one for my Urban Decay eyeliner.  It works great and is not wasteful of the liner at all!  I love it!</li>
            <li> This sharpener is awesome!! Sharpens perfectly and holds the mess in the case until your ready to get rid of it!</li>
            <li> This is a great little eyeliner sharpener. I bought it so I could sharpen my NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil Shadow Liner, but I love how it has a smaller sharpener hole for normal sized pencil liners. It sharpens well, and I&#x27;ve never had either a jumbo or regular liner break while sharpening. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a cheap yet great quality sharpener that gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> Many of the newer lip and eye pencils are softer and don&#x27;t quite fit into most of the sharpeners on the market.  This was a bit better but still not perfect.  Great for extra hard traditional pencils.</li>
            <li> I needed a nyx sharpeneer&lt;br /&gt;i love that it has 2 sized holes&lt;br /&gt;one small&lt;br /&gt;and one large&lt;br /&gt;sharpens well</li>
            <li> I needed a large sharpener for my NYX wax brow pencil and this one fits the bill.  The large side has no problem with sharpening my wax tool and the small side was perfect for my mini eyeliner from a Halloween makeup kit.  Will purchase again...Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have bought many other sharpener before, including some big brand product. However, onne of those can compared with this one! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> great for my big fat pencils</li>
            <li> fits my fat pencil perfect. I couldn&#x27;t find one in stores</li>
            <li> Works great to sharpen my NYX pencils.</li>
            <li> It was not big for my eye shadow pencil. It is the same size that I bought at Walmart. So it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly even on some eyeliner pencils that I&#x27;ve had tremendous trouble with. (eg. the Milani Liquif&#x27;eye range, which always breaks when I try to sharpen it on other sharpeners!) I fully recommend this!!</li>
            <li> What can I say .. It&#x27;s a good sharper worth the extra money . I paid two dollars for one that did not work .</li>
            <li> This came very fast. It was a good price. Packaged nicely. I was looking for a sharpener for my NYX jumbo pencils. It sharpens them beautifully! Very smooth, and doesn&#x27;t chop up your pencil. Thanks for the fast efficient service! I would buy from you again!</li>
            <li> this is a great sharpener. My other sharpeners let the shaved pieces fall off but this one catches everything until you&#x27;re ready to open and discard the remaining pieces. It sharpens great. no complaints.</li>
            <li> NYX is a very smart company that made a jumbo pencil that would not fit any other sharpener but their own brand. Touché NYX Touché.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t fit, I bought it for my lipstick of the same brand, for some reason it does not fit.</li>
            <li> This device keeps breaking the pencils instead of sharpening them.  It was probably designed for non-standard pencils, although the description says otherwise.</li>
            <li> Before I write my review, I want to state that I love the company NYX and I think this item is very good quality and this item WOULD have received 5 stars had there not been so many complications with my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my sharpener I was thrilled with how fast it came, unfortunately when I opened the packaging and found the item I was disappointed to see that the plastic cover was missing(or so I thought), only to find out that it was not missing but had broken on the way to my home. This item was not packaged in anything to protect it from breaking at all(it is only plastic) so my guess would be that it was crushed by the rest of the items in my order or a postman had been a little too rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon and they were happy to send me a replacement at no cost to me and did not ask me to return the original, which I thought was extremely kind of them considering the sharpener does work. The item was sent with free 2 day shipping, and I often hound the tracking numbers when I order items and noticed that this second sharpener had also become damaged in transit so it would not be delivered, tracking told me to contact Amazon about what to do next, so I did. A THIRD sharpener was sent to me, again at no additional cost with free 2 day shipping, and when I received it it was all in one piece but the only packaging it had was some standard cardboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, my issue is not with the item, and not even with the customer support as it was stellar the whole time, my issue is with the fact that two items had to break before I received my item in one piece, not to mention the third could have very well broken the same way since it had no protective bubble wrap or anything. I would have thought after two items breaking in the mail Amazon would have at least thought to wrap the thing in SOMETHING to protect it.</li>
            <li> This sharpener works with MAC pencils that contain plastic (the ones that tend to get eaten up by other sharpeners). I like the size. Works great!</li>
            <li> Great sharpener.  Sharpened lip pencils without waste or making the tip break off like some other sharpeners do.  I also live that the shreads are self-contained so this a great sharpener to keep in your purse for on the go.</li>
            <li> Works as it should. Don&#x27;t buy anything else. It&#x27;s great and I would buy it again if I lose this one.</li>
            <li> I can get better sharpeners from the dollar store (as a two pack!). I just did not like this sharpener whatsoever. It just shreds my makeup pencils. Maybe I got a dud because I looked at reviews before I bought it and it seemed like 99% of reviewers liked it. Meh! You win some, you lose some. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Fits all of my make up pencils perfectly.  Contains all the shavings.  Blade is sharp and durable. Very good item.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife to sharpen her eyebrow pencils on. Works fine, she looks like a Disney witch now. Double blades and holes for different sizes of pencils.</li>
            <li> This is a great sharpener. Sharpens my eye pencils very precisely compared to my old sharpener. Would certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> I really needed a pencil sharpener for a big liner that I have. I was a little hesitant to buy this because I thought that it would be cheap. This is a great sharp sharpener way better than I thought! I can tell that it will last for a really long time!</li>
            <li> Great little sharpener!</li>
            <li> I needed this sharpener for my urban decay pencils. They&#x27;re super creamy and I couldn&#x27;t get a sharp point when I used other sharpeners. I read somewhere that this is a dupe for the urban decay sharpener. I&#x27;ve never used the urban decay sharpener, but this did what I needed at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Wish the top of the sharpener would stay on better.</li>
            <li> Great sharpener. I bought a Tweezerman and my large pencils from Smashbox did not fit.  This one fits and I am so happy :)</li>
            <li> Best sharpener I&#x27;ve owned. My Shu Uemura sharpener broke, and I purchased this one. Honestly, I like it better! Great price point.</li>
            <li> great for 2 different types of  pencil or my eye liner pencils. good price a lasted me a while now.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same, dirty eyeliner pencil sharpener for years - so I knew it was time to get a new one.  There are a few top rated ones that come up through Amazon search - a few cheaper than this one, but this one had the most reviews, so I thought &amp;#34;why not.&amp;#34;  It works well and my eye pencil is sharp again!  However, I don&#x27;t see how this one would be $2.00 more expensive than other to rated sharpeners.</li>
            <li> Needed this to sharpen my jumbo eye pencils. Also works great for sharpening NARS lip pencils and regular sized pencils. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Bought this for back stage makeup for a theater production. The price was right knowing that I might not need it after the show.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that I&#x27;m going to buy two more . . . and maybe a few for friends.  Best sharpener for cosmetic pencils that I&#x27;ve found, period.</li>
            <li> This sharpener works great. I love that I can sharpen different sized pencils with it.</li>
            <li> I have some jumbo eye liners that didn&#x27;t fit in my normal eye liner sharpener, so I could never sharpen them, now I can thanks to this jumbo opening in the sharpener!</li>
            <li> I would give this Sharpener a FIVE except the packaging was terrible, I ordered two and they were tossed into a LARGE Manila envelope with no other protection so they were thrown from one end to the other in the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrive in terrible condition, one had the top holding the shavings broken in THREE pieces so to use it you will need to hold over a garbage container or something to catch the mess.&lt;br /&gt;I have send reviews about the terrible packing on other products but NEVER hear back from Amazon. So I don&#x27;t expect they to do anything about this product or give any personal contact either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sharpener is great gives the sharpest point I have ever had on my pencils.</li>
            <li> Best sharpener I have ever used. comes with a needle-like to clean the sharpener. I have bought two one for me the other is for my mom, she loved it.</li>
            <li> Good sharpener. I like that it had a cap that catches the shavings. I hate shavings. Does what it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> I love it, all my pencils now in order</li>
            <li> This is a terrific little sharpener.  After using it a few times, I agree with other reviewers in that all the other random sharpeners that have been junking up my makeup case are now absolute crap and have been tossed out.  The NYX sharpener works so smoothly that I don&#x27;t even bother to put my eyeliner pencils in the fridge before sharpening any more!  It shaves easily and I haven&#x27;t lost a single point off my eye pencils, fat or slim.  You won&#x27;t be sorry you purchased this.</li>
            <li> This was PERFECT for my tarte smolder eyes pencil! (Which is why I bought it) it sharpened easily and amazingly for my tarte pencils, and my other pencils as we&#x27;ll. awesome product!!</li>
            <li> It sharpens the jumbo milk. At last.</li>
            <li> For something as simply as a sharpener I never would usually write a product review, but seriouselybthis sharpener out of sooo many I&#x27;ve used my whole life, is really really good! Lol, it has the box so it catches the loose parts obviously, &amp; like how it&#x27;s clear, unlike some I can&#x27;t see if they are full or how deep I&#x27;m putting the pencil in, &amp; not only on NYX pencils, but every brand I use thin or thick it sharpens it to a perfection! Never too much taken offf or too little, it sharpens it perfectly and evenly, I&#x27;m impressed with this little sucker here! Never thought I&#x27;d be saying that about a sharpener but as of now, not going to use any if them but this one cuz it makes them literally perfect, no ruff edges or anything, love this tiny thing! Lol :))</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it has two sizes and holds a the remnants. Works just as well if not better than some I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for!</li>
            <li> Now I do not have to throw my dull eyeliner pencils away and buy another one until it is not pointy anymore. Other sharpeners just crush and ruin the pencil. This is very nice and smooth. Also, it has two holes; a regular and a bigger one for jumbo pencils. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Not only does it have dual (slim/fat) sharpeners, but a protective cover and great price!</li>
            <li> Nothing special, just a sharpener, but works for smaller makeup pencils and thicker ones, sharpens well, does the job, recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fit my new lip crayon perfect. Not the easiest to clean, but it does have a nifty tool that helps get the gunk out.</li>
            <li> works great!! even has this little stick that comes out to get any leftovers out of the cracks and crevices</li>
            <li> Too weak. Not enough sharp.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected, really works and a snap to clean out shavings, takes less than 1/2 a second to remove shavings and put plastic top back on!</li>
            <li> Nice sharpener, it does the job!</li>
            <li> Got it a long time ago and still works great! Plastic cover that helps contain shavings still stays on which is great because I travel alot. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I have an eye pencil that i could not find a sharpener for UNTIL NOW! Works great! love it! A must for chunky pencils</li>
            <li> This sharpener is great!  It works for my skinny eyeliners and my chubby lip pencils. Can&#x27;t beat the price! Love NYX products.</li>
            <li> Was having problems sharpening my kohl eyeliners, using other sharpeners the tip of my eyeliners will break or ended up with a fragile, thick tip hard to use. After reviewing what I could use or How I should sharpen those types of liners, I found out great reviews about the urban decay that costs $20 dlls. Then I found out this could be a good dupe, and it is indeed. Works good for slim and chubby pencils!! :)</li>
            <li> Annoyingly you need this for NYX however they have a lot of good cheap makeup so it&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li> Can anyone tell me if this will fit a 1/2 in lipstick. I have an old jumbo Chanel stick and can&#x27;t seem to find anything wide enough. Thanks in advance!</li>
            <li> Needed a big sharpener for the big eye pencil. works great</li>
            <li> This sharpener works on fat pencils, like the Urban Decay lip pencil and Benefit High Brow.</li>
            <li> Works as promised, great product.</li>
            <li> Use this sharpener constantly.</li>
            <li> I had bought the L&#x27;oreal Liquid Pencil Eyeliner and though I loved how pigmented it was; I wasted most of the pencil trying to get it sharpened as the liner tip kept on getting botched or breaking off. I don&#x27;t know what it is about this sharpener, but it works. I can now sharpen the eyeliner to a pointy tip without it breaking off in the sharpener.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase.  It does a great job on the big eye pencils that I love to use and also on the thinner ones for my brows.  I would highly recommend this little tool.</li>
            <li> I had an old Avon Big Color Eye Pencil that my dad used to have to sharpen for me with a blade because no commercial eye pencil sharpener was big enough, until I bought this one! If you have tried the sharpeners from the drug store and your big eye pencils don&#x27;t fit, buy this sharpener!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> They make their pencils so that they can&#x27;t sharpen in other pencil sharpeners, but this one does the trick for their pencils</li>
            <li> I like to order these periodically because when they get dull they mess up the cosmetics. I will continue buying.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sharpener with two different sizes to sharpen, however I think I could have found one cheeper at my local discount store or beauty supply.</li>
            <li> The tip of the eyeliner gets flattened, not sharp enough to make a fine line, which is what I need.</li>
            <li> Finally, a sharpener that doesn&#x27;t eat up my pencils!  I use on standard pencils---Stila and Urban Decay.  It makes the tip nice and pointy without eating away at it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful sharpener. Does a great job on my Wet and Wild pencils</li>
            <li> My new favorite and only sharpener, I use this only for my eyebrow pencils. I think they&#x27;re just regular size pencils, definitely not jumbo, but this baby does the trick. It&#x27;s staying in my makeup bag until I loose it because that&#x27;s the only way I could imagine parting with it.</li>
            <li> This sharpener is perfect for all of NYX&#x27;s pencil products- lip liners, eyeliners, jumbo pencils. The size is a little off for other large shadow pencils but it is perfect for its purpose.</li>
            <li> fits all different sixe pencils and traps the scraps to throw away later. love this pencil sharpener for all kinds of beauty tools</li>
            <li> its a sharpener. i dont know how it could be good or bad, it sharpens. does the trick so buy it and stop reading reviews already. the end</li>
            <li> IT DOESNT WORK!! This is a rip off. Cheaply made as well, had bought the NYX eyeshadow pencils and nothing was big enough to sharpen them, I waited because I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much on this thing!!!! I bought one at Sallys Beauty Supply for $1.99 that has 3 possible widths for your pencils.....worked like a charm...DON&#x27;T BUY THIS ONE!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pencil sharpener, what are you expecting?</li>
            <li> I love this sharpener!! I bought it to go with the NYX jumbo eye pencil shadow liner 604 milk and it works like a dream. very easy to pop the top off and clean out. it sharpens very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t struggle to sharpen bigger eye pencils. No uneven sharpening, wish I would have bought this years ago!</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d only ordered one of these...for 4.24 I should have double checked but yeah I got a package of like 20 which is WAY more than I will ever need. I&#x27;m just gonna sell them for a dollar each though haha!</li>
            <li> I needed this to sharpen NYC longwear pencils because my other sharpener didn&#x27;t work. I like it. It does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Good product for price. Sharpener is exactly as described. I like being able to contain the shavings and not get them everywhere.</li>
            <li> Best sharpener I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This thing is great.  It actually sharpens the big, thick eye color pencils that i have, which have proven a challenge to sharpen.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> So sharp. So convenient to keep shavings inside. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love that this fits us to 3 different sizes of pencils, and is nice and sharp. No issues to report.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and works very well! It is perfect for travel as well as use at home since it small.  Both thick and thinner eye pencils fit to sharpen with this tool.</li>
            <li> Good item to use in the bathroom for the women&#x27;s make up and their up keep of the eye liners.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it is a makeup sharpener, lol, how can you go wrong, it doesn&#x27;t mess up your pencils and leave you with split or chipped wood. For the price, its not bad,</li>
            <li> I have bought several other make up pencil sharpeners to sharpen my NYX jumbo pencils and haven&#x27;t had any success with them. But this one finally did the job in a couple seconds flat! I was so excited to be able to use my eye pencils again! One tip... put the pencils in the freezer for 15 minutes or so, that way the soft colored part doesn&#x27;t make a mess in the sharpener. Am very pleased with this simple product!</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews, stating that this shapener creates a sharp point. Which was not true in my case. The sharpener has a piece that flattens put the top of the pencil a bit. So I unscrewed the blade, cut the piece out, and now it sharpens to my preference. I need my brow pencils to have the perfect point. I will likely still order this again as it is so affordable.</li>
            <li> When I found this online i was skeptical because I bought a couple of sharpeners and they were too small for some of the things that are jumbo size like the eyebrow wax jumbo pencil. When I got this I was surprise that I could actually use it and have not problems. :)</li>
            <li> I did not buy this through Amazon but I know I rely on the reviews posted here when buying almost anything. This thing is AMAZING! I use the Rimmel Scandelous Eyes eyeshadow stick. They are big, the outerpart is a hard plastic. I tried using a standard pencil sharpener like I have done in the past to sharpen it and broke my sharpener. I got this in the mail yesterday and it sharpened my stick as though it was butter. Loving this product.</li>
            <li> Really really love it. very good product.</li>
            <li> What a great sharpener.  I&#x27;ve had others before that just didn&#x27;t sharpen without breaking the eyeliner pencil.  This one works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very good product. The product came as shown and the shipping was fast; this seller is also highly recommended as a result. This is the only sharpener that can sharpen my NYX Jumbo pencils and it comes with a little stick like object to clean excess product out of the sharpener. Best sharpener for makeup products I&#x27;ve ever used. It is now used to sharpen all of my makeup pencils.</li>
            <li> Same as the Urban Decay one but way cheaper!  I love the two sizes in one sharpener.  It is easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I love the NYX sharpener. It sharpens the eye liners &amp; the lip liners pretty well. I did throw out the oldest eye liner sharpeners, they didn&#x27;t sharp very well and it looked very crappy. I said hello to the NYX sharpener for good. Buy it, eye liners &amp; lip liners sharpens well than any other sharpeners.</li>
            <li> works well....no complaints.  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I like that it holds the sharpenings so that you aren&#x27;t making a mess.</li>
            <li> Best sharpener for NYX products. Most other sharpeners will not fit their pencils.</li>
            <li> I have been looking hard for a great sharpener. Lets just say, I will never have that problem again! My friend had the grind-house from urban decay and i loved it, but not the price. After a few searches I saw that this nyx sharpener was identical. And trust me it is.  It&#x27;s so smooth to operate and truly does the best at its job! And at 4 bucks! So happy with this purchase. Truly a must have!</li>
            <li> Fits the jumbo crayons perfectly.  I also like that the lid is attached with a hinge so it keeps the shavings but then I don&#x27;t lose then lid when I need to dump them out.</li>
            <li> After a few uses it became dull and had a hard time sharpening my NYX pencils which it is made for, HUH!</li>
            <li> Bought this to sharpen my 4 y/o&#x27;s large pencils but it does not work well for that, he hole is not deep enough</li>
            <li> I finally found a sharpener that fits ally makeup pencils-from my Benefit eyeliner to my Nars jumbo lip liner. It sharpens really nicely also, doesn&#x27;t catch like other sharpeners. Love it!</li>
            <li> There are no covers!!! Both the top and bottom!!! Totally different from the picture!!! At first I thought perhaps they are in the box, but I couldn&#x27;t find them..Too bad</li>
            <li> Seriously great device. Gentle on my delicate eye pencils.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this to sharpen her eye pencils. What she uses those for, I have no idea! But she&#x27;s dead sexy, and that&#x27;s all that counts!</li>
            <li> I had a few regular large pencil sharpeners from other brands but they don&#x27;t work for NYX jumbo pencils. I think NYX pencils are not a standard size. This one works perfectly and i like that it has a cover and keeps all the shavings in there.</li>
            <li> Finally a sharpener that fits my Urban Decay pencils! Works great. Gives a nice point and I haven&#x27;t had any issue with it breaking the liners while sharpening. A win in my book.</li>
            <li> Top pops open while in use. Explodes shaving everywhere</li>
            <li> sharpens to a sharp point, it is designed to easily catch the shavings and keep things neat.  As good as the designer brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a couple of weeks. So far, the blades are nice and sharp and perform well. I like that it has a &#x27;cover&#x27; for the pencil &#x27;droppings&#x27; to fall into. This way, I can empty the shaved contents into the trash when it&#x27;s full. Having two sizes for sharpening is a plus. I hope it continues to perform as it should.</li>
            <li> Now I can sharpen my NYX Eye Pencils. It has 2 sizes to sharpen the jumbo ans the smaller pencils - just perfect!</li>
            <li> This sharpener and the Maybelline New York Expert Tools Dual Sharpener are very similar. They both work great on hard to sharpener make-up pencils.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a nyx jumbo eyeliner pencil and bought this a few days later. The shipping was quick, only took two days, product was exactly as described and works great! It sharpens all my pencils and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This is a great seller, two thumbs way up :]</li>
            <li> works great.  Doesn&#x27;t break my eye pencils and gives a sharp point every time.  It&#x27;s nice that it catches the shavings for disposal.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much that I can really say. It Sharpens my Jumbo Eye liners like I need it to. the lid at first is hard to come off but easy on and off.</li>
            <li> Works great and has not given me any problems. Very cheap and worth it if you consistently use pencils for your eyes, brows, etc.</li>
            <li> i swear its awesome, and to my surprise it comes with a lil stick to clear corrossions..... thats great!!!! love</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> This does not sharpen the NYX jumbo lip pencil.  The pencil fits in the larger slot but the angle of the blade is off.  It goes around and around and the pencil does not sharpen.</li>
            <li> It sharpens everything nicely. The only thing in my collection that had trouble were some high saturated lipglosses by urban decay. I think that is more Bc of the creamy glossy formula to them rather than the sharpener.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low, and this one works so well.  The regular size eyeliner actually can be sharpened by either size.  I am getting more to replace my old ones.  I took the top and bottom covers off, so I can clean the sharpener easily, and so doesn&#x27;t leave the shavings sitting in the unit, accumulating.</li>
            <li> Needed a new sharpener and I love this one! Be gentle when sharpening and don&#x27;t jam the pencil in and it will work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> With all of the five star reviews I was expecting a great sharpener.  Mine was a dud.  NYX&#x27;s sharpener was made in Germany, so I expected excellent craftsmanship.  I was sorely disappointed.  It consistently takes a large chuck off one side and then the pencil will spin, never sharpening the rest of the pencil.  Also be prepared to have shavings fall out all four sides when you pop the lid off the top.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered, just what I expected. Sharpens great! Not that cheaply made. Purchased specifically for NYX brow shaping wax pencil.</li>
            <li> I broke the tips of my new NARS lip pencils and didn&#x27;t have a sharpener that fit them. This worked perfectly. Now I have dragon lady red lips again:)</li>
            <li> No more ragged make up pencils...awesome  As described....no breakage..beautiful sharpening..fast shipment, great quality Will buy another one for my other make up bag</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Sharpens nice and smooth and even, and doesn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast. It works great. It has two sides and makes sharpening all of my makeup pencils a breeze. It works perfectly to sharpen all of my pencils, even my non NYX ones. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was not packaged that well. It was wrapped up in a cardboard box with no padding which caused the sharpener to get pretty scratched up making it look used.</li>
            <li> Simple, functional and dirt-cheap despite good quality. What else didja expect from NYX?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it just works so perfectly because I use NYX pencils or what, but this is the best sharpener I have ever used in my life!  I had a Revlon sharpener and it kept gouging out holes in the pencil.  I thought it was maybe just the way that the NYX pencils were since they&#x27;re on the cheap side.  But I decided to go ahead and try another sharpener.  So, I got the Covergirl sharpener.  That was even worse than the Revlon!  Finally, I decided to go ahead and try the NYX.  It is PERFECT!  It sharpens the pencil to a perfect point, no gouging, no breakage.  I recommend this sharpener to anyone, especially if you use NYX pencils!</li>
            <li> this is a good sharpener for the nyx jumbo pencils and as a regular eye pencil sharpener. good for the price</li>
            <li> This was bought as a backup/travel sharpener to a dual unit I bought many years ago.  Knowing that one day mine will quit working, and having been severly disappointed with the Cover Girl sharpener I bought recently (made in China), I saw that this NYX one has German-made blades -- as does my original -- and knew THAT was the secret to a perfect cut.  The Cover Girl tool was more $$ and ate away chunks of the pencil, leaving a jagged, splintery mess easily capable of cutting a lip or eyelid.  This NYX works great; would recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this to sharpen regular pencils and more importantly, my Nars velvet matte lips pencils. I mean, the Scrooge in me agonized over shelling out $26 for a lip pencil (if only the Dolce Vita wasn&#x27;t so amazing), so I definitely didn&#x27;t want to pay the premium for the jumbo sharpener from Nars. This works great!</li>
            <li> My white pencil stick was too big for this, I have yet to find one that works for me. Darn.</li>
            <li> Good sharpener. It works even better than some of the more expensive ones. It doesn&#x27;t just work for NYX pencils, either. I use it on my MAC lip liners and almost every other line of cosmetic pencil. It also helps me to reach that $35 needed when I&#x27;m just a little short for free shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I needed a large sharpener for my NARS lip pencil, but didn&#x27;t want to spend much on something I will inevitably lose, so I skipped the NARS one this time around and got this one.  It works exactly the same!  Very sharp, doesn&#x27;t tear up my pencils, and the lid stays on tight until you empty, so no more shaving busting out of there and making a huge mess.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I need it to do! It would be nice if it came with a little pick to remove excess product, but I like that you can remove the top to get into hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> It was delivered super quick and it couldn&#x27;t go wrong with that price. My lip liners are nice and sharp again.</li>
            <li> works great, easy to sanitize, and very useful with duel sized sharpener</li>
            <li> Great sharpener. Fits my big eyebrow pencil, which is what I was going for!</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK WITH EXTRA LARGE PENCILS ALTHOUGH COMMENTS CLAIM IT DOES.  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> NYX sharpener was exactly as described. I needed a sharpener to replace my old one that I probably had for 5 + years. It works really well...sharpens my eyebrow pencils to a fine point. There are two slots...one for sharpening smaller sized pencils and the other for bigger sized ones. All the shavings remain contained in the sharpener itself and does not fall out even if jarred. Excellent product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This sharpener is one great little tool for sharpening eye pencils of every kind.....narrow and chubby pencils, alike.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It great because its compact, clear lid makes it easy to tell when it needs to be emptied.  Sharpens all my pencils very well without over sharpening!</li>
            <li> What a joke, I bought this to go with my jumbo NYX eyeliner pencils (black bean, and the turqoise one) and this didn&#x27;t even work with them! I would turn and turn to no avail, it wouldn&#x27;t really &#x27;catch&#x27; onto the pencil and start sharpening. SMH</li>
            <li> This sharpener is a piece of junk. It does not sharpen correctly, no matter how hard I tried to sharpen my pencil eyeliner, the tip would break, at first I thought I was sharpening really hard so I tried doing it lightly and the tip would still break, I got halfway down the pencil. Not worth it, I do NOT recommend this sharpener at all.</li>
            <li> This little sharpener is the best I&#x27;ve found for eye liner/brow pencils. It accommodates the large liner pencils and the smaller ones. It even has a back that keeps all the shavings in one place and easy to dump.  It&#x27;s super sharp.</li>
            <li> Wow this really does work.  It is so very very sharp.  Works better than any other sharpener I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> I have a set of Urban Decay 24/7 eye pencils that needed sharpening. This sharpener was super-sharp and sharpened the entire set, plus all my other eye pencils without any breakage.</li>
            <li> Finally have a sharpener that works on my NYX  jumbo eye pencils. Very pleased</li>
            <li> Works beautifully, not just on my NYX pencils but on all my pencils.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my larger eyebrow wax pencils.</li>
            <li> I bought the nyx fat eye liner and the brow pencil. Love them both. I read online this is he only sharpener that works with them. I didn&#x27;t try any other one as I read it will mess your pencils up.</li>
            <li> This product is not too bad, it is just a pencil shaperner to shapen a pencil. There is nothing more to it.</li>
            <li> Bought the NYX brand so I could be sure it would be compatible with my NYX pencils. Has a double sharpener for fat and skinny pencils. Easy lid snaps off to dump out shavings. Great price.</li>
            <li> Neither of the sharpeners I owned would work on my NYX jumbo eye pencils.  This one worked perfectly and it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s enclosed so you can use it anywhere - not just over a wastebasket!</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow pencil sharpener I&#x27;ve had yet! I like that the back part comes off--it makes it easy to clean out the inside when the tip of a pencil breaks off and gets stuck.</li>
            <li> I bought this sharpener with reservations but I didn&#x27;t need to have any because it is perfect. It works perfectly for my pencils both small and large sizes and hasn&#x27;t yet clogged up. I am so glad I bought it. It also came carefully packaged and within a reasonable amount of time. Thank you</li>
            <li> Happy I found this sharpener</li>
            <li> I really like this sharpener because it is practical and cheap. I totally recommend this product!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is not only for NYX pencils but for other eye liners as well</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a sharpener big enough for my VS eye pencils and everybody said this one was so huge and it fit the biggest pencils but when I opened it, it was just like all the other ones at the store.  Not big enough.  I&#x27;m sure it works fine though.</li>
            <li> Perfect for eye liners! Worked fabulous and reasonable price as well.</li>
            <li> I have ruined many eye pencils on shrapeners that \\&quot;chewed up\\&quot; the pencils. This one does an excellent job. I especially needed a good one for \\&quot;fat\\&quot; pencils.  A+!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sharpener... It sharpens just fine. What else can you say about it?</li>
            <li> Finally, one that works on soft pencils. Getting a point on my eyeliner, eyebrow and lipliner pencils has been a challenging experience. After trying many devices this little guy works beautifully. How long it lasts we&#x27;ll have to see.</li>
