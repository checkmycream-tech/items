            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The smell is great.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with these shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li>I guess they can&#x27;t win them all.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I decided to.  </li>
            <li>This is great and all-natural.</li>
            <li>that is great</li>
            <li>/&gt;You get a good amount for the price and the smell is great, so I bought a bottle.</li>
            <li>but that could be a good thing because of the lack of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Smelled good, but was not moisturizing at all.  </li>
            <li>He always smells so good after his showers.</li>
            <li>This has added a good amount of moisture.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel really good.</li>
            <li>The Shampoo was good, but the conditioner did not work well for me</li>
            <li>The two together works good.  </li>
            <li>This could be a good shampoo for someone with flyaway hair.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Smells good and lives up to what it says it will do for your hair.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>So, while I guess this is a good shampoo, it&#x27;s probably best for those who live in place without bugs or pets.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any kind of hair products, no gel, spray, nothing</li>
            <li>and I DO switch off about one-third of the time to avoid any kind of build up</li>
            <li>This has worked great for my hair type and it really gets your scalp clean, smells awesome, and lathers.</li>
            <li>I have struggled to find *the* shampoo for my hair, considering that each strand of hair is very fine</li>
            <li>This is an awesome natural shampoo and paraben free!</li>
            <li>Glad to be able to find this since my boyfriend is allergic to sulfates.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I had box dyed my hair one too many times, and the texture had changed to an unmanageable, elasticy, knot that had me CONVINCED I would have to chop off all my hair.</li>
            <li>As a shampoo, it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>My kids also love the fruity smell, and it lathers well for a sulfate-free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Although i still love their products</li>
            <li>I will continue my search for a shampoo and conditioner made without so many harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>and I liked that it was sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed their predecessor shampoo formulas.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what they did to the formula, but they didn&#x27;t change it for the better.</li>
            <li>I am not even sure if I will finish this bottle.</li>
            <li>I just started using this more moisture shampoo along with the conditioner and my hair has never looked better..or felt better.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo added moisure and volume, which resulted in greater managability.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>but i promise you will love burts bees and your hair</li>
            <li>will look so much better</li>
            <li>If you have the time, google the images for the Baobab tree - very cool.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair from drying up and soft, also smells great.</li>
            <li>They both have fine, but dry hair, so this is perfect for them.  </li>
            <li>This product worked surprisingly well for my hair, and left a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>now so I know not to expect a strong smell but</li>
            <li>It lathers and cleans well without stripping my fine, wavy hair, and I like the smell.</li>
            <li>Excellent results, very shiny, soft, full and clean hair &amp; scalp.</li>
            <li>It works just as great as other shampoo, costs less than most at the store, and works/smells great!</li>
            <li>I have been using Loreal Eversleek shampoo and conditioner, which is another sulfate free brand.</li>
            <li>, I thought I would try this brand of shampoo since it is free of parabens.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt this smooth ever..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with it so far.</li>
            <li>This would work great for really dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair never once felt really clean while I was using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really love to be able to use natural products on my hair but</li>
            <li>Now my hair is clean.  </li>
            <li>Do it again and the lather is super rich.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m editing my post to say that this shampoo and conditioner have actually been making my hair look really good in terms of how its falling.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair smelled because after washing it twice it still smelled unclean and more of the way your hair smells after being out in a very humid day.</li>
            <li>the scent this one has is lovely in the bottle, not so much once you shampoo your hair with</li>
            <li>The curls are soft with some nice corkscrew curls here and there.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special regarding my scalp and hair, but I love that it has ingredients that isn&#x27;t known to cause health problems like many of the regular brands out there.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo because it was sulfate free, and I was looking to make a switch to something more natural.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the Baobab seed oil ingredient since the Baobab is my favorite tree.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I wasn&#x27;t able to find my normal Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Love it so far!</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, making it great for dry winter months.</li>
            <li>Wikapedia says that some people are calling the baobab fruit the next \\&quot;super food\\&quot; because of its exotic nature and rich nutrient profile...</li>
            <li>I was looking for a reasonably priced sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>The cat has woken me up in the middle of the night licking my head, which would be nice if the sandpaper like tongue didn&#x27;t start to hurt.</li>
            <li>I love BB&#x27;s products but this shampoo is a complete disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hair is healthy and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have cytotoxic or other harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>My hair is very healthy but naturally dry as a lot of curly hair is.</li>
            <li>, I just would not reccomend this particular shampoo for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I noticed right after I rinsed that my hair felt...</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my hair shinny, hydrated and removes all frizz (which is not an easy task considering I live in South Florida).</li>
            <li>When I went to the store, they didn&#x27;t have the normal brand of natural shampoo I had been using, so I thought -- against my better judgement -- to give Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo a try.</li>
            <li>First I tried Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Not only do bugs love the smell of this, but so do cats.</li>
            <li>The first time I shampooed my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the first bottle</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s your first time washing without sulfates, of course it&#x27;s going to be greasy.</li>
            <li>so try them all if the first one doesnt work for you</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it works better with other type of hair but it didn&#x27;t work for my fine, straight hair</li>
            <li>how great it felt to finally have my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li>Generally I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this one falls flat.  </li>
            <li>At first I was very pleased with the results, it seemed as if it instantly tamed my fly aways and such but as the month since I purchased it has passed my hair has progressively gotten greasier and extremely dull looking.</li>
            <li>I have long wavy hair that was, at one point in time, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>When I first bought it I thought that it smelled absolutely heavenly</li>
            <li>OK, so doesn&#x27;t work for me as a shampoo, but it is full of more natural ingredients than most soaps/shampoos, plus it smells a little citrusy/ vanilla like , reminded me of real southern Key Lime Pie.</li>
            <li>, when I finally ran out a month ago I bought the new More Moisture.</li>
            <li>It did not have very much lather, but still left my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>can only imagine what this would do to someone with fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather much</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s a moisturizing formula, but this was really, really greasy.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells fresh and natural.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like it really cleans my hair-</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a lot of really helpful ingredients</li>
            <li>and I had to use a residue striper to get back the light</li>
            <li>I wish they would bring back the old More Moisture Shampoo.</li>
            <li>bug bites on your scalp (especially if you&#x27;re balding) are neither fun nor pretty.</li>
            <li>have fine straight hair and wanted to give this shampoo a try since my ends tend to be dry.</li>
            <li>I would wash my hair and not only did it not smell clean but hrs.</li>
            <li>I also tried their new formula for Super Shiny (the mango) and had the exact same results.  </li>
            <li>it leaves it greasy and matted, particularly underneath.  </li>
            <li>I have curly very dry hair that is fine and prone to frizz in humidy.  </li>
            <li>and its soft!!</li>
            <li>and it left it squeaky clean, soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>low chemicals, clean natural feel</li>
            <li>and because that&#x27;s supposed to be good for hair, in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this for approximately six months now.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, you live and learn I guess.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that it doesn&#x27;t contain sodium lauryl sulfate or propyline glycol, but unfortunately this particular \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product just doesn&#x27;t clean or moisturize well, which is what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li>It made the whole top and front of my hair noticeably thick and greasy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it&#x27;s not a kids&#x27; shampoo, it&#x27;s not tear-free, so I don&#x27;t recommend using this on very young children.</li>
            <li>The first wash you are removing  dirt and prior product buildup.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like Burt&#x27;s Bees Shampoo and Conditioner with Baobab, I like all the other Burt&#x27;s Bees products I&#x27;ve tried, but this duo is unfortunately not for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for shampoo and conditioner without all the possibly harmful chemicals, but not had much luck so far.  </li>
            <li>, I know that some natural shampoos can take time to get used to if you have been using chemical products.</li>
            <li>I have naturally 2C-3A curly hair.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to go all natural and try burts.</li>
            <li>Their hair does not get greasy after using it and their hair is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair has natural body.  </li>
            <li>I have been using natural shampoos for 5 yrs.</li>
            <li>it took my hair a week and after the first week of use my hair would be clean after only using a small amount of shampoo.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, fast forward to the second week of use...after the second and third time using it, I realized that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling I felt that first time I tried it was the so called &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34;  the shampoo provides which in my case caused build up.  </li>
            <li>Like the title of the review says, that&#x27;s my main problem with this product and the same goes for the condtioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt greasy even towards the middle and ends, and I began to shed quite a bit more hair than usual.</li>
            <li>I could see that if your hair is not truly dry how the combination of the conditioner and shampoo might be to much.  </li>
            <li>As someone who is pregnant, I wanted to try something without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>This is my third attempt and although the Burt&#x27;s Bees products left my hair in a little better condition, they have left the skin on my scalp and face quite irritated, burning and itchy.  </li>
            <li>I received the products but two of the bottles were not tightly closed and one had leaked.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I particularly like the Baobab seed oil ingredient since the Baobab is my favorite tree.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wasn&#x27;t able to find my normal Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Love it so far!</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing, making it great for dry winter months.</li>
            <li> Wikapedia says that some people are calling the baobab fruit the next \\&quot;super food\\&quot; because of its exotic nature and rich nutrient profile...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a reasonably priced sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> The cat has woken me up in the middle of the night licking my head, which would be nice if the sandpaper like tongue didn&#x27;t start to hurt.</li>
            <li> I love BB&#x27;s products but this shampoo is a complete disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hair is healthy and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have cytotoxic or other harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> My hair is very healthy but naturally dry as a lot of curly hair is.</li>
            <li> , I just would not reccomend this particular shampoo for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed right after I rinsed that my hair felt...</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my hair shinny, hydrated and removes all frizz (which is not an easy task considering I live in South Florida).</li>
            <li> When I went to the store, they didn&#x27;t have the normal brand of natural shampoo I had been using, so I thought -- against my better judgement -- to give Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo a try.</li>
            <li> First I tried Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Not only do bugs love the smell of this, but so do cats.</li>
            <li> The first time I shampooed my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the first bottle</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s your first time washing without sulfates, of course it&#x27;s going to be greasy.</li>
            <li> so try them all if the first one doesnt work for you</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it works better with other type of hair but it didn&#x27;t work for my fine, straight hair</li>
            <li> how great it felt to finally have my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li> Generally I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this one falls flat.  </li>
            <li> At first I was very pleased with the results, it seemed as if it instantly tamed my fly aways and such but as the month since I purchased it has passed my hair has progressively gotten greasier and extremely dull looking.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair that was, at one point in time, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> When I first bought it I thought that it smelled absolutely heavenly</li>
            <li> OK, so doesn&#x27;t work for me as a shampoo, but it is full of more natural ingredients than most soaps/shampoos, plus it smells a little citrusy/ vanilla like , reminded me of real southern Key Lime Pie.</li>
            <li> , when I finally ran out a month ago I bought the new More Moisture.</li>
            <li> It did not have very much lather, but still left my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> can only imagine what this would do to someone with fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather much</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a moisturizing formula, but this was really, really greasy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells fresh and natural.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like it really cleans my hair-</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a lot of really helpful ingredients</li>
            <li> and I had to use a residue striper to get back the light</li>
            <li> I wish they would bring back the old More Moisture Shampoo.</li>
            <li> bug bites on your scalp (especially if you&#x27;re balding) are neither fun nor pretty.</li>
            <li> have fine straight hair and wanted to give this shampoo a try since my ends tend to be dry.</li>
            <li> I would wash my hair and not only did it not smell clean but hrs.</li>
            <li> I also tried their new formula for Super Shiny (the mango) and had the exact same results.  </li>
            <li> it leaves it greasy and matted, particularly underneath.  </li>
            <li> I have curly very dry hair that is fine and prone to frizz in humidy.  </li>
            <li> and its soft!!</li>
            <li> and it left it squeaky clean, soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> low chemicals, clean natural feel</li>
            <li> and because that&#x27;s supposed to be good for hair, in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this for approximately six months now.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, you live and learn I guess.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that it doesn&#x27;t contain sodium lauryl sulfate or propyline glycol, but unfortunately this particular \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product just doesn&#x27;t clean or moisturize well, which is what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li> It made the whole top and front of my hair noticeably thick and greasy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it&#x27;s not a kids&#x27; shampoo, it&#x27;s not tear-free, so I don&#x27;t recommend using this on very young children.</li>
            <li> The first wash you are removing  dirt and prior product buildup.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like Burt&#x27;s Bees Shampoo and Conditioner with Baobab, I like all the other Burt&#x27;s Bees products I&#x27;ve tried, but this duo is unfortunately not for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for shampoo and conditioner without all the possibly harmful chemicals, but not had much luck so far.  </li>
            <li> , I know that some natural shampoos can take time to get used to if you have been using chemical products.</li>
            <li> I have naturally 2C-3A curly hair.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to go all natural and try burts.</li>
            <li> Their hair does not get greasy after using it and their hair is soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> My hair has natural body.  </li>
            <li> I have been using natural shampoos for 5 yrs.</li>
            <li> it took my hair a week and after the first week of use my hair would be clean after only using a small amount of shampoo.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, fast forward to the second week of use...after the second and third time using it, I realized that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling I felt that first time I tried it was the so called &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34;  the shampoo provides which in my case caused build up.  </li>
            <li> Like the title of the review says, that&#x27;s my main problem with this product and the same goes for the condtioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt greasy even towards the middle and ends, and I began to shed quite a bit more hair than usual.</li>
            <li> I could see that if your hair is not truly dry how the combination of the conditioner and shampoo might be to much.  </li>
            <li> As someone who is pregnant, I wanted to try something without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is my third attempt and although the Burt&#x27;s Bees products left my hair in a little better condition, they have left the skin on my scalp and face quite irritated, burning and itchy.  </li>
            <li> I received the products but two of the bottles were not tightly closed and one had leaked.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry hair</li>
            <li> you have to get passed the gross greasiness and flat phase.</li>
            <li> This Shampoo is very heavy for fine hair and it leaves my hair limp and stringy...even washing twice &amp;  without use of conditioner afterward.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small so much.</li>
            <li> In fact, it left my hair dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is colored with a demi-perm color, and this shampoo has not stripped the color out of my hair at all or left it feeling dry.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a very fruity, sweet smell, which isn&#x27;t bad in and of itself except...</li>
            <li> It is indeed moisturizing but probably a little too much for my hair so that it feels a little oily.</li>
            <li> and i have very long hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dry texture.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every 3-4 days because my hair tends to be on the dry side.</li>
            <li> My haie is dry but not after using this shampoo</li>
            <li> My hair is EXTREMELY dry and fly-away even in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I have very fine, thinning hair, and my scalp tends to get dry (which can be really ugly to see).</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with dry hair or living in a dry climate!</li>
            <li> I am trying to eliminate, or at least cut back on all the harmful and toxic chemicals traditional personal care products use.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure as to if it dries hair too much as I use heavy conditioners.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive but far cheaper than higher end</li>
            <li> I tend to have very dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> and i still had a knotting mess and had to you de-tangler to get my hair brushed out.</li>
            <li> It does, however, feel a little different while shampooing.  </li>
            <li> But i have a whole lot of it so its very thick, it has been quite a task.</li>
            <li> That said, I love Berts Bees products and since the Fruit and leaves of the Baobab tree are used medicinally for asthma and for allergic skin conditions, it couldn&#x27;t be a bad thing to keep this product around in the shower for use as a body wash</li>
            <li> So I thought I could possibly be using too much conditioner, wrong again.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> wet</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the results of this product, especially considering the price I paid for it at my local super market.</li>
            <li> (I use this shampoo usually once a week, and a different shampoo the rest of the week)that after using this shampoo my hair was as dry as straw.  </li>
            <li> However, due to trying to get rid of chronic hives</li>
            <li> Perhaps that is due to the addition of the moisurizing ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Skipped the conditioner, used very wide comb and applied Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> I gave this shampoo another try and the following day after using it my hair looked dull once</li>
            <li> Sometimes a short \\&quot;purging\\&quot; period will cause icky hair days.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, color treated, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I had already bought the conditioner and loved it, but this shampoo was terrible.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo does seem to weigh it down a bit.  </li>
            <li> (half a bottle) down the drain.  </li>
            <li> I have tried using less and more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Usually I can go three days without washing my hair with absolutely no issues do to</li>
            <li> It was spilt a little this time, but it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t matter, just a little.</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> but they left my hair in poor condition.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried Avalon Lavender Conditioner and had the same poor result.  </li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews here before making my purchase, it would have saved me a few $$$.  </li>
            <li> all of those that I&#x27;ve tried have been so drying and harsh that I&#x27;ll stick with drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair every other day with that shampoo, the bottle lasted forever, you didn&#x27;t mean much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need something that isn&#x27;t going to damage my hair any worse than the dry heat does.  </li>
            <li> Usually, I use their volume shampoo and conditioner, but decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with scalp psoriasis for the past year or so...</li>
            <li> and my hair just looked dull.  </li>
            <li> later my hair looked greasy and dirty.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, unruly, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Wrong, even after a vigorous rinse it was still extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> It attracts bugs and I mean tons and tons of them.</li>
            <li> I tried every expensive product I could find.</li>
            <li> On a personal preference note, the smell was terrible too.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to even try it because of the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> Aside from chapstick and cuticle cream, I&#x27;ve had nothing but disappointing experiences with this brand.</li>
            <li> I resorted to wearing pony tales with headbands to disguise the results as I waited out what I hoped would be an awkward period.</li>
            <li> Turns out I was just dealing with a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even after using absurd amounts of the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After blow drying my hair, the sides and layers underneath would look disgustingly greasy.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is awful.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> When I went to the store, they didn&#x27;t have the normal brand of natural shampoo I had been using, so I thought -- against my better judgement -- to give Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo a try. Aside from chapstick and cuticle cream, I&#x27;ve had nothing but disappointing experiences with this brand. Somehow I thought this would be different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a good amount for the price and the smell is great, so I bought a bottle. I have thick, coarse, color treated, wavy hair. Usually I can go three days without washing my hair with absolutely no issues do to it&#x27;s dry texture. However, as soon as I started using this product, it felt like I wasn&#x27;t washing my hair at all, when in fact I would wash it four times in one shower. Scrub, scrub, scrub...nothing. Even after using absurd amounts of the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After blow drying my hair, the sides and layers underneath would look disgustingly greasy. I went back in the shower several times to check if I had mistakenly bought the conditioner. Nope!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I know that some natural shampoos can take time to get used to if you have been using chemical products. Sometimes a short \\&quot;purging\\&quot; period will cause icky hair days. But after using almost the entire bottle, I still look like an unhygienic middle schooler. I resorted to wearing pony tales with headbands to disguise the results as I waited out what I hoped would be an awkward period. Turns out I was just dealing with a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only imagine what this would do to someone with fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. Never again, Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> I have naturally 2C-3A curly hair. I was looking for a reasonably priced sulfate free shampoo. I wash my hair every 3-4 days because my hair tends to be on the dry side. I used to use head and shoulders because of the scalp dryness and itchiness. This has worked great for my hair type and it really gets your scalp clean, smells awesome, and lathers.</li>
            <li> It does not smell great. Don&#x27;t think its doing a great job moisturizing my hair. It doesn&#x27;t sud well but that could be a good thing because of the lack of chemicals. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.  Edit: 1/16/15. I&#x27;m editing my post to say that this shampoo and conditioner have actually been making my hair look really good in terms of how its falling. It is indeed moisturizing but probably a little too much for my hair so that it feels a little oily. This would work great for really dry hair.</li>
            <li> Smelled good, but was not moisturizing at all.  In fact, it left my hair dry and frizzy.  I was not a fan.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery. Quality Product.</li>
            <li> Love it so far! I am not sure as to if it dries hair too much as I use heavy conditioners. But the smell is to die for!!! and its soft!!</li>
            <li> Glad to be able to find this since my boyfriend is allergic to sulfates. Doesn&#x27;t lather much but it does do the job perfectly. He always smells so good after his showers.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wasn&#x27;t able to find my normal Burt&#x27;s Bees shampoo anywhere.  I had already bought the conditioner and loved it, but this shampoo was terrible.  It made the whole top and front of my hair noticeably thick and greasy.  I know it&#x27;s a moisturizing formula, but this was really, really greasy. I also tried their new formula for Super Shiny (the mango) and had the exact same results.  I have normal to dry hair but I can&#x27;t use either of these.  Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Smells like bubble gum.</li>
            <li> I like the product and how it lathers on the scalp. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything special regarding my scalp and hair, but I love that it has ingredients that isn&#x27;t known to cause health problems like many of the regular brands out there.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like Burt&#x27;s Bees Shampoo and Conditioner with Baobab, I like all the other Burt&#x27;s Bees products I&#x27;ve tried, but this duo is unfortunately not for me.  I&#x27;ve been looking for shampoo and conditioner without all the possibly harmful chemicals, but not had much luck so far.  First I tried Free and Clear shampoo and conditioner but they left my hair in poor condition.  Then I tried Avalon Lavender Conditioner and had the same poor result.  This is my third attempt and although the Burt&#x27;s Bees products left my hair in a little better condition, they have left the skin on my scalp and face quite irritated, burning and itchy.  If it weren&#x27;t for the skin reaction, I would have given these products 3 or 4 stars.  The search continues.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, unruly, curly hair.  This product worked surprisingly well for my hair, and left a nice scent.  It did not have very much lather, but still left my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for years now. Usually, I use their volume shampoo and conditioner, but decided to give this one a try. I absolutely love it! It smells so wonderful that I look forward to using it every day. And I like the results. I tend to have very dry, curly hair. This has added a good amount of moisture. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo and conditioner for years, I like it&#x27;s small so much. It was spilt a little this time, but it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t matter, just a little.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. The smell is great. Makes my hair feel really good. My haie is dry but not after using this shampoo</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from drying up and soft, also smells great.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair that was, at one point in time, shiny and healthy. I have struggled to find *the* shampoo for my hair, considering that each strand of hair is very fine But i have a whole lot of it so its very thick, it has been quite a task. At first I was very pleased with the results, it seemed as if it instantly tamed my fly aways and such but as the month since I purchased it has passed my hair has progressively gotten greasier and extremely dull looking. I, like others who have left reviews, thought that I wasn&#x27;t rinsing it well. Wrong, even after a vigorous rinse it was still extremely greasy. So I thought I could possibly be using too much conditioner, wrong again. I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the results of this product, especially considering the price I paid for it at my local super market. Would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I had box dyed my hair one too many times, and the texture had changed to an unmanageable, elasticy, knot that had me CONVINCED I would have to chop off all my hair. I tried every expensive product I could find. Then I decided to go all natural and try burts. THIS SAVED MY HAIR. I cant stress enough how great it felt to finally have my hair back to normal. Thank you burts!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have very fine, thinning hair, and my scalp tends to get dry (which can be really ugly to see). As a shampoo, it&#x27;s okay, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with greasy build-up, nor hair falling out, or anything like that, what I have had a problem with is this smell. This shampoo has a very fruity, sweet smell, which isn&#x27;t bad in and of itself except... It attracts bugs and I mean tons and tons of them. I walk outside and they swarm around my head following me everywhere -- bug bites on your scalp (especially if you&#x27;re balding) are neither fun nor pretty. Not only do bugs love the smell of this, but so do cats. The cat has woken me up in the middle of the night licking my head, which would be nice if the sandpaper like tongue didn&#x27;t start to hurt. So, while I guess this is a good shampoo, it&#x27;s probably best for those who live in place without bugs or pets.</li>
            <li> My kids outgrew using the Baby Bee wash as a shampoo, so I was looking for a sulfate-free shampoo to replace it.  They both have fine, but dry hair, so this is perfect for them.  Their hair does not get greasy after using it and their hair is soft and manageable.  My kids also love the fruity smell, and it lathers well for a sulfate-free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s not a kids&#x27; shampoo, it&#x27;s not tear-free, so I don&#x27;t recommend using this on very young children.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo.  I use the conditioner as well.  Hair is healthy and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have cytotoxic or other harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> My wife is allergic to it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with these shampoo or conditioner. The Shampoo was good, but the conditioner did not work well for me and i have very long hair and i still had a knotting mess and had to you de-tangler to get my hair brushed out. i have up on Burts bees shampoo and conditioners. I guess they can&#x27;t win them all. Although i still love their products</li>
            <li> Like the title of the review says, that&#x27;s my main problem with this product and the same goes for the condtioner.  I bought both of them together at my local health food store.  I am trying to eliminate, or at least cut back on all the harmful and toxic chemicals traditional personal care products use.  I am glad that it doesn&#x27;t contain sodium lauryl sulfate or propyline glycol, but unfortunately this particular \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product just doesn&#x27;t clean or moisturize well, which is what it claims to do.  I should have read the reviews here before making my purchase, it would have saved me a few $$$.  Oh well, you live and learn I guess.  I will continue my search for a shampoo and conditioner made without so many harmful chemicals.  I know there are others, but this one just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells fresh and natural.  My hair has natural body.  This shampoo does seem to weigh it down a bit.  I usually wash first with this shampoo and then rinse and shampoo again with Redken for color treated hair.  The two together works good.  This could be a good shampoo for someone with flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> I love BB&#x27;s products but this shampoo is a complete disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine straight hair and wanted to give this shampoo a try since my ends tend to be dry. The first time I shampooed my hair I noticed right after I rinsed that my hair felt...wet, I know it makes no sense but my hair felt different. I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair smelled because after washing it twice it still smelled unclean and more of the way your hair smells after being out in a very humid day. I have been using natural shampoos for 5 yrs. now so I know not to expect a strong smell but the scent this one has is lovely in the bottle, not so much once you shampoo your hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, fast forward to the second week of use...after the second and third time using it, I realized that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling I felt that first time I tried it was the so called &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34;  the shampoo provides which in my case caused build up.  I would wash my hair and not only did it not smell clean but hrs. later my hair looked greasy and dirty.  I don&#x27;t use any kind of hair products, no gel, spray, nothing and I noticed my scalp started to itch and my hair just looked dull.  I went to the store and bought a build-up remover shampoo and it left it squeaky clean, soft and shinny. I gave this shampoo another try and the following day after using it my hair looked dull once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it works better with other type of hair but it didn&#x27;t work for my fine, straight hair and I decided to use it as body wash.</li>
            <li> low chemicals, clean natural feel</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because it was sulfate free, and I was looking to make a switch to something more natural. I was very disappointed. My hair never once felt really clean while I was using this shampoo and conditioner. My hair felt greasy even towards the middle and ends, and I began to shed quite a bit more hair than usual. On a personal preference note, the smell was terrible too. I gave it away after about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Generally I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this one falls flat.  It doesn&#x27;t lather very well and I don&#x27;t feel like it really cleans my hair- it leaves it greasy and matted, particularly underneath.  I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo.  When I first bought it I thought that it smelled absolutely heavenly and I liked that it was sulfate free.  However I noticed over time (I use this shampoo usually once a week, and a different shampoo the rest of the week)that after using this shampoo my hair was as dry as straw.  Also about 5 weeks after buying the shampoo it started to smell rancid, really gross so I ended up dumping what was left (half a bottle) down the drain.  I had also bought the matching conditioner but had to ditch it as well as it did not moisturize my hair at all.  So after this I&#x27;ve determined that I&#x27;ll not be buying anything else made by Burt&#x27;s Bees.  I&#x27;d really love to be able to use natural products on my hair but all of those that I&#x27;ve tried have been so drying and harsh that I&#x27;ll stick with drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> I have been using Loreal Eversleek shampoo and conditioner, which is another sulfate free brand. However, due to trying to get rid of chronic hives w/ undetermined cause, I thought I would try this brand of shampoo since it is free of parabens. I am very satisfied with it so far. It lathers and cleans well without stripping my fine, wavy hair, and I like the smell. My hair is colored with a demi-perm color, and this shampoo has not stripped the color out of my hair at all or left it feeling dry. I am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> This is awful.  My hair is left feeling greasy even if I lather and rinse twice in a row with this shampoo.  One morning I actually wondered if I forgot to wash my hair.  I enjoyed their predecessor shampoo formulas.  I&#x27;m left wondering if the Clorox purchase of BBs has driven changes to maximize margin not customer satisfaction and whether or not I can trust purchasing their products going forward.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery, no problems.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees always have great products including this shampoo!</li>
            <li> The first wash you are removing  dirt and prior product buildup. No lather. Do it again and the lather is super rich. Now my hair is clean.  Skipped the conditioner, used very wide comb and applied Moroccan oil. Excellent results, very shiny, soft, full and clean hair &amp; scalp. It works great.</li>
            <li> I wish they would bring back the old More Moisture Shampoo. I washed my hair every other day with that shampoo, the bottle lasted forever, you didn&#x27;t mean much.&lt;br /&gt;So, when I finally ran out a month ago I bought the new More Moisture. It leaves your hair so greasy. I have tried using less and more.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what they did to the formula, but they didn&#x27;t change it for the better. I am not even sure if I will finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used on my hair. It is a little expensive but far cheaper than higher end brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair shinny, hydrated and removes all frizz (which is not an easy task considering I live in South Florida). My girlfriend and friends have noticed the different and think that I had a treatment done or something. Recommend you use it alongside the Burt&#x27;s Bees Shea and Grapefruit deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I just started using this more moisture shampoo along with the conditioner and my hair has never looked better..or felt better.  I have curly very dry hair that is fine and prone to frizz in humidy.  My hair is very healthy but naturally dry as a lot of curly hair is. My hair has never felt this smooth ever.. The curls are soft with some nice corkscrew curls here and there.  I could see that if your hair is not truly dry how the combination of the conditioner and shampoo might be to much.  I was skeptical to even try it because of the bad reviews.  I am so happy I decided to.  This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ll use now!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome natural shampoo and paraben free! It is very moisturizing, making it great for dry winter months. I use it along with the Moisture Baobab Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Totally moisturizes and brings back my curls!</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with scalp psoriasis for the past year or so...I read a review about the glycerin in this shampoo helping so I decided to try it out. It took about 2 months for me to begin to see results, but I haven&#x27;t had a flair up since then. I&#x27;m not going to say this cured my psoriasis, but it has definitely helped in managing it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Smells good and lives up to what it says it will do for your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is EXTREMELY dry and fly-away even in the summer.  This shampoo added moisure and volume, which resulted in greater managability.  It does, however, feel a little different while shampooing.  Perhaps that is due to the addition of the moisurizing ingredients.  It also has a pleasing fragrance.  I&#x27;m still on the first bottle and I DO switch off about one-third of the time to avoid any kind of build up and because that&#x27;s supposed to be good for hair, in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve been using this for approximately six months now.  It has improved the look and feel of my hair so much that I rarely switch off to anything else, and when I do, I&#x27;m always sorry that I did.  It&#x27;s got a lot of really helpful ingredients and it&#x27;s sulfate free.  I hope they never change the formula.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the Baobab seed oil ingredient since the Baobab is my favorite tree. It does a wonderful job moisturizing my hair. But combined with the conditioner, residue built up and I had to use a residue striper to get back the light shine I so like.</li>
            <li> This is great and all-natural. As someone who is pregnant, I wanted to try something without all the harsh chemicals. It works just as great as other shampoo, costs less than most at the store, and works/smells great!</li>
            <li> This Shampoo is very heavy for fine hair and it leaves my hair limp and stringy...even washing twice &amp;  without use of conditioner afterward.  OK, so doesn&#x27;t work for me as a shampoo, but it is full of more natural ingredients than most soaps/shampoos, plus it smells a little citrusy/ vanilla like , reminded me of real southern Key Lime Pie. That said, I love Berts Bees products and since the Fruit and leaves of the Baobab tree are used medicinally for asthma and for allergic skin conditions, it couldn&#x27;t be a bad thing to keep this product around in the shower for use as a body wash, right?  Wikapedia says that some people are calling the baobab fruit the next \\&quot;super food\\&quot; because of its exotic nature and rich nutrient profile...that is great, I just would not reccomend this particular shampoo for fine hair. If you have the time, google the images for the Baobab tree - very cool.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  It has no detergents in it and living in the desert I need something that isn&#x27;t going to damage my hair any worse than the dry heat does.  This shampoo is wonderful.  I would recommend it to anyone with dry hair or living in a dry climate!</li>
            <li> you have to get passed the gross greasiness and flat phase. it took my hair a week and after the first week of use my hair would be clean after only using a small amount of shampoo. if it&#x27;s your first time washing without sulfates, of course it&#x27;s going to be greasy. your hair has over produced oils and you have to give it some time to stop over producing. ive used this and the pomegranate and ive had different results for both. so try them all if the first one doesnt work for you but i promise you will love burts bees and your hair will look so much better</li>
            <li> I received the products but two of the bottles were not tightly closed and one had leaked. This is all I have to say.</li>
