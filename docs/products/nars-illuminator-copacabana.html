            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Color is perfect.</li>
            <li>perfect under or blended with foundation as a primer and highlighter.</li>
            <li>Absolutely awesome Illuminator in this Copacabana shade.  </li>
            <li>Very happy</li>
            <li>This stuff is INCREDIBLY reflective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shade -</li>
            <li>Super recomendo!!!</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to apply and no need much product to get a very nice and very beautiful look.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>The best way to apply this creamy Illuminator is to use the Nars Pore Perfecter for Oily skin under it first.  </li>
            <li>and I simply love it!</li>
            <li>The Orgasm shade of this Illuminator does what makeup SHOULD do - enhance your own beauty.</li>
            <li>Really looks wonderful..</li>
            <li>and I look healthy and gorgeous..</li>
            <li>Very impressed with this product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But, yes I love it</li>
            <li>and I will order more once it is time to get another one.</li>
            <li>I think it better moisturizing skin before use.</li>
            <li>love the color..</li>
            <li>I love their foundations and blushes but not this Illuminator.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Look, I love this…and I mix it in with my foundation…</li>
            <li>I was about to get &#x27;that gal&#x27; and/or &#x27;high beam&#x27; from benefit, but I saw a great article about this product and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>I did not care for it specially when it was kind of pricy for what it did--</li>
            <li>This is perfect to add just a little shimmer to my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, and can be added throughout the day when you need some brightening to your face</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it on darker skin tones, it would be too light.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great product and would recommend to anyone.  </li>
            <li>There is a cheap paper \\&quot;instruction manual\\&quot; in the box, which is not included in the box when you buy it at the mall.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for--I love the Nars illuminator in orgasm for the summer, when I&#x27;m tan, but in the winter, I need something lighter for my lighter skin.</li>
            <li>so using the Perfecter for oily skin is to make the Illuminator &amp; then make up set properly and look good.  </li>
            <li>wherever light hits first - brow bone, collarbone etc.</li>
            <li>It is one of those rare products that just makes you look</li>
            <li>So save your $$ &amp; go right to the one for oily skin.</li>
            <li>Beautiful illumination under eyebrows, around inner corner of eye, just above cupid&#x27;s bow.</li>
            <li>The Copacabana illuminator is a fun color and adds glow to your face, etc...just don&#x27;t use too much or you will end up looking like the tin man!</li>
            <li>It is thicker than the benefit products (I looked like the tin man after the first application...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sparing in your application it can definitely give a lovely effect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the same product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rate this in my top beauty buys because it&#x27;s just such an absolute steal for the money.</li>
            <li>The Nars Pore Perfecter for Dry skin will not set my makeup in this horrid humid, hot tropical climate, so make sure to get the one for oily skin as it sets your makeup whether going out for the day or evening.  </li>
            <li>One drop is powerful enough to highlight your entire face effectively.</li>
            <li>The packaging is very low quality, whereas authentic NARS packaging is high quality.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you wait and let the pore perfecter dry into your skin, then apply&lt;br /&gt;the illuminator &amp; let it set, then apply your make up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 28 years old and am constantly looking for new products that make me look better then ever!</li>
            <li>highly recommend, but don&#x27;t over do it ;)</li>
            <li>I mix it with my foundation before application and get a very dewy look.</li>
            <li>It has a very frost/metallic finish.  </li>
            <li>very lluminating</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for anything NARS, but the elf shimmer palette is probably just as good for highlighting at a much lower price point.</li>
            <li>Illuminates older skin.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to use it sparingly as a high liter.</li>
            <li>I use this on my cheeks mostly; for night time looks you could also place a little</li>
            <li>used with a very sparing hand it brings out an inner golden peachy glow that looks diffused and natural.</li>
            <li>The entire trick to success in setting your make up to stay put is the Pore Perfecter for oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Someday, when I finally need a new bottle, I&#x27;ll buy another one right away.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the container is small too.</li>
            <li>It is light on the face and adds the little bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for creating a dewy look even in the bitter cold and dryness of winter.</li>
            <li>I use from light to heavy liquid foundations, but my daughter uses mineral powder make up&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I did not use the product, because I could tell it was fake right away, but the color also did not seem very consistent in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have mature, dry skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Do not trust sellers on Amazon.com who are selling NARS or other expensive beauty products.  </li>
            <li> I thought is was a little expensive</li>
            <li> However, I must say I was SHOCKED when I saw how small it is.</li>

            <li> I have tried a lot of illuminators lately and really like this one - I was about to get &#x27;that gal&#x27; and/or &#x27;high beam&#x27; from benefit, but I saw a great article about this product and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  It is thicker than the benefit products (I looked like the tin man after the first application...a little goes a long way!), which means this large quantity will last a long time.  It&#x27;s a great shade - I definitely recommend for anyone looking for a liquid illuminator/highlighter.</li>
            <li> Great product! Goes on smoothly, and can be added throughout the day when you need some brightening to your face area.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Lisa</li>
            <li> I love this product! I mix it with my foundation before application and get a very dewy look.</li>
            <li> Bottle will go a LONG way. The smallest amount is all that&#x27;s used per application. Beautiful illumination under eyebrows, around inner corner of eye, just above cupid&#x27;s bow. Planning on getting the orgasm color as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is INCREDIBLY reflective.  It has a very frost/metallic finish.  If you&#x27;re sparing in your application it can definitely give a lovely effect.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it on darker skin tones, it would be too light.  They do have a darker color in the Illumjinator line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> The Copacabana illuminator is a fun color and adds glow to your face, etc...just don&#x27;t use too much or you will end up looking like the tin man!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Copacabana off of the reviews I read b/c I wanted it to give my face a glowly look. I love it. However, I must say I was SHOCKED when I saw how small it is. All that for 29 dollars I thought? However, you do only need a very tiny amount so I guess it might last longer then I realize?!? Hopefully. But, yes I love it and I will order more once it is time to get another one. I do wanna try the body Illuminator as well, but that is $59 dollars and I&#x27;m sure the container is small too. I am going to try to use some of this on my legs to see if I like it b/c I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the same product. Anyways, I highly suggest trying this, I really don&#x27;t think anyone can be disappointed. I&#x27;m 28 years old and am constantly looking for new products that make me look better then ever!</li>
            <li> As a former makeup artist, as far as cosmetics go, I try a lot, buy *some*, and rave about very FEW.

            <li> A fan for a long time..best illuminator.</li>
            <li> I recommend this products.If you want to looks younger !!! Color is perfect. I think it better moisturizing skin before use.</li>
            <li> Really looks wonderful..love the color..I used it over moisturizer and I look healthy and gorgeous..</li>
            <li> I used maybe a table spoon of this product since I purchased this awhile back.  Just didn&#x27;t do anything for me and it was watery.  I love their foundations and blushes but not this Illuminator.  I wish it worked for me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. perfect under or blended with foundation as a primer and highlighter.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome Illuminator in this Copacabana shade.  The best way to apply this creamy Illuminator is to use the Nars Pore Perfecter for Oily skin under it first.  I have mature, dry skin so using the Perfecter for oily skin is to make the Illuminator &amp; then make up set properly and look good.

The one for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;would not set my make up all day or all night and got drippy after a couple of hrs.  So save your $$ &amp; go right to the one for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I did not care for it specially when it was kind of pricy for what it did--my cheeks were not luminized like the product said it would do -I would not buy it again or recommend it</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for--I love the Nars illuminator in orgasm for the summer, when I&#x27;m tan, but in the winter, I need something lighter for my lighter skin. This product is perfect for creating a dewy look even in the bitter cold and dryness of winter. A little goes a long way, so this should last me a long time.</li>
            <li> This little bottle lasts for-freaking-ever. One drop is powerful enough to highlight your entire face effectively.

            <li> A little goes a long way! very lluminating</li>
            <li> I saw this in a makeup tutorial and I simply love it! I also use mac highlighter, but this one is so blendable and gives a brighter effect. highly recommend, but don&#x27;t over do it ;)</li>
            <li> Illuminates older skin.  Very happy</li>
            <li> Look, I love this…and I mix it in with my foundation….it&#x27;s very pink, though, and if you overdo it, you will look shiny! I prefer to use it sparingly as a high liter. I&#x27;m a sucker for anything NARS, but the elf shimmer palette is probably just as good for highlighting at a much lower price point.</li>
            <li> Adorei o produto!!! Ele é lindo e chegou no prazo. Super recomendo!!! Valeu muito a pena! Os produtos Nars são os melhores!!!</li>
            <li> This is not a NARS product.  The packaging is very low quality, whereas authentic NARS packaging is high quality.  There is a cheap paper \\&quot;instruction manual\\&quot; in the box, which is not included in the box when you buy it at the mall.  I did not use the product, because I could tell it was fake right away, but the color also did not seem very consistent in the bottle.  Do not trust sellers on Amazon.com who are selling NARS or other expensive beauty products.  Only order from the company&#x27;s website (in this case NARS website) or buy in person at a department store at the mall or Sephora or another trusted make-up supplier.</li>
