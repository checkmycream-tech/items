            <li>Just love this product which i&#x27;ve been using for a good number of years...</li>
            <li>I have found this particular brand to be very good and goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li>Bare Minerals is still the best of them all.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Glad I make the investment.</li>
            <li>I am totally in love with this makeup.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of make-up.</li>
            <li>yet I feel my aging skin (almost 59 yrs old) looks as good as it gets!  </li>
            <li>I loved how it made my face look like a canvas, ready for painting!  </li>
            <li>and I love the clean feel.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and it covers well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t soil my clothes and it is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>etc giving my skin a lovely smooth blemish free sheen.</li>
            <li>it covers blemishes, fine veins</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals has been my favorite makeup for years and this shade is a good match for my olive skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I love it but just don&#x27;t ever take the time to do it right.  </li>
            <li>The powder was light weight on face, the texture is smooth and it is not a bad thing to leave on face over night, it&#x27;s so light weight on my face</li>
            <li>I believe the one thing I love most about Bare Minerals foundation with SPF 15 is the feeling that it&#x27;s NOT a caked-on, clog-your-pores foundation.  </li>
            <li>It is so light on your face, but covers very well.</li>
            <li>I rarely wear makeup.  </li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time and my friends noticed right away.  </li>
            <li>Great product, I have been using bare minerals for a long time will continue to use.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Was a larger container than expected, so that was a nice surprise!</li>
            <li>You really just have to try it.</li>
            <li>My skin shows so much of a difference when wearing this makeup.  </li>
            <li>My friends stated that they thought it made them look older because of their wrinkles and lines but on me (I am tan with oily skin)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using bare essentials for a few years now, and still love it!</li>
            <li>You can either match your skin color or use a little darker for a more tanned look.  </li>
            <li>It goes on with enough light-to-medium coverage (depending on how much you like)and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is actually real Bare Minerals, or if it was inexpensive because the container is a dud.  </li>
            <li>There are no stores close to my home where I can purchase Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>I am 25 yrs old, tan moderately and every once in awhile</li>
            <li>I have used Bare Minerals for over ten years</li>

            <li> The only disappointment that I had was that the top doesn&#x27;t close when I want to put it away or travel.  </li>
            <li> It actually has reduced the amount of acne that I used to get, probably because it isn&#x27;t suffocating my skin! :)</li>
            <li> After using Bare Minerals for the past 7 years, I wouldn&#x27;t dream of changing my make-up.  </li>
            <li> I used Bare Minerals in the past then tried other brands.</li>
            <li> The cap feels thin and heap, and not the same plastic as other BM, and the sifter doesn&#x27;t lock into place either open or closed.  </li>
            <li> Something seems to be different with the consistency, not really sure what it is.</li>
            <li> Once you try it, you will never use any of the other things again.</li>
            <li> So This is certainly not worth the price you pay.</li>
            <li> When I can get a little cheaper</li>
            <li> i had trouble with the matte version my face broke out...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy either.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with bare minerals!!  </li>
            <li> My tone is usually all off</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; would make my face itch and feel dry, but it didnt do that at all.</li>

            <li> I rarely wear makeup.  I love it but just don&#x27;t ever take the time to do it right.  Anyhow, I bought this because I have a cruise coming up and want to \\&quot;paint my face\\&quot; every day.  I tried this for the first time and my friends noticed right away.  I loved how it made my face look like a canvas, ready for painting!  My tone is usually all off and this stuff looked absolutely incredible.  My friends stated that they thought it made them look older because of their wrinkles and lines but on me (I am tan with oily skin) it looked great!  You really just have to try it.</li>
            <li> After using Bare Minerals for the past 7 years, I wouldn&#x27;t dream of changing my make-up.  There are no stores close to my home where I can purchase Bare Minerals so Amazon.com fits the bill perfectly for me!</li>
            <li> I used Bare Minerals in the past then tried other brands. Bare Minerals is still the best of them all. It has the best color shades still.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using bare essentials for a few years now, and still love it! I have oily skin so it doesn&#x27;t make me look like I just pace planted on a fowl of baby oil like liquid makeup does, yet still gives great coverage.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with bare minerals!!  My skin shows so much of a difference when wearing this makeup.  So happy with it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it. Tan in the summer and medium tan in the winter.</li>
            <li> The only disappointment that I had was that the top doesn&#x27;t close when I want to put it away or travel.  This was the 2nd time that this has happened on an online order.</li>
            <li> I love it. The best makeup made.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have been using bare minerals for a long time will continue to use.  Will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my own use, I simply  Loved it, nice make-up.  I recommend this to friends all the time. Good seller as well.</li>
            <li> I have used Bare Minerals for over ten years and I love the clean feel. I remove my make up almost every night, but if for some reason I don&#x27;t,  I don&#x27;t wake up with make up all over my pillow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is actually real Bare Minerals, or if it was inexpensive because the container is a dud.  The cap feels thin and heap, and not the same plastic as other BM, and the sifter doesn&#x27;t lock into place either open or closed.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is easy to apply and it covers well.It doesn&#x27;t soil my clothes and it is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> The powder was light weight on face, the texture is smooth and it is not a bad thing to leave on face over night, it&#x27;s so light weight on my face I forgot I had the foundation on, it&#x27;s luminiously radiant on the skin.</li>
            <li> Something seems to be different with the consistency, not really sure what it is.</li>
            <li> I believe the one thing I love most about Bare Minerals foundation with SPF 15 is the feeling that it&#x27;s NOT a caked-on, clog-your-pores foundation.  It goes on with enough light-to-medium coverage (depending on how much you like)and yet I feel my aging skin (almost 59 yrs old) looks as good as it gets!  I cleanse before bed, but if I can&#x27;t cleanse for some reason, I know the pillow cases aren&#x27;t going to have the remains of yucky makeup on them the next morning! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Have purchased before and will continue to purchase.  Color is great, coverage is great.  Very Happy&lt;br /&gt;with this.</li>
            <li> Just love this product which i&#x27;ve been using for a good number of years...it covers blemishes, fine veins etc giving my skin a lovely smooth blemish free sheen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color and product for yrs! Will never go back to drug store products. And for the price here on amazon, I just can&#x27;t pass it up. I am 25 yrs old, tan moderately and every once in awhile I will get a blemish or 2. This stuff doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;neck line&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t look cakey. It actually has reduced the amount of acne that I used to get, probably because it isn&#x27;t suffocating my skin! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered medium tan... nowhere in the description does it say it&#x27;s matte... i had trouble with the matte version my face broke out... i didn&#x27;t want to ever order it again so i bought this and now im stuck with matte again... pain in the ass</li>
            <li> What a wonderful way to buy a great makeup.  It is so light on your face, but covers very well. Glad I make the investment.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It&#x27;s all I use1</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this makeup. I would never change to anythinh else. It is wonderful and it has great coverage. I will use this makeup always.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of make-up. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  When I can get a little cheaper it&#x27;s a steal. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it&#x27;s the best foundation that I have ever used.  Works well for my complexion.</li>
            <li> I have found this particular brand to be very good and goes on nicely.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy either.  You can either match your skin color or use a little darker for a more tanned look.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals has been my favorite makeup for years and this shade is a good match for my olive skin tone.  Was a larger container than expected, so that was a nice surprise!</li>
            <li> Im 60 plus and a hairdresser so Im not a stranger to cosmetics in any way...and this is the very best ever to come along. Once you try it, you will never use any of the other things again. I was afraid that the &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; would make my face itch and feel dry, but it didnt do that at all. In fact, you dont even know you are wearing anything. Just try it once....bet you never buy anything else.</li>
            <li> This product is 2g travel size. You can buy the 8g anywhere for $27. So This is certainly not worth the price you pay.</li>
