            <li>Recommended by my dentist excellent</li>

            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Every check-up has been perfect.  </li>
            <li>are about the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>In Spry, I have found the best toothpaste and one I will use from here on.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it&#x27;s a xylitol toothpaste, and xylitol is great for teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps them in great shape.</li>
            <li>It tastes great as well.</li>
            <li>This is great toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I was told that the ingredient which it contains, Xylitol, kills bacteria very effectively.</li>
            <li>Excellent product!!Seller also shipped quickly!!</li>
            <li>I loved this tooth paste.  </li>
            <li>The price is good too on amazon.com.</li>
            <li>To be fair, there isn&#x27;t a lot of sorbitol in the toothpaste; but why not omit it entirely?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I keep getting good results at my dental checkups, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li>dental hygienist and dentist also agree is good for the teeth/gums.</li>
            <li>I have always used Spry and loved its product line, including their gum and pastilles, for their taste and to reduce cavities in my children and myself.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as i thought it would be</li>
            <li>In my opinion, additional preventative measures taken are better than nothing, so even if you do not consume the recommended 6-10grams each day, using this product will still be beneficial towards maintaining great oral health.</li>

            <li>Very refreshing, good taste and effective cleaning</li>
            <li>After using this brand for a month, my dentist said my gum was in a very healthy state.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an effective xylitol toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be effective because whenever we used Xlear toothpaste, we seemed to get no cavities</li>
            <li>(Incidentally, it also prevents periodontal disease and has been shown to be effective at reducing the risk of ear</li>
            <li>Therefore, the more xylitol in the product, the closer we get to the optimum dose.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;This is an amazing product that does better at providing moisturizing than Biotene in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Good flavor and clean teeth.</li>
            <li>I love Spry Xylitol products.</li>
            <li>in all, I would recommend it, but it would be a better product in my estimation without the sorbitol.</li>
            <li>What could be better.</li>
            <li>I appreciate being able to purchase it, with no problems, online.</li>
            <li>I love using Spry tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to go to the dentist any more.</li>
            <li>Love that it uses xylitol</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t need to use a whitener any more.</li>
            <li>Worked better than the antibiotic rinse from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t use the gum, because of TMJ, so I tried the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>If anything, I think we probably consume even more sugar today than we did years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The highest concentration is found in Squigle toothpaste (which you can find here on Amazon; I have it and will use it more than Spry now that I know this).  </li>

            <li>It has Xylitol, which kills oral bacteria to the extent that the oral flora in the mouth changes into a more healthy flora</li>
            <li>The FDA doesn&#x27;t test for toxins or even have very good regulations on personal care items.  </li>
            <li>Xlear Spry is available in spearmint which works much better for me.  </li>
            <li>I saw this product at whole foods but decided to look at Amazon.com and bought it and both my children loved it.  </li>
            <li>No overly strong chemical harse taste.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste tastes great (kind of like the green dinner mints you find at weddings) and isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the taste and appears to work fine, but this will take time and checkup to see how it is working out.</li>
            <li>A great change from regular toothpaste</li>
            <li>this is important to promoting brushing.  </li>

            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>Not a product that is available in most stores, with the exception of certain health food stores.</li>

            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too sweet or minty.  </li>
            <li>This is a good toothpaste, now with fluoride, being recommended by my dentist and is unavailable locally.  </li>
            <li>It is very minty without being overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It is very minty without being overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste costs more than most brands, but unless you brush your teeth ten times a day, the price difference isn&#x27;t significant.</li>
            <li>, It is important to note that in order to get the FULL anti-cavity benefit from xylitol, you have to use xylitol products correctly and consistently over a period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipped quick and just as described.  </li>
            <li>It did take me three days to get used to its different minty taste, but afterwards, I liked it more and more than any commercial fluoride toothpaste I had ever used, including Tom&#x27;s.  </li>

            <li>It is expensive compared to others but has an awesome taste and leaves your teeth feeling so clean!</li>
            <li>I wish more people new about the benefits of Xylitol that is in THIS toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Xylitol is a natural sugar alcohol that cannot be digested by most bacteria in the mouth.</li>
            <li>Xylitol is found to be good for dental health, and this toothpaste has that, as well as being much lower on the toxic ingredients than standard toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>preventative measure works together with other preventative measures to help maintain optimum dental health.</li>
            <li>preventative measure works together with other preventative measures to help maintain optimum dental health.</li>
            <li>Like other toothpastes, it comes in a tube, tastes good, and you use it with a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If I had to guess most people would average around 0.5-0.7 grams of toothpaste each time they brushed, since most people tend to use more toothpaste than recommended.**&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you for carrying this brand at a reasonable price, and getting it to me quickly.</li>
            <li>am telling you this to be aware that in order to have anti-cavity protection from this product, as seen in studies, it is recommended to have 6-10grams xylitol per day.</li>
            <li>Consuming higher than this level did not offer additional benefits in the studies done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Consuming higher than this level did not offer additional benefits in the studies done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They stopped carrying it, so my first instinct was to look on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m looking for as many ways as possible to moisturize my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To obtain beneficial xylitol-effects on mutans streptococci, on plaque and caries occurrence xylitol must be consumed three times or more per day, with a daily dose of 5-6 grams.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The first ingredient is water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a dentist, I have experimented with many different toothpaste brands.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit more expensive than other brands, but when you want to experience the best, it is well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kone</li>
            <li>However, some smart people have already done the math for us at xylitolpreventscavities.com.  </li>
            <li>It is important you are doing your part brushing 2 minutes, 2 times a day, flossing daily, and maintaining regular dental visits in order to prevent decay!</li>
            <li>At roughly $4.50 a tube it is on the more expensive side of toothpaste, but I enjoy the xylitol in it and am happy to pay a little extra for that added</li>
            <li>Just be aware there are specific guidelines set to achieve maximum results in preventing cavities when using xylitol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It always leaves my breath smelling and feeling fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li>If you tend to get more cavities than usual, Spry will kill the organisms that cause cavities, and protect teeth enamel with</li>
            <li>a dental professional, I recommend this product as an additional preventative method against cavities.</li>
            <li>Consuming less xylitol will provide some protection but in order to receive the FULL benefit to protect against cavities, you&#x27;d have to consume 6-10grams each day.</li>

            <li>All xylitol, no other sweeteners!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moreover, the controversy around the harmful effects of fluoride has been widely published, and certain cities in the United States have even removed it from their water supplies, I have steered clear of fluoride toothpastes.  </li>

            <li>To obtain the optimum dosing of xylitol in your diet for caries prevention, you would probably need to chew Spry gum and pastilles at least a few times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Basically, Spry contains 25% xylitol, and it is not the first ingredient after the active ingredient, which is fluoride.  </li>
            <li>So how much xylitol is in this toothpaste, and how much are you getting when you place a small amount on your toothbrush each day?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not cheap, but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I have a super dry mouth due to Meds</li>
            <li>It is important you are doing your part brushing 2 minutes, 2 times a day, flossing daily, and maintaining regular dental visits in order to prevent decay!***er brushing, which is an excessive amount of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Spry Xylitol products. This toothpaste tastes great (kind of like the green dinner mints you find at weddings) and isn&#x27;t too strong. At roughly $4.50 a tube it is on the more expensive side of toothpaste, but I enjoy the xylitol in it and am happy to pay a little extra for that added benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a dental professional, I recommend this product as an additional preventative method against cavities. Xylitol is a natural sugar alcohol that cannot be digested by most bacteria in the mouth. Consuming xylitol limits the growth of bacteria in the mouth, which reduces the amount of acid left behind by bacteria. Less bacteria&#x3D;less acid&#x3D;reduced chance of decay forming (cavities).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, It is important to note that in order to get the FULL anti-cavity benefit from xylitol, you have to use xylitol products correctly and consistently over a period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended dose for highest anti-cavity benefit: 6-10grams/day, administered 3-5 times.&lt;br /&gt;One Spry mint &#x3D; 0.5 grams xylitol&lt;br /&gt;One piece of Spry gum &#x3D; 0.72 grams xylitol&lt;br /&gt;One gram toothpaste &#x3D; approximately 0.25 grams xylitol (minimum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least 25% of the weight in Spry toothpaste is xylitol, (roughly a minimum of 36 grams xylitol in an entire tube (144g) of toothpaste. 36/144&#x3D;.25g xylitol per 1g toothpaste)&lt;br /&gt;**Most people do NOT use an entire gram of toothpaste when brushing, 0.25 grams is considered a \\&quot;pea sized\\&quot; amount of toothpaste. If I had to guess most people would average around 0.5-0.7 grams of toothpaste each time they brushed, since most people tend to use more toothpaste than recommended.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking the above numbers into consideration, it would be extremely hard to get to the 6-10grams recommended daily. Brushing twice a day with Spry toothpaste (0.50g), eating two Spry mints (1g), and chewing two pieces of Spry gum (1.44g) in one day doesn&#x27;t even make it to 3 grams of xylitol (roughly 2.94). That&#x27;s even calculating toothpaste at 1 gram per brushing, which is an excessive amount of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am telling you this to be aware that in order to have anti-cavity protection from this product, as seen in studies, it is recommended to have 6-10grams xylitol per day. Consuming less xylitol will provide some protection but in order to receive the FULL benefit to protect against cavities, you&#x27;d have to consume 6-10grams each day. Consuming higher than this level did not offer additional benefits in the studies done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this is a great product and will provide anti-cavity benefits depending on the amount you consume/if you consume consistently. In my opinion, additional preventative measures taken are better than nothing, so even if you do not consume the recommended 6-10grams each day, using this product will still be beneficial towards maintaining great oral health.

            <li> I loved this tooth paste.  The Dentist recommended a tooth paste with xylitol in the product.  I saw this product at whole foods but decided to look at Amazon.com and bought it and both my children loved it.  It wasn&#x27;t too sweet or minty.  It was perfect tasting.  My boy friend and I both like the product as well.  I would definitely recommend this product to another customer.  The price is good too on amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s a xylitol toothpaste, and xylitol is great for teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an effective xylitol toothpaste. But I was disappointed to find that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It contains glycerine, which (some day) coats the teeth with a film that prevents remineralization (though others dispute this).  (It&#x27;s probably not something to lose sleep over.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It also contains sorbitol. Sorbitol is just as bad as sucrose (table sugar); both feed the bacteria that cause tooth decay.  To be fair, there isn&#x27;t a lot of sorbitol in the toothpaste; but why not omit it entirely?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also contains fluoride, but I knew this when I bought it... I was looking for a natural paste that provided a little topical fluoride treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend it, but it would be a better product in my estimation without the sorbitol.</li>
            <li> Not a product that is available in most stores, with the exception of certain health food stores. Thank you for carrying this brand at a reasonable price, and getting it to me quickly.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist excellent</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist and I use this myself. Some mainstream brands are too harsh for me and the xylitol has been proven to benefit your teeth and oral tissues. I DO NOT believe any product should replace seeing your dentist (or doctor) for routine check ups as one review claimed.</li>
            <li> No sugars that damage teeth, and one that actually kills bacteria. What could be better. No overly strong chemical harse taste. A great change from regular toothpaste</li>
            <li> the best tooth paste ever</li>
            <li> This is a good toothpaste, now with fluoride, being recommended by my dentist and is unavailable locally.  I appreciate being able to purchase it, with no problems, online.</li>
            <li> I love using Spry tooth paste. My teeth are really great!! I don&#x27;t have to go to the dentist any more. It keeps them in great shape.</li>
            <li> For some reason peppermint toothpaste burns my mouth.  Xlear Spry is available in spearmint which works much better for me.  Love that it uses xylitol and you can choose to have fluoride or not.  Ships well.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and in the condition described by seller.  I whiten my teeth periodically so I was pleasantly surprised to find, after using this for a few weeks, that my teeth are whiter and brighter.  I won&#x27;t need to use a whitener any more.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this toothpaste at a store here in Chicago. They stopped carrying it, so my first instinct was to look on Amazon. It always leaves my breath smelling and feeling fresh for a long time. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste costs more than most brands, but unless you brush your teeth ten times a day, the price difference isn&#x27;t significant. I was told that the ingredient which it contains, Xylitol, kills bacteria very effectively. Like other toothpastes, it comes in a tube, tastes good, and you use it with a toothbrush. If I keep getting good results at my dental checkups, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> It is expensive compared to others but has an awesome taste and leaves your teeth feeling so clean! Worth it!</li>
            <li> Xylitol toothpaste was recommended by relative who said the gum was recommended by her dental hygienist. Said she hasn&#x27;t had a cavity in a couple of years! I have been using the toothpaste for at least 6 mons, because of chronic, painful inflammation after meals. Works great! Worked better than the antibiotic rinse from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t use the gum, because of TMJ, so I tried the toothpaste. Not cheap, but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My dental hygienist and dentist also agree is good for the teeth/gums.</li>
            <li> I have a super dry mouth due to Meds so I&#x27;m looking for as many ways as possible to moisturize my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing product that does better at providing moisturizing than Biotene in my opinion. It tastes great as well.</li>
            <li> I always buy this. It&#x27;s my favorite toothpaste. All xylitol, no other sweeteners!</li>
            <li> I have always used Spry and loved its product line, including their gum and pastilles, for their taste and to reduce cavities in my children and myself.  It seemed to be effective because whenever we used Xlear toothpaste, we seemed to get no cavities compared to the years we used regular Crest or Colgate fluoride toothpastes.  During those years, cavities abounded, and our diet has not changed appreciably since then.  If anything, I think we probably consume even more sugar today than we did years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Xylitol cannot be metabolized by plaque bacteria, contrary to sorbitol and other 6-carbon polyols, and may thus favour mineralization.\\&quot;  This is from the European Journal of Dentistry.  HOWEVER, this same source also indicates:  \\&quot;Studies with low daily doses of xylitol are known as a rule to fail to show any caries-preventive effects. To obtain beneficial xylitol-effects on mutans streptococci, on plaque and caries occurrence xylitol must be consumed three times or more per day, with a daily dose of 5-6 grams.\\&quot;  (Eur J Dent. Apr 2009; 3(2): 81-82.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does xylitol work to prevent caries?  It inhibits growth of the oral bacteria Streptococcus mutans.  (Incidentally, it also prevents periodontal disease and has been shown to be effective at reducing the risk of ear infections.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other studies I saw indicated an optimal dose for cavity prevention in the order of 4.3 to 10 grams per day.  So how much xylitol is in this toothpaste, and how much are you getting when you place a small amount on your toothbrush each day?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is difficult to quantify since everyone uses a different amount of toothpaste.  However, some smart people have already done the math for us at xylitolpreventscavities.com.

Therefore, the more xylitol in the product, the closer we get to the optimum dose.

Ah, but Xlear Spry has fluoride in it, 0.243%, according to the label.  This is why I removed a star from a potential five star rating.  Xlear makes a non-fluoride Spry toothpaste, and that one I would give five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the taste of this toothpaste.  It is very minty without being overwhelming.  It did take me three days to get used to its different minty taste, but afterwards, I liked it more and more than any commercial fluoride toothpaste I had ever used, including Tom&#x27;s.

            <li> don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as i thought it would be</li>
            <li> Very refreshing, good taste and effective cleaning</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was recommended by my children&#x27;s pediatric dentist.  I bought a tube in their office for $10, which is expensive, but was told that it&#x27;s like a miracle worker.  They said that they have seen major improvements in other patient check-ups; so I gave it a try.  This is great toothpaste.  My son and daughter have not had a bad check-up since we started using this product four years ago.  Every check-up has been perfect.  I can&#x27;t give you any scientific proof that it works, only what my experience has been with it and my kids&#x27; cavity-free check-ups are proof enough for me that this product works.</li>
            <li> This paste helps stop the bad breath and gum bleeding, it is little bit pricey but helps the situation and should provide bigger tubes too</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!Seller also shipped quickly!! Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Good flavor and clean teeth. I did think i was buying a non-fluoride paste, but that was my mistake.</li>
            <li> Disappointed about fluoride, since I go with the spry toothpaste to avoid fluoride. Not really sure why fluoride would be added with the xylitol</li>
            <li> I enjoy the taste and appears to work fine, but this will take time and checkup to see how it is working out.</li>
            <li> Xylitol is found to be good for dental health, and this toothpaste has that, as well as being much lower on the toxic ingredients than standard toothpaste.  The FDA doesn&#x27;t test for toxins or even have very good regulations on personal care items.  Spry and Earth Paste (which looks like dirt and has NO foam- but does get teeth clean) are about the best I&#x27;ve found.  Tom&#x27;s of Maine has been sold to Colgate, so cheap manufacturing is the bottom line there.  Sad.</li>
            <li> After using this brand for a month, my dentist said my gum was in a very healthy state. So I continue to use this brand instead go Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I wish more people new about the benefits of Xylitol that is in THIS toothpaste.  It is also in Spry gum and candies.  It actually combats tooth decay.  Not just helps.  It removes the bacteria that causes decay.  If you can&#x27;t get to brush your teeth during the day at least buy the gum or candy with Xylitol in it and chew it right after eating something with sugar in it (even your coffee).  It will protect your teeth till you get home to brush before bed. I was actually told about this product from my dentist!</li>
            <li> As a dentist, I have experimented with many different toothpaste brands.  In Spry, I have found the best toothpaste and one I will use from here on.  Several reasons for this decision:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It has Xylitol, which kills oral bacteria to the extent that the oral flora in the mouth changes into a more healthy flora&lt;br /&gt;2.  It has fluoride to help prevent cavities&lt;br /&gt;3.  It tastes great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from bad breath Spry can kill the bacteria that cause bad breath, rendering breath neutral in terms of odor.  If you tend to get more cavities than usual, Spry will kill the organisms that cause cavities, and protect teeth enamel with fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit more expensive than other brands, but when you want to experience the best, it is well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kone</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and just as described.  Thanks!</li>
