            <li>in all, I&#x27;m incredibly happy with this curling wand and see myself getting years of use out of it.  </li>
            <li>Works great for beachy curls.</li>
            <li>I can pop curls in before I go out for the night, use zero product, and STILL have a great look when I get home at 2AM.</li>
            <li>Plus, the differentiated sizing on the barrel makes for a great effect on my hair.</li>
            <li>Great for making tighter curls.</li>
            <li>I have been using a straightener for years to curl my hair, and it works great.</li>

            <li>I am thrilled with my wand!</li>
            <li>and she said it was easy and perfect to use!</li>
            <li>The curls come out really good</li>
            <li>When I tried it , I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I loved that it included the heat glove and a rubber tip.</li>
            <li>But I think this is a good product and would purchase again or recommend if needed.</li>
            <li>i used it and loved it</li>
            <li>this works....bought if for my daughter and the curls and gorgeous....</li>
            <li>and my hair still looks good.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good choice for the price.</li>
            <li>the gloves isnt all that good tho</li>
            <li>easy to use and curls hold for days!!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li>But when a friend uses it, my daughter&#x27;s hair looks great and the curl holds for 2 days instead of 10 minutes like most curling irons and rollers I have used in her hair.</li>
            <li>but since it had so many great reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Curls come out perfect and it was well worth the $24 I paid for it.</li>
            <li>It works great on my hair and I haven&#x27;t found many irons that would work so well.  </li>
            <li>I love this curling iron!</li>

            <li>An instructional video or booklet for correct procedure for how to use it would be nice.  </li>
            <li>Purchase your own glove separately.</li>
            <li>and if I kept them, they would be nice waves another day after.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>This heats up nicely and evenly.  </li>
            <li>honestly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did, works just good as a 100.00 dollar iron or the one my hairdresser uses.</li>
            <li>nice product..</li>
            <li>The orange iron is also good, but this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t even have to use any kind of styling products.</li>
            <li>Makes nice curls.</li>
            <li>It curls hair perfectly and the glove thay comes with is really helpful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the glove, but it would come in handy for others who are beginners to using a curling Wand.</li>

            <li>Heats fast and brilliant design.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely and awesomely..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it works quickly!!!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Works great and heats up very fast.</li>
            <li>But for the first styler I&#x27;ve owned that doesn&#x27;t clamp, it is great.  </li>
            <li>At first i was really happy with the way the iron curled.</li>
            <li>Great deal and works very well!  </li>
            <li>It works great and heats up fast!</li>

            <li>I love this curling wand.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wand and would give it more than 5 stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Even the next day my hair has a great beach wave still!</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I use it every day and have just stocked up on bandaids!  :)</li>
            <li>Love this wand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the products I use or lack there of...</li>
            <li>I love this wand.</li>
            <li>I love this wand curler.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I have never been able to get my hair to hold a curl or wave until now.</li>
            <li>There is no temperature gauge, but that&#x27;s okay for me.</li>
            <li>and I like this one more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with it, but</li>
            <li>this is my favorite curling iron ever.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>The glove was tricky to work with, but believe me, its better than a burn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to have curly hair-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The surface is nice and smooth, unlike some that make your hair stick to it and do not release.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I did purchase better gloves since so many spoke of burns.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely in love with this curling wand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to many curling irons to no avail.  </li>
            <li>My curls are nice and bouncy and most importantly</li>
            <li>i love how it curls my hair, but looks more like beach waves than curly sue.&lt;br /&gt;perfect</li>
            <li>It does not get any better than this.  </li>
            <li>It also gives the top of my hair a lot of volume if I decided to wrap my hair closer to the roots.  </li>
            <li>, I think you just get more volume with your hair since the curls start closer to the scalp with this design.  </li>
            <li>LOVE.  </li>
            <li>Love this styling wand...</li>
            <li>it creates tighter curls up top, and looser ones at the bottom.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>LOVE this wand.  </li>
            <li>I totally love it.</li>
            <li>But do make sure not to burn yourself,you have to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I really love it.  </li>
            <li>When I do have time to curl my hair, I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve burnt my arms and hands more times than I can count.</li>
            <li>outstanding results.</li>
            <li>I have burned my wrist many times.</li>
            <li>The glove it comes with is ok but causes static.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product though.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love a bargain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the most noticeable downside</li>
            <li>(I hope) you&#x27;ll be as pleased with it as I am!le.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite go to products.  </li>
            <li>my hair is healthy but it gets a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who is interested in beautiful, wild, sexy hair!!</li>
            <li>I have really long hair, and it looks absolutely beautiful when I wand my hair!!</li>
            <li>I use it all the time and my hair being so long curls great with it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to buy a different glove because it just wasn&#x27;t as great, but the product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to use it still, for some reason some curls come out better than the others, but that&#x27;s error within myself All around; great wand for a great price.</li>
            <li>and I have perfect loose beachy waves just like I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>This thing is simple, effective and an amazing value!</li>
            <li>Just Fantastic :)</li>
            <li>This made me feel  much more comfortable using it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is always sliding to the end of the regular conical sticks, but this is brilliant.  </li>
            <li>I may get better at using this, but I burned myself like five times and the curls weren&#x27;t smooth when I was done.</li>
            <li>Good for stubborn straight hair like mine</li>
            <li>That being said this product was very easy to use and gave my hair a beautiful shaped curl which I have never been able to get with any other curling device.</li>
            <li>I like this iron but prefer the one that tapers at other end best.</li>
            <li>Love it, the curler makes the most adorable curls ever and holds pretty well.</li>
            <li>Loved it I absolutely love the curls they honestly do stay for a long time I did my hair at 12pm it now 11:30</li>
            <li>I own many flat irons, curling irons, rollers and wands and this is by far the best product for creating curls I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use too.</li>
            <li>I ordered this wand on the 1st and it came very quickly from brooklyn</li>
            <li>The design makes it easy to hold hair on the barrel.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I experienced a burn on my face, nothing major but should not be used if you are not concentrating on what you are doing.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot very quickly and makes perfect waves that last all day.</li>
            <li>My hair just won&#x27;t hold a curl because it&#x27;s baby fine</li>
            <li>it gets VERY hot so wear the glove!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I tried this one first!</li>
            <li>Beware of the end...gets very hot, even with the rubber cap on it!</li>
            <li>It gets very hot!</li>
            <li>if u want tiny curls this is great for u</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the look it gives my hair.</li>
            <li>The glove is soooo comfortable</li>
            <li>My husband actually thought I went and had my hair done when he came in from work lol.</li>
            <li>All I did was add a bit more serum to calm the frizz</li>
            <li>but overall im happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>I love the fun angle of the curls and texture it gives.</li>
            <li>but it makes pretty curls and is easy to use!</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use, heats up fast, and really gives you amazing curls!</li>
            <li>It gets super hot and the curls are amazing.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>This gets nice and hot and makes good, lasting curls.</li>
            <li>I love the curl that I get from the shape of the wand, and the curls are even more gorgeous when I pin the curls then let them down.</li>
            <li>This wand is perfectly efficient and easy to use on my curly hair to add extra definition and professional style curl.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use, even if you&#x27;ve never used a wand before.</li>
            <li>a quick, easy solution.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>The curler did not come in the original packaging and was not functional.</li>
            <li>when I found it here I was excited.</li>
            <li>But use the glove, it&#x27;s really easy to burn yourself on the barrel since it gets so hot!</li>
            <li>Great for long hair!</li>
            <li>Love it, it gets super hot</li>
            <li>really makes cute curls.</li>
            <li>I love how it curls and the curls really stay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking one star off because there is no stand or cool tip</li>
            <li>Got is a few days after i ordered it , i love it leaves  really nice curls :)</li>
            <li>This is a nice curling iron that is high quality and priced right.  </li>
            <li>This makes curls just the right shape and it&#x27;s very hot and the curls stay!</li>
            <li>, that is very long and this wand works beautifully on it, and super fast!</li>
            <li>Luckily this product does come with a heat glove and a cool end tip.</li>
            <li>but I was careful to not burn myself, the glove came in very handy to keep that from happening and the heat gard tip.</li>
            <li>Drop dead gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Having tried so many other wands, I realized a while ago that a simple pair of knit gloves (the kind you can get at any superstore for about a buck a pair) does just as good a job of protecting my hands.  </li>
            <li>Having tried so many other wands, I realized a while ago that a simple pair of knit gloves (the kind you can get at any superstore for about a buck a pair) does just as good a job of protecting my hands.  </li>
            <li>These curls don&#x27;t need hair spray either, they stay in all day (even overnight if you&#x27;re lucky).</li>
            <li>It worked on 3 completely different types of hair in the same awesome way.</li>
            <li>and it came quick.</li>
            <li>it came in really quickly and was protected in the box</li>
            <li>I learned quickly.</li>
            <li>This wand gets super hot super quick, so always use the glove with it!</li>
            <li>Curls came out so nice and smooth and tight, I just love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied with this and highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is very hot.  </li>
            <li>This wand gets VERY hot.</li>
            <li>This is my first curl wand, so I have no base for comparison.</li>
            <li>it also gets very hot you will get burned</li>
            <li>This wand does get very HOT</li>
            <li>Since I only do this with the very top layer of curls, it&#x27;s proven</li>
            <li>Also, very, very hot</li>
            <li>and everyone at work loved it and said that it probably took long to get it done, nope</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is a fabulous product I don&#x27;t understand how it works so much better than other irons :)</li>
            <li>I have fine, slightly wavy hair of medium thickness that is in good health.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot SO fast, so make sure and wear the gloves.  </li>
            <li>These get hot!  </li>
            <li>This iron is HOT!  </li>
            <li>It does get extremely hot!</li>
            <li>gets your fingertips hot!</li>
            <li>It takes a little longer to heat than advertised but otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, curly hair, this curling Wand does the curls perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This iron does create  VERY NICE curls or waves semi-loose or tight.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t do my own hair with it very well, but it has made amazing curls that last all day in my both of my young daughters hair.</li>
            <li>Gives me fun</li>
            <li>It seems as nice as curlers similar to it that I saw at a competitor&#x27;s store.</li>
            <li>Overall i would recommend this to someone, but let them know the kind of curls or waves that they will get with this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried soooo many curling irons and wands, and this is bar far</li>
            <li>my favorite thus far.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite styling tool of the moment.</li>
            <li>I want to start by saying that I might possibly have every styling tool of every kind.</li>
            <li>Gets very hot very fast.</li>
            <li>It heats up super hot (watch your fingers)</li>
            <li>Gets super hot</li>
            <li>I have used many other curling wands, but the shape of this one makes for a very unique curl.</li>
            <li>I tend to curl the night before to let the curls relax overnight since I tend to look like Shirley Temple right after I finish.  </li>
            <li>maybe I am not using it right.</li>
            <li>but I went out on a womb and used it right before a party</li>
            <li>so it burned right through my &amp;#34;heat resistant&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying my hair is very long, very straight and very healthy.</li>
            <li>It gets hot super fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different brands as well as different shapes, and so far, this Bed Head reverse-conical wand is the best one I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>This wand was very easy to use, my curls came out quite uniform and lasted all night and the next day with no hairspray which is amazing for my hair, usually curls with tons of hairspray only last an hour or so, so I am impressed.</li>
            <li>Hours later its A nice wave but still really curly.</li>
            <li>This is a great curler in that it makes solid curls that will last all day without a touch up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, fast, and effective.</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast and geta really hot.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have any kind of stand or guard to keep it from touching the counter directly when it&#x27;s put down.</li>
            <li>With this wand, that hassle is solved (I also love that it makes my curls looser at the end, which as they relax throughout the day gives them a much more realistic &amp;#34;beachy wave&amp;#34; that so many users of curling wands are seeking--those conical wands tend to create Shirley Temple curls that never really relax enough to look</li>
            <li>shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>Heats up pretty fast and gets really hot!  </li>
            <li>and it gets realllyyy hot</li>
            <li>This is my first curling wand</li>
            <li>In the morning, I run my fingers through my hair and am ready to go!  </li>
            <li>The wand gets really hot</li>
            <li>This is the first curling wand I have bought</li>
            <li>I cannot get the hang of this wand and obviously need way more practice.  </li>
            <li>The wand doesn&#x27;t seem to get overly hot at all.</li>
            <li>Gets really hot and my hair will stay curly/wavy for two days without hairspray.</li>
            <li>I love this curler for my short hair.</li>
            <li>it came in very well!</li>
            <li>You get exactly that</li>
            <li>So it begins that you have this hot curling iron on the vanity .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li>The glove should come up higher on the wrist to prevent burns.</li>
            <li>Would HIGHLY recommend this tool!!</li>
            <li>it leaves your hair really pretty.  </li>
            <li>Gives great long lasting curls!</li>
            <li>It seems to get really hot, but doesn&#x27;t have temperature controls (just and on/off toggle).  </li>
            <li>I did burn my hand the first time</li>
            <li>and she said it works really well and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li>the curls last all day!  :)</li>
            <li>this item is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so pretty and so evenly curled.</li>
            <li>At first I used the protective glove, that is included, but after a while I mastered even without the glove and never got burnt,</li>
            <li>This is my first Curling Wand</li>
            <li>My sister first introduced me to this</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a curling wand and to me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s as close to perfect as a wand has come for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The iron is still hot</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite hair accessory, by far.</li>
            <li>the only thing I was not crazy about it the glove, it makes my hair staticky  Other than that its great and</li>
            <li>It gives such gorgeous volume and the curls last all day.</li>
            <li>The curls come out better then on a regular wand &amp; heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>Great product for price wish it got a little hotter just a little more time consuming I guess as a hairstylist</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be able to make the big loose curls once my hair is longer, and hopefully some more length will make it easier to use.</li>
            <li>I really like the blue one, curls are tighter at the top, but don&#x27;t really look tighter</li>
            <li>More realistic curls than some of the smaller wands.</li>
            <li>my hair is very long, so a wider wand would probably be better for me.</li>
            <li>I can easily make it two three days on the same curls.</li>
            <li>You might have to play around with how long is good enough to leave it on for your hair type.  </li>
            <li>I normally wear my hair curly, so I wanted to use this to create a more defined curl pattern in certain spots rather than curling my entire head.  </li>
            <li>Especially for less than $20 this is a great purchase.</li>
            <li>Defined waves can be nice for certain occasions, but i was searching for an everyday look.</li>
            <li>and it takes me 10-15 minutes to curl my whole head.  </li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves this.</li>
            <li>Not for the inexperienced or even the just able.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this wand!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much easier.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the waves i wanted i would recommend an iron that has a straight barrel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my fault anyway for not reading much into the information</li>
            <li>but it does curl my hair really fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a control setting for heat, but I don&#x27;t think that takes away from it much.</li>
            <li>I was very unsure about this iron wand because of the price, I thought there was no way this would give me the curl I wanted</li>
            <li>Shipping and delivery is fast as well.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really curl hair</li>
            <li>BUT you can really burn yourself if you don&#x27;t becareful.  </li>
            <li>I have burned myself three times with the very tip of the wand on my inside forearms..</li>
            <li>I really like it--</li>
            <li>i dint think I would like it so much</li>
            <li>so I wash it and wear it straight</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really need it</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no temp settings, and would burn hair if used too much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like this product, but that may be b/c</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>I have straight, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier than using a curling iron.</li>
            <li>To me it&#x27;s much easier.</li>
            <li>It heats up very well.  </li>
            <li>By the third day I usually brush the curls out for beautiful waves.</li>
            <li>they are very messy but very cute</li>
            <li>this product also gets so hot that it left my hair super damaged after one use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly easy and it held for so long.</li>
            <li>The only con is it does not have the auto turn off, but for the price it was worth it!</li>
            <li>HOT, seriously hot, but the curls are like NO other.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used two other types of curling irons and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;m actually glad about this, as I used to snag my hair on those rests while wrapping it around my other wands.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;m actually glad about this, as I used to snag my hair on those rests while wrapping it around my other wands.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and the curls stay in for a long time without hairspray!</li>
            <li>It provides very full, voluminous curls and when brushed out becomes soft waves.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic and makes your hair have these bouncy curls and even without hairspray will stay in for a long time.definetely</li>
            <li>i typically just straighten it every day, but since i got this i love to curl my hair</li>
            <li>Let me preface this post by saying that I have long, naturally stick straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Just okay, not very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Curls look thick and bouncy and last ALL day, sometimes my hair even looks better day two!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it had different heat settings because this baby gets HOT!</li>
            <li>Yes, there is only one heat setting (extremely hot!).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing at such a low price and it is definitely a must buy !</li>
            <li>I have been using the Remmington light pink wand for 2 years.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how it is different, but it makes lovely natural looking curls that last all day with no hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Overall this product works and is worth the money.</li>
            <li>You can also achieve a more formal look by taking larger (about 3&amp;#34;) pieces, wrap them around the wand, hold for about 8 seconds, let them fall, and when you&#x27;ve done your whole head, brush them out with a round , smoothing brush.</li>
            <li>I would have much rather spent the extra 5 bucks for an authentic product.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t like the glove, but I rarely burn my fingers without it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use hairspray  to hold the style like I normally would.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that after curling my whole head, I tend to end up with some kinky curls that won&#x27;t lie flat and thus make my head&#x27;s shape look funny.  </li>
            <li>Problem with this method is that you can easily tell where the curl starts because suddenly you go from straight hair to a pretty tight curl.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little time to get a handle of it without burning yourself, but I picked it up pretty quickly by watching a YouTube video.  </li>
            <li>It was not authentic and when I contacted the company they were very unprofessional and refused to give me a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;Simply said: DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!</li>
            <li>It lifts your roots to make you look like you have more volume, and makes for bigger curls towards the bottom to keep the &amp;#34;volumeous&amp;#34; look the whole way down!</li>
            <li>and you can get tons of different sized curls all depending how much hair you wrap around!</li>
            <li>I take different sections of hair (a combination of pieces ranging from 1&amp;#34; to 4&amp;#34;), twist them, and then wrap them around the wand curling away from my face.</li>
            <li>The small size at the one end, however, made tighter, more poodle-like curls.  </li>
            <li>This is actually my second wand (the first being a Revlon wand with a clip).</li>
            <li>and it only took 30 mins (the first time).</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because it gets really hot</li>
            <li>By far this one KILLS the others SMASHED and STOMPED ONTO THE GROUND!  </li>
            <li>but once you get the motions down it&#x27;s smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>I used the &amp;#34;tension method&amp;#34; to blow dry my hair, and attempted to bevel my hair--without success...</li>
            <li>It works but you have to be careful because of how hot it gets plus the glove doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night on my freshly washed, air dried hair with only anti frizz serum in it just to see how it worked, let the curls cool, then went to bed.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was worried that this wand&#x27;s single heat setting wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough to give me lasting curls, but having tried other wands that got as hot as 410 degrees F, I can honestly say that this wand gets at least that hot, if not hotter.  </li>
            <li>The glove is a cheap little glove they put in there for show.</li>
            <li>This wand is super easy to use and it takes only a few minutes for me to do my long hair!</li>
            <li>I like that it is wide on the end, as most wands are wide at the handle and skinny at the end.  </li>
            <li>I have no trouble using it, much easier than regular curling iron.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the gloves that came with it might be itchy for people that has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Wear your glove for sure, I use it at least 3 times a week</li>
            <li>I bought this as an Xmas gift for my 12 year old.</li>
            <li>My nine year old daughter loves when I curl her hair with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big into hair styling, but really wanted to try out a curling wand.  </li>
            <li>I have bought two so far.</li>
            <li>She says it gives her soft, beachy waves.  </li>
            <li>Not the shape we were after, but it actually works very well.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist recommended this type of curling iron to accentuate the texture of my natural curls.  </li>
            <li>if you have some natural wave, you don&#x27;t have to curl every piece of your hair.  </li>
            <li>Heats up SO fast and curls last all day.</li>
            <li>Bought to curl my 3 yr old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>i have had no issues with the product thus far.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, curls last for days.</li>
            <li>I am a 47yr old Mother and baby</li>
            <li>but with the curling wand by the third use I really started getting it.</li>
            <li>If you like wild, sexy, messy, bombshell curls, this curling wand is definitely for you!</li>
            <li>I recently bought another Bed Head curling iron 1\\&quot; with a clip and its not as great as this one! :(</li>
            <li>overall I would say get it, it has become my main curler since I have been using it</li>
            <li>While I wish the glove that came with it was a little thicker and covered up a little more of my arm, the wand itself is PHENOMINAL!</li>
            <li>It is not too easy to use compare to the typical curling iron / flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair that is long.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;just be careful it can get really hot</li>
            <li>Had some trouble getting used to not having a cool tip.  </li>
            <li>overall, this product is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>: This wand beats out all the others I&#x27;ve tried for a few simple but important reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>Honestly the first time I used this wand I was done in less than 10 minutes, and I have fairly long thick hair.</li>
            <li>Gives you those loose spirals with the straight ends...</li>
            <li>Be very careful when you use this because it gets SO HOT</li>
            <li>It gets very hot so be careful and use the glove but the pay off is the curls last the entire day.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m old fashion, but I would stick to the traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li>For reference, I&#x27;m Caucasian with incredibly thick, coarse hair that has lots of body but no real wave or curl of its own.  </li>
            <li>and i dont have to section off in super small pieces</li>
            <li>The method I&#x27;ve settled on (and it might seem silly, but it isn&#x27;t as much of a hassle as it may sound like)</li>
            <li>I am African American, and wear my hair natural.</li>
            <li>I use CHI&#x27;s iron guard on my hair before curling and my curls will last the whole day without any other products needed.</li>
            <li>curls come out messy, very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li>The only thing is I wish the glove was a little longer because I burned myself the first time I used it and the scar has not gone away after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I was curious to try another type of curling wand and found the new Curlipops on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The curls are odd looking but the curls hold the whole day.</li>
            <li>Takes a little practice and wear the glove - you&#x27;ll get used to it and the burns you&#x27;ll get without it really hurt.</li>

            <li> Works great for beachy curls.</li>
            <li> I can pop curls in before I go out for the night, use zero product, and STILL have a great look when I get home at 2AM.</li>
            <li> Plus, the differentiated sizing on the barrel makes for a great effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> Great for making tighter curls.</li>
            <li> I have been using a straightener for years to curl my hair, and it works great.</li>

            <li> I am thrilled with my wand!</li>
            <li> and she said it was easy and perfect to use!</li>
            <li> The curls come out really good</li>
            <li> When I tried it , I loved it.  </li>
            <li> I loved that it included the heat glove and a rubber tip.</li>
            <li> But I think this is a good product and would purchase again or recommend if needed.</li>
            <li> i used it and loved it</li>
            <li> this works....bought if for my daughter and the curls and gorgeous....</li>
            <li> and my hair still looks good.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good choice for the price.</li>
            <li> the gloves isnt all that good tho</li>
            <li> easy to use and curls hold for days!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li> But when a friend uses it, my daughter&#x27;s hair looks great and the curl holds for 2 days instead of 10 minutes like most curling irons and rollers I have used in her hair.</li>
            <li> but since it had so many great reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Curls come out perfect and it was well worth the $24 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> It works great on my hair and I haven&#x27;t found many irons that would work so well.  </li>
            <li> I love this curling iron!</li>

            <li> This wand is amazing.</li>
            <li> An instructional video or booklet for correct procedure for how to use it would be nice.  </li>
            <li> Purchase your own glove separately.</li>
            <li> and if I kept them, they would be nice waves another day after.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> This heats up nicely and evenly.  </li>
            <li> honestly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did, works just good as a 100.00 dollar iron or the one my hairdresser uses.</li>
            <li> nice product..</li>
            <li> The orange iron is also good, but this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t even have to use any kind of styling products.</li>
            <li> Makes nice curls.</li>
            <li> It curls hair perfectly and the glove thay comes with is really helpful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the glove, but it would come in handy for others who are beginners to using a curling Wand.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, makes my hair look awesome.  </li>
            <li> I love love love this wand!!</li>

            <li> At first I had a hesitation about ordering this however, once I got I loved it!</li>
            <li> Does a good job curling my fine hair.</li>
            <li> It makes nice mermaid curls,/waves, tighter at the top and looser at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Heats fast and brilliant design.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely and awesomely..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it works quickly!!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Works great and heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> But for the first styler I&#x27;ve owned that doesn&#x27;t clamp, it is great.  </li>
            <li> At first i was really happy with the way the iron curled.</li>
            <li> Great deal and works very well!  </li>
            <li> It works great and heats up fast!</li>
            <li> It created very light and bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very comfortable in my arms.</li>
            <li> The glove it came with was very cheap</li>
            <li> I LOVED this item gives the exact curls I want would defiantly recommend!</li>
            <li> u love to travel with style</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wand and would give it more than 5 stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Even the next day my hair has a great beach wave still!</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I use it every day and have just stocked up on bandaids!  :)</li>
            <li> Love this wand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the products I use or lack there of...</li>
            <li> I love this wand.</li>
            <li> I love this wand curler.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get my hair to hold a curl or wave until now.</li>
            <li> There is no temperature gauge, but that&#x27;s okay for me.</li>
            <li> and I like this one more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it, but</li>
            <li> this is my favorite curling iron ever.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> The glove was tricky to work with, but believe me, its better than a burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to have curly hair-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The surface is nice and smooth, unlike some that make your hair stick to it and do not release.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I did purchase better gloves since so many spoke of burns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely in love with this curling wand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to many curling irons to no avail.  </li>
            <li> My curls are nice and bouncy and most importantly</li>
            <li> i love how it curls my hair, but looks more like beach waves than curly sue.&lt;br /&gt;perfect</li>
            <li> It does not get any better than this.  </li>
            <li> It also gives the top of my hair a lot of volume if I decided to wrap my hair closer to the roots.  </li>
            <li> , I think you just get more volume with your hair since the curls start closer to the scalp with this design.  </li>
            <li> LOVE.  </li>
            <li> Love this styling wand...</li>
            <li> it creates tighter curls up top, and looser ones at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> LOVE this wand.  </li>
            <li> I totally love it.</li>
            <li> But do make sure not to burn yourself,you have to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I really love it.  </li>
            <li> When I do have time to curl my hair, I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve burnt my arms and hands more times than I can count.</li>
            <li> outstanding results.</li>
            <li> I have burned my wrist many times.</li>
            <li> The glove it comes with is ok but causes static.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product though.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a bargain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the most noticeable downside</li>
            <li> (I hope) you&#x27;ll be as pleased with it as I am!le.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite go to products.  </li>
            <li> my hair is healthy but it gets a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who is interested in beautiful, wild, sexy hair!!</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, and it looks absolutely beautiful when I wand my hair!!</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and my hair being so long curls great with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to buy a different glove because it just wasn&#x27;t as great, but the product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to use it still, for some reason some curls come out better than the others, but that&#x27;s error within myself All around; great wand for a great price.</li>
            <li> and I have perfect loose beachy waves just like I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> This thing is simple, effective and an amazing value!</li>
            <li> Just Fantastic :)</li>
            <li> This made me feel  much more comfortable using it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is always sliding to the end of the regular conical sticks, but this is brilliant.  </li>
            <li> I may get better at using this, but I burned myself like five times and the curls weren&#x27;t smooth when I was done.</li>
            <li> Good for stubborn straight hair like mine</li>
            <li> That being said this product was very easy to use and gave my hair a beautiful shaped curl which I have never been able to get with any other curling device.</li>
            <li> I like this iron but prefer the one that tapers at other end best.</li>
            <li> Love it, the curler makes the most adorable curls ever and holds pretty well.</li>
            <li> Loved it I absolutely love the curls they honestly do stay for a long time I did my hair at 12pm it now 11:30</li>
            <li> I own many flat irons, curling irons, rollers and wands and this is by far the best product for creating curls I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wand on the 1st and it came very quickly from brooklyn</li>
            <li> The design makes it easy to hold hair on the barrel.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased for such a great price.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I experienced a burn on my face, nothing major but should not be used if you are not concentrating on what you are doing.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot very quickly and makes perfect waves that last all day.</li>
            <li> My hair just won&#x27;t hold a curl because it&#x27;s baby fine</li>
            <li> it gets VERY hot so wear the glove!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I tried this one first!</li>
            <li> Beware of the end...gets very hot, even with the rubber cap on it!</li>
            <li> It gets very hot!</li>
            <li> if u want tiny curls this is great for u</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the look it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> The glove is soooo comfortable</li>
            <li> My husband actually thought I went and had my hair done when he came in from work lol.</li>
            <li> All I did was add a bit more serum to calm the frizz</li>
            <li> but overall im happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I love the fun angle of the curls and texture it gives.</li>
            <li> but it makes pretty curls and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use, heats up fast, and really gives you amazing curls!</li>
            <li> It gets super hot and the curls are amazing.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> This gets nice and hot and makes good, lasting curls.</li>
            <li> I love the curl that I get from the shape of the wand, and the curls are even more gorgeous when I pin the curls then let them down.</li>
            <li> This wand is perfectly efficient and easy to use on my curly hair to add extra definition and professional style curl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use, even if you&#x27;ve never used a wand before.</li>
            <li> a quick, easy solution.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!</li>
            <li> The curler did not come in the original packaging and was not functional.</li>
            <li> when I found it here I was excited.</li>
            <li> But use the glove, it&#x27;s really easy to burn yourself on the barrel since it gets so hot!</li>
            <li> Great for long hair!</li>
            <li> Love it, it gets super hot</li>
            <li> really makes cute curls.</li>
            <li> I love how it curls and the curls really stay.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking one star off because there is no stand or cool tip</li>
            <li> Got is a few days after i ordered it , i love it leaves  really nice curls :)</li>
            <li> This is a nice curling iron that is high quality and priced right.  </li>
            <li> This makes curls just the right shape and it&#x27;s very hot and the curls stay!</li>
            <li> , that is very long and this wand works beautifully on it, and super fast!</li>
            <li> Luckily this product does come with a heat glove and a cool end tip.</li>
            <li> but I was careful to not burn myself, the glove came in very handy to keep that from happening and the heat gard tip.</li>
            <li> Drop dead gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Having tried so many other wands, I realized a while ago that a simple pair of knit gloves (the kind you can get at any superstore for about a buck a pair) does just as good a job of protecting my hands.  </li>
            <li> Having tried so many other wands, I realized a while ago that a simple pair of knit gloves (the kind you can get at any superstore for about a buck a pair) does just as good a job of protecting my hands.  </li>
            <li> These curls don&#x27;t need hair spray either, they stay in all day (even overnight if you&#x27;re lucky).</li>
            <li> It worked on 3 completely different types of hair in the same awesome way.</li>
            <li> and it came quick.</li>
            <li> it came in really quickly and was protected in the box</li>
            <li> I learned quickly.</li>
            <li> This wand gets super hot super quick, so always use the glove with it!</li>
            <li> Curls came out so nice and smooth and tight, I just love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied with this and highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and is very hot.  </li>
            <li> This wand gets VERY hot.</li>
            <li> This is my first curl wand, so I have no base for comparison.</li>
            <li> it also gets very hot you will get burned</li>
            <li> This wand does get very HOT</li>
            <li> Since I only do this with the very top layer of curls, it&#x27;s proven</li>
            <li> Also, very, very hot</li>
            <li> and everyone at work loved it and said that it probably took long to get it done, nope</li>
            <li> Otherwise it is a fabulous product I don&#x27;t understand how it works so much better than other irons :)</li>
            <li> I have fine, slightly wavy hair of medium thickness that is in good health.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot SO fast, so make sure and wear the gloves.  </li>
            <li> These get hot!  </li>
            <li> This iron is HOT!  </li>
            <li> It does get extremely hot!</li>
            <li> gets your fingertips hot!</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to heat than advertised but otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair, this curling Wand does the curls perfectly.  </li>
            <li> This iron does create  VERY NICE curls or waves semi-loose or tight.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do my own hair with it very well, but it has made amazing curls that last all day in my both of my young daughters hair.</li>
            <li> Gives me fun</li>
            <li> It seems as nice as curlers similar to it that I saw at a competitor&#x27;s store.</li>
            <li> Overall i would recommend this to someone, but let them know the kind of curls or waves that they will get with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried soooo many curling irons and wands, and this is bar far</li>
            <li> my favorite thus far.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite styling tool of the moment.</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that I might possibly have every styling tool of every kind.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot very fast.</li>
            <li> It heats up super hot (watch your fingers)</li>
            <li> Gets super hot</li>
            <li> I have used many other curling wands, but the shape of this one makes for a very unique curl.</li>
            <li> I tend to curl the night before to let the curls relax overnight since I tend to look like Shirley Temple right after I finish.  </li>
            <li> maybe I am not using it right.</li>
            <li> but I went out on a womb and used it right before a party</li>
            <li> so it burned right through my &amp;#34;heat resistant&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying my hair is very long, very straight and very healthy.</li>
            <li> It gets hot super fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brands as well as different shapes, and so far, this Bed Head reverse-conical wand is the best one I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> This wand was very easy to use, my curls came out quite uniform and lasted all night and the next day with no hairspray which is amazing for my hair, usually curls with tons of hairspray only last an hour or so, so I am impressed.</li>
            <li> Hours later its A nice wave but still really curly.</li>
            <li> This is a great curler in that it makes solid curls that will last all day without a touch up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, fast, and effective.</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast and geta really hot.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have any kind of stand or guard to keep it from touching the counter directly when it&#x27;s put down.</li>
            <li> With this wand, that hassle is solved (I also love that it makes my curls looser at the end, which as they relax throughout the day gives them a much more realistic &amp;#34;beachy wave&amp;#34; that so many users of curling wands are seeking--those conical wands tend to create Shirley Temple curls that never really relax enough to look</li>
            <li> shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> Heats up pretty fast and gets really hot!  </li>
            <li> and it gets realllyyy hot</li>
            <li> This is my first curling wand</li>
            <li> In the morning, I run my fingers through my hair and am ready to go!  </li>
            <li> The wand gets really hot</li>
            <li> This is the first curling wand I have bought</li>
            <li> I cannot get the hang of this wand and obviously need way more practice.  </li>
            <li> The wand doesn&#x27;t seem to get overly hot at all.</li>
            <li> Gets really hot and my hair will stay curly/wavy for two days without hairspray.</li>
            <li> I love this curler for my short hair.</li>
            <li> it came in very well!</li>
            <li> You get exactly that</li>
            <li> So it begins that you have this hot curling iron on the vanity .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li> The glove should come up higher on the wrist to prevent burns.</li>
            <li> Would HIGHLY recommend this tool!!</li>
            <li> it leaves your hair really pretty.  </li>
            <li> Gives great long lasting curls!</li>
            <li> It seems to get really hot, but doesn&#x27;t have temperature controls (just and on/off toggle).  </li>
            <li> I did burn my hand the first time</li>
            <li> and she said it works really well and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> the curls last all day!  :)</li>
            <li> this item is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so pretty and so evenly curled.</li>
            <li> At first I used the protective glove, that is included, but after a while I mastered even without the glove and never got burnt,</li>
            <li> This is my first Curling Wand</li>
            <li> My sister first introduced me to this</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a curling wand and to me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s as close to perfect as a wand has come for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The iron is still hot</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite hair accessory, by far.</li>
            <li> the only thing I was not crazy about it the glove, it makes my hair staticky  Other than that its great and</li>
            <li> It gives such gorgeous volume and the curls last all day.</li>
            <li> The curls come out better then on a regular wand &amp; heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> Great product for price wish it got a little hotter just a little more time consuming I guess as a hairstylist</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be able to make the big loose curls once my hair is longer, and hopefully some more length will make it easier to use.</li>
            <li> I really like the blue one, curls are tighter at the top, but don&#x27;t really look tighter</li>
            <li> More realistic curls than some of the smaller wands.</li>
            <li> my hair is very long, so a wider wand would probably be better for me.</li>
            <li> I can easily make it two three days on the same curls.</li>
            <li> You might have to play around with how long is good enough to leave it on for your hair type.  </li>
            <li> I normally wear my hair curly, so I wanted to use this to create a more defined curl pattern in certain spots rather than curling my entire head.  </li>
            <li> Especially for less than $20 this is a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Defined waves can be nice for certain occasions, but i was searching for an everyday look.</li>
            <li> and it takes me 10-15 minutes to curl my whole head.  </li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this.</li>
            <li> Not for the inexperienced or even the just able.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this wand!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much easier.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the waves i wanted i would recommend an iron that has a straight barrel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my fault anyway for not reading much into the information</li>
            <li> but it does curl my hair really fast.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a control setting for heat, but I don&#x27;t think that takes away from it much.</li>
            <li> I was very unsure about this iron wand because of the price, I thought there was no way this would give me the curl I wanted</li>
            <li> Shipping and delivery is fast as well.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really curl hair</li>
            <li> BUT you can really burn yourself if you don&#x27;t becareful.  </li>
            <li> I have burned myself three times with the very tip of the wand on my inside forearms..</li>
            <li> I really like it--</li>
            <li> i dint think I would like it so much</li>
            <li> so I wash it and wear it straight</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really need it</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no temp settings, and would burn hair if used too much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this product, but that may be b/c</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> I have straight, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier than using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> To me it&#x27;s much easier.</li>
            <li> It heats up very well.  </li>
            <li> By the third day I usually brush the curls out for beautiful waves.</li>
            <li> they are very messy but very cute</li>
            <li> this product also gets so hot that it left my hair super damaged after one use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly easy and it held for so long.</li>
            <li> The only con is it does not have the auto turn off, but for the price it was worth it!</li>
            <li> HOT, seriously hot, but the curls are like NO other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two other types of curling irons and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;m actually glad about this, as I used to snag my hair on those rests while wrapping it around my other wands.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;m actually glad about this, as I used to snag my hair on those rests while wrapping it around my other wands.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and the curls stay in for a long time without hairspray!</li>
            <li> It provides very full, voluminous curls and when brushed out becomes soft waves.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic and makes your hair have these bouncy curls and even without hairspray will stay in for a long time.definetely</li>
            <li> i typically just straighten it every day, but since i got this i love to curl my hair</li>
            <li> Let me preface this post by saying that I have long, naturally stick straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Just okay, not very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Curls look thick and bouncy and last ALL day, sometimes my hair even looks better day two!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it had different heat settings because this baby gets HOT!</li>
            <li> Yes, there is only one heat setting (extremely hot!).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing at such a low price and it is definitely a must buy !</li>
            <li> I have been using the Remmington light pink wand for 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how it is different, but it makes lovely natural looking curls that last all day with no hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Overall this product works and is worth the money.</li>
            <li> You can also achieve a more formal look by taking larger (about 3&amp;#34;) pieces, wrap them around the wand, hold for about 8 seconds, let them fall, and when you&#x27;ve done your whole head, brush them out with a round , smoothing brush.</li>
            <li> I would have much rather spent the extra 5 bucks for an authentic product.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like the glove, but I rarely burn my fingers without it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use hairspray  to hold the style like I normally would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that after curling my whole head, I tend to end up with some kinky curls that won&#x27;t lie flat and thus make my head&#x27;s shape look funny.  </li>
            <li> Problem with this method is that you can easily tell where the curl starts because suddenly you go from straight hair to a pretty tight curl.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time to get a handle of it without burning yourself, but I picked it up pretty quickly by watching a YouTube video.  </li>
            <li> It was not authentic and when I contacted the company they were very unprofessional and refused to give me a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;Simply said: DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!</li>
            <li> It lifts your roots to make you look like you have more volume, and makes for bigger curls towards the bottom to keep the &amp;#34;volumeous&amp;#34; look the whole way down!</li>
            <li> and you can get tons of different sized curls all depending how much hair you wrap around!</li>
            <li> I take different sections of hair (a combination of pieces ranging from 1&amp;#34; to 4&amp;#34;), twist them, and then wrap them around the wand curling away from my face.</li>
            <li> The small size at the one end, however, made tighter, more poodle-like curls.  </li>
            <li> This is actually my second wand (the first being a Revlon wand with a clip).</li>
            <li> and it only took 30 mins (the first time).</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it gets really hot</li>
            <li> By far this one KILLS the others SMASHED and STOMPED ONTO THE GROUND!  </li>
            <li> but once you get the motions down it&#x27;s smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> I used the &amp;#34;tension method&amp;#34; to blow dry my hair, and attempted to bevel my hair--without success...</li>
            <li> It works but you have to be careful because of how hot it gets plus the glove doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night on my freshly washed, air dried hair with only anti frizz serum in it just to see how it worked, let the curls cool, then went to bed.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was worried that this wand&#x27;s single heat setting wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough to give me lasting curls, but having tried other wands that got as hot as 410 degrees F, I can honestly say that this wand gets at least that hot, if not hotter.  </li>
            <li> The glove is a cheap little glove they put in there for show.</li>
            <li> This wand is super easy to use and it takes only a few minutes for me to do my long hair!</li>
            <li> I like that it is wide on the end, as most wands are wide at the handle and skinny at the end.  </li>
            <li> I have no trouble using it, much easier than regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the gloves that came with it might be itchy for people that has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Wear your glove for sure, I use it at least 3 times a week</li>
            <li> I bought this as an Xmas gift for my 12 year old.</li>
            <li> My nine year old daughter loves when I curl her hair with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big into hair styling, but really wanted to try out a curling wand.  </li>
            <li> I have bought two so far.</li>
            <li> She says it gives her soft, beachy waves.  </li>
            <li> Not the shape we were after, but it actually works very well.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this type of curling iron to accentuate the texture of my natural curls.  </li>
            <li> if you have some natural wave, you don&#x27;t have to curl every piece of your hair.  </li>
            <li> Heats up SO fast and curls last all day.</li>
            <li> Bought to curl my 3 yr old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> i have had no issues with the product thus far.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, curls last for days.</li>
            <li> I am a 47yr old Mother and baby</li>
            <li> but with the curling wand by the third use I really started getting it.</li>
            <li> If you like wild, sexy, messy, bombshell curls, this curling wand is definitely for you!</li>
            <li> I recently bought another Bed Head curling iron 1\\&quot; with a clip and its not as great as this one! :(</li>
            <li> overall I would say get it, it has become my main curler since I have been using it</li>
            <li> While I wish the glove that came with it was a little thicker and covered up a little more of my arm, the wand itself is PHENOMINAL!</li>
            <li> It is not too easy to use compare to the typical curling iron / flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair that is long.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;just be careful it can get really hot</li>
            <li> Had some trouble getting used to not having a cool tip.  </li>
            <li> overall, this product is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> : This wand beats out all the others I&#x27;ve tried for a few simple but important reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Honestly the first time I used this wand I was done in less than 10 minutes, and I have fairly long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Gives you those loose spirals with the straight ends...</li>
            <li> Be very careful when you use this because it gets SO HOT</li>
            <li> It gets very hot so be careful and use the glove but the pay off is the curls last the entire day.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m old fashion, but I would stick to the traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> For reference, I&#x27;m Caucasian with incredibly thick, coarse hair that has lots of body but no real wave or curl of its own.  </li>
            <li> and i dont have to section off in super small pieces</li>
            <li> The method I&#x27;ve settled on (and it might seem silly, but it isn&#x27;t as much of a hassle as it may sound like)</li>
            <li> I am African American, and wear my hair natural.</li>
            <li> I use CHI&#x27;s iron guard on my hair before curling and my curls will last the whole day without any other products needed.</li>
            <li> curls come out messy, very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> The only thing is I wish the glove was a little longer because I burned myself the first time I used it and the scar has not gone away after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I was curious to try another type of curling wand and found the new Curlipops on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The curls are odd looking but the curls hold the whole day.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice and wear the glove - you&#x27;ll get used to it and the burns you&#x27;ll get without it really hurt.</li>
            <li> I only burned myself slightly on my knuckle, but that&#x27;s because I got over excited by how well it was working and started to get sloppy haha.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is be VERY careful, VERY HOT!</li>
            <li> I have very straight, hard to curl hair and Bed Head seems to be the only brand that works.</li>
            <li> only negative point is that it gets really hot no temperature control settings...for my hairs curls do not last longer ..</li>
            <li> I have long hair but the second time I used it, it took me only 15 min to curl it</li>
            <li> I have thick, medium length, very straight hair</li>
            <li> Hard to use despite being quite hot.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be a lil hard for me at first</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to both a flat iron and curling iron and still cannot manage.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you have medium to long hair!</li>
            <li> The glove is no good; the heat gets right through it.</li>
            <li> My hair would never hold curl very long with regular curling irons.</li>
            <li> I really like it,but it was hard for me to learn how to use it......</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> I dont have to hold the iron long for my curls</li>
            <li> I also have really long hair(26&#x27;&#x27;)</li>
            <li> But if you wear the glove it seems to be harder to tell if you are holding hair or not, or getting close enough to the edges.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to burn yourself cuz the glove is short.</li>
            <li> My hair is long with layers.</li>
            <li> My hair is long</li>
            <li> I use a long sock on my hand and that helps.  </li>
            <li> The cord is long and swivels.</li>
            <li> It is so much less damaging than a regular curling iron and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy on the second day.</li>
            <li> Also, the curls do come out looking like spiral curls and a bit larger in the size of the spiral than other clipless wands.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;ve done my whole head, I run my fingers through the curls and apply a very small amount of wax to the ends.</li>
            <li> The other big reason this Bed Head wand is the one I&#x27;ve decided to keep is that for whatever reason (the type of ceramic it&#x27;s made of?</li>
            <li> It might be too hot for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Takes me less than 15 min to do my hair, and curls last all night.</li>
            <li> My hair does not hold a curl well and will typically fall without massive doses of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because it is too short for my hair and the shape is not good enough as only the bottom part of my hair gets widely curled.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of those right curls other wands are giving you TRY THIS!</li>
            <li> I can finally achieve the look I&#x27;m going for with little to no product.</li>
            <li> It seems to make my hair a little bit frizzy, which is the only downside.  </li>
            <li> Its price (at least for what Amazon is currently selling it at, which I know may change over time) is about five to ten bucks cheaper than the wands I&#x27;ve purchased at retailers.  </li>
            <li> so I was curious.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a bit thiner than I expected</li>
            <li> Be really careful not to burn yourself though, it isn&#x27;t for beginners.</li>
            <li> THESE CURLS STAY FOR DAYS with absolutely no hairspray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with a few solutions to this; I tried only wrapping about 2/3 of each lock around the wand so that the hair closest to my scalp doesn&#x27;t even get any heat.  </li>
            <li> I have really long hair down to my waist.  </li>
            <li> Which means you have to do it without and have some ice ready for that burn, because it is serious!</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail 2 days BEFORE the expected due date.</li>
            <li> A few other minor cons--these don&#x27;t really bother me, but I could see some people being annoyed by them--are that the wand doesn&#x27;t automatically shut off, so</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a lot I can say that other reviewer haven&#x27;t already.  </li>
            <li> Be careful using this item and wear the glove!</li>
            <li> (I have rough hair, I need the heat!)</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day and on the days I don&#x27;t wash, I curl.  </li>
            <li> pad I have been using for other hair tools for 3 years.</li>
            <li> Glove works well enough, however, it did arrive with a small hole.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been hunting for one, or trying to decide between this model and other wands out there, I say go for this one and</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been hunting for one, or trying to decide between this model and other wands out there, I say go for this one and</li>
            <li> I have other Bed Head curling wands.  </li>
            <li> You can wrap them as loose or as tight as you&#x27;d like, and they work on all lengths/thickness of hair.</li>
            <li> You can get tight curls to loose beach like waves without spending hours staring in the mirror with frustration.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this for first timers though because it will burn you bad if you&#x27;re not careful with it</li>
            <li> The curls last a few days, and give my usually limp hair lots of volume.  </li>
            <li> Typically, with traditional clamp-style curling irons, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl past a day.  </li>
            <li> I have found this one to be a little harder to use</li>
            <li> I love that I can wrap at the base to get a small tight curl and twist the wand to keep feeding the hair through the smaller area.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical but really wanted a curling wand without paying a lot of money.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint, it doesn&#x27;t have a stand ..</li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly shoulder length hair that usually refuses to hold a curl at all but for some reason this wand worked wonders.  </li>
            <li> I have hair down to my waist and this curler still curls every strand of my hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this little thing rocks my world.</li>
            <li> All the other ratings were  spot on!  </li>
            <li> It took curling half my head and one wrist burn to figure out how to work it</li>
            <li> i figured buying a wand would prevent breakage and be a bit less damaging.</li>
            <li> If you want really tight curls, do less hair and hold the hair on the wand longer..</li>
            <li> Usually my curls fall within a half hour with any other tool</li>
            <li> makes the cutest curls, will burn you if you do not use the little glove that comes with it.</li>
            <li> My hair ends up looking like little bo peep.</li>
            <li> Although the glove could be a little thicker.</li>
            <li> we r a little picky</li>
            <li> let go a little bit at a time.  </li>
            <li> I correct that with a little product.  </li>
            <li> I will say you can start to feel the heat a little through the glove.</li>
            <li> the narrow bottom leaves you with tight frizzy poodle curls.</li>
            <li> I can do one half of my head but the other is quite hard</li>
            <li> is to go ahead and wrap each lock all the way, and then after the curls have cooled off and rested for a few minutes, use my straightener to tame down the tightest part of the curl (I have bangs that I use my straightener to tame, too, so</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use to the ones with the clips, but I watched a few YouTube videos and went at it.</li>
            <li> if you want looser curls.. grab thicker strands of hair, wrap and a few seconds into holding..</li>
            <li> I have had it a few months now..</li>
            <li> have been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had quite a few.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried a curling wand that is evenly thick the whole length, or even worse, one that is biggest at the base and smallest at the tip (the opposite of this Bed Head wand&#x27;s shape), you know how frustrating it can be to try holding your hair taut against a friggin&#x27; hot iron while working against gravity.  </li>
            <li> I also have had no trouble with the wand rolling off my counter or the heated tip dipping down to the counter to come in contact with anything; the base is heavy enough to balance the weight of the iron part.  </li>

            <li> I have thin hair, so using a regular wand that tapers at the end makes my hair look stringy and definitely not cute.</li>
            <li> If you have thicker hair, leave it on a little longer, and if your hair is thin, don&#x27;t leave it on very long.  </li>
            <li> It does take a little getting used to since it isn&#x27;t your ordinary curling iron, but once you get the swing of things</li>
            <li> The glove doesn&#x27;t protect your hand very well &amp; is very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very adept at using it.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d better remember to turn it off yourself or risk doing some serious damage to anything sitting close to it, and the heating glove included with it (which, unless you are a total expert at using a curling wand, you MUST use in order to avoid really painful burns to your hands and/or fingers) is very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> but i ordered it anyway considering it was just a few bucks!  </li>
            <li> No joke, it hurts, and the glove is terrible... too awkward to be able to grip your hair when curling, and too short to protect your wrists - and you need to protect them.</li>
            <li> her hair is hard to keep a curl and this iron seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just hard to use and took me a while to do all of my hair.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and as soon as I opened the box I plugged that sucker in and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> Because in the store you can&#x27;t find the one that is thick at the end and thinner in the back.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> No holding it on for 30 seconds per one inch section of hair (seriously who has time for that?)</li>
            <li> The major con for me is how frizzy it made my hair even using a fizz control product it is just crazy!</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY hard to hold a curl and this wand made my hair curly and bouncy.</li>
            <li> This method will give you a crazy, non-polished, everyday look.</li>
            <li> I have thin, wavy hair that can&#x27;t hold a curl.</li>
            <li> I use the hottest setting and I have slightly thin hair.</li>
            <li> Finally, there is nothing built into the shape of this wand&#x27;s base to make it rest on a countertop.  </li>
            <li> Finally, there is nothing built into the shape of this wand&#x27;s base to make it rest on a countertop.  </li>
            <li> Received a ridiculous amount of compliments from women of all ages!</li>
            <li> The glove is awkward and makes it difficult to feel how to section your hair, but I got burnt a few times without it.</li>
            <li> I have crazy thick hair</li>
            <li> However, I am deducting one star from my rating for the horrible burn on my wrist that I got after only one day/use.</li>
            <li> I e-mailed the seller and told me sorry</li>
            <li> Go ahead ladies you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Usually I end up curling my hair and being disappointed</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a clamp, so your hair doesn&#x27;t get that weird fringe thing where the clamp was.</li>
            <li> and I was SO wrong.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use if you are not used to working with these types of tools.  </li>
            <li> christ was i wrong.</li>
            <li> Seriously!!  </li>
            <li> It was Hard to use since you had to hold it in an awkward position, I kept getting burned!</li>
            <li> the glove is horrible though, just use your fingers carefully</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both burned ourselves using this awkward styler.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s when you buy it, you will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> I burned my finger badly.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s really bad about it.</li>
            <li> The glove however, is worthless.</li>
            <li> That said, there is a bit of a learning curve to figure out how to hold the styler and wrap the hair, and the glove is worthless.  </li>
            <li> Took getting used to, I don&#x27;t use the glove as it is annoying.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am TERRIBLE at doing my hair!</li>
            <li> this product is horrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My daughter and I both burned ourselves using this awkward styler.</li>
            <li> Works great and heats up very fast. Curls last into the next day. I have some pieces of hair that don&#x27;t like to hold a curl and this does the trick!</li>
            <li> if u want tiny curls this is great for u&lt;br /&gt;just be careful it can get really hot&lt;br /&gt;the gloves that came with it might be itchy for people that has sensitive skin so watch out.&lt;br /&gt;if u love to travel with style this is great  coz its dual voltage u might just need adaptor to which place ur taking it</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite hair accessory, by far. Even my friends have asked me where I got my curls. This thing works like a dream, folks! It heats up super hot (watch your fingers) but once you get the motions down it&#x27;s smooth sailing. It comes with a glove to wear (once you&#x27;re a pro, who needs it). These curls don&#x27;t need hair spray either, they stay in all day (even overnight if you&#x27;re lucky). You can wrap them as loose or as tight as you&#x27;d like, and they work on all lengths/thickness of hair. Wonderful, just wonderful!</li>
            <li> Wear your glove for sure, I use it at least 3 times a week and I enjoy the look it gives my hair. I have really long hair and it gets it done in about 20 -30 mins.</li>
            <li> It was Hard to use since you had to hold it in an awkward position, I kept getting burned! curls come out messy, very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> An instructional video or booklet for correct procedure for how to use it would be nice.  But when a friend uses it, my daughter&#x27;s hair looks great and the curl holds for 2 days instead of 10 minutes like most curling irons and rollers I have used in her hair.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! I receive several compliments every time I curl my hair. The curls last all day. Would totally recommend this curling iron!</li>
            <li> I have had this wand for almost a year. It works perfectly! The glove however, is worthless. Purchase your own glove separately.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand. My hair would never hold curl very long with regular curling irons. very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Used it as soon as I got it. My hair is VERY hard to hold a curl and this wand made my hair curly and bouncy. Hours later its A nice wave but still really curly. I absolutely love this wand and would give it more than 5 stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;Also shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> Great product! Timely delivery!!</li>
            <li> The curls come out really good and it gets realllyyy hot</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because it is too short for my hair and the shape is not good enough as only the bottom part of my hair gets widely curled.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying my hair is very long, very straight and very healthy. That being said this product was very easy to use and gave my hair a beautiful shaped curl which I have never been able to get with any other curling device. The major con for me is how frizzy it made my hair even using a fizz control product it is just crazy!</li>
            <li> The curls are odd looking but the curls hold the whole day.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it. Took her just one try to figure it out and she was on her way.</li>
            <li> I love this wand! It keeps my hair curled all day! Even the next day my hair has a great beach wave still! This wand is super easy to use and it takes only a few minutes for me to do my long hair! If you are looking for the beachy wave or the &amp;#34;blogger&amp;#34; style hair, get this!</li>
            <li> I like this iron but prefer the one that tapers at other end best. I have found this one to be a little harder to use but I still like it and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few weeks now. I get TONS of compliments each time I do my hair with this. It&#x27;s super easy to use, even if you&#x27;ve never used a wand before. My only complaints are that there&#x27;s no stand on this wand so you have to put it on a towel so it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t burn your counter, and every now and then it snags your hair. Other than that, this little thing rocks my world.</li>
            <li> This is my first curling wand and I love it.  I have thick, medium length, very straight hair and it takes me 10-15 minutes to curl my whole head.  I tend to curl the night before to let the curls relax overnight since I tend to look like Shirley Temple right after I finish.  In the morning, I run my fingers through my hair and am ready to go!  The curls last all day and if I kept them, they would be nice waves another day after.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t receive the glove but the wand is fantastic for the price!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a lot I can say that other reviewer haven&#x27;t already.  This is a great curler in that it makes solid curls that will last all day without a touch up.  For my youngest, the curls lasted the next day as well.  That said, there is a bit of a learning curve to figure out how to hold the styler and wrap the hair, and the glove is worthless.  I used youtube to figure out how to hold and wrap.  The glove though....I was basically using my finger tips and nails to avoid a burn.  But for the first styler I&#x27;ve owned that doesn&#x27;t clamp, it is great.  More realistic curls than some of the smaller wands.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need practice but I just don&#x27;t get the gimmick.  Hard to use despite being quite hot.  Seems like it could damage hair too.</li>
            <li> Great price and a really good product!  The wand gets really hot which is a must for my hair! The only con is it does not have the auto turn off, but for the price it was worth it!</li>
            <li> Used it once.  Had some trouble getting used to not having a cool tip.  Burnt my shoulder and a knuckle during the process, ouch!  I have fine, slightly wavy hair of medium thickness that is in good health.  The curls did last through the event I went to that night with the use of some product, but were gone by morning.  Also, the curls do come out looking like spiral curls and a bit larger in the size of the spiral than other clipless wands.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this. I have to go in her room and hunt to get it back. lol&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;m going to have to buy another one...</li>
            <li> I am TERRIBLE at doing my hair! i typically just straighten it every day, but since i got this i love to curl my hair &amp; i can actually do it! It does take a little getting used to since it isn&#x27;t your ordinary curling iron, but once you get the swing of things it goes like a breeze! and you can get tons of different sized curls all depending how much hair you wrap around! Totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I own many flat irons, curling irons, rollers and wands and this is by far the best product for creating curls I have ever had.  I don&#x27;t understand how it is different, but it makes lovely natural looking curls that last all day with no hairspray.  It is so much less damaging than a regular curling iron and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy on the second day. However...you have got to pay attention while using it.  It will burn the heck out of your hand, finger, wrist, etc.  That being said, I use it every day and have just stocked up on bandaids!  :)</li>
            <li> Love this wand.  This is the first curling wand I have bought and I am so impressed by it.  It is super easy to use and creates voluminous, wonderful curls.  I would by this for a friend as well.</li>
            <li> My faviorate rod iron ever...i have two others and this one is amazing. It heats up super fast and geta really hot. I dont have to hold the iron long for my curls and they last a couple of days ( &amp; im in Louisiana-super humid). I also have really long hair(26&#x27;&#x27;) and i dont have to section off in super small pieces either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cons-but it only has a on and off switch no temp adjustment.</li>
            <li> I cannot get the hang of this wand and obviously need way more practice.  Not for the inexperienced or even the just able.  I am accustomed to both a flat iron and curling iron and still cannot manage.  Will continue to update.  U tube videos may help.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but the curls don&#x27;t last...I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the products I use or lack there of...</li>
            <li> Works great!! Curls hold amazingly well!!</li>
            <li> I love this wand. Does what it&#x27;s suppose to, curls perfectly. The only complaint I have is be VERY careful, VERY HOT! The glove is a cheap little glove they put in there for show. Which means you have to do it without and have some ice ready for that burn, because it is serious! I always get compliments on my hair when I use this wand! I recently bought another Bed Head curling iron 1\\&quot; with a clip and its not as great as this one! :( Overall this product works and is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can never get my hair to curl.  I got this wand and it is perfect!  My curls stayed for hours even at work (i&#x27;m a milker on a dairy farm).</li>
            <li> I do not like this, I cannot work with the glove as it gets tangled in the hair. I think if the glove was smoother it may be easier.</li>
            <li> I wish I had gotten the regular wand.</li>
            <li> I love this wand curler. I have hair down to my waist and this curler still curls every strand of my hair. I can go a couple of days without having to re-curl my hair. It actually gets even prettier and natural-looking after a day. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Although I am still not quite sure how to use this on my hair, the product was perfect and came quickly</li>
            <li> I bought this as an Xmas gift for my 12 year old. She loves it. The wand doesn&#x27;t fry her ends like a curling iron does and the heat resistant gloves protects from burns</li>
            <li> Great curling wand. It makes nice mermaid curls,/waves, tighter at the top and looser at the bottom. My nine year old daughter loves when I curl her hair with this. It gets very hot so be careful and use the glove but the pay off is the curls last the entire day.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing!! It&#x27;s easy to use and it works quickly!!! No holding it on for 30 seconds per one inch section of hair (seriously who has time for that?) only to have the curl fall out 30 minutes later. This thing is simple, effective and an amazing value! It worked on 3 completely different types of hair in the same awesome way. Just Fantastic :)</li>
            <li> I had never tried one of these before so I was curious.  When I tried it , I loved it.  It works great even if you straightened your hair.</li>
            <li> makes the cutest curls, will burn you if you do not use the little glove that comes with it. But if you wear the glove it seems to be harder to tell if you are holding hair or not, or getting close enough to the edges.</li>
            <li> Best curling iron!  Takes me less than 15 min to do my hair, and curls last all night.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand!</li>
            <li> Love it... really makes cute curls. However, I am deducting one star from my rating for the horrible burn on my wrist that I got after only one day/use. No joke, it hurts, and the glove is terrible... too awkward to be able to grip your hair when curling, and too short to protect your wrists - and you need to protect them. Otherwise, perfect and glad I bought.</li>
            <li> This is the best styling tool ive ever had! I have never been able to get my hair to hold a curl or wave until now. I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big into hair styling, but really wanted to try out a curling wand.  I had no idea if I should get a tapered, all one size, or conical wand.  I decided on this one (the conical).  It&#x27;s AMAZING!  The curls last a few days, and give my usually limp hair lots of volume.  My coworkers were so impressed with this that THREE of them have now purchased the wand, and another is going to buy one for each of her daughters!  My tip:  buy another glove.  I use both hands to wrap my hair, so by using two gloves I don&#x27;t have to continue switching the glove.  One coworker doesn&#x27;t use the glove, but I&#x27;m not that coordinated...I&#x27;ll definitely burn my fingers if I don&#x27;t use it.  Highly recommend this wand!</li>
            <li> This is my second curling wand. I ordered it Tuesday March 11, 2014 and it came in two days. I love the curl that I get from the shape of the wand, and the curls are even more gorgeous when I pin the curls then let them down. I would definitely recommend this item to someone ! It&#x27;s amazing at such a low price and it is definitely a must buy !&amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Great for stay all day curls. I didn&#x27;t even need hairspray. I love that I can wrap at the base to get a small tight curl and twist the wand to keep feeding the hair through the smaller area. There is no temperature gauge, but that&#x27;s okay for me. The wand doesn&#x27;t seem to get overly hot at all. I have the Bed Head Rock n Roller as well,  and I like this one more. I want to try the hour glass one next.</li>
            <li> If you like wild, sexy, messy, bombshell curls, this curling wand is definitely for you! I take different sections of hair (a combination of pieces ranging from 1&amp;#34; to 4&amp;#34;), twist them, and then wrap them around the wand curling away from my face. I only hold them for about 5 or 6 seconds, unwrap them, and let them fall. After I&#x27;ve done my whole head, I run my fingers through the curls and apply a very small amount of wax to the ends. This method will give you a crazy, non-polished, everyday look. You can also achieve a more formal look by taking larger (about 3&amp;#34;) pieces, wrap them around the wand, hold for about 8 seconds, let them fall, and when you&#x27;ve done your whole head, brush them out with a round , smoothing brush. Both of these looks are beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;  This wand gets VERY hot. It comes with a glove, but I choose not to use it (because I leave about 2&amp;#34; at the bottom of each piece UN-curled). Be very careful when you use this because it gets SO HOT and there is not a heat setting!&lt;br /&gt;  I have used many other curling wands, but the shape of this one makes for a very unique curl. I love it. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in beautiful, wild, sexy hair!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this wand!! I have bought two so far. 1 for myself and another for my cousin!</li>
            <li> It created very light and bouncy curls. I&#x27;m in love with it, but caution- it gets VERY hot so wear the glove!</li>
            <li> Probably one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever bought.Works fantastic and makes your hair have these bouncy curls and even without hairspray will stay in for a long time.definetely glad I bought this.give this 6 stars!!!!</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical but really wanted a curling wand without paying a lot of money.  This wand is perfect!  I love how it curls and the curls really stay.  I can easily make it two three days on the same curls.</li>
            <li> Love this wand! It&#x27;s quite a bit thiner than I expected but it makes pretty curls and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite curling iron ever. my curls last for days and days when i use it. the glove is horrible though, just use your fingers carefully and it&#x27;s much easier. i&#x27;ve recommended this tool to all my friends with hair.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I&#x27;m happy with this product my wave patterns are BEAUTIFUL! I definitely recommend this to everyone. money well spend</li>
            <li> Be careful not to burn yourself cuz the glove is short.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and it came quick. Gets very hot very fast. I burned my finger badly. I don&#x27;t want to wear a glove while styling my hair. My hair is long with layers. I don&#x27;t like how this curling iron curled my hair. Made it poofy which is not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I only burned myself slightly on my knuckle, but that&#x27;s because I got over excited by how well it was working and started to get sloppy haha. Got it in the mail 2 days BEFORE the expected due date. Works really well. Gives me fun Carrie Bradshaw curls so I&#x27;m happy! The glove was tricky to work with, but believe me, its better than a burn.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much! It is so easy to use and the curls stay in for a long time without hairspray!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to have curly hair- no iron had ever worked for me. This was instantaneous. It&#x27;s incredibly easy and it held for so long. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this product enough!!</li>
            <li> Works great. Gets really hot and my hair will stay curly/wavy for two days without hairspray. Love it. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like it,but it was hard for me to learn how to use it...... The glove is soooo comfortable</li>
            <li> I like that it is wide on the end, as most wands are wide at the handle and skinny at the end.  This works in my hair great!  It heats up quickly and is very hot.  The surface is nice and smooth, unlike some that make your hair stick to it and do not release.  I am thrilled with my wand!</li>
            <li> The curler did not come in the original packaging and was not functional. It was not authentic and when I contacted the company they were very unprofessional and refused to give me a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;Simply said: DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! I would have much rather spent the extra 5 bucks for an authentic product.</li>
            <li> I love this curler for my short hair. It was a great product for the price. It seems as nice as curlers similar to it that I saw at a competitor&#x27;s store. I loved that it included the heat glove and a rubber tip. This made me feel  much more comfortable using it.  I just wish it had different heat settings because this baby gets HOT!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item about four months ago. At first i was really happy with the way the iron curled. If you want loose,soft, waves this is not the iron for you. This iron creates defined waves. Defined waves can be nice for certain occasions, but i was searching for an everyday look. This iron does create  VERY NICE curls or waves semi-loose or tight. Overall i would recommend this to someone, but let them know the kind of curls or waves that they will get with this iron.&lt;br /&gt;  P.S. If you are looking for the waves i wanted i would recommend an iron that has a straight barrel</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before trying this and all the good things were true! I love this curling wand! It gives such gorgeous volume and the curls last all day. I slept on them and they still held the next day.</li>
            <li> My only problem with this one is that it doesn&#x27;t come with heat setting. It&#x27;s my fault anyway for not reading much into the information but I kinda thought that with all the styling tools, it&#x27;s necessary for them to have a heat setting. Oh well. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this for first timers though because it will burn you bad if you&#x27;re not careful with it but hey, it still works.</li>
            <li> Great deal and works very well!  Gives you those loose spirals with the straight ends...</li>
            <li> This is my first curl wand, so I have no base for comparison. But I think this is a good product and would purchase again or recommend if needed.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of those right curls other wands are giving you TRY THIS! Especially if you have medium to long hair! Curls look thick and bouncy and last ALL day, sometimes my hair even looks better day two!! Tempted to buy another one!</li>
            <li> My daughter is very happy with her new &amp;#34;reverse&amp;#34; curling iron.  She says it gives her soft, beachy waves.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> This styler it self is great. I love it. But I was told that I would receive a GLOVE.. but I did not receive it. I e-mailed the seller and told me sorry but they said i would not get one. I kept rechecking the item and nowhere did it say I would not receive a glove. It&#x27;s upsetting because this is one of the reasons why I picked this one item!!! I have used it, but i keep burning myself!!</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, and it looks absolutely beautiful when I wand my hair!!</li>
            <li> Love it, the curler makes the most adorable curls ever and holds pretty well. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it only has a on/off switch so I can not choose the temperature but it does curl my hair really fast. overall I would say get it, it has become my main curler since I have been using it</li>
            <li> Works great on my shoulder length hair. The glove is no good; the heat gets right through it. But the iron itself does the job without spending a ton. Easy to use too.</li>
            <li> This heats up nicely and evenly.  The small size at the one end, however, made tighter, more poodle-like curls.  It also doesn&#x27;t have any kind of stand or guard to keep it from touching the counter directly when it&#x27;s put down.</li>
            <li> Loveeeee! I&#x27;ve tried soooo many curling irons and wands, and this is bar far my favorite thus far. I have thin hair, so using a regular wand that tapers at the end makes my hair look stringy and definitely not cute. This wand has the opposite effect, though! It lifts your roots to make you look like you have more volume, and makes for bigger curls towards the bottom to keep the &amp;#34;volumeous&amp;#34; look the whole way down! It doesn&#x27;t have a control setting for heat, but I don&#x27;t think that takes away from it much. If you have thicker hair, leave it on a little longer, and if your hair is thin, don&#x27;t leave it on very long.  You might have to play around with how long is good enough to leave it on for your hair type.  I only left mine on for about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> I have very straight, hard to curl hair and Bed Head seems to be the only brand that works. This iron works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Be careful using this item and wear the glove! I have burned mhyself twice now with this on my wrist and they are burns that are scarring after healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all a good product that produces great curls!</li>
            <li> All the other ratings were  spot on!  I only played with my blue girl and I am in love!  I did purchase better gloves since so many spoke of burns.</li>
            <li> it came in really quickly and was protected in the box it came in very well! You get exactly that and it works great and you get beautiful mermaid curls!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this style on my hair .&lt;br /&gt;So when I found it here I was excited. Because in the store you can&#x27;t find the one that is thick at the end and thinner in the back.&lt;br /&gt;But honestly. There is no stand. So it begins that you have this hot curling iron on the vanity . Really?&lt;br /&gt;That is my biggest problem with it and also that it doesn&#x27;t work the same way as in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it heats well.</li>
            <li> Not the shape we were after, but it actually works very well.  It gets hot SO fast, so make sure and wear the gloves.  We just were not sure about the opposite conical barrel, but it does produce pretty curls.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite styling tool of the moment. It gets super hot and the curls are amazing. They last until you wash your hair. By the third day I usually brush the curls out for beautiful waves. I get so many compliments! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> so impressed with this item my daughter is the happiest. her hair is hard to keep a curl and this iron seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> My hair ends up looking like little bo peep. maybe I am not using it right. I prefer traditional hair curlers.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and transaction...Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely in love with this curling wand.  I&#x27;ve tried to many curling irons to no avail.  My wedding is in 4 weeks and when I saw it I thought what the heck why not give it a try?  I want a curly updo but after trying again and again I resigned myself to the fact I probably will  never get the hair I want.  My hair just won&#x27;t hold a curl because it&#x27;s baby fine and also I think it is out to get me!  It arrived on time and as soon as I opened the box I plugged that sucker in and gave it a try.  It took curling half my head and one wrist burn to figure out how to work it but once that happened it turned out beautifully!  My curls are nice and bouncy and most importantly: HOLDING!  WITHOUT PRODUCT!!  I can finally achieve the look I&#x27;m going for with little to no product. My fiance can also finally see the curly hair he has always wanted to see on me!  I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t bought one sooner!  I highly recommend!!  One happy girl here!!!</li>
            <li> It works but you have to be careful because of how hot it gets plus the glove doesn&#x27;t really work but it still blocks out some heat</li>
            <li> I ordered this wand on the 1st and it came very quickly from brooklyn i used it and loved it,it does not give you perfect curls if thats what you are looking for they are very messy but very cute it also gets very hot you will get burned</li>
            <li> this product is amazing.  i love how it curls my hair, but looks more like beach waves than curly sue.&lt;br /&gt;perfect for what i was looking for!</li>
            <li> I do not like this curler. The glove should come up higher on the wrist to prevent burns. My daughter has burnt herself twice on this curler. I do not like how it does not have a rest of some sort. Maybe I&#x27;m old fashion, but I would stick to the traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> This wand is perfectly efficient and easy to use on my curly hair to add extra definition and professional style curl. It takes a little longer to heat than advertised but otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product it gives me beautiful curls and am great for the price! The curler heats up very quickly!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Works beautifully. Curls came out so nice and smooth and tight, I just love it. I thought it would be a lil hard for me at first I&#x27;m use to the ones with the clips, but I watched a few YouTube videos and went at it. It was very easy, the curls came out flawless no frizzy ends just beautiful curls. This wand does get very HOT but I was careful to not burn myself, the glove came in very handy to keep that from happening and the heat gard tip. I was very unsure about this iron wand because of the price, I thought there was no way this would give me the curl I wanted but since it had so many great reviews I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did, works just good as a 100.00 dollar iron or the one my hairdresser uses. My husband actually thought I went and had my hair done when he came in from work lol. Awesome curling iron!! Go ahead ladies you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This works so good! Although the glove could be a little thicker.</li>
            <li> It does not get any better than this.  Finally a styling tool that is so versatile you can create any look you want.  You can get tight curls to loose beach like waves without spending hours staring in the mirror with frustration.  Honestly the first time I used this wand I was done in less than 10 minutes, and I have fairly long thick hair. You can not beat the price on Amazon.  Much more expensive in stores.  I bought 2 just in case Bed Head decides to discontinue this styling wand.  I highly recommend.  Heats fast and brilliant design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a wand before, and didn&#x27;t realize this was a backwords one, or whatever it&#x27;s considered. I can&#x27;t do my own hair with it very well, but it has made amazing curls that last all day in my both of my young daughters hair.</li>
            <li> This is heaven on Earth if you wear Brazilian or Peruvian hair. Purchase this! The curls come out better then on a regular wand &amp; heats up really fast. Shipping and delivery is fast as well.</li>
            <li> This is the best ever. Takes a little practice and wear the glove - you&#x27;ll get used to it and the burns you&#x27;ll get without it really hurt.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have ever used. Since I have received I have used it almost every day! I love the curl it gives! It&#x27;s not if you buy this product... it&#x27;s when you buy it, you will not be sorry! LOVE!</li>
            <li> nice product..only negative point is that it gets really hot no temperature control settings...for my hairs curls do not last longer ..I have thin,dry and frizzy hairs..</li>
            <li> I want to start by saying that I might possibly have every styling tool of every kind. This is actually my second wand (the first being a Revlon wand with a clip). I have thin, wavy hair that can&#x27;t hold a curl. I have a big barrel curling iron, a 1\\&quot;, tourmaline and ceramic and I&#x27;ve tried it all--this wand is absolutely awesome. It makes ringlet curls that fall to waves as the day progresses. Usually my curls fall within a half hour with any other tool and I have had my hair curly for going on 2 hours now..and that&#x27;s without any styling spray or products. I actually got this wand at TJ Maxx but I had to write a review to praise it! Would HIGHLY recommend this tool!! Also love that this comes with a heat glove! Bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I slept with my hair curly and wore it all day today and it is still curly!! Received a ridiculous amount of compliments from women of all ages! HIGHLY recommend this product! Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wand!!</li>
            <li> Great product for price wish it got a little hotter just a little more time consuming I guess as a hairstylist we r a little picky</li>
            <li> this works....bought if for my daughter and the curls and gorgeous....they last for the entire nite and that is while she goes out dancing...lol</li>
            <li> Gets super hot (I have rough hair, I need the heat!) Works great and it&#x27;s very comfortable in my arms.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really curl hair</li>
            <li> It gets hot super fast! My curls lasted all day! My hair is long i just wish the stick was longer! The glove works</li>
            <li> The glove doesn&#x27;t protect your hand very well &amp; is very uncomfortable. I have never used this type of styler, I got it for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this wand!  BUT you can really burn yourself if you don&#x27;t becareful.  I have burned myself three times with the very tip of the wand on my inside forearms..I have really long hair down to my waist.  This is the only wand that has kept the curl in ALL day even on the days I hit the gym during my lunch hour.  It also gives the top of my hair a lot of volume if I decided to wrap my hair closer to the roots.  I don&#x27;t even need a lot of product to hold the curls.  If you want really tight curls, do less hair and hold the hair on the wand longer.. if you want looser curls.. grab thicker strands of hair, wrap and a few seconds into holding.. let go a little bit at a time.  I wash my hair every other day and on the days I don&#x27;t wash, I curl.  it leaves your hair really pretty.  I get soo many compliments from the ladies (even from men that I work with!). I have had it a few months now.. but after leaving the gym today.. I received two compliments so I knew I had to leave a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the glove was longer.  A must buy.  I totally recomend it!</li>
            <li> Works great with my hair! I personally don&#x27;t like the glove, but I rarely burn my fingers without it. Gives great long lasting curls!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Remmington light pink wand for 2 years.  I was curious to try another type of curling wand and found the new Curlipops on Amazon.  I ordered this one and the orange tapered one.  I really like the blue one, curls are tighter at the top, but don&#x27;t really look tighter, I think you just get more volume with your hair since the curls start closer to the scalp with this design.  The orange iron is also good, but this one is my favorite.  Use the glove until you are experienced using a wand!  These get hot!  Very happy with purchase though.</li>
            <li> Awesome product fast shipping love it</li>
            <li> Let me preface this post by saying that I have long, naturally stick straight, fine hair. My hair does not hold a curl well and will typically fall without massive doses of hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a few weeks and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Yes, there is only one heat setting (extremely hot!). Luckily this product does come with a heat glove and a cool end tip. It provides very full, voluminous curls and when brushed out becomes soft waves. I use CHI&#x27;s iron guard on my hair before curling and my curls will last the whole day without any other products needed. It&#x27;s simple, fast, and effective. I would recommend this product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Beware!!! This wand gets super hot super quick, so always use the glove with it! I&#x27;m not sure how to use it still, for some reason some curls come out better than the others, but that&#x27;s error within myself All around; great wand for a great price.</li>
            <li> holy moly!!! I am in love with this!! I have crazy thick hair, that is very long and this wand works beautifully on it, and super fast! the only thing I was not crazy about it the glove, it makes my hair staticky  Other than that its great and I am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this type of curling iron to accentuate the texture of my natural curls.  I really like it--if you have some natural wave, you don&#x27;t have to curl every piece of your hair.  It seems to get really hot, but doesn&#x27;t have temperature controls (just and on/off toggle).  It seems to make my hair a little bit frizzy, which is the only downside.  I correct that with a little product.  I get tons of compliments when I use this iron.</li>
            <li> LOVE.  Gave me perfect curls.  Only had to hold it 5 seconds for each section of hair.  The design makes it easy to hold hair on the barrel.  My hair is always sliding to the end of the regular conical sticks, but this is brilliant.  Heats up SO fast and curls last all day.</li>
            <li> Bought to curl my 3 yr old daughter&#x27;s hair. It worked great. Took getting used to, I don&#x27;t use the glove as it is annoying. I did burn my hand the first time but once I learned the proper technique worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> I bought as a gift and asked my sister how she likes it and she said it works really well and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> My hair never curls but this has been my solution. I can curl my hair in the morning, go to bed, and wake up again and my hair still looks good. Also, I don&#x27;t even have to use any kind of styling products. I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied with this and highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this styling wand...easy to use and curls hold for days!!</li>
            <li> Does a good job curling my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love it, it gets super hot but it holds the curls well. I haven&#x27;t quite figured out how to get the tips curled unless i want burned lol</li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly shoulder length hair that usually refuses to hold a curl at all but for some reason this wand worked wonders.  I normally wear my hair curly, so I wanted to use this to create a more defined curl pattern in certain spots rather than curling my entire head.  I used it for the first time last night on my freshly washed, air dried hair with only anti frizz serum in it just to see how it worked, let the curls cool, then went to bed.  This morning, to my surprise, the curls were still there, and were perfectly relaxed and defined.  All I did was add a bit more serum to calm the frizz and I have perfect loose beachy waves just like I was hoping for.  I&#x27;m amazed considering I didn&#x27;t use hairspray  to hold the style like I normally would.</li>
            <li> I use this iron in congunction with my normal 1&amp;#34; for beautiful beachy waves! I like that it creates tighter curls up top, and looser ones at the bottom. This adds definition and texture to my hair. Took a couple days to get the hang of it, but now I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> This curling wand is very nice. Curls come out perfect and it was well worth the $24 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I am African American, and wear my hair natural. I don&#x27;t do a ton of heat, but this did the trick. I used the &amp;#34;tension method&amp;#34; to blow dry my hair, and attempted to bevel my hair--without success...a day later I used this wand and voila! To maintain, I pin curled my hair at night.</li>
            <li> I love this iron ! i dint think I would like it so much but i ordered it anyway considering it was just a few bucks!  Im so happy I did!  the curls last all day!  :)</li>
            <li> Especially for less than $20 this is a great purchase. This wand was very easy to use, my curls came out quite uniform and lasted all night and the next day with no hairspray which is amazing for my hair, usually curls with tons of hairspray only last an hour or so, so I am impressed. Usually I end up curling my hair and being disappointed so I wash it and wear it straight but I went out on a womb and used it right before a party and it only took 30 mins (the first time). I&#x27;m taking one star off because there is no stand or cool tip so it burned right through my &amp;#34;heat resistant&amp;#34; pad I have been using for other hair tools for 3 years. Otherwise it is a fabulous product I don&#x27;t understand how it works so much better than other irons :)</li>
            <li> I love it but I still gotta learn how to curl correctly. I can do one half of my head but the other is quite hard and I got second degree burn on my arm. Not their fault. Just mine for being a beginner lol. Still an amazing wand</li>
            <li> LOVE this wand.  Never knew my hair could curl so well.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I totally love it. My curls stayed for two days without hairspray. The only thing is I wish the glove was a little longer because I burned myself the first time I used it and the scar has not gone away after 3 weeks. I have long hair but the second time I used it, it took me only 15 min to curl it and everyone at work loved it and said that it probably took long to get it done, nope 15 min only. Would definately recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely and awesomely..well awesome! It makes your hair look amazing! Drop dead gorgeous! But do make sure not to burn yourself,you have to get the hang of it. It doesn&#x27;t have a clamp, so your hair doesn&#x27;t get that weird fringe thing where the clamp was.</li>
            <li> My niece encouraged me to get a conical styler.  I really love it.  I dumped the plastic glove and purchased a heat resistant glove for dutch oven cooking.  Don&#x27;t really need it but it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;nice to have&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to buy a different glove because it just wasn&#x27;t as great, but the product itself is amazing. When I do have time to curl my hair, I get so many compliments. The product is easy to use, heats up fast, and really gives you amazing curls!</li>
            <li> This iron is HOT!  I&#x27;ve burnt my arms and hands more times than I can count. The glove doesn&#x27;t help at all. I use a long sock on my hand and that helps.  Makes nice curls.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted a bed  head curler and when I received this one I was very  impressed plus the price is amazing how can u not say no to this !!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it!  But use the glove, it&#x27;s really easy to burn yourself on the barrel since it gets so hot!</li>
            <li> this item is exactly as advertised. works well. i have had no issues with the product thus far. overall, this product is worth the money spent. only burned myself twice!</li>
            <li> This wand is amazing. It curls hair perfectly and the glove thay comes with is really helpful. I only gave it 4 stars because it gets really hot and there&#x27;s no temp settings, and would burn hair if used too much.</li>
            <li> This is the best styler I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;ve had quite a few. This makes curls just the right shape and it&#x27;s very hot and the curls stay!</li>
            <li> My wife lives by this, she says it&#x27;s a great product that works just as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an iron like this one but they cost well over $80...for $25 this one does all the same things as the others. The glove it came with was very cheap so I threw it out and am using a glove from another iron, but besides that it is great!</li>
            <li> Wish it had a temp display.  Curls look great. My curls/waves last for several days. Good price. Easy to use</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well. Good for stubborn straight hair like mine</li>
            <li> outstanding results. My hair looks so pretty and so evenly curled. I have no trouble using it, much easier than regular curling iron. At first I used the protective glove, that is included, but after a while I mastered even without the glove and never got burnt,</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, curls last for days. Just wish there was a temperature control. Glad I purchased for such a great price.</li>
            <li> This realy works . But it burns heck out your hands and wrist. Be very careful. And there&#x27;s no temp adjustment so u might  fry your hair</li>
            <li> I use my wand all the time!  Heats up pretty fast and gets really hot!  I get tons of compliments on my hair when I use it.</li>
            <li> You have to get used to how to use these. I have burned my wrist many times. The waves are great and stay in all day. I recommend using gel ahead of time. I use the hottest setting and I have slightly thin hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first Curling Wand and I&#x27;m so glad I tried this one first! My only complaint, it doesn&#x27;t have a stand .. so it moves around on my counter! It does get extremely hot! Will continue to purchase BED HEAD PRODUCTS!!</li>
            <li> I have the hardest to curl hair and it makes the perfect curls that hold all day!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice curling iron that is high quality and priced right.  This curling iron will provide years of style.</li>
            <li> I may get better at using this, but I burned myself like five times and the curls weren&#x27;t smooth when I was done. I don&#x27;t really like this product, but that may be b/c I&#x27;m not very adept at using it.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected. Beware of the end...gets very hot, even with the rubber cap on it!</li>
            <li> DUDE ..  BEST EVER!!!  Seriously!!  I am a 47yr old Mother and baby I have had some curling irons.  By far this one KILLS the others SMASHED and STOMPED ONTO THE GROUND!  I&#x27;m  telling you, buy it!  HOT, seriously hot, but the curls are like NO other.  SIMPLY TOP OF THE LINE!</li>
            <li> At first I had a hesitation about ordering this however, once I got I loved it! Great for long hair! You get great curls! USE THE GLOVE!&lt;br /&gt;It gets your fingertips hot!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing! It gets really hot very quickly and makes perfect waves that last all day. Be really careful not to burn yourself though, it isn&#x27;t for beginners. The glove it comes with is ok but causes static.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair that is long. This is an excellent product for doing the &amp;#34;beach waves&amp;#34; style. I&#x27;ve used two other types of curling irons and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!! everything about this wand is amazing!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I learned quickly. Glove works well enough, however, it did arrive with a small hole. LOVE this product though. Nothing curls my hair, and if it does they fall in an hour. THESE CURLS STAY FOR DAYS with absolutely no hairspray.</li>
            <li> Loved it I absolutely love the curls they honestly do stay for a long time I did my hair at 12pm it now 11:30 and the curls are still curls not waves</li>
            <li> My sister first introduced me to this and I love it!  It works great on my hair and I haven&#x27;t found many irons that would work so well.  I can sleep w/ the curls and still have curls the next day!  Love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li> Works well, takes some trial and error to use product without burning yourself.</li>
            <li> You definitely need to buy this product! It works great and heats up fast!</li>
            <li> This gets nice and hot and makes good, lasting curls. It&#x27;s just hard to use and took me a while to do all of my hair. I have straight, shoulder length hair. I did get several compliments on my hair though. The glove is awkward and makes it difficult to feel how to section your hair, but I got burnt a few times without it. Some people may have a talent for this sort of thing, but I don&#x27;t. I wish I had bought one with a clip for now, but I&#x27;m keeping this because I&#x27;m growing my hair out. I think I&#x27;ll be able to make the big loose curls once my hair is longer, and hopefully some more length will make it easier to use.</li>
            <li> This tastes nothing like blue raspberry! My Fiances hair looked beautiful after she used it and she said it was easy and perfect to use!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a curling wand and to me it&#x27;s much easier than using a curling iron. The hardest part is just having patience. I have thick hair so it does take longer. I tried using a curling iron multiple times and never got the hang of it but with the curling wand by the third use I really started getting it. To me it&#x27;s much easier. Not sure how hot it gets but it was perfect for my hair. It might be too hot for thin hair. I will say you can start to feel the heat a little through the glove. The inverted shape makes it so your curl gets bigger at the ends. There&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s really bad about it. The cord is long and swivels. The switch gets in the way at times but all in all it&#x27;s a good choice for the price.</li>
            <li> For months, I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find the perfect curling wand.  I&#x27;ve tried different brands as well as different shapes, and so far, this Bed Head reverse-conical wand is the best one I&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s as close to perfect as a wand has come for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: This wand beats out all the others I&#x27;ve tried for a few simple but important reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1. Its shape makes it infinitely easier to curl my hair around the barrel and keep it there without it sliding off.  If you&#x27;ve tried a curling wand that is evenly thick the whole length, or even worse, one that is biggest at the base and smallest at the tip (the opposite of this Bed Head wand&#x27;s shape), you know how frustrating it can be to try holding your hair taut against a friggin&#x27; hot iron while working against gravity.  With this wand, that hassle is solved (I also love that it makes my curls looser at the end, which as they relax throughout the day gives them a much more realistic &amp;#34;beachy wave&amp;#34; that so many users of curling wands are seeking--those conical wands tend to create Shirley Temple curls that never really relax enough to look natural).&lt;br /&gt;2. The other big reason this Bed Head wand is the one I&#x27;ve decided to keep is that for whatever reason (the type of ceramic it&#x27;s made of? how hot it gets?), it gives me curls that last several days with no refreshing whatsoever.  For reference, I&#x27;m Caucasian with incredibly thick, coarse hair that has lots of body but no real wave or curl of its own.  Typically, with traditional clamp-style curling irons, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl past a day.  At first, I was worried that this wand&#x27;s single heat setting wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough to give me lasting curls, but having tried other wands that got as hot as 410 degrees F, I can honestly say that this wand gets at least that hot, if not hotter.  So, if you have hard-to-curl hair like I do, that&#x27;d be another reason to snag this wand as opposed to a different brand (I tried both Remington and Conair wands, and neither one gave me as long-lasting curls as this Bed Head one).&lt;br /&gt;3. Its price (at least for what Amazon is currently selling it at, which I know may change over time) is about five to ten bucks cheaper than the wands I&#x27;ve purchased at retailers.  Who doesn&#x27;t love a bargain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Like I said, this wand is close to--but not completely--perfect.&lt;br /&gt;1. Here&#x27;s the most noticeable downside: because of its baseball-bat shape, each lock of hair that you curl will be tightest up by your scalp (assuming you wrap the entire lock).  I&#x27;ve found that after curling my whole head, I tend to end up with some kinky curls that won&#x27;t lie flat and thus make my head&#x27;s shape look funny.  I&#x27;ve experimented with a few solutions to this; I tried only wrapping about 2/3 of each lock around the wand so that the hair closest to my scalp doesn&#x27;t even get any heat.  Problem with this method is that you can easily tell where the curl starts because suddenly you go from straight hair to a pretty tight curl.  The method I&#x27;ve settled on (and it might seem silly, but it isn&#x27;t as much of a hassle as it may sound like) is to go ahead and wrap each lock all the way, and then after the curls have cooled off and rested for a few minutes, use my straightener to tame down the tightest part of the curl (I have bangs that I use my straightener to tame, too, so I&#x27;ve already got it heated up for that purpose).  Since I only do this with the very top layer of curls, it&#x27;s proven a quick, easy solution.&lt;br /&gt;2. A few other minor cons--these don&#x27;t really bother me, but I could see some people being annoyed by them--are that the wand doesn&#x27;t automatically shut off, so you&#x27;d better remember to turn it off yourself or risk doing some serious damage to anything sitting close to it, and the heating glove included with it (which, unless you are a total expert at using a curling wand, you MUST use in order to avoid really painful burns to your hands and/or fingers) is very uncomfortable.  Having tried so many other wands, I realized a while ago that a simple pair of knit gloves (the kind you can get at any superstore for about a buck a pair) does just as good a job of protecting my hands.  Finally, there is nothing built into the shape of this wand&#x27;s base to make it rest on a countertop.  Personally, I&#x27;m actually glad about this, as I used to snag my hair on those rests while wrapping it around my other wands.  I also have had no trouble with the wand rolling off my counter or the heated tip dipping down to the counter to come in contact with anything; the base is heavy enough to balance the weight of the iron part.  I wouldn&#x27;t let the lack of a countertop-rest discourage you from buying this wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m incredibly happy with this curling wand and see myself getting years of use out of it.  If you&#x27;ve been hunting for one, or trying to decide between this model and other wands out there, I say go for this one and (I hope) you&#x27;ll be as pleased with it as I am!le.

            <li> I LOVED this item gives the exact curls I want would defiantly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have other Bed Head curling wands.  I bought this one just to get some different curls to my hair.  It heats up very well.  I have very thick, curly hair, this curling Wand does the curls perfectly.  A different look.  I don&#x27;t use the glove, but it would come in handy for others who are beginners to using a curling Wand.</li>
            <li> Great wand! Works great for beachy curls. It gets very hot! Wear the provided heat glove.</li>
            <li> While I wish the glove that came with it was a little thicker and covered up a little more of my arm, the wand itself is PHENOMINAL! I can pop curls in before I go out for the night, use zero product, and STILL have a great look when I get home at 2AM. I was worried that the wand wouldn&#x27;t curl my hair because of it&#x27;s thickness and I was SO wrong. Plus, the differentiated sizing on the barrel makes for a great effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> Got is a few days after i ordered it , i love it leaves  really nice curls :) the gloves isnt all that good tho but overall im happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Great for making tighter curls. Heat works well and curl stays for hours.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the teardrop shape.</li>
            <li> Just okay, not very easy to use.  The iron is still hot even u wear your gloves on.  It is not too easy to use compare to the typical curling iron / flat iron.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use if you are not used to working with these types of tools.  Also, very, very hot and I experienced a burn on my face, nothing major but should not be used if you are not concentrating on what you are doing.</li>
            <li> This is the best. I love the fun angle of the curls and texture it gives. I can put it in a different way to get a different curl... it&#x27;s basically foolproof.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Heats up fast, makes my hair look awesome.  One of my favorite go to products.  It takes a little time to get a handle of it without burning yourself, but I picked it up pretty quickly by watching a YouTube video.  Great prodcut!</li>
            <li> I have been using a straightener for years to curl my hair, and it works great. my hair is healthy but it gets a lot of breakage. i figured buying a wand would prevent breakage and be a bit less damaging. christ was i wrong. this product is horrible. the narrow bottom leaves you with tight frizzy poodle curls. not what i was hoping for. this product also gets so hot that it left my hair super damaged after one use. my hair is very long, so a wider wand would probably be better for me. unless you are going for an electricuted version of taylor swift, please, save your money!</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and my hair being so long curls great with it! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because they kept telling me it did not include the heat resistant glove so I didn&#x27;t receive one! (Even though it says you&#x27;ll get it in the description)</li>
