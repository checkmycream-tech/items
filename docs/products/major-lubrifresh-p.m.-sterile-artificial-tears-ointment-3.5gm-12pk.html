            <li>I like Gen Teal better.</li>

            <li>I use the LubiFresh PM when I get up in the middle of the night (every night!) and find the packaging allows for easy application (better than the Erythromycin tube) and the ointment is a good consistency.</li>
            <li>Amazon was great about getting it to us in a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>Great price and product for those that need to use daily.</li>

            <li>product doesn&#x27;t run, places in my eyes easily, and does the job very, very well.&lt;br /&gt;After using the first tube of a dozen purchased, I decided to purchase another dozen.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Amazon</li>
            <li>My eye doctor thought this would be good for my dry eyes and he was exactly right.  </li>
            <li>Our fur angels seem to enjoy it in their eyes, it seems to be very soothing to them.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use with a tip that makes application easy and it does not dry out before morning.  </li>
            <li>The price in right.  </li>
            <li>This product has worked as well or better than any of the classic national or store brands available at local drug chains.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;off brands&amp;#34;, and found them to work fine also, but this stuff is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is Priced better than name brands at the local drug stores&lt;br /&gt;There are No proprietary ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I plan on ordering more in the future.  </li>
            <li>and my ophthalmologist prescribed Erythromycin ointment at bedtime which has helped much more than any of the steroid products a former MD suggested.</li>
            <li>This is exactly like Refresh</li>
            <li>I really like the idea and convenience of the large economical pack.  </li>
            <li>Dispenses exactly how much you want without continuing to ooze out of tube.  </li>
            <li>We use these for our special needs 4 year old son who does not blink very well.  </li>
            <li>Seems to dispense better than others I&#x27;ve tried and after a months use had drastic improvement with dry eye symptoms.  </li>
            <li>This unmedicated (pure sterile vasoline)</li>
            <li>So much so that if I forget the lubricant at night my corneas develop scratches and blisters.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is reliable from tube to tube and the price is very competitive.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>What I really like is the tip design of the LubriFresh.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my eyes lubricated the whole night.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have thought of this much sooner.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s cheaper than most other brands.  </li>
            <li>eye ointment is the most economical as it is exactly the same as that sold for humans but is marketed for dogs at a lot less!</li>
            <li>-6488-38 which differs from the main picture of the product which has NDC 0904-5168-38 on the front of the box.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This product cleared up my raw eyelids and removed the burning redness from my eyes better than allergy eye drops.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find a resonably priced eye ointment that works so well.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a couple of months, she is getting the same results as other products that cost much more.  </li>
            <li>but the exact same ingredients.  </li>
            <li>According to the eye doctor, I do no shut my eyes completely when I sleep</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my 95 year old mother.  </li>
            <li>and the old one was made in the USA</li>
            <li>Very noticeable when removing my contacts the following night.</li>
            <li>Some nighttime ointment is watery and completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>The case price is much lower than what we can find in local stores.</li>
            <li>Product was for my 90+-year old mother who needs to keep her eyes moist - it works very well in helping her with her dry eyes.  </li>
            <li>Been using this product for years with tremendous satisfaction and with no quality issues but be careful, seller Royal Meds sent me a different version of this ointment made in Korea with NDC 0904</li>
            <li>Also the tube itself is not the same quality as the old tubes, at least mine weren&#x27;t - I had greater difficulty getting all the ointment</li>
            <li>The expense over the years has been exorbitant, and many of the different products I&#x27;ve used can be very runny, difficult to apply, and wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Not sure if the original product changed or if I was sent a counterfeit batch but stay away from the batch made in Korea as it&#x27;s completely a different lube inside the tube.</li>
            <li>I wish they sold larger tubes as I run out of it often and have to use a lot of it  every night as my left eye does not close completely when I sleep.</li>
            <li>Very comparable to other similar ( and more expensive) items.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply inside the lower lids, but be careful not to squeeze too hard or the product will continue to come out after application.  </li>

            <li> -6488-38 which differs from the main picture of the product which has NDC 0904-5168-38 on the front of the box.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product cleared up my raw eyelids and removed the burning redness from my eyes better than allergy eye drops.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find a resonably priced eye ointment that works so well.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a couple of months, she is getting the same results as other products that cost much more.  </li>
            <li> but the exact same ingredients.  </li>
            <li> According to the eye doctor, I do no shut my eyes completely when I sleep</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 95 year old mother.  </li>
            <li> and the old one was made in the USA</li>
            <li> Very noticeable when removing my contacts the following night.</li>
            <li> Some nighttime ointment is watery and completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> The case price is much lower than what we can find in local stores.</li>
            <li> Product was for my 90+-year old mother who needs to keep her eyes moist - it works very well in helping her with her dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> Been using this product for years with tremendous satisfaction and with no quality issues but be careful, seller Royal Meds sent me a different version of this ointment made in Korea with NDC 0904</li>
            <li> Also the tube itself is not the same quality as the old tubes, at least mine weren&#x27;t - I had greater difficulty getting all the ointment</li>
            <li> The expense over the years has been exorbitant, and many of the different products I&#x27;ve used can be very runny, difficult to apply, and wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Not sure if the original product changed or if I was sent a counterfeit batch but stay away from the batch made in Korea as it&#x27;s completely a different lube inside the tube.</li>
            <li> I wish they sold larger tubes as I run out of it often and have to use a lot of it  every night as my left eye does not close completely when I sleep.</li>
            <li> Very comparable to other similar ( and more expensive) items.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply inside the lower lids, but be careful not to squeeze too hard or the product will continue to come out after application.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Price is great, but the product change makes me rank this much lower than usual.</li>
            <li> This supply will last you a long time, depending on your level of use.  </li>
            <li> Just put the stuff in at night before bed, and the effects last all day long!</li>
            <li> Other tubes have a smaller tip and allow the ointment to curl around as it comes out.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this type of product in my eyes every night for years for dry eye.  </li>
            <li> I buy for my pups dry eyes.</li>
            <li> If your eyes are as dry as mine are, they need the ointment that comes in this product.</li>
            <li> to treat my dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have dry eye</li>
            <li> Use at night at bedtime and helps with dry eye.</li>
            <li> Because I suffer from chronic dry eye, I&#x27;ve had to use eye ointment nightly for twenty years.</li>
            <li> Use nightly because of severe dry eye.  </li>

            <li> I wipe my closed eyes with a damp cloth after application to remove the excess.  </li>
            <li> Dry eye is no fun.</li>
            <li> The quality is the same for less than half the price.</li>
            <li> This ointment works as well as any other ointment which I have used.  </li>
            <li> Four stars due to the spikes around the lid edge.</li>
            <li> Of course, not many meet the low cost of the Lubrifresh, but</li>
            <li> This stuff works just as well as any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I prefer other brands, but I don&#x27;t want to pay $14</li>
            <li> For the past several years, my dry eyes have given me problems with my gas-permeable hard contact lenses.</li>
            <li> Breaking the seal &amp; trying to get the band off is not fun, nor is squeezing the last bit out while trying to avoid those little pricks.&lt;br /&gt;After using these for a few years, I&#x27;m finally tired enough of it to be searching for an alternative.</li>
            <li> and there is less irritation...</li>
            <li> Previously purchased this product from my pooch&#x27;s vet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit softer than Refresh</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND USES THIS LUBE EVERYDAY 3 AND 4 TUBES.  </li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t messy at all.</li>
            <li> No huge air bubbles in the tube.  </li>
            <li> Anyhow, that major brand was quite expensive, so I looked for a less expensive similar product, and found these.</li>
            <li> It is also much less expensive that similar products I have bought and used.</li>
            <li> I used this product daily before bed to help prevent painful dry eye during the night.  </li>
            <li> This product at least gives you another option.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and it eliminates my need for regular artificial tears throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> TOO SMALL, VERY HARD TO SQUEEZE OUT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less expensive than &amp;#34;human&amp;#34; eye lube and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed the the concentration percentages were different than what we were using.</li>
            <li> went to the opthamalogist as I thought the dystrophy was getting worse.  </li>
            <li> For years I bought the expensive stuff, in the stores, until it occurred to me that it might be sold on Amazon, in bulk!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that Puralube is no longer around.  </li>
            <li> Awfully gooey.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My eye doctor thought this would be good for my dry eyes and he was exactly right.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The price is good Since i have red Eye it Helps a lot I would recomend this to everyone Very Good</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t go to bed without some kind of eye lubricant you will like this product.  I have suffered extreme dry eye for years because my eyes don&#x27;t close all the way in spite of three surgeries to correct the problem  So much so that if I forget the lubricant at night my corneas develop scratches and blisters.  This product relieves those problems because of how moisturizing it is.  It is easy to use with a tip that makes application easy and it does not dry out before morning.  The consistency is reliable from tube to tube and the price is very competitive.  If you don&#x27;t want to pay $10 a tube at Walmart for eye gel, this is the place to buy.  The quality is the same for less than half the price. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this type of product in my eyes every night for years for dry eye.  This is an exceptional price for this product and the ointment does the job very well.</li>
            <li> This is really good ointment. I use it often. It keeps my eyes moist and the consistency is good. Not watery like most combination ointments. Thank you.</li>
            <li> excellent quality and price</li>
            <li> Not runny like some eye ointments.  No huge air bubbles in the tube.  Dispenses exactly how much you want without continuing to ooze out of tube.  Best value for this type of product that I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> TOO SMALL, VERY HARD TO SQUEEZE OUT</li>
            <li> I rely on lubricating eye relif at night just before going to bed.  It is great for someone with dry eyes.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find a resonably priced eye ointment that works so well.  I will buy this lubricant again.</li>
            <li> I buy for my pups dry eyes. Works well.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my shar pei. And have been buying this product since he was a puppy (he is now 5) and we buy this about 3 times a year. It works great!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, price is reasonable, plus and timely delivery.  No complaints and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Just what I need for bargain price,</li>
            <li> This was a very good product at a great price.  I bought it for my Pug, who has dry-eye syndrome and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> If your eyes are as dry as mine are, they need the ointment that comes in this product. Personally, I use it all of the time, not just at night. The amount of product needs to be moderated for daytime use because the oil causes blurriness, but in time and with experience, this is not a problem and my eyes thank me for it!</li>
            <li> It works for me. The product was delivered on time as promised.</li>
            <li> to treat my dry eyes.  According to the eye doctor, I do no shut my eyes completely when I sleep so this keeps them lubricated and there is less irritation...</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well, and it is a good price. I wish they sold larger tubes as I run out of it often and have to use a lot of it  every night as my left eye does not close completely when I sleep. Dry eye is no fun.</li>
            <li> We would recommend this product. We run a spay/neuter clinic for feral cats and use this product for our surgeries. Very comparable to other similar ( and more expensive) items.</li>
            <li> i have very dry eyes and need to lubricate them nightly.  This product does the job well and it&#x27;s cheaper than the named brands</li>
            <li> Bought for my dog who has eye issues. Product works well and is easy to apply. Product spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t stay bunched up. Quick delivery. Good packaging.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND USES THIS LUBE EVERYDAY 3 AND 4 TUBES.  BEST PRICE I HAVE EVERY FOUND IT FOR.  LIKE TO SAVE MONEY.</li>
            <li> This product has worked as well or better than any of the classic national or store brands available at local drug chains.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 95 year old mother.  After using it for a couple of months, she is getting the same results as other products that cost much more.  I have now reordered and will continue to provide her with this product.</li>
            <li> great product and fast service.</li>
            <li> This is Priced better than name brands at the local drug stores&lt;br /&gt;There are No proprietary ingredients&lt;br /&gt;And Works fine</li>
            <li> I order this product all the time. The product is excellent at a great price.I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that Puralube is no longer around.  It was 1/4 the price of what&#x27;s on the shelves at the pharmacy but the exact same ingredients.  This product at least gives you another option.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at very good price.&lt;br /&gt;I need to use this daily so am pleased to have a good source.</li>
            <li> I use a tube a week. It&#x27;s much less expensive than &amp;#34;human&amp;#34; eye lube and works just as well. If it&#x27;s good enough for my schnauzer, it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Superb product. Closest product to Allergan Refresh Lacri-Lube Lubricant Eye Ointment for a fraction of the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT UPDATE (June 2016): Been using this product for years with tremendous satisfaction and with no quality issues but be careful, seller Royal Meds sent me a different version of this ointment made in Korea with NDC 0904-6488-38 which differs from the main picture of the product which has NDC 0904-5168-38 on the front of the box. I pulled one of the original ones labeled NDC 0904-5168-38 that I had stored away and the old one was made in the USA but this Korean batch stings my eyes beyond belief forcing me to return the entire case as it&#x27;s unusable. The packaging is different and so is the labeling despite looking identical. Not sure if the original product changed or if I was sent a counterfeit batch but stay away from the batch made in Korea as it&#x27;s completely a different lube inside the tube. Look for the NDC 0904-5168-38 version of the product. I&#x27;ll order another batch and hope I get the original product again.</li>
            <li> This product has worked nicely for two of our schitzus fur angels.  I really like the idea and convenience of the large economical pack.  Our fur angels seem to enjoy it in their eyes, it seems to be very soothing to them.</li>
            <li> Could not sleep (or wake up with my eyes OK) without it.</li>
            <li> This is what the vet said we could use for our dog&#x27;s eyes.  Works great.  We will be using on an ongoing basis and will reorder when we need it.</li>
            <li> Another great buy from Amazon. My eyes and lids were in need of a soothing ointment after over-using allergy eye drops this summer. This product cleared up my raw eyelids and removed the burning redness from my eyes better than allergy eye drops. Using this ointment when I go to bed totally eliminated the need for eye drops.</li>
            <li> This ointment works as well as any other ointment which I have used.  The price in right.  Why pay more?</li>
            <li> For the past several years, my dry eyes have given me problems with my gas-permeable hard contact lenses. I tried using the standard OTC eye lubricant drops but the chemicals in those drops actually caused me problems with dizziness, etc. Finally my opthamologist gave me a sample of a very simple lubricant that was made of only mineral oil and petroleum get. It worked wonderfully - much better than any drops or gel drops I had tried. Just put the stuff in at night before bed, and the effects last all day long! Very noticeable when removing my contacts the following night. Anyhow, that major brand was quite expensive, so I looked for a less expensive similar product, and found these. This works just as well for 1/3 the cost! Same stuff! Nice to be able to save my eyes without putting chemicals into them!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and great price, much better value than buying one at a time from my vet.</li>
            <li> Product was for my 90+-year old mother who needs to keep her eyes moist - it works very well in helping her with her dry eyes.  The price is much better than the name brands, too.  Amazon was great about getting it to us in a short period of time.  Great experience!</li>
            <li> I use this nightly and the quality easily matches products costing twice as much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than most sold in drug stores!  So worth it!</li>
            <li> We use these for our special needs 4 year old son who does not blink very well.  This ointment has helped keep his eyes moist so he does not get abrasions.</li>
            <li> Great for prebath ointment in dog&#x27;s eyes to protect from any soap irritation</li>
            <li> tried as substitute for rugby product.  like rugby better</li>
            <li> The product is what it was advertised to be. Some nighttime ointment is watery and completely ineffective. This was great and I plan on ordering more in the future.  The shipping was great too; it came in two days.  Kudos for the product and company. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have dry eye and my ophthalmologist prescribed Erythromycin ointment at bedtime which has helped much more than any of the steroid products a former MD suggested. I use the LubiFresh PM when I get up in the middle of the night (every night!) and find the packaging allows for easy application (better than the Erythromycin tube) and the ointment is a good consistency. Pricing on this is good which, if you are a nightly user, is an important consideration. I find one tube lasts about two weeks but gets a bit more difficult to squeeze out towards the end....same with the Erythromycin though so it is not a design issue.&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/ 2015 Still my go-to product. I tried another, thicker ointment which I liked, but returned to LubiFresh PM because, overall, it is the best value for a nightly user.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good buy and I like the product.</li>
            <li> just as good as Refresh PM</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great price point.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  This is exactly like Refresh but at a much better price.  Use at night at bedtime and helps with dry eye.</li>
            <li> Good price, perfect for my dog.</li>
            <li> Four stars due to the spikes around the lid edge. Breaking the seal &amp; trying to get the band off is not fun, nor is squeezing the last bit out while trying to avoid those little pricks.&lt;br /&gt;After using these for a few years, I&#x27;m finally tired enough of it to be searching for an alternative. Of course, not many meet the low cost of the Lubrifresh, but oh well...</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t keep my eyes as moist as some of the others out there.  Good price</li>
            <li> Because I suffer from chronic dry eye, I&#x27;ve had to use eye ointment nightly for twenty years. The expense over the years has been exorbitant, and many of the different products I&#x27;ve used can be very runny, difficult to apply, and wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t run, places in my eyes easily, and does the job very, very well.&lt;br /&gt;After using the first tube of a dozen purchased, I decided to purchase another dozen.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Amazon - you&#x27;re always my go-to site for value and quality.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this before and am still pleased with all aspects of the purchase and quality of the product.  Count me as a faithful customer for this ointment!</li>
            <li> Use nightly because of severe dry eye.  Seems to dispense better than others I&#x27;ve tried and after a months use had drastic improvement with dry eye symptoms.  Great price and product for those that need to use daily.</li>
            <li> Awfully gooey.  Stains the pillowcase.  I like Gen Teal better.</li>
            <li> I loved how cheap the product price was and that I was able to order it in bulk with free shipping. I ordered it because it said compare to Refresh pm like our son&#x27;s tube at home. I was disappointed the the concentration percentages were different than what we were using. We are still able to use it though!</li>
            <li> The eye ointment works well. I have used this brand before and find it meets my needs. This was a special price offer.</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry eyes.  I use it every night and it eliminates my need for regular artificial tears throughout the day.  I have a history of pterygium growths in both eyes and I really believe this product slows their growth and retains good moisture in the eyes.  It&#x27;s easy to apply inside the lower lids, but be careful not to squeeze too hard or the product will continue to come out after application.  The case price is much lower than what we can find in local stores.</li>
            <li> Decent product and the best price I could find on the internet</li>
            <li> Buy all the time. Have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I used this product daily before bed to help prevent painful dry eye during the night.  It works. It is simple in composition and straight-forward, sterile, with no side effects. It is also much less expensive that similar products I have bought and used.</li>
            <li> I use this eye ointment on my pug.  She does not have any moisture at all in her eyes and this product works great to keep her eyes moisturized.</li>
            <li> This stuff works just as well as any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s a little bit softer than Refresh P.M., if that makes any difference.  I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;off brands&amp;#34;, and found them to work fine also, but this stuff is my favorite.  Yes, it&#x27;s cheaper than most other brands.  What I really like is the tip design of the LubriFresh.  It makes it easy to get the ointment where you want it!  Other tubes have a smaller tip and allow the ointment to curl around as it comes out.  That&#x27;s fine if you want ointment all over your eyelashes.  I&#x27;ll be buying this from now on.</li>
            <li> Great product and price. Our English Bulldog has &amp;#34;dry eyes&amp;#34; so using these on a daily basis helps his eyes stay moist and help us with cost savings.</li>
            <li> This unmedicated (pure sterile vasoline) eye ointment is the most economical as it is exactly the same as that sold for humans but is marketed for dogs at a lot less!</li>
            <li> This is the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Excellent for and out of this world price!</li>
            <li> Keeps my eyes lubricated the whole night. Has an excellent applicator that doesn&#x27;t come spilling out of the tube. Isn&#x27;t messy at all.</li>
            <li> I have corneal dystrophy, and have to have ointment at night to prevent corneal erosion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the opthamalogist as I thought the dystrophy was getting worse.  Didn&#x27;t know until after the exam that it is the ointment.  I came home to check it all out, and found the ingredient change, without even letting the consumer know.  Shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This used to be a great product, until the ingredients changed lanolin alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I have 12 boxes left of the 36 I initially purchased, how do I return the unused items?  Also the tube itself is not the same quality as the old tubes, at least mine weren&#x27;t - I had greater difficulty getting all the ointment out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is great, but the product change makes me rank this much lower than usual.</li>
            <li> I use this for my dogs and horses dry eye. Lubricates really well and is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> I have dry eyes (Blepharitis) so I have to put a swath of oil lubricant in my eyes each night.  For years I bought the expensive stuff, in the stores, until it occurred to me that it might be sold on Amazon, in bulk!  Bingo! Yahtzee!  This product is as good as the name brand eye lubricant sold in stores at a much cheaper price.  I wish I would have thought of this much sooner.  I must go through about 2 tubes of this stuff a month.  I&#x27;m working through my second 12pk.  Good deal!  (Someone mentioned it gooping up their pillow case so they don&#x27;t use this anymore.  I actually sleep with a hand towel on my pillowcase to avoid getting that ointment or mascara residue on it.  The trials of using eye makeup when using ointment now that&#x27;s a bit of a nightmare, isn&#x27;t it.)</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.  I prefer other brands, but I don&#x27;t want to pay $14+ per tube of eye ointment.  This supply will last you a long time, depending on your level of use.  I use it 1-3 times per day.  I wipe my closed eyes with a damp cloth after application to remove the excess.  It lasts longer than the eye drops.  I have severe dry eyes.</li>
            <li> Previously purchased this product from my pooch&#x27;s vet. So glad to be able to purchase from Amazon.com in bulk quantity, which is a money saver for me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and receipt Package arrived in good shape. Best price I could find on this product as long as you will need a twelve pack.</li>
            <li> Loved it, just like refresh PM, but much cheaper</li>
            <li> Great price, works well.  Arrived in a timely fashion and in excellent condition.</li>
