            <li>Bottle has a slow release cap so its easy to control.</li>
            <li>The only thing is, if you use this product daily, use it sparingly because a little goes a long way; also, you&#x27;d have to shampoo your hair more often if used daily.  </li>
            <li>The bottle I received was rancid (the oil was so old it rotted) and was a different color than regular Kemi Oyl.  </li>
            <li>This product left her hair a greasy mess that smelled terrible-little better than plain cooking oil.</li>

            <li> Almost the same rating, but PINK hair product(S) would run out way before Kemi OYL would...</li>

            <li> This product is the only that I find actually does what and oil is supposed to do, and that is soften hard skin.</li>
            <li> and PINK does not have the staying power like KEMI OYL does.</li>
            <li> Plan on getting again when I&#x27;m out in a few months</li>
            <li> once applied, usually after a shower or bath Kemi Oyl  soaks into the skin and does not leave a greasy oil mess.  </li>
            <li> After washing my hair I use 3-5 small drops of KEMI OYL.</li>
            <li> Also, the product did not feel or smell like Kemi Oyl -- I was not able to use it.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this product in my area</li>
            <li> As we age and our skin loses its resiliency  </li>
            <li> I found it again but it was expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a fake version of Kemi Oyl.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just so you know my status on Kemi OYL, I am a balck male with hair length from skin to 1/2\\&quot; in length (fade style). After washing my hair I use 3-5 small drops of KEMI OYL. It can keep your hair treated all week (Mon-Fri) if you want to. 1 application per hair wash... anything more would be too much. Non-greasey, practically odorless, and application longevity it the perks of Kemi OYL. My wife is Puerto Rican with hair to her bra strap... an 8oz bottle lasts her 4-6 months. I have a 4oz bottle.... It will be over 12 months before I would even think about buying the next bottle :D. Great stuff. I was using PINK hair products prior to KEMI OYL. Almost the same rating, but PINK hair product(S) would run out way before Kemi OYL would...and PINK does not have the staying power like KEMI OYL does.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil on my hair for yrs and I absolutely love this stuff. It makes your hair shiny and soft with a pleasant smell with out feeling really heavy and greasy. I mix it with Jojoba oil and it gives my hair this healthy glow nice moisture without that greasy oily feel to it. If you have not tried it, then take my advice buy it. You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Great product good multipurpose oil</li>
            <li> Love this product. Glad I could find it on amazon in the larger size.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I used it growing up and remembered it leaving my hair soft, shiny and smelling great!  This product left her hair a greasy mess that smelled terrible-little better than plain cooking oil.</li>
            <li> well this oil can&#x27;t  be found in beauty salons, i check NYC every where, no one has it. we love using this product.</li>
            <li> I use to use it a long time ago but it faded out of the stores. I found it again but it was expensive. Buying this way I save money.</li>
            <li> I like using this product right before I flat iron. It&#x27;s moisturizes and creates a beautiful shine that I like.</li>
            <li> i have been a fan of this product for many years a product I will cntinue to purchase for years to come. My shipment took a while thats the only reason I didint give 5 stars.</li>
