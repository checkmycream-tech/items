            <li>It is very good and the delivery is very timely.</li>

            <li>I am glad that I bought this.</li>

            <li>I love this sparkle spray for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Just okay.</li>
            <li>The quality of this spray was better than I&#x27;ve used before trying thus product.</li>
            <li>It is like a fine gold mist, so it is not overpowering in looks</li>
            <li>Nice touch, but comes out fast and strong.</li>
            <li>Even light brown.</li>
            <li>Does not show up unless under sun light.  </li>
            <li>original shipment got lost in the mail.  </li>
            <li>so I used just three quick spurts as I shook my head, anything else</li>
            <li>arrived quickly, as described</li>
            <li>This is fun to use on a special occasion or night out.  </li>

            <li>This makes hair shiny and sparkly without being too much.  </li>
            <li>(liking keeping my hair still) would have been too much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much if any of a &amp;#34;gold dust&amp;#34; effect, maybe a hint of sheen,</li>
            <li>This product does what it is supposed to do really well.</li>
            <li>There are other hair glitters that are better for our needs -- daughter&#x27;s dance recitals, etc.</li>
            <li>The gold is highly reflective and the colir is sophisticated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>High quality and</li>
            <li>Looks like something that would be useful for a much younger person, as it looks like you are wearing glitter.  </li>

            <li> This makes hair shiny and sparkly without being too much.  Wonderful transaction!</li>
            <li> Nice touch, but comes out fast and strong. It is like a fine gold mist, so it is not overpowering in looks, this would work really well with blond hair! Even light brown. Mine is darker brown, with red highlights so I used just three quick spurts as I shook my head, anything else (liking keeping my hair still) would have been too much.</li>
            <li> This is fun to use on a special occasion or night out.  It leaves glitter in your hair and doesn&#x27;t fall out all over the place.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly, as described</li>
            <li> Very small. I don&#x27;t see much if any of a &amp;#34;gold dust&amp;#34; effect, maybe a hint of sheen, but it makes my hair feel oily. Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> This product does what it is supposed to do really well. It is very good and the delivery is very timely. I am glad that I bought this.</li>
            <li> Way too shiny.  Looks like something that would be useful for a much younger person, as it looks like you are wearing glitter.  Good for Halloween.</li>

            <li> This does not hold as well as is promoted</li>
            <li> I love this sparkle spray for my hair.  Everyone comments on it and it smells good too!&lt;br /&gt;My original shipment got lost in the mail.  The Beauty Source reshipped them immediately and responded to my emails without delay.  They were awesome!!</li>

            <li> The bottle I recieved doesn&#x27;t even look the same, and it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;pearl shimmer&amp;#34;, which is actually just a shine to my hair. I&#x27;m livid1</li>
            <li> The quality of this spray was better than I&#x27;ve used before trying thus product.The gold is highly reflective and the colir is sophisticated.&lt;br /&gt;I wore it during a roller derby bout and it lasted well past the bout sad after party, but was still easy to wash off later. The bottle is aerosol and I would like that to be changed and the quantity is low. I dusted my arms and 4 of my teammates&#x27; arms before the bottle was empty.High quality and I recommend it for that reason.</li>
