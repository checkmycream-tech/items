            <li>This is the best Mascara.</li>
            <li>Service was excellent.  </li>
            <li>BUT, that being said, if it worked great than the two-part process wouldn&#x27;t be an issue!  </li>
            <li>THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST MASCARAS EVER...</li>

            <li>I am so happy my items was shipped to me with no problem.</li>
            <li>this mascara is great but starts to irritate me towards the end of the day.</li>

            <li>I was looking for a good, inexpensive mascara and the ratings on this one were good.  </li>
            <li>A+ Quick shipping, great product for great price.</li>
            <li>but SO glad I was able to find it on Amazon!!  </li>
            <li>I love this product because of the primer and mascara!</li>
            <li>This stuff will not come off, until you are ready to take it off with either soap and water or makeup remover and the best part you never need to do touch ups during the day.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, and am buying more before it goes away!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find this still available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love how it has to application brushes</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>From what I understand this product has been discontinued, so I was pleased to find it online.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t find in stores any more.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I love this mascara..</li>
            <li>otherwise i love this mascara..</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;m able to get them somewhere.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite mascara for years.</li>
            <li>I love Maybelline products</li>
            <li>But seriously, I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara, the primer thickens and lengthens lashes making the mascara work even better.</li>
            <li>wife love it.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t clump easily.</li>
            <li>easy to take out with makeup remover cloth.</li>
            <li>i definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a mascara that does not clump, does not run and will make your lashes beautiful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of mascaras over the years, and every time I try a new one, I find it not to be as good as this one.</li>
            <li>The gold and black XXL Pro is much better!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It seems to go on just fine without it.</li>
            <li>you for making it available on line.</li>
            <li>Once the white kind dries, putting on the mascara over keeps the eyelashes separated, and stays on All Day!.  </li>
            <li>This mascara coats lashes evenly and goes on super smooth...</li>
            <li>2) putting on the white conditioner first works great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of mascaras in my day, but none of them have made my eyelashes so full and voluminous.</li>
            <li>I have ling lashes and love to wear mascara, aside from being a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li>lasts a good amount of time and good black long eyelash mascara to wear out even at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that nylon bristles get more product on my lashes, separate, add good volume, and lengthen much better than the short bristled hard plastic brushes do.</li>
            <li>This is good mascara if you just want dark lashes</li>
            <li>like there is to little&lt;br /&gt;mascara and drys up very fast..</li>
            <li>i love the brush because it gets every tiny lash.</li>
            <li>(regaardless of whether it&#x27;s 1 or 2 (you are supposed to use side 1 first, then</li>
            <li>First of all, I dont like two part mascara, but that&#x27;s my fault for maybe not reading the description.  </li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on my lashes even though I don&#x27;t think my lashes are long.</li>
            <li>Got to me fast</li>
            <li>I really prefer the curl brush</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>VERY UPSETTING</li>
            <li>This mascara doesn&#x27;t flake off throughout the day, and it really does at lots of volume.</li>
            <li>i think because it really dries up to stay in place and makes me want to rub my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love that one end is primer and the other mascara.</li>
            <li>I think if you like long lashes without putting fake ones on this is great for you!</li>
            <li>I have very sparse lashes and found that using the white first extends my lashes to 3 times the length.</li>
            <li>If you use the white part first</li>
            <li>BUT PER USUAL WHEN YOU LOVE A PRODUCT, THE MANUFACTURER TAKES IT OFF THE MARKET..</li>
            <li>Because it does stick to lashes so well, isn&#x27;t drying, and is rich &amp; dark, it can take some effort to get it all off at night.</li>
            <li>I just it was an old product and died.</li>
            <li>Builds volume well yet naturally and doesn&#x27;t flake off.</li>
            <li>different but using the white section first</li>
            <li>really makes a difference my lashes are twice as long and their is no clumping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very wet so half of the mascara ended up at the top of my eyelids, so i was having to wipe it off for the next 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>So sorry the company discontinued this amazing product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s double ended, you first use the white to elongate your lashes, and then the black to complete the look.</li>
            <li>No other compares to how it actually improves my lashes.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;Apparently Amazon is against haiku and that wasn&#x27;t long enough.  </li>
            <li> I found that the product seems old and dried out.....will not use again.....</li>
            <li> I use the primer end on my upper lashes and the black end on both sets.  </li>
            <li> I find that it works really well to thicken thin eye lashes without making them look like they are over done with mascara.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I love the base side, and don&#x27;t ever end up actually using it.</li>
            <li> but one end was empty and the other end is almost.  </li>
            <li> Closer but not exact.  </li>
            <li> I like the black/black formula not the stuff like this that has a white first base then to be covered with black.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to find it where we live however.</li>
            <li> Packaging was broken when product was received.</li>
            <li> So sorry it is out of production!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I hate I can&#x27;t find it in the store</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed that Maybelline has discontinued it!</li>

            <li> It makes my eyes pop and my eyelashes thicker, bigger, blacker and XXL longer. I love how it has to application brushes</li>
            <li> I found that the product seems old and dried out.....will not use again.....did not work like others did....service was great though....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of mascaras in my day, but none of them have made my eyelashes so full and voluminous. It&#x27;s double ended, you first use the white to elongate your lashes, and then the black to complete the look. And, boy when they say water poof, they weren&#x27;t kidding! This stuff will not come off, until you are ready to take it off with either soap and water or makeup remover and the best part you never need to do touch ups during the day. I have never had my eyelashes look so pretty, i wear it everyday and get compliments on it all the time! i definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a mascara that does not clump, does not run and will make your lashes beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have ling lashes and love to wear mascara, aside from being a professional makeup artist. This is one of the best mascarascI have used on myself, I love it!</li>

            <li> I like the black/black formula not the stuff like this that has a white first base then to be covered with black. UGH</li>
            <li> They stopped selling this in a store that I always buy it from so I found it on Amazon and started buying it. This is the best Mascara. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. No other compares to how it actually improves my lashes.</li>

            <li> A+ Quick shipping, great product for great price. I like that it can be removed with soap and water instead of and will three cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is good mascara if you just want dark lashes but there is no volume. Otherwise this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I love this product because of the primer and mascara! Works great!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this. Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore</li>
            <li> I picked this up in a bargin bin, and am a big convert!  If you use the white part first (regaardless of whether it&#x27;s 1 or 2 (you are supposed to use side 1 first, then 2) putting on the white conditioner first works great.  Once the white kind dries, putting on the mascara over keeps the eyelashes separated, and stays on All Day!.  I love this mascara, and am buying more before it goes away!</li>
            <li> Closer but not exact.  Service was excellent.  Prompt shipping, Fair price.  I might get this one again.  I don&#x27;t quite feel the lengthener is quite the same as the one I purchased at the drugstores.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good, inexpensive mascara and the ratings on this one were good.  First of all, I dont like two part mascara, but that&#x27;s my fault for maybe not reading the description.  BUT, that being said, if it worked great than the two-part process wouldn&#x27;t be an issue!  This mascara isn&#x27;t lengthening OR thickening - my lashes looked like 10 skinny spider legs.  It&#x27;s also very wet so half of the mascara ended up at the top of my eyelids, so i was having to wipe it off for the next 30 minutes. Horrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this everywhere...but one end was empty and the other end is almost.  I just it was an old product and died.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite mascara for years. I have very sparse lashes and found that using the white first extends my lashes to 3 times the length. I can finally look awake in the morning.  So sorry the company discontinued this amazing product but SO glad I was able to find it on Amazon!!  I plan on ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline products but this one did not impress me at all! It dried our fast and did not give me the promised XXL lashes.</li>
            <li> I looked all over for this product and was so happy when I found it here. I am so happy my items was shipped to me with no problem.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this mascara. Loves it. It is impossible to find it where we live however. Amazon to the rescue!</li>
            <li> My fave mascara&lt;br /&gt;Why oh why discontinued??&lt;br /&gt;Cried, then found it here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently Amazon is against haiku and that wasn&#x27;t long enough.  But seriously, I love this mascara.  I use the primer end on my upper lashes and the black end on both sets.  Builds volume well yet naturally and doesn&#x27;t flake off.</li>
            <li> The gold and black XXL Pro is much better!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find this still available on Amazon.  I find that it works really well to thicken thin eye lashes without making them look like they are over done with mascara.  Hope Maybelline will still make it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Packaging was broken when product was received.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST MASCARAS EVER...BUT PER USUAL WHEN YOU LOVE A PRODUCT, THE MANUFACTURER TAKES IT OFF THE MARKET..SO YOU CAN NO LONGER GET IT...VERY UPSETTING</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of mascaras over the years, and every time I try a new one, I find it not to be as good as this one. I can&#x27;t say I love the base side, and don&#x27;t ever end up actually using it. It seems to go on just fine without it. This mascara coats lashes evenly and goes on super smooth...doesn&#x27;t clump easily. I also like the brush design. I&#x27;ve found that nylon bristles get more product on my lashes, separate, add good volume, and lengthen much better than the short bristled hard plastic brushes do. This mascara doesn&#x27;t flake off throughout the day, and it really does at lots of volume. Because it does stick to lashes so well, isn&#x27;t drying, and is rich &amp; dark, it can take some effort to get it all off at night. A creamy cleanser works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently found out that Maybelline discontinued this item, so if you like it, buy it up where you can!</li>
            <li> So happy to have found my mascara!!</li>
            <li> i didnt care for the primer. I think i prefer to just layer my mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, the primer thickens and lengthens lashes making the mascara work even better. I was VERY disappointed that Maybelline has discontinued it!</li>
            <li> this mascara is great but starts to irritate me towards the end of the day. i think because it really dries up to stay in place and makes me want to rub my eyes. it wont smear unless you rub your eyes. lasts a good amount of time and good black long eyelash mascara to wear out even at night. easy to take out with makeup remover cloth. doesnt clump.</li>
            <li> great product. wife love it.</li>
