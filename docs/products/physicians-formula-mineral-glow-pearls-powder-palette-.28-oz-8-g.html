            <li>I am very pleased and happy to say this is a fantastic product that gives you coverage as well as a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, and this imparts a lovely glow, but I have to use it lightly</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the brush that came with this because the size/shape of the brush wasn&#x27;t what I needed, and I have my own brushes anyway.</li>
            <li>also it&#x27;s a nice amount</li>
            <li>I use beige pearl and I am fair skinned but tan easily</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s best applied with two fingers, or a very soft blush brush.</li>
            <li>It is my new favorite item!!!</li>
            <li>have that perfect hint of natural highlight</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the baked look.</li>
            <li>It is not a highligher - maybe more of an illuminizer?</li>
            <li>i love this</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I like the translucent pearl better for my skin.</li>
            <li>It is a great highlighter and gives a nice natural glow.</li>
            <li>It makes for a lovely, radiant effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two waitresses from the business I work at introduced me to this product, because they both use it and love it.</li>
            <li>and I love, love, love their pressed powder now.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>If your skin is smooth, this will add a nice, youthfull glow.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t to sparkly, more shimmery which I love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>The top layer is strong but not all the underneath layers.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin, like mine too!</li>
            <li>&quot; Really it isn&#x27;t, the powder is just that good, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shimmery and pearly without looking like glitter, goes on easily, and the pan lasts forever.</li>
            <li>It was fine for every day work.</li>
            <li>Very strong and shimmery at first</li>
            <li>I love applying this to my cheekbones, it adds a nice natural glow.</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>I have light skin.</li>
            <li>(And you cannot use it as and eyeshadow as I originally thought - way too light.)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff because of the pretty glow and pearly quality it has.  </li>
            <li>very natural ,soft i really recommend is excellent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this for anyone who&#x27;s smart about how they spend and want and honest review because this was my first time buying this product</li>
            <li>The luminescent glow it gives your face is amazing and soft on your skin.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice soft glow.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think if you have reasonably clear skin (which I get by using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Put makes my face too shiny and it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>Absolutely stunning but natural look!!</li>
            <li>The compact works great, the brush hidden under the tray with the powder in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite translucent, so unless you are super super fair (or possibly super super dark)</li>
            <li>So now I wear it daily, and I get so many compliments on my skin!</li>
            <li>So pretty!  </li>
            <li>You can control the amount of shimmer you apply by using a kabuki, so you can wear it light for day/work and double up for more shine when going out</li>
            <li>such a nice highlighter</li>
            <li>The shimmer isn&#x27;t too noticeable but enough to give a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I loved this product, the color was as expected.</li>
            <li>today my opinion of this product is positive!</li>
            <li>you are looking for more of a classic highlighting product for your eyes, I recommend BeneFit High Beam.</li>
            <li>The product is great, delivery took 3 weeks which was a bit excessive as the seller is in NY</li>
            <li>B00B118D6A Oxy Maximum Action Advanced Face Wash, 5 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>The Youtube video I found showed that you push the top lid all the way back and break part of the plastic (you hear it snap)</li>
            <li>My first day using product and no issues.</li>
            <li>I love this product and definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a glowing finish.</li>
            <li>The only thing I could complain about is that I wish there was more of the product in the container, but</li>
            <li>I got the translucent pearl shade (as I am super pasty pale) and though it is quite shimmery, I liked this product a lot.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin so next time I will go for a cream highligher, but great product.</li>
            <li>Once it is open it is easy to get into from there</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t want that in my body or on my skin.</li>
            <li>, you can just throw a little bit of this product on your cheeks, and people will think your skin is amazing.</li>
            <li>It;s hard to find a good drugstore highlighter</li>
            <li>I just swirl a tiny bit on my kabuki and lightly dust myself</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The color is very neutral.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this thinking it would be a potential highlighter or glow powder, since it looked quite light and shimmery in the pan.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it really isn&#x27;t any use as a highlighter.</li>
            <li>well spent I love it</li>
            <li>low price dupe alternative to Hourglass Ambient Light powders, IF you use this under your foundation, over moisturizer/primer and concealer.</li>
            <li>I really like this highlighter.  </li>
            <li>Can be applied to bridge of nose, indent in lip and middle of chin to give a natural glow on top of your check</li>
            <li>This powder doesn&#x27;t clog pores and gives you a nice finish after using their great base.</li>
            <li>It makes me look brighter and more awake and doesn&#x27;t break out my dry, sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I use to put it on after my makeup, but it definitely looks better mixed.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a highlighter but with sensitive skin as I do!</li>
            <li>highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they make good quality, non irritating cosmetics</li>
            <li>It really helps with dark eye circles and makes you look more awake instantly.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without it</li>
            <li>I put it on over my foundation and it gives a nice subtle glow.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and break out prone skin</li>
            <li>I am pretty savvy at opening things so whomever designed it needs a different job.</li>
            <li>but again, the design is for the birds to first open it.</li>
            <li>I am very pale and this made me look dewy and &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; and smooth, glowing, etc!</li>
            <li>Getting to the makeup is easy though, it is getting the mirror and brush on the 2nd tier of the compact that you have to be careful.</li>
            <li>I use a little more just above my cheek bones, my brow arches and on my nose and chin for a highlighting effect.</li>
            <li>Yes, the $45 brand might be a little better, but I can afford to get one for the car and house, and this is such a luxury.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t cling to any dry patches I may have as long as I use a light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty, subtle glow, but may be more obvious on someone who has actual color to their skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new one but in a different color.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>but then after a few uses it calms down and is a great yet subtle highlighter.</li>
            <li>It does a completely reasonable job for the price, and I like the slightly glowy-but-not-oily effect that it leaves me with.</li>
            <li>I think it really pulls a look together with little effort</li>

            <li> I have very sensitive and break out prone skin</li>
            <li> I am pretty savvy at opening things so whomever designed it needs a different job.</li>
            <li> but again, the design is for the birds to first open it.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and this made me look dewy and &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; and smooth, glowing, etc!</li>
            <li> Getting to the makeup is easy though, it is getting the mirror and brush on the 2nd tier of the compact that you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> I use a little more just above my cheek bones, my brow arches and on my nose and chin for a highlighting effect.</li>
            <li> Yes, the $45 brand might be a little better, but I can afford to get one for the car and house, and this is such a luxury.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t cling to any dry patches I may have as long as I use a light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty, subtle glow, but may be more obvious on someone who has actual color to their skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new one but in a different color.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> but then after a few uses it calms down and is a great yet subtle highlighter.</li>
            <li> It does a completely reasonable job for the price, and I like the slightly glowy-but-not-oily effect that it leaves me with.</li>
            <li> I think it really pulls a look together with little effort</li>
            <li> I ended up watching a Youtube video on the product just to figure it out as there is no clear way to open it on the 2nd level</li>
            <li> It is just the right amount of shimmer and the color is perfect!Its subtle enough to dust all over and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> so I pay for the quality and it lasts a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this for highlighting cheekbones, above brow arch, and at the center of each eyelid.</li>
            <li> I keep trying other brands but come back to this.</li>
            <li> and you do risk breaking the powder when you do, so be careful.</li>
            <li> Used for years though, and like the way it made my skin look but not with that added ingredient in it, no thanks.</li>
            <li> In any event, it is a very sheer, slightly shimmery product that makes my skin look dewy and fresh (not glittery, which I was afraid of).</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way though.</li>
            <li> and it is glued down</li>
            <li> I know some other people had some trouble opening the package to get to the mirror/brush compartment, but I didn&#x27;t have any difficulty with it.</li>
            <li> and I was a little nervous</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I need a little pearly glow at my age!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s for my skin color</li>
            <li> I now wear it every day, usually in the eyes and cheeks area.</li>
            <li> If you have very pale skin like me buy this!</li>
            <li> brought it home and put just a small amount on my cheeks, and I am really obsessed.</li>
            <li> On Amazon I got it about $2-3 cheaper than drugstores and I know its expensive for a drugstore brand</li>
            <li> Ill update if my opinion changes but</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone would be disappointed with this purchase</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I initially purchased this powder to replace the amazonian clay powder made by Tarte. I am very pleased and happy to say this is a fantastic product that gives you coverage as well as a hint of shimmer. I use it everyday. You can control the amount of shimmer you apply by using a kabuki, so you can wear it light for day/work and double up for more shine when going out :) I receive a lot of compliments from others telling me my skin looks \\&quot;flawless.\\&quot; Really it isn&#x27;t, the powder is just that good, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I use beige pearl and I am fair skinned but tan easily and it matches well. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would be.  Will stay with Revlon.</li>
            <li> Very nice highlighter.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Put makes my face too shiny and it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> Have a good texture and a pretty shine!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is just the right amount of shimmer and the color is perfect!Its subtle enough to dust all over and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice soft glow. I apply it under my eyebrows and across my cheekbones.</li>
            <li> Product is good for highlighting cheek bones and each temple.  Can be applied to bridge of nose, indent in lip and middle of chin to give a natural glow on top of your check blush.  Helps sculpt a face.</li>
            <li> I love the baked look. Very beautiful and makes my skin glow. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a 5 was because on the glitter it has in it, I wasn&#x27;t a fan on the glitter. I&#x27;m 28, lol I don&#x27;t do glitter. Still a great product tho.</li>
            <li> I have been using Physicians Formula products for years now. I have bought this powder 3-4 times now. I like this for makeup days and no makeup days. I just swirl a tiny bit on my kabuki and lightly dust myself all over.&lt;br /&gt;  I do this as my last step after foundation or last step after sunscreen when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup. It makes me look brighter and more awake and doesn&#x27;t break out my dry, sensitive, acne prone skin. It also doesn&#x27;t cling to any dry patches I may have as long as I use a light hand.&lt;br /&gt;  I use a little more just above my cheek bones, my brow arches and on my nose and chin for a highlighting effect. I think it really pulls a look together with little effort and I look healthier. On Amazon I got it about $2-3 cheaper than drugstores and I know its expensive for a drugstore brand but they make good quality, non irritating cosmetics so I pay for the quality and it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;  If you found my review helpful please click the &amp;#34;helpful tab&amp;#34;. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Too shiny for my taste but for those who like that extra shine it does deliver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been  searching for a substitute for the now discontinued revlon skinlights, this is beautiful and gives a pearl opalescence finish, Great luminous highlighter! Will purchase again and again!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I normally only wear eye makeup - I never wear foundation, blush, bronzers, or any type of powder on my face. I saw this when I was buying some eyeliners, and I have to admit that I was suckered in by the name and the fact that the product was a shimmery pinkish nude color. I figured if nothing else, I could try using it as an eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought it home and put just a small amount on my cheeks, and I am really obsessed. So now I wear it daily, and I get so many compliments on my skin! It is not a highligher - maybe more of an illuminizer? (And you cannot use it as and eyeshadow as I originally thought - way too light.) In any event, it is a very sheer, slightly shimmery product that makes my skin look dewy and fresh (not glittery, which I was afraid of). So many people have told me I have beautiful skin when I wear this. Honestly, I think if you have reasonably clear skin (which I get by using [[ASIN:B00B118D6A Oxy Maximum Action Advanced Face Wash, 5 Ounce]] - I&#x27;ve gotten maybe five blemishes over the course of the two-ish years that I&#x27;ve been using that product), you can just throw a little bit of this product on your cheeks, and people will think your skin is amazing. I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for more of a classic highlighting product for your eyes, I recommend BeneFit High Beam.</li>
            <li> very natural ,soft i really recommend is excellent i love this</li>
            <li> The product is great, delivery took 3 weeks which was a bit excessive as the seller is in NY and I am in NC. The product was what it is promised to be and works well in providing a nice shimmer that easily blends in with blush and foundation. To open the compact&#x27;s 2nd level you have to practically break the lid by pulling it all the way back so that you can then get a knife to wedge the mirror and brush open. I am pretty savvy at opening things so whomever designed it needs a different job. Getting to the makeup is easy though, it is getting the mirror and brush on the 2nd tier of the compact that you have to be careful. I ended up watching a Youtube video on the product just to figure it out as there is no clear way to open it on the 2nd level and it is glued down so you sit there thinking how do I open this without forcing it? Basically you have to force it and you do risk breaking the powder when you do, so be careful. The Youtube video I found showed that you push the top lid all the way back and break part of the plastic (you hear it snap) and then you wedge a knife in to pop it open. Once it is open it is easy to get into from there but again, the design is for the birds to first open it.</li>
            <li> I got the translucent pearl shade (as I am super pasty pale) and though it is quite shimmery, I liked this product a lot. A little bit goes a long way though. I know some other people had some trouble opening the package to get to the mirror/brush compartment, but I didn&#x27;t have any difficulty with it. I don&#x27;t use the brush that came with this because the size/shape of the brush wasn&#x27;t what I needed, and I have my own brushes anyway.</li>
            <li> I bought this in lieu of translucent powder.  I have very fair skin, and this imparts a lovely glow, but I have to use it lightly or I look almost plastic.  The color is very neutral.  I use a bit on my eyelids in place of heavier eye shadow, and then put some on as a highlighter. It&#x27;s a pretty, subtle glow, but may be more obvious on someone who has actual color to their skin.</li>
            <li> I just want alittle  holiday sparkle, nothing that will make me break out. My first day using product and no issues. I&#x27;m happy w purchase. Ill update if my opinion changes but today my opinion of this product is positive! :) UPDATE: I like this product.  I ordered a new one but in a different color. I got the beige pearl which turns out to be for medium skin. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s for my skin color but I&#x27;ll continue to play w it and give it away should it not work out for me. I like the translucent pearl better for my skin.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful! I am very pale and this made me look dewy and &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; and smooth, glowing, etc!</li>
            <li> You need this. Trust me!</li>
            <li> So I bought this thinking it would be a potential highlighter or glow powder, since it looked quite light and shimmery in the pan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it really isn&#x27;t any use as a highlighter. It&#x27;s quite translucent, so unless you are super super fair (or possibly super super dark) this isn&#x27;t going to affect your skin tone. It&#x27;s also not at all shimmery on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I therefore tend to use it as an over-everything finishing powder. It does a completely reasonable job for the price, and I like the slightly glowy-but-not-oily effect that it leaves me with. I would definitely get this again.</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy using this product. It is a great highlighter and gives a nice natural glow. I have very sensitive and break out prone skin, that has not been an issue using this product. I probably will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use this as a highlighter and it makes my skin glow all day! I love this product and definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a glowing finish. Just lightly brush onto the cheekbones and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> Very strong and shimmery at first but then after a few uses it calms down and is a great yet subtle highlighter. The top layer is strong but not all the underneath layers.</li>
            <li> I love applying this to my cheekbones, it adds a nice natural glow.</li>
            <li> I have been using Physicians Formula creams and make up for a year now. This powder doesn&#x27;t clog pores and gives you a nice finish after using their great base.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a highlighter but with sensitive skin as I do! Absolutely stunning but natural look!! &amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It highlight perfectly. I use it on my chicks and the tip on my nose.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. The best finishing powder for any makeup. An excellent and light coverage and highlighter! I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I switched to Mineral Fusion brand after learning PF puts Yellow 5 in their products. I certainly don&#x27;t want that in my body or on my skin. Its an added ingredient that isn&#x27;t necessary, I will not purchase this again, or any of their products. Used for years though, and like the way it made my skin look but not with that added ingredient in it, no thanks. There are alternatives.</li>
            <li> Its a very light beautiful highlight its not to sparkly don&#x27;t worry it&#x27;s good for pictures or to go out sand have that perfect hint of natural highlight I&#x27;m writing this for anyone who&#x27;s smart about how they spend and want and honest review because this was my first time buying this product and I was a little nervous it&#x27;s money well spent I love it also it&#x27;s a nice amount you don&#x27;t need a lot so it will last it&#x27;s the perfect size I hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> such a nice highlighter and it comes with a mirror and a brush! I put it over my undereye concealer for the extra coverage and it work beautifully. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I use this for highlighting cheekbones, above brow arch, and at the center of each eyelid. It works beautifully. I find it&#x27;s best applied with two fingers, or a very soft blush brush. I&#x27;m a fan of fingers with this product for over foundation. If you want to get a glow all over without sparkles, try using a brush to apply this all over, but UNDER your foundation. It makes for a lovely, radiant effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shimmery and pearly without looking like glitter, goes on easily, and the pan lasts forever. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good low price dupe alternative to Hourglass Ambient Light powders, IF you use this under your foundation, over moisturizer/primer and concealer.</li>
            <li> Two waitresses from the business I work at introduced me to this product, because they both use it and love it. After trying it out once, I went out and bought some the next day. I now wear it every day, usually in the eyes and cheeks area. It really helps with dark eye circles and makes you look more awake instantly. The shimmer isn&#x27;t too noticeable but enough to give a nice glow. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone would be disappointed with this purchase</li>
            <li> I never bought Physician&#x27;s Formula (PF) before and I love, love, love their pressed powder now. The luminescent glow it gives your face is amazing and soft on your skin. Great for sensitive skin, like mine too! I&#x27;ll definitely purchase PF products again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected! Love it!</li>
            <li> Cannot live without it</li>
            <li> Gives my face a healthy glow! Does not break out my skin!</li>
            <li> I do not recommend the medium shade.  The fairer shad worked well, and I like it, but it was a tad sparkly for a staff meeting or presentation.  It was fine for every day work.</li>
            <li> I really like this highlighter.  I put it on over my foundation and it gives a nice subtle glow.  I have very dry skin so next time I will go for a cream highligher, but great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price. It;s hard to find a good drugstore highlighter so I definitely recommend getting this one if you&#x27;re not trying to break the bank.</li>
            <li> I am already on my second compact. I love this product. It is what its supposed to be, highlighter....Not just glitter. I have the translucent, and I definitely recommend it. I use it for eye shadow, cheek bones, brow bones, on my lips... It is my new favorite item!!!</li>
            <li> I loved this product, the color was as expected. For a powder highlighter, this is a great option.</li>
            <li> I love this. Does not give coverage, so if you have blemishes, this is not for you. If your skin is smooth, this will add a nice, youthfull glow.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I keep trying other brands but come back to this. I use mineral powder foundation,  and I apply this to my brush and then dip it in my foundation &amp; apply. It gives that beautiful illuminated glow when I do that. I use to put it on after my makeup, but it definitely looks better mixed. I just hope they don&#x27;t stop making this! The only thing I could complain about is that I wish there was more of the product in the container, but oh well. If you have very pale skin like me buy this!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes you look sun kissed/glowy. It isn&#x27;t to sparkly, more shimmery which I love. I have light skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because of the pretty glow and pearly quality it has.  So pretty!  Makes my skin look flawless over a good liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> Best price for a very nice glowy powder. Yes, the $45 brand might be a little better, but I can afford to get one for the car and house, and this is such a luxury. The compact works great, the brush hidden under the tray with the powder in it. When you open the lid, the lower compartment opens, to get to the brush. It took me a while to figure that out. For the price, this is the best value. I need a little pearly glow at my age!</li>
