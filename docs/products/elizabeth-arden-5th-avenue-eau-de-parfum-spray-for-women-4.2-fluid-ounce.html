            <li>very nice, GF loves it.</li>
            <li>It is a sophisticated fragrance - wonderful for an evening out on the town or a walk to the corner deli.</li>

            <li>IT SMELL REALLY GOOD</li>
            <li>A GOOD BYE PERFUME.</li>
            <li>This is a clean smelling floral that is perfect for day- time wear to the office, church or shopping.</li>
            <li>I ordered this as a gift for someone and am very pleased that it has lived up to the fragrances she has got else where.</li>
            <li>Love it.. and loved the price.</li>
            <li>This fragrance, although made by a very good company (I think - it was in the 50&#x27;s anyway), smells like something an older lady would like.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase, it was what i expected, for me this is an excellent item, thanks.</li>
            <li>I have worn this fragrance since it came out and still love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume,  it smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>My favorite perfume and</li>
            <li>favorite</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I love it and introduce my friends.</li>
            <li>They love it too.</li>
            <li>It had a very reasonable price and it&#x27;s nice to have it shipped to me and avoid the mall altogether.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume since I bought the first bottle more than a year before.</li>
            <li>A feminine and non-obtrusive scent that anyone can enjoy.</li>
            <li>I am constantly asked what I am wearing as others love the smell!!</li>
            <li>My one and only scent...love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>My long quest for a sophisticated scent ends  here!!</li>
            <li>Seems right for every occasion.  </li>
            <li>All right.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I purchased last time at a department store but at a significant discount!!  </li>
            <li>I would definitely return here to get more fragrances.</li>
            <li>That being said, you could also wear this in the evening or for a date to project an innocent but romantic image.</li>
            <li>It has good strength and longevity, so only a couple of sprays are necessary for the day.</li>
            <li>Not so strong as to be offensive, but with a definite scent.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, but it arrived more than half empty, it leaked during shipping.</li>
            <li>My regular perfume thats sweet and not overpowered.</li>
            <li>Classic scent I have been wearing since my teens (now in my 30&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>I look for offers to buy and have it in stock.</li>
            <li>was not able to find it in the stores,but was glad to find it online at such a low price.</li>
            <li>This huge bottle has lasted me years and hardly has a dent in it....</li>
