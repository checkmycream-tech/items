            <li>USE im in love with this</li>
            <li>love all the colors, the colors are pigmented  as well.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed picking colors</li>
            <li>I normally couldn&#x27;t pull off and combining them to create beautiful custom color.  </li>
            <li>but most were appealing to all</li>
            <li>I havent been able to use them</li>
            <li>I just love them all.</li>
            <li>The product appears to be ok but there was no cosmetic bag.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait till I get paid again so that I can buy more.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>The colors are fantastic!</li>
            <li>So many omg  </li>
            <li>29 lip glosses thought it was supposed to be more</li>
            <li>Filled up all of my drawers !</li>
            <li>The variety is so many tht</li>
            <li>I really like its so great</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love that I am able to keep one handy in my purse for quick touch ups</li>
            <li>but there so gorg I&#x27;m not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>Nice array of colors, not sticky, feels nice on your lips and lasts for a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase that I would recommend this to anyone who wants to look fabulous.</li>
            <li>My clients love that I have a huge variety for them to look and choose from.</li>
            <li>Some were light, but I would layer them on top of lipstick which works for me.  </li>
            <li>They really really are just as good quality as MAC.</li>
            <li>I didnt get the makeup case, but got eyeshadow to replace not having the case which was fine.</li>
            <li>The makeup bag is super cute.</li>
            <li>Great colors, long lasting wear, very good product and all received intact upon delivery.</li>
            <li>Wish it was a little darker in color but great variety!</li>
            <li>Can we say love at first sight!</li>
            <li>So great to look at the huge variety and feel that you are set for the entire day!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a complete make-up kit with the works (bright colors, product quality, price, &amp; versatility).</li>
            <li>, always make my lips feel smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Plus, great colors and will last forever!</li>
            <li>Added Bonus: Free Lipgloss</li>
            <li>and if you are experienced with doing your makeup you can make it last.</li>
            <li>All the colors are fabulous.</li>
            <li>bag looks cheap .great</li>
            <li>This product will initially come off as being a great deal, but it is not.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews there were a lot of good and a few not so good.</li>
            <li>Wow, I just loved these lip glosses.  </li>
            <li>Could&#x27;ve definitely done without this shade for sure!!</li>
            <li>I plan on wearing them in numerical order just to have fun!  </li>
            <li>I was excited, but nervous because of the reviews I had read about shattered</li>
            <li>Totally in love with those glosses, Awesome range of colours, some are pigmented some are not, they do not last long but overall really great deal.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>packing could be a little more attractive and the make up</li>
            <li>but they are great and you won&#x27;t need lipgloss for a long time!</li>
            <li>I buy this for the very first time because I was never happy about all the previous one I tried, but this one was excellent perfect.</li>
            <li>The colors are light to dark, have great variety, not MAC but will get the job done, Not a bad product at all.</li>
            <li>This is a true semi-sheer gloss.</li>
            <li>and it is true.</li>
            <li>These came quickly in the mail during holiday season.</li>
            <li>and I can see many more in my future.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty though.</li>
            <li>I was really pleased with that unexpected miracle!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say it enough I LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy your collection as much as I did.</li>
            <li>Some are sheer and some are pigminted, I love the smooth feel.</li>
            <li>These lip glosses are so fun.  </li>
            <li>I love the pigmentation of these, I brought these for my 15 yr old sister who loves lipgloss and lipstick and she adores them, some colors was repeated in my batch</li>
            <li>This is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love this line, love how I received all the colors, I was skeptical at first because of the pics not showing much detail but was so happy when I received them</li>
            <li>great pigment, smooth application, long lasting and</li>
            <li>and so me getting these many colors is useful because I definitely will use them.</li>
            <li>Came super fast</li>
            <li>they are beautiful colors and last a very long time.</li>
            <li>and I knew exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Love glitter, just can&#x27;t get enough of it?</li>
            <li>This is my first NYX buy</li>
            <li>I love using the different lip colors.</li>
            <li>The quality of the each lipgloss is great and long lasting.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the lip glosses not being wrapped, then you will love these, every shade possible.</li>
            <li>This lipgloss is pretty</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it&#x27;s glossy and pretty and the colors show , but eventually it wears out, I have to keep reapplying it every 25 minutes or so, but they are really pretty</li>
            <li>I realize that they&#x27;re lip glosses, but ask yourself &amp;#34;Why would you buy 36 different lip glosses when you&#x27;ll need to actually lay that corresponding color lip stick down first to even see the color?&amp;#34;  Just buy your favorite good quality lipsticks and use one clear or shimmering lip gloss on top.</li>
            <li>in love and the very sparkly makeup bag they came in were a big plus!</li>
            <li>Make-up brush (too big for bottles, but is great for applying concealer or other shadows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they got here on Wednesday, pretty fast, so</li>
            <li>I highly recommend any lip gloss lover to purchase this batch because I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t last long!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I consider myself a pro when it comes to applying make-up, so no false advertisement here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THESE R VERY CREAMY BUT</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>SO I REALLY LIKE IT</li>
            <li>I especially like that these lipglosses are fragrance free because they never feel sticky</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>I love all the different colors the set offers and the gloss they used to make it.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and is not sticky like some other products.  </li>
            <li>first off let me tell you I live in Kuwait which is one of the hottest countries in the world</li>
            <li>Its a decent product for the price...</li>
            <li>I received my package of 36 beautiful shades of NYX Round Lip Gloss yesterday and I&#x27;ve yet to take them out of their separate plastic packaging only because I am in constant admiration of these colors!!</li>
            <li>I just wish there were a few more shades of purple-lavender and silvers.</li>
            <li>and I personally kept a few because I liked them so much.</li>
            <li>How am I supposed to know if these are new?</li>
            <li>so how am i supposed to know it new ????</li>
            <li>I Would buy another 36 if there was a different set available with different colors.</li>
            <li>I love these and the fact that they come in so many colors that I can use them for all seasons and with any outfit!They aren&#x27;t gloopy or nasty and I love how they feel on my lips.</li>
            <li>The main reason for this buy was for the economical value and the wide variety of colors.  </li>
            <li>but I like to have as many shades on hand as possible and sometimes little differences matter.</li>
            <li>(Now, I have used NYX products before, they have always been fav, but I never invested in complete kits like these.)  </li>
            <li>and then I must reapply it, but if I wear it over a lip liner or lip stick it last much longer.</li>
            <li>AMAZON IS USUALLY PROFESSIONAL WITH PACKAGING  AND SENDING OUT REQUESTED  GOODS.</li>
            <li>the old fashion way...</li>
            <li>too many of the same colors were sent i expected to receive all types of different ones instead of two or three of the same</li>
            <li>The cosmetic bag that they mention is of poor quality bag that it not easy on the eyes, but more importantly, doesn&#x27;t even have the capacity to hold 32 colors.</li>
            <li>She generally wears MAC, but she like these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much nicer than I expected for the money.</li>
            <li>These colors are vibrant and really do last a long time.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is not receiving the free makeup bag</li>
            <li>They barely tinted your lips, only the darker one&#x27;s gave some color.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have enjoyed picking colors</li>
            <li> I normally couldn&#x27;t pull off and combining them to create beautiful custom color.  </li>
            <li> but most were appealing to all</li>
            <li> I havent been able to use them</li>
            <li> I just love them all.</li>
            <li> The product appears to be ok but there was no cosmetic bag.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait till I get paid again so that I can buy more.  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> The colors are fantastic!</li>
            <li> So many omg  </li>

            <li> I really like its so great</li>

            <li> but there so gorg I&#x27;m not disappointed at all!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase that I would recommend this to anyone who wants to look fabulous.</li>
            <li> My clients love that I have a huge variety for them to look and choose from.</li>
            <li> Some were light, but I would layer them on top of lipstick which works for me.  </li>
            <li> They really really are just as good quality as MAC.</li>
            <li> I didnt get the makeup case, but got eyeshadow to replace not having the case which was fine.</li>
            <li> The makeup bag is super cute.</li>
            <li> Great colors, long lasting wear, very good product and all received intact upon delivery.</li>

            <li> Plus, great colors and will last forever!</li>

            <li> and if you are experienced with doing your makeup you can make it last.</li>
            <li> All the colors are fabulous.</li>
            <li> bag looks cheap .great</li>
            <li> This product will initially come off as being a great deal, but it is not.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews there were a lot of good and a few not so good.</li>
            <li> Wow, I just loved these lip glosses.  </li>
            <li> Could&#x27;ve definitely done without this shade for sure!!</li>
            <li> I plan on wearing them in numerical order just to have fun!  </li>
            <li> I was excited, but nervous because of the reviews I had read about shattered</li>
            <li> Totally in love with those glosses, Awesome range of colours, some are pigmented some are not, they do not last long but overall really great deal.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> packing could be a little more attractive and the make up</li>
            <li> but they are great and you won&#x27;t need lipgloss for a long time!</li>
            <li> I buy this for the very first time because I was never happy about all the previous one I tried, but this one was excellent perfect.</li>
            <li> The colors are light to dark, have great variety, not MAC but will get the job done, Not a bad product at all.</li>
            <li> This is a true semi-sheer gloss.</li>
            <li> and it is true.</li>
            <li> These came quickly in the mail during holiday season.</li>
            <li> and I can see many more in my future.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty though.</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with that unexpected miracle!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it enough I LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy your collection as much as I did.</li>
            <li> Some are sheer and some are pigminted, I love the smooth feel.</li>
            <li> These lip glosses are so fun.  </li>
            <li> I love the pigmentation of these, I brought these for my 15 yr old sister who loves lipgloss and lipstick and she adores them, some colors was repeated in my batch</li>
            <li> This is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love this line, love how I received all the colors, I was skeptical at first because of the pics not showing much detail but was so happy when I received them</li>
            <li> great pigment, smooth application, long lasting and</li>
            <li> and so me getting these many colors is useful because I definitely will use them.</li>
            <li> Came super fast</li>
            <li> they are beautiful colors and last a very long time.</li>
            <li> and I knew exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Love glitter, just can&#x27;t get enough of it?</li>
            <li> This is my first NYX buy</li>
            <li> I love using the different lip colors.</li>
            <li> The quality of the each lipgloss is great and long lasting.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the lip glosses not being wrapped, then you will love these, every shade possible.</li>
            <li> This lipgloss is pretty</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it&#x27;s glossy and pretty and the colors show , but eventually it wears out, I have to keep reapplying it every 25 minutes or so, but they are really pretty</li>
            <li> I realize that they&#x27;re lip glosses, but ask yourself &amp;#34;Why would you buy 36 different lip glosses when you&#x27;ll need to actually lay that corresponding color lip stick down first to even see the color?&amp;#34;  Just buy your favorite good quality lipsticks and use one clear or shimmering lip gloss on top.</li>
            <li> in love and the very sparkly makeup bag they came in were a big plus!</li>
            <li> Make-up brush (too big for bottles, but is great for applying concealer or other shadows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they got here on Wednesday, pretty fast, so</li>
            <li> I highly recommend any lip gloss lover to purchase this batch because I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t last long!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I consider myself a pro when it comes to applying make-up, so no false advertisement here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THESE R VERY CREAMY BUT</li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> SO I REALLY LIKE IT</li>
            <li> I especially like that these lipglosses are fragrance free because they never feel sticky</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I love all the different colors the set offers and the gloss they used to make it.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and is not sticky like some other products.  </li>
            <li> first off let me tell you I live in Kuwait which is one of the hottest countries in the world</li>
            <li> Its a decent product for the price...</li>
            <li> I received my package of 36 beautiful shades of NYX Round Lip Gloss yesterday and I&#x27;ve yet to take them out of their separate plastic packaging only because I am in constant admiration of these colors!!</li>
            <li> I just wish there were a few more shades of purple-lavender and silvers.</li>
            <li> and I personally kept a few because I liked them so much.</li>
            <li> How am I supposed to know if these are new?</li>
            <li> so how am i supposed to know it new ????</li>
            <li> I Would buy another 36 if there was a different set available with different colors.</li>
            <li> I love these and the fact that they come in so many colors that I can use them for all seasons and with any outfit!They aren&#x27;t gloopy or nasty and I love how they feel on my lips.</li>
            <li> The main reason for this buy was for the economical value and the wide variety of colors.  </li>
            <li> but I like to have as many shades on hand as possible and sometimes little differences matter.</li>
            <li> (Now, I have used NYX products before, they have always been fav, but I never invested in complete kits like these.)  </li>
            <li> and then I must reapply it, but if I wear it over a lip liner or lip stick it last much longer.</li>
            <li> AMAZON IS USUALLY PROFESSIONAL WITH PACKAGING  AND SENDING OUT REQUESTED  GOODS.</li>
            <li> the old fashion way...</li>
            <li> too many of the same colors were sent i expected to receive all types of different ones instead of two or three of the same</li>
            <li> The cosmetic bag that they mention is of poor quality bag that it not easy on the eyes, but more importantly, doesn&#x27;t even have the capacity to hold 32 colors.</li>
            <li> She generally wears MAC, but she like these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much nicer than I expected for the money.</li>
            <li> These colors are vibrant and really do last a long time.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is not receiving the free makeup bag</li>
            <li> They barely tinted your lips, only the darker one&#x27;s gave some color.  </li>
            <li> As I carefully opened the box, I said to myself \\&quot;here we go; I really hope I don&#x27;t have to make a return due to a lemon product.\\</li>
            <li> I live half way across the wold</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that long lasting.</li>
            <li> they actully last long on your lips !</li>
            <li> All the glosses are different, some only slightly so</li>
            <li> Since it is a gift spent 2 hours at craft store looking for something to put glosses in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed quite a few people saying the same thing</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say that is a major complaint.</li>
            <li> Some crazy colors in the full batch</li>
            <li> I only have to apply it a few times a day usually after I eat.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow Kit: Dress-up or dress down</li>
            <li> I plan on buying a separate container just for these because I don&#x27;t want them to get lost in the malay that is my TUB of other glosses!</li>
            <li> Over the past five years, I have spent over $10,000 on beauty products, $7,000 on make-up alone.</li>
            <li> I had a little problem with the shipping</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy</li>
            <li> The glosses are not sticky and are thin enough that I combine sometimes three colors</li>
            <li> WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MISSING TWO?</li>
            <li> Cons: Very sticky, had a bad odor to them.</li>
            <li> Talk about making me look like the walking dead!</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I guess you can say that I am a beauty queen who takes her make-up very seriously.</li>
            <li> Cold, Hard CASH.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and ended up getting rid of the entire set.</li>
            <li> This is truly terrible, not necessarily the product, as I wouldn&#x27;t know, but the company.</li>
            <li> This has upped my lip gloss count to at LEAST 450!!!</li>
            <li> BUT VERY DISAPPOINTED</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I received this package without damage. I love the pack of colors you get. The colors apply on evenly. I definately recommend this set!</li>
            <li> I received my package of 36 beautiful shades of NYX Round Lip Gloss yesterday and I&#x27;ve yet to take them out of their separate plastic packaging only because I am in constant admiration of these colors!! I plan on wearing them in numerical order just to have fun!  This has upped my lip gloss count to at LEAST 450!!! I KID YOU NOT! I own 450 lip glosses!!  I plan on buying a separate container just for these because I don&#x27;t want them to get lost in the malay that is my TUB of other glosses! There&#x27;s not a shade of these that I DON&#x27;T like - and me not being a fan of \\&quot;glitter\\&quot;, I actually don&#x27;t have a problem with some of these that DO have glitter! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! I highly recommend any lip gloss lover to purchase this batch because I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t last long!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so maybe there IS one shade that I just detest and cannot pull off whatsoever - \\&quot;Sand Dune\\&quot;. Talk about making me look like the walking dead! Could&#x27;ve definitely done without this shade for sure!!</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little darker in color but great variety!</li>
            <li> Tons of long-wearing, non-sticky, sheer colors to choose from!  These are high-end quality for drug store prices and I LOVE them!!!!</li>
            <li> This come with many shades that I liked.  Some were light, but I would layer them on top of lipstick which works for me.  The rest I gave away as part of gifts to friends.  I didnt get the makeup case, but got eyeshadow to replace not having the case which was fine.</li>
            <li> THESE R VERY CREAMY BUT NOT A LOT OF COLOR PAYOFF SO WHAT I DO IS APPLY THEM OVER TOP OF MY LIPSTICK TO MAKE THE COLOR POP AND ENLARGE MY LIPS THEY WORK VERY WELL IF U R GONNA APPLY SOMETHING MAYBE EVEN A LIPLINER ALL OVER THE LIP THEN THE LIPGLOSS THEY GIVE U LOTS AND LOTS OF COLORS SO I REALLY LIKE IT</li>
            <li> These came quickly in the mail during holiday season. I was really pleased with that unexpected miracle! Plus the colors are great. I&#x27;m a gogo dancer and so me getting these many colors is useful because I definitely will use them. They really really are just as good quality as MAC. I love em and use them every day!</li>
            <li> Nice array of colors, not sticky, feels nice on your lips and lasts for a reasonable amount of time.  I just wish there were a few more shades of purple-lavender and silvers.</li>
            <li> Let me just first thank Misspinkcat and Amazon for their exceptional product, packaging, and customer service! Over the past five years, I have spent over $10,000 on beauty products, $7,000 on make-up alone. I have purchased beauty products from almost every retailer out there and tried a versatile selection of brand name products. I guess you can say that I am a beauty queen who takes her make-up very seriously. I consider myself a pro when it comes to applying make-up, so no false advertisement here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, my husband wanted to purchase a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift for me and I knew exactly what I needed. I was looking for a complete make-up kit with the works (bright colors, product quality, price, &amp; versatility). I had researched for hours, coming across pricey and monotonous kits, until I discovered the NYX eyeshadow, lipstick, and glitter shade kits. (Now, I have used NYX products before, they have always been fav, but I never invested in complete kits like these.)  So after reading the reviews and deciding to make a $150.00 investment with standard shipping (35 eyeshadow kit, 36 lipgloss kit, 78 eyeshadow kit, &amp; 40 eyeshadow glitter) I was excited, but nervous because of the reviews I had read about shattered eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting only four days, I received my shipment. As I carefully opened the box, I said to myself \\&quot;here we go; I really hope I don&#x27;t have to make a return due to a lemon product.\\&quot; Once the box was open, I noticed that everything was neatly placed and wrapped in bubble wrap; I was relieved and grateful all at the same time.  Now when people refer to these products as \\&quot;crack\\&quot; or \\&quot;magic dust,\\&quot; they&#x27;re not kidding.  Once I tried every color, lipgloss, bronzer, powder, and glitter dust I knew I had made a life-time investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;35 pc. Eyeshadow Kit: Amazing! Glides on perfect, with a variety of colors, and last all day! Good Beginner kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;78 pc. Eyeshadow Kit: Dress-up or dress down, this kitwill offer you everything you need for eyes and cheeks. Can be used for work or play!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;40 pc. Glitter Eyeshadow:  Perfect for the glam girl! Love glitter, just can&#x27;t get enough of it? Then this is a must, believe me it will be one of the best purchases you will ever make! Added Bonus: Make-up brush (too big for bottles, but is great for applying concealer or other shadows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;36 pc. Lipgloss Kit: I especially like that these lipglosses are fragrance free because they never feel sticky, always make my lips feel smooth and shiny. Plus, great colors and will last forever! Perfect for gifts as well. Added Bonus: Free Lipgloss Bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m hooked now, saving a fortune and continue to be impressed with the quality and versatility of these products, the kits are as big as they look don&#x27;t be fooled! I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase that I would recommend this to anyone who wants to look fabulous.</li>
            <li> I love these lip glosses.  A lot of colors look similar, but once applied are quite different!  Great texture and feel on the lips!</li>
            <li> The colors on your lips look just like the pictures. Some have alot of shimmer but it&#x27;s cute. They are not sticky at all! def a must have for the price!</li>
            <li> omg words cant explain how much i love these. great pigment, smooth application, long lasting and its been a year since i purchased....i love you forever lol!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these and the fact that they come in so many colors that I can use them for all seasons and with any outfit!They aren&#x27;t gloopy or nasty and I love how they feel on my lips.</li>
            <li> I love these lip glosses I had a little problem with the shipping but there very pigmented and a nice array of colors I would buy again and good for my kit as well!</li>
            <li> The product came on time. It is also so cute! The pouch turned out quite different though from the picture. But over all I am satisfied.:)</li>
            <li> The colors are light to dark, have great variety, not MAC but will get the job done, Not a bad product at all. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> too many of the same colors were sent i expected to receive all types of different ones instead of two or three of the same</li>
            <li> Some are sheer and some are pigminted, I love the smooth feel.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal and the lip gloss is wonderful!  I love the range of colors and it stays on for quite some time!!  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Totally in love with those glosses, Awesome range of colours, some are pigmented some are not, they do not last long but overall really great deal.</li>
            <li> I like the color variety. So many colors to choose from. My clients love that I have a huge variety for them to look and choose from.</li>
            <li> Love this line, love how I received all the colors, I was skeptical at first because of the pics not showing much detail but was so happy when I received them</li>
            <li> Love these lip glosses. received these yesterday. was packaged really nice all of them were there including the cosmetics bag. I will purchase again. However I will be trying the lip creams next . thank you amazon and Pandora.</li>
            <li> only 6 of the lips gloss had the sealing protection</li>
            <li> I love this all the colors are so nice i will get this again i have a lot to chose what i want&lt;br /&gt;to USE im in love with this</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews there were a lot of good and a few not so good. I got them and LOVE them! I don&#x27;t think I had a repeat of colors at all. The gloss stays on for quite awhile and lasts. It&#x27;s also shiny.</li>
            <li> I like it!! love all the colors, the colors are pigmented  as well. kindv runny, i dont like the fact it dosent smell, not sticky at all so thats a plus.. Its a decent product for the price... :_) i heard that the NYX eye shadows dust are must have, i will be ordering that next an see how it is.</li>
            <li> Quality product. Colors all perfect. Lasting and not sticky. These were part of our wedding shower gift sets for guests. All 80 guests loved them. I would use this product again.</li>
            <li> I just received these in and they are a wonderful addition to my every growing lip gloss collection. The colors are semi sheer, so they work great over a base color (lip liner, or lip stick). The gloss only lasts for an hour max and then I must reapply it, but if I wear it over a lip liner or lip stick it last much longer. I went to dinner with my husband after applying my makeup including an NYX lip gloss in apricot over a lip liner in an almost identical color. It lasted through dinner. These lip glosses are such an awesome buy since they are really good quality item and if you are experienced with doing your makeup you can make it last. There isn&#x27;t a color in the collection that is off putting. They mix well and will match anyones complection. I love that I am able to keep one handy in my purse for quick touch ups and it doesn&#x27;t have to be the same as the one I put on before I leave for work in the am. These are a great way to transform your look from day to night with a shot of color. This is my first NYX buy and I can see many more in my future. The only con of this is the smell but once it&#x27;s on your lips you can&#x27;t smell anything so I can&#x27;t say that is a major complaint. I hope you enjoy your collection as much as I did.</li>
            <li> These lip glosses are so fun.  I have enjoyed picking colors I normally couldn&#x27;t pull off and combining them to create beautiful custom color.  The glosses are not sticky and are thin enough that I combine sometimes three colors and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or uncomfortable. Beautiful and fabulous!  So great to look at the huge variety and feel that you are set for the entire day!</li>
            <li> I love the pigmentation of these, I brought these for my 15 yr old sister who loves lipgloss and lipstick and she adores them, some colors was repeated in my batch but I didn&#x27;t mind,</li>
            <li> Wow, I just loved these lip glosses.  They came packed in groups but I used them like stocking stuffers and they were great. Some crazy colors in the full batch but most were appealing to all and I personally kept a few because I liked them so much.</li>
            <li> GREAT GLOSSES BUT VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I PAID FOR THIRTY-SIX NYX LIP GLOSSES BUT GOT  ONLY THIRTY-FOUR. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MISSING TWO? I PAID FOR THEM TOO? AMAZON IS USUALLY PROFESSIONAL WITH PACKAGING  AND SENDING OUT REQUESTED  GOODS. CAN&#x27;T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS HAPPENED.</li>
            <li> Great price for this item.  My mom for some reason loved this collection.  I gave it to her as a gift.  She generally wears MAC, but she like these.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  They barely tinted your lips, only the darker one&#x27;s gave some color.  I realize that they&#x27;re lip glosses, but ask yourself &amp;#34;Why would you buy 36 different lip glosses when you&#x27;ll need to actually lay that corresponding color lip stick down first to even see the color?&amp;#34;  Just buy your favorite good quality lipsticks and use one clear or shimmering lip gloss on top.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife and once she received it, she loved this item. It arrived before Christmas, but since we were away, I didn&#x27;t receive this until after Christmas. Great colors, long lasting wear, very good product and all received intact upon delivery. Would recommend these lip gloss lip sticks.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money. I love using the different lip colors. Im 14 and i think im set for life!</li>
            <li> The main reason for this buy was for the economical value and the wide variety of colors.  The glosses feel good and they have a pleasant scent as well.</li>
            <li> this is really a great buy every color you need is there ,and I am the lip gloss Queen so for all of you  jump on it can not bet the price</li>
            <li> They arrived quicker than I thought. The makeup bag is super cute. All the colors are fabulous. This has saved me alot of time and money</li>
            <li> A great big thank you to  Misspinkcat and Amazon for their wonderful products, packaging, and customer service. I live half way across the wold so this did take some time to get here,I contacted the seller and the response was instantaneous. When it arrived I was over the moon, first off let me tell you I live in Kuwait which is one of the hottest countries in the world so packaging is VERY important,I got everything promised and the colors are fabulous, I also have the jumbo lip liners so these go great with those, love NYX products, they are a must have, you wont have to spend time looking for colors to match your makeup look, here you have the works.</li>
            <li> Cons: Very sticky, had a bad odor to them. I was very disappointed and ended up getting rid of the entire set.</li>
            <li> AWESOME! I havent been able to use them all yet lol but they are great and you won&#x27;t need lipgloss for a long time! there is literally every color I could ever need in this. they are beautiful colors and last a very long time. great product!</li>
            <li> Beautiful lipgloss I just love them all. I definitely recommend to any lady.  They are the best . Thank you so much</li>
            <li> The product appears to be ok but there was no cosmetic bag.  Since it is a gift spent 2 hours at craft store looking for something to put glosses in.  Feel like I have been ripped off.</li>
            <li> OMG... I love these Nyx lip gloss!  And I got 36 of them.  That means I can wear a different shade every day for over a month!!!  Now that&#x27;s what I call versatile.  These colors are vibrant and really do last a long time.  I have wanted to try Nxy makeup since I started watching the RuPaul show.  I remember that the winner won a lifetime supply of Nyx cosmetics...Wish that had been me!  Guess I will have to get my supply of Nyx the old fashion way...Cold, Hard CASH.  I can&#x27;t wait till I get paid again so that I can buy more.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I love these. ALL OF THEM ARE GREAT. All the glosses are different, some only slightly so but I like to have as many shades on hand as possible and sometimes little differences matter. There are some sparkly ones, some opaque ones, some shimmery some shiny, all very very nice. I Would buy another 36 if there was a different set available with different colors. It&#x27;s so much nicer than I expected for the money. Can&#x27;t say it enough I LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li> I love all the different colors the set offers and the gloss they used to make it. I only have to apply it a few times a day usually after I eat. I will definitely buy this set again. Worth it!</li>
            <li> the colours are great . they actully last long on your lips ! .the packing could be a little more attractive and the make up bag looks cheap .great product anyway</li>
            <li> I purchased this set as a stocking stuffer for the ladies in my family.  They all loved it and wanted to know where/how I purchased so many.  I also purchased one set for myself.  The quality of the each lipgloss is great and long lasting.</li>
            <li> The colors are fantastic! It goes on very smoothly and is not sticky like some other products.  This is a true semi-sheer gloss.</li>
            <li> I wish they were individually wrapped. How am I supposed to know if these are new? The colors are very pretty though. If you don&#x27;t mind the lip glosses not being wrapped, then you will love these, every shade possible. I just can&#x27;t put something on my lips not knowing that others haven&#x27;t used these, or done anything to them. You never know what people will do nowadays.</li>
            <li> Can we say love at first sight! So many omg  in love and the very sparkly makeup bag they came in were a big plus! Came super fast I counted 29 lip glosses thought it was supposed to be more but there so gorg I&#x27;m not disappointed at all! Filled up all of my drawers !</li>
            <li> This product will initially come off as being a great deal, but it is not. I&#x27;ve noticed quite a few people saying the same thing and it is true. The lip glosses are not wrapped or initially packaged. Anyone could have used them and I refuse to take the chance of trying them on, as I don&#x27;t know where they&#x27;ve been. In addition, I did not receive 36 colors, only 32. The cosmetic bag that they mention is of poor quality bag that it not easy on the eyes, but more importantly, doesn&#x27;t even have the capacity to hold 32 colors. This is truly terrible, not necessarily the product, as I wouldn&#x27;t know, but the company.</li>
            <li> I purchased these NYX lip glosses and i couldnt be happier. The variety is so many tht i havent even tested them all out yet and just get them . Its girly heaven!</li>
            <li> I buy this for the very first time because I was never happy about all the previous one I tried, but this one was excellent perfect. I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This lipgloss is pretty but it&#x27;s not that long lasting. When you first put it on it&#x27;s glossy and pretty and the colors show , but eventually it wears out, I have to keep reapplying it every 25 minutes or so, but they are really pretty and I purchased it on Monday and they got here on Wednesday, pretty fast, so if you want something like these glosses you will have to reapply it, but it&#x27;s a good investment if you like lipgloss, you won&#x27;t have to buy gloss for awhile because of all the colors you can choose from! Happy Shopping &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I really like its so great and it smells good I was a little hesitant to buy but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> my shipment came all in one plastic bag non of them hsve plastic packaging so how am i supposed to know it new ????</li>
