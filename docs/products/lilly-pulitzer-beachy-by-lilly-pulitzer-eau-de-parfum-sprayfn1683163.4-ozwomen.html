            <li>AND WELL LIKED</li>
            <li>but i lucked out and liked it.</li>
            <li>When I read the word \\&quot;beachy\\&quot;, I pictured the scent to be tropical - kind of like the smell of a sunblock (like hawaiian tropic).  </li>

            <li>Giving it 3 stars because it makes for a nice room freshener.</li>
            <li>it is a perfect summer scent, its light and has a sweet floral scent.</li>
            <li>It smells great and lasts most of the day without being too strong.  </li>

            <li>the packaging is ADORABLE and I love the scent!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still advertising it to my friends, customers in Viet Nam and most of them love the smell of it!</li>
            <li>Beautiful bottle, very light fresh scent.</li>
            <li>, i need more i am out, my daughter really liked this smell also.</li>
            <li>I own another scent by Pulitzer and love that one, so I took a chance.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled!</li>
            <li>The bottle is beautiful too...too pretty to put away</li>
            <li>and it is easily my #2 fave!</li>
            <li>Soft,  wonderful summer fragrance, have received many compliments.</li>
            <li>A light, springy fusion with a yummy finish that will be sure to provide delicious aromas throughout the whole year.</li>
            <li>it smells very cheap....</li>
            <li>Price was right, bottle is pretty, very happy with the purchase  from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>and then I found it on the website for more than 1/2 off</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing online without smelling it</li>
            <li>This is a delightful and unassuming perfume for daytime, especially well-suited to spring and summer.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a GREAT late spring and definately a perfect summer fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love this parfum.</li>
            <li>It smells refreshing and does have a tropical beachy smell to it.</li>
            <li>I will surely be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li>i just love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I receive many compliments when wearing Beachy.</li>
            <li>The perfume was among the most wanted by Kate.</li>
            <li>Love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I would like the product more if the scent lingered longer than it does&lt;br /&gt;Great for the summer time as well as spring</li>
            <li>I love Lilly Pulitzer patterns</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how many ask me \\&quot;what are you wearing...</li>
            <li>In fact, she gets so many compliments when she wears it.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent</li>
            <li>I keep it out in my bedroom to enjoy the sea glass color of it!</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Truly lovely, like being in a garden on a humid summer morning.</li>
            <li>Not quite like the beach - more like a garden.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li>I had not tested it before but read many reviews on it about how it smelled like the beach.</li>
            <li>Glad I stumbled across it.  </li>
            <li>Very clean, sophisticated &amp; youthful, floral-beachy fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fresh scent, one that&#x27;s very easy to wear, and one that has more staying power than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>more \\&quot;springy\\&quot; than \\&quot;beachy\\&quot;...has a lovely, unusually fresh AND warm combination.</li>
            <li>happy new year</li>
            <li>And to top it off the bottle is super adorable.</li>
            <li>Turns out, you really get a pretty good amount for the price!</li>
            <li>it so easy to order that I did not have a problem.)  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to find a good fragrance that really captures the clean salty air of the beach with a lil twist of suntan oil/ coconut.</li>
            <li>In all, it is a nice floral fragrance, has staying power, more for a mature woman, but it smells nothing like a beach scent should.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is light and is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>People want to know what I am wearing because they like the light scent.  </li>
            <li>so I know she would love it smile</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light floral scent that reminds me of a lightly scented baby powder.  </li>
            <li>She was quite surprised and delighted when she got it since I had to order it on line.  </li>
            <li>I can not say it smells like suntan lotion which is what I was wanting but it is very fresh and summer-like</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, fresh and smells like paradise!  </li>
            <li>Wow what an amazing clean scent!</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to find it on Amazon for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The scent is unique.  </li>
            <li>Sand, surf, fresh air!</li>
            <li>It is a clean, citrusy scent with a hint of summer breeze.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean</li>
            <li>this is a nice clean everyday fragrance, oddly enough, it does smell like the best parts of the beach, it is one of my favorites</li>
            <li>Price is more than reasonable too.</li>
            <li>I loved it from the second I put it on.  </li>
            <li>My friend loved it, I gave it to her as a birthday present.</li>
            <li>On me all I could smell was sweet flowers.</li>
            <li>However, after about 15 minutes of applying to my skin, the floral notes all turned powdery, pungent, and sickly sweet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent, just not what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, but not the scent I was expecting.</li>
            <li>This is a clean fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and will enjoy wearing this scent all summer long.  </li>
            <li>Not very strong, so it&#x27;s nice to wear to work and then spray some more on before going out at night.</li>
            <li>This is a bit too powerful for my taste.</li>
            <li>Nothing fresh and reminds me of grandma.</li>
            <li>I ordered it and it arrived packaged nicely and in just a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I based my reviews on others saying it had a beachy, coconut, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>This is such a nice fragrance that I wear it even in the winter.</li>
            <li>Smells so fresh.</li>
            <li>I love the green and blue print on the box and the bottle will look so beautiful on any vanity.  </li>
            <li>This perfume I can definitely see on a more mature lady; definitely more floral than fresh or fruity.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday, and going out at night!</li>
            <li>Pretty packaging.</li>
            <li>Time to go to the department store and try them first..</li>
            <li>Each year we ask the \\&quot;birthday person\\&quot; to give us a list starting with the item they want the most.  </li>
            <li>So when I got it and smelled it for the first time, I immediately didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>Got it fast and as described!</li>
            <li>I was willing to try it with the reviews I read.</li>
            <li>, I was willing to risk it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this through amazon without smelling it first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty bottle I keep on my dresser</li>
            <li>One of my favorite, this one is for a present</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more from Lilly Pulitzer.  </li>
            <li>It is clean, soft, feminine and enticing.</li>
            <li>, fragarence is lite, clean not heavy, and lasts thru out the day</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t linger as long as I would like, but I just love it so much!</li>
            <li>It smells more powdery and like an old woman rather than young and floral.</li>
            <li>I smell only strong flowers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this perfume at a large Dept Store for twice the price</li>
            <li>I expected I light scent, BEACHY and fresh and summery.</li>
            <li>I really like it, and I feel energized when I spray it on in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or over-powering; it smells like a fresh tropical breeze.  </li>
            <li>I am very picky about what fragrance I wear</li>
            <li>but this is an absolute keeper.</li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t and my husband loves it, says it&#x27;s very feminine.  </li>
            <li>My customers really like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really to find the perfume in the stores</li>
            <li>It actually reminded me of a combination of baby powder and cheap drugstore perfume marketed for &amp;#34;mature women&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t smell quite right, and I&#x27;m concerned that either it is really old or it was exposed to the elements in some way that altered its chemical makeup.  </li>
            <li>With that said, this one was too &#x27;sharp&#x27; for me and overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t live close to any stores that sell this, so I took a gamble and ordered on Amazon, based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I am 34 years old and wanted a fresh beach-like scent, but this scent is way too mature for me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that came from the seller, but most likely it did since it was on the outside and inside of the package.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>if you enjoy smelling like an old lady wrapped in toilet paper, this is for you.</li>
            <li>I am constantly getting compliments on its airy and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth buying, and the scent can only be described as...</li>
            <li>Normally, I really love this scent and was surprised at the low, low price posted for this.  </li>
            <li>Love the sent but it does not last on me very long.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it so much, she wants to wear it also (Christmas present).</li>
            <li>and it literally the exact same product!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ahve actually finished a bottle of perfume!  </li>
            <li>at first i thought it smelt a little &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; for me, but i found if i only put a small amount the scent wears very nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it again, especially at this price for such a large bottle!!</li>
            <li>not heavy.  </li>
            <li>So I gave it to my mom who is 60 years old and she loves it.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of a 1970&#x27;s old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>This was purchased for a very hard to please teen ager and she feel in love with her first gift of a fragrance.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I smelled the bottle - it was truly lovely and complex, with strong white floral notes and a hint of salt/sea spray and a little melon.</li>
            <li>The scent is both clear and a little sweet....</li>
            <li>Beachy doesn&#x27;t smell like suntan lotion or marine notes, it&#x27;s much softer and more complicated.  </li>
            <li>I have barely used this bottle.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> the packaging is ADORABLE and I love the scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still advertising it to my friends, customers in Viet Nam and most of them love the smell of it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle, very light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> , i need more i am out, my daughter really liked this smell also.</li>
            <li> I own another scent by Pulitzer and love that one, so I took a chance.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled!</li>
            <li> The bottle is beautiful too...too pretty to put away</li>
            <li> and it is easily my #2 fave!</li>
            <li> Soft,  wonderful summer fragrance, have received many compliments.</li>
            <li> A light, springy fusion with a yummy finish that will be sure to provide delicious aromas throughout the whole year.</li>
            <li> it smells very cheap....</li>
            <li> Price was right, bottle is pretty, very happy with the purchase  from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li> and then I found it on the website for more than 1/2 off</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing online without smelling it</li>
            <li> This is a delightful and unassuming perfume for daytime, especially well-suited to spring and summer.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a GREAT late spring and definately a perfect summer fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love this parfum.</li>
            <li> It smells refreshing and does have a tropical beachy smell to it.</li>
            <li> I will surely be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li> i just love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I receive many compliments when wearing Beachy.</li>
            <li> The perfume was among the most wanted by Kate.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  </li>
            <li> I would like the product more if the scent lingered longer than it does&lt;br /&gt;Great for the summer time as well as spring</li>
            <li> I love Lilly Pulitzer patterns</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how many ask me \\&quot;what are you wearing...</li>
            <li> In fact, she gets so many compliments when she wears it.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent</li>
            <li> I keep it out in my bedroom to enjoy the sea glass color of it!</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Truly lovely, like being in a garden on a humid summer morning.</li>
            <li> Not quite like the beach - more like a garden.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li> I had not tested it before but read many reviews on it about how it smelled like the beach.</li>
            <li> Glad I stumbled across it.  </li>
            <li> Very clean, sophisticated &amp; youthful, floral-beachy fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very fresh scent, one that&#x27;s very easy to wear, and one that has more staying power than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> more \\&quot;springy\\&quot; than \\&quot;beachy\\&quot;...has a lovely, unusually fresh AND warm combination.</li>
            <li> happy new year</li>
            <li> And to top it off the bottle is super adorable.</li>
            <li> Turns out, you really get a pretty good amount for the price!</li>
            <li> it so easy to order that I did not have a problem.)  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a good fragrance that really captures the clean salty air of the beach with a lil twist of suntan oil/ coconut.</li>
            <li> In all, it is a nice floral fragrance, has staying power, more for a mature woman, but it smells nothing like a beach scent should.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is light and is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> People want to know what I am wearing because they like the light scent.  </li>
            <li> so I know she would love it smile</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light floral scent that reminds me of a lightly scented baby powder.  </li>
            <li> She was quite surprised and delighted when she got it since I had to order it on line.  </li>
            <li> I can not say it smells like suntan lotion which is what I was wanting but it is very fresh and summer-like</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, fresh and smells like paradise!  </li>
            <li> Wow what an amazing clean scent!</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to find it on Amazon for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The scent is unique.  </li>
            <li> Sand, surf, fresh air!</li>
            <li> It is a clean, citrusy scent with a hint of summer breeze.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean</li>
            <li> this is a nice clean everyday fragrance, oddly enough, it does smell like the best parts of the beach, it is one of my favorites</li>
            <li> Price is more than reasonable too.</li>
            <li> I loved it from the second I put it on.  </li>
            <li> My friend loved it, I gave it to her as a birthday present.</li>
            <li> On me all I could smell was sweet flowers.</li>
            <li> However, after about 15 minutes of applying to my skin, the floral notes all turned powdery, pungent, and sickly sweet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad scent, just not what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, but not the scent I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This is a clean fresh smell.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and will enjoy wearing this scent all summer long.  </li>
            <li> Not very strong, so it&#x27;s nice to wear to work and then spray some more on before going out at night.</li>
            <li> This is a bit too powerful for my taste.</li>
            <li> Nothing fresh and reminds me of grandma.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and it arrived packaged nicely and in just a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I based my reviews on others saying it had a beachy, coconut, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice fragrance that I wear it even in the winter.</li>
            <li> Smells so fresh.</li>
            <li> I love the green and blue print on the box and the bottle will look so beautiful on any vanity.  </li>
            <li> This perfume I can definitely see on a more mature lady; definitely more floral than fresh or fruity.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday, and going out at night!</li>
            <li> Pretty packaging.</li>
            <li> Time to go to the department store and try them first..</li>
            <li> Each year we ask the \\&quot;birthday person\\&quot; to give us a list starting with the item they want the most.  </li>
            <li> So when I got it and smelled it for the first time, I immediately didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> Got it fast and as described!</li>
            <li> I was willing to try it with the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> , I was willing to risk it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this through amazon without smelling it first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty bottle I keep on my dresser</li>
            <li> One of my favorite, this one is for a present</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more from Lilly Pulitzer.  </li>
            <li> It is clean, soft, feminine and enticing.</li>
            <li> , fragarence is lite, clean not heavy, and lasts thru out the day</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t linger as long as I would like, but I just love it so much!</li>
            <li> It smells more powdery and like an old woman rather than young and floral.</li>
            <li> I smell only strong flowers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this perfume at a large Dept Store for twice the price</li>
            <li> I expected I light scent, BEACHY and fresh and summery.</li>
            <li> I really like it, and I feel energized when I spray it on in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or over-powering; it smells like a fresh tropical breeze.  </li>
            <li> I am very picky about what fragrance I wear</li>
            <li> but this is an absolute keeper.</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t and my husband loves it, says it&#x27;s very feminine.  </li>
            <li> My customers really like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really to find the perfume in the stores</li>
            <li> It actually reminded me of a combination of baby powder and cheap drugstore perfume marketed for &amp;#34;mature women&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t smell quite right, and I&#x27;m concerned that either it is really old or it was exposed to the elements in some way that altered its chemical makeup.  </li>
            <li> With that said, this one was too &#x27;sharp&#x27; for me and overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t live close to any stores that sell this, so I took a gamble and ordered on Amazon, based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I am 34 years old and wanted a fresh beach-like scent, but this scent is way too mature for me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that came from the seller, but most likely it did since it was on the outside and inside of the package.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> if you enjoy smelling like an old lady wrapped in toilet paper, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I am constantly getting compliments on its airy and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth buying, and the scent can only be described as...</li>
            <li> Normally, I really love this scent and was surprised at the low, low price posted for this.  </li>
            <li> Love the sent but it does not last on me very long.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it so much, she wants to wear it also (Christmas present).</li>
            <li> and it literally the exact same product!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ahve actually finished a bottle of perfume!  </li>
            <li> at first i thought it smelt a little &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; for me, but i found if i only put a small amount the scent wears very nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy it again, especially at this price for such a large bottle!!</li>
            <li> not heavy.  </li>
            <li> So I gave it to my mom who is 60 years old and she loves it.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of a 1970&#x27;s old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a very hard to please teen ager and she feel in love with her first gift of a fragrance.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I smelled the bottle - it was truly lovely and complex, with strong white floral notes and a hint of salt/sea spray and a little melon.</li>
            <li> The scent is both clear and a little sweet....</li>
            <li> Beachy doesn&#x27;t smell like suntan lotion or marine notes, it&#x27;s much softer and more complicated.  </li>
            <li> I have barely used this bottle.</li>
            <li> It is a little more floral than I usually wear, but after a few minutes it mellows into a soft, sultry feminine citrus.  </li>
            <li> It is too bad, because the scent in the bottle is amazing.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day long also.</li>
            <li> Larger bottle at half the price of a local perfume outlet!</li>
            <li> (My computer skills are somewhat limited.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to have a fresher, cleaner scent.  </li>
            <li> not really anything I wear in the cooler months</li>
            <li> Not really flowery, not really fruity, just like a day at the beach.</li>
            <li> The only small thing I noticed was the package smelled a bit like cigarette smoke.</li>
            <li> Make&#x27;s me think of a sunny beach down south.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too flowery/spicy for me.  </li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t be spraying it all crazy!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying blind then don&#x27;t purchase this.</li>
            <li> Unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>
            <li> Hate to tell them what it is</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t terrible, just not my thing.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Beachy before and never has it smelled so awful!</li>

            <li> WAS A GIFT AND WELL LIKED</li>
            <li> Unpleasant scent. Pretty packaging.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Great Price!  Great Gift!  Have someone who loves the fragrance and couldn&#x27;t find it locally!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  I expected it to have a fresher, cleaner scent.  It&#x27;s a little too flowery/spicy for me.  I don&#x27;t know why I buy fragrances I&#x27;ve never tried on the internet.  I&#x27;ve never found one I like.  Time to go to the department store and try them first..</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I bought this product in the store for$68,on sale! and then I found it on the website for more than 1/2 off and it literally the exact same product!</li>
            <li> This is a bit too powerful for my taste. I was hoping to find a good fragrance that really captures the clean salty air of the beach with a lil twist of suntan oil/ coconut. I have yet to find a perfume with that mix of beach goodness. This one isn&#x27;t terrible, just not my thing.</li>
            <li> i love this scent! i wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing online without smelling it but i lucked out and liked it. it is a perfect summer scent, its light and has a sweet floral scent. at first i thought it smelt a little &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; for me, but i found if i only put a small amount the scent wears very nicely. i get a lot of compliments on it when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> When I see \\&quot;beach\\&quot; themed perfumes I expect them to smell of coconuts and ocean notes.  That makes this perfume a very pleasant surprise.  Beachy doesn&#x27;t smell like suntan lotion or marine notes, it&#x27;s much softer and more complicated.  It&#x27;s a very fresh scent, one that&#x27;s very easy to wear, and one that has more staying power than I was expecting.  This is a delightful and unassuming perfume for daytime, especially well-suited to spring and summer.</li>
            <li> love this smell! i wear lilly pulitzer &#x27;juicy&#x27; as my regular scent but i trien this one too and it is easily my #2 fave!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this fragrance. I ALWAYS get tons of compliments. It&#x27;s a GREAT late spring and definately a perfect summer fragrance. Wouldn&#x27;t wear it fall/winter, but that&#x27;s me.</li>
            <li> Great price, well packaged!</li>
            <li> Amazon has a great price for this perfume!!  I took a chance and purchased this online even though I am quite picky about my scents.  I ended up loving it!  It is a clean, citrusy scent with a hint of summer breeze.  It is a little more floral than I usually wear, but after a few minutes it mellows into a soft, sultry feminine citrus.  I really like it, and I feel energized when I spray it on in the morning.  I&#x27;d buy it again, especially at this price for such a large bottle!!</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a very hard to please teen ager and she feel in love with her first gift of a fragrance. She has requested a replacement as she is almost out of this.  Will be ordering in the future.</li>
            <li> After reading so many rave reviews about \\&quot;Beachy\\&quot;, it sounded like the scent for me, and it is!  It&#x27;s light, fresh and smells like paradise!  It&#x27;s not heavy or over-powering; it smells like a fresh tropical breeze.  I can&#x27;t believe the size either; 3.4 ounces, and a bargain!  I am very pleased and will enjoy wearing this scent all summer long.  Also wanted to add that the packaging and bottle is absolutely gorgeous!  I love the green and blue print on the box and the bottle will look so beautiful on any vanity.  Makes a great gift for a Mom, Sister or Aunt!  Thank you, Amazon for your speedy service and great packaging too!</li>
            <li> Good purchase.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is light and is not overpowering.  People want to know what I am wearing because they like the light scent.  When going out to dinner the aroma of the food does not conflict with the eau de parfum.  Excellent value at Amazon.  I am ordering more of these for Christmas gifts!</li>
            <li> great beachy smell, i need more i am out, my daughter really liked this smell also. If you like the beach you will like this</li>
            <li> Very clean, sophisticated &amp; youthful, floral-beachy fragrance. I wish the Lilly Pulitzer brand would reconsider bringing back this one and Wink.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase. It arrived on time in perfect condition. Price was competitive. That&#x27;s everything I ask for.</li>
            <li> Fragrance smells wonderful, so clean.  My daughter loves it so much, she wants to wear it also (Christmas present).</li>
            <li> I orginally bought this somewhere else, but have abought a second, larger bottle here.  This is the first time I ahve actually finished a bottle of perfume!  The scent doesn&#x27;t linger as long as I would like, but I just love it so much!</li>
            <li> if you enjoy smelling like an old lady wrapped in toilet paper, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the name throw you off...more \\&quot;springy\\&quot; than \\&quot;beachy\\&quot;...has a lovely, unusually fresh AND warm combination. A light, springy fusion with a yummy finish that will be sure to provide delicious aromas throughout the whole year. Not very strong, so it&#x27;s nice to wear to work and then spray some more on before going out at night. I wear it with everything, and it&#x27;s become a signature scent for me. I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> The perfume came in a brand new unopened package and smelled wonderful. I&#x27;ve purchased this perfume at a large Dept Store for twice the price and it was a much smaller bottle. It was great to be able to buy my favorite perfume at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> I have purchased Beachy before and never has it smelled so awful! It smells more powdery and like an old woman rather than young and floral. I switched to Viva La Juicy La Fleur and I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with that! Save your $$$ and skip this purchase!</li>
            <li> Always makes it when it&#x27;s supposed too.</li>
            <li> This perfume is awesome.  Its feminine, uplifts my mood, and is not overpowering.  If anything, I wish it were a tad bit stronger.  Its a great way to be able to afford some Lily.</li>
            <li> Love this parfum. I am constantly getting compliments on its airy and fresh scent. Price is more than reasonable too.</li>
            <li> This perfume gave me a headache, smells like those beachy potpourri that I will be using for my bathroom.  Nothing fresh and reminds me of grandma.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying blind then don&#x27;t purchase this. Smells like old lady perfume, not really beachy at all.</li>
            <li> the packaging is ADORABLE and I love the scent! It smells refreshing and does have a tropical beachy smell to it. I will surely be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like this scent at all.... it smells very cheap.... I will not buy this brand again</li>
            <li> Never smelled fragrance before so I took a chance.  So glad I did!  I loved it from the second I put it on.  Everyone compliments the fragrance on me.  Hate to tell them what it is, it&#x27;s MY summer fragrance!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved water scents, and I love all things Lilly... and when they came out with this scent I was in love!  It smells great and lasts most of the day without being too strong.  Great for everyday, and going out at night!</li>
            <li> For some reason, I thought 3.4 ounces wouldn&#x27;t be enough perfume. Turns out, you really get a pretty good amount for the price! This is definitely worth buying, and the scent can only be described as...well...beachy! My friend loved it, I gave it to her as a birthday present. She&#x27;s a diehard Lilly fan, and she didn&#x27;t even know she put out fragrances. I gave her a wonderful surprise with this purchase.</li>
            <li> i just love this fragrance. It is clean, soft, feminine and enticing. I receive many compliments when wearing Beachy. I can spray it on in the morning and still smell it hours later. I am very picky about what fragrance I wear but this is an absolute keeper. Wearing Beachy makes me happy.</li>
            <li> I got for my wife for Christmas soon so I know she would love it smile so well merry Christmas to you all and happy new year</li>
            <li> Each year we ask the \\&quot;birthday person\\&quot; to give us a list starting with the item they want the most.  The perfume was among the most wanted by Kate. She was quite surprised and delighted when she got it since I had to order it on line.  (My computer skills are somewhat limited.  However, Amazon makes[[ASIN:B002XQ1VAM Lilly Pulitzer Beachy By Lilly Pulitzer For Women Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Oz]] it so easy to order that I did not have a problem.)  It was a good day for all of us.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.  I bought it after reading reviews on Amazon.  I own another scent by Pulitzer and love that one, so I took a chance.  I disagree with the reviews I read about some citrus tones.  It&#x27;s a light floral scent that reminds me of a lightly scented baby powder.  It&#x27;s become my evening and dress up scent for summer.  I&#x27;m  closer to middle age and can&#x27;t stand women whose scent is overpowering.  This one isn&#x27;t and my husband loves it, says it&#x27;s very feminine.  It&#x27;s also a great bargain on Amazon.  Larger bottle at half the price of a local perfume outlet!</li>
            <li> I would buy this Lilly Pulitzer again and again. Need to stock it often.</li>
            <li> Love the sent but it does not last on me very long. I would like the product more if the scent lingered longer than it does&lt;br /&gt;Great for the summer time as well as spring not really anything I wear in the cooler months</li>
            <li> Wow what an amazing clean scent! I get compliments every time I use it no matter where or when! I saw that the price went up, If I would of known it would increase, I would have bought a case!! Beachy is still an amazing parfume regardless of the price!!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled! It&#x27;s clean it&#x27;s simple, and it&#x27;s affordable. And to top it off the bottle is super adorable.</li>
            <li> People will want to know where you got this perfume.  Stays on all day and lingers just enough that people&lt;br /&gt;are wondering what is that wonderful smell you&#x27;re wearing!</li>
            <li> Scent preferences are subjective. With that said, this one was too &#x27;sharp&#x27; for me and overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Just got this for spring and I am loving it! What a bargain price! Saw this in the store for double the amount! Taking with me to Spring Break!</li>
            <li> I adore this scent.  I purchased as a gift to me.  I love Lilly Pulitzer patterns and I could simply afford her perfume, not necessarily her clothing.  I am a supervisor at UPS in operations......surrounded by hundreds of men.  I cannot tell you how many ask me \\&quot;what are you wearing...I want to buy that for my wife\\&quot; \\&quot;it smells so good\\&quot;.  The scent is unique.  not heavy.  Just beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a bottle for my daughter who is 21.  When she was home for Summer break from College, she came to visit me at UPS toward the end of my day so that we could spend some time together.  As she passed through the guard shack and waited for me to come and escort her into the building, the Guard remarked when I got there....\\&quot;I knew she was your daughter....she smells just as beautiful as you do\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So....ladies......THIS is the scent that for whatever reason......is remembered</li>
            <li> When I read the word \\&quot;beachy\\&quot;, I pictured the scent to be tropical - kind of like the smell of a sunblock (like hawaiian tropic).  I thought of coconut, vanilla, pineapple and so forth.  So when I got it and smelled it for the first time, I immediately didn&#x27;t like it.  It should be called \\&quot;gardeny\\&quot; or \\&quot;floraly\\&quot; because it&#x27;s a floral scent.  It&#x27;s not a bad scent, just not what I wanted.  I am 34 years old and wanted a fresh beach-like scent, but this scent is way too mature for me.  So I gave it to my mom who is 60 years old and she loves it.  In fact, she gets so many compliments when she wears it.  Even men will ask her what she is wearing.  In all, it is a nice floral fragrance, has staying power, more for a mature woman, but it smells nothing like a beach scent should.</li>
            <li> I expected I light scent, BEACHY and fresh and summery. This perfume I can definitely see on a more mature lady; definitely more floral than fresh or fruity. Not bad, but not the scent I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Got it fast and as described! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Normally, I really love this scent and was surprised at the low, low price posted for this.  However, it doesn&#x27;t smell quite right, and I&#x27;m concerned that either it is really old or it was exposed to the elements in some way that altered its chemical makeup.  I have barely used this bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent and I have worn it for several years.  I was so pleased to find it on Amazon for a very reasonable price.  I ordered it and it arrived packaged nicely and in just a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it for several times. It has good smell. My customers really like it. I&#x27;m still advertising it to my friends, customers in Viet Nam and most of them love the smell of it!</li>
            <li> this perfume smells great! Reminds me of sunshine and water. The bottle is beautiful too...too pretty to put away I keep it out in my bedroom to enjoy the sea glass color of it!</li>
            <li> this is a nice clean everyday fragrance, oddly enough, it does smell like the best parts of the beach, it is one of my favorites, fragarence is lite, clean not heavy, and lasts thru out the day</li>
            <li> Its perfume. You spray it on to smell nice. If you wanna know what it smells like go to a store and try the sample. My wife smells great with this</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle, very light fresh scent. Perfect summer scent. Not really flowery, not really fruity, just like a day at the beach. Sand, surf, fresh air!</li>
            <li> Smells like the beach!</li>
            <li> Soft,  wonderful summer fragrance, have received many compliments. Price was right, bottle is pretty, very happy with the purchase  from Amazon.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine was wearing Beachy, and I loved the way it smelled on her....So, I thought I&#x27;d try it for myself....The scent is both clear and a little sweet....It works for me.</li>
            <li> Love this. It&#x27;s my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I was willing to try it with the reviews I read. On me all I could smell was sweet flowers. I didn&#x27;t get a &amp;#34;beachy &amp;#34; smell. I was disappointed but I know fragrances wear different on everyone, I was willing to risk it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume! It&#x27;s very potent. It lasts all day! A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t be spraying it all crazy! LOL! My BF loves the smell! It&#x27;s a great price!!! Will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> This is a clean fresh smell. I prefer to wear this fragrance in the summer. It&#x27;s really to find the perfume in the stores so I definitely recommend buying it online.</li>
            <li> I purchased this through amazon without smelling it first. My fault. I based my reviews on others saying it had a beachy, coconut, fresh scent. I can&#x27;t smell a beachy scent at all. I smell only strong flowers. It reminds me of a 1970&#x27;s old lady perfume. It&#x27;s a pretty bottle I keep on my dresser but I don&#x27;t spray it at all. What a waste.</li>
            <li> Heavenly fragrance. Make&#x27;s me think of a sunny beach down south. Everything about it is beautiful...even the packaging. Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> This is such a nice fragrance that I wear it even in the winter. I get compliments all the time and asked what that fragrance is.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t live close to any stores that sell this, so I took a gamble and ordered on Amazon, based on all the positive reviews. I was hoping for a fragrance with floral/salt notes, with just a hint of summer melon. When it arrived, I smelled the bottle - it was truly lovely and complex, with strong white floral notes and a hint of salt/sea spray and a little melon. Truly lovely, like being in a garden on a humid summer morning. Not quite like the beach - more like a garden. However, after about 15 minutes of applying to my skin, the floral notes all turned powdery, pungent, and sickly sweet. It actually reminded me of a combination of baby powder and cheap drugstore perfume marketed for &amp;#34;mature women&amp;#34;. It is too bad, because the scent in the bottle is amazing. Giving it 3 stars because it makes for a nice room freshener.</li>
            <li> Smells so fresh. Get many compliments by friens and even strangers!  Now that Lilly has passed I hope it will not be discontinued.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite, this one is for a present</li>
            <li> purchased for my granddaughter who loves this product - and goes thru it like water - she&#x27;s happy then I am happy</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the scent of this perfume. I had not tested it before but read many reviews on it about how it smelled like the beach. I can not say it smells like suntan lotion which is what I was wanting but it is very fresh and summer-like and I Have had compliments on it already. The service from the company I ordered for was excellent. The only small thing I noticed was the package smelled a bit like cigarette smoke. I don&#x27;t know if that came from the seller, but most likely it did since it was on the outside and inside of the package. I say this in case you are allergic to that. But I would buy from them again, good prices and service</li>
            <li> Great summer fragrance.  Glad I stumbled across it.  Will definitely buy more from Lilly Pulitzer.  Lasts all day long also.</li>
