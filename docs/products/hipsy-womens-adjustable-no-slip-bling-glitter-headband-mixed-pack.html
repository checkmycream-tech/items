            <li>Still think the color and design is cute.</li>

            <li>Extremely comfortable and a pretty color.</li>
            <li>I have several of the Hipsy headbands, they are my favorite!</li>
            <li>I expected more elasticity but that ok, I fix the headband with pins.</li>
            <li>Purchased these for my 5th grade daughters 70&#x27;s school performance, super cute and fit great, not too loose or tight.</li>
            <li>Easy adjust to fit my big head - no headache or slippage.</li>
            <li>I have short hair that I am letting grow out (after 30+ years) and it keeps the shorter ends off my face, I Love Them.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rave about these headbands enough, I have gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time (1 week) exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>Pretty pricey for a headband</li>
            <li>I can see this thing lasting me a very long time as the quality is great.</li>
            <li>I am very petite</li>
            <li>There is really nothing &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; about it.  </li>
            <li>The band itself is very durable and doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Very pretty headband - simple yet classy enough to wear to work.  </li>
            <li>They are non slip and adjustable which is hard to fine.</li>
            <li>so it is hard to find headbands that fit my head.</li>
            <li>The ajustable size is very convenient but it doesn&#x27;t stay the same size all day long.</li>
            <li>They truly are adjustable and well worth the few bucks apiece.  </li>
