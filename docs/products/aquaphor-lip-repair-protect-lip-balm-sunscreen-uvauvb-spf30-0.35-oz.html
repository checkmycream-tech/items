            <li>Great product; it is soothing on the lips, not greasy.  </li>

            <li>This feels very nice on the lips.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just as good</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a good reason for that.</li>
            <li>Buy it if you have fair skin and all.</li>
            <li>Great for smoothing-- --eliminates dryness and effective for eliminating chapped lips.</li>
            <li>Aquaphor  is as good as  its write up  suggests.</li>
            <li>This was a good price</li>
            <li>so I guess it worked, for which I am very glad.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Aquaphor is some awesome stuff, and I really wanted this lip balm to work for me because of the sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice lip balm.  </li>
            <li>It does apply a lot easier than stick-type lip balms, which is nice.</li>
            <li>, I have really liked the quality of this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Nice feel on my lips.</li>
            <li>I prefer the kind without the SPF 30 for myself as I can taste what seems like sun tan lotion with this.  </li>
            <li>The best if your not lipstick kind of person and don&#x27;t like sticky gloss gives lips nice sheen  plus keeps from Sun and wind burn highly moisturizing</li>
            <li>The packaging often make a farting noise when you use it which is good for a cheap laugh!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First, kudos to this company for a timely delivery and great packaging.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t leave that &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; residue that I get with some lip balms.  </li>
            <li>Works so much better than pure Vaseline or the Aquaphor that isn&#x27;t branded &amp;#34;Lip Therapy.&amp;#34; Also, great for sun protection on sunny days.</li>
            <li>Nothing better on the market for lip protection.</li>
            <li>It costs a bit more than most chapsticks but the tube lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>so glad dr. recommended it</li>
            <li>I usually LOVE aquaphor products.  </li>
            <li>I know for sure</li>
            <li>My pediatrician turned me only EOS and I&#x27;m hooked on it, Passion Fruit&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Aquaphor Lip Repair for many years and love it.  </li>
            <li>The product just sits on top of lips and never penetrates.  </li>
            <li>I love Aquaphor.</li>
            <li>This product is no exception and keeps them safe from the sun.</li>
            <li>I will be buying again for sure.</li>
            <li>Because of that, I apply the balm with my finger, which defeats the purpose of a more sanitary application of Aquaphor as compared to the tub version.</li>
            <li>I love having these to put in my purse.</li>
            <li>Simply the best to protect my lips!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is better than Vaseline Lip Therapy.</li>
            <li>soaks in and repairs lips and then keeps them from getting any more cracks.</li>
            <li>This product line is top notch,</li>
            <li>i love the products of aquaphor.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if I will use this or not, as I prefer the healing ointment, which seems to work better under lipsticks and glosses.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Glad I purchased.  </li>
            <li>The formula is pretty good and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>this is the best moisturizer for really dry lips.</li>
            <li>This brand is one of the best things you can use for chapped or dry lips.  </li>
            <li>This is the best for really dry lips.</li>
            <li>My lips are smooth and healthy again.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working great - no itchy rash.</li>
            <li>Gave me some LL Cool J enviable lips!</li>
            <li>The original Aquaphor is awesome for dry lips.</li>
            <li>(my lips chap easily</li>
            <li>goes on easily doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Moisturizers lips just fine, but if any gets in your mouth</li>
            <li>Works great for chapped or dry lips and the addition of SPF makes it even better</li>
            <li>so that is quite important to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not have a smooth texture</li>
            <li>Sunscreen is important, but a lot of us forget to protect our lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My lips feel smooth.</li>
            <li>MY LIP SUPER SOFT AND NICE AND PROTECTS IT FROM THE SUN EVERYONE SHOULD BUY ONE!  </li>
            <li>Between this and the original formula, I use it every day all day.</li>
            <li>It helps my skin significantly in the winter.</li>
            <li>A nice lip balm, great hydration at a good price and hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li>So overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li>This stuff feels nice, but disappears far too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, this is some great stuff.</li>
            <li>imagine this would be great for anyone in extreme weather conditions.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and add a sheen to my lips, not as much as lip gloss, but makes my lips look moist and nice.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has high SPF and it can protect my lips when I go out in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I use Aquaphor (w/out sunscreen) frequently and love it.  </li>
            <li>When I saw the product with Sunscreen protection on Amazon, I ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>With regular stick lip balm, you need to apply it, and apply more, and apply even more, to get your lips to feel like they&#x27;re soft again.</li>
            <li>Aquaphor products always work to heal my skin up fast, and I loved that this had SPF, but I really wanted the lip repair item to be non-petroleum based hence only 3 stars.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and very absorbing.</li>
            <li>a little hot when I use it, not so good as the one without spf protect</li>
            <li>purchased while on accutane to help with the chronic dry lips and the sunscreen in this product changes the taste from the original version but makes this work great for anytime spent in the sun.  </li>
            <li>Your lips stay hydrated and healthy, and get protection from UVs at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how tiny this is!</li>
            <li>Love the feeling on my lips and the SPF is critical for someone who gets fever blisters in the sun.</li>
            <li>Pretty gross.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aquaphor has a funny taste,maybe from the sunscreen</li>
            <li>the lip protect works well, makes your lip soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I like this, but actually prefer the Aquaphor healing ointment and tend to gravitate towards that more.  </li>
            <li>This is a good foundation for lipstick, which I don&#x27;t use a lot of, but if I have a shade that&#x27;s too intense or dark, I use Aquaphor first and the put the lipstick over it and it cuts the intensity and lightens the color.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this product did more harm than good.</li>
            <li>I like this lip balm very much because it really calms and restores my lips overnight.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of softening, but doesn&#x27;t last very long, but which of them does?</li>
            <li>My derm recommended this to me while I am on accutane and it works fine, until the edges of your lips break out in gross pimples!</li>
            <li>Seems fine for moisturizing purposes, but this is something I&#x27;d only take to the beach--where I know I&#x27;m already going to smell like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a funny taste like lots of high spf lip protectants.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lip balm after a dermatologist told me that I needed to use a lip balm with an SPF of at least 30, with both UVA and UVB protection, as part of my daily routine (I have a very fair complexion--</li>
            <li>The ointment just needs one application for a whole day.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for keeping lips from drying out.</li>
            <li>It has spf 30 and is non-scented, and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It also lasts longer than some others and hydrates really well</li>
            <li>It does soften dry/chapped lips, but I&#x27;ve yet to  see it really REPAIR cracked/scabbed lips.</li>
            <li>Very moist on the lips and protective, although it leaves a taste.</li>
            <li>Perfect for cold new england winters!</li>
            <li>Works well but other products are better.</li>
            <li>Back to original Aquaphor.</li>
            <li>We use this for our daughter&#x27;s lips because she gets dry lips easily.  </li>
            <li>I discovered a new horror, my lips were very swollen.</li>
            <li>I used to use the regular size Aquaphor on my lips and that also worked well, but this formulation, made specifically for lips is lightly flavored, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>However, I wanted to start using more non-petroleum based ointments for topical use (especially on my lips.)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially I intended to only use this lip balm in the morning and use something cheaper when I wasn&#x27;t worried about sun exposure, but I like this one so much more than other lip balms that I pretty much exclusively use the Aquaphor now.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that every product I&#x27;ve ever used that has avobenzone in it has given me some kind of negative reaction.</li>
            <li>Since it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to return it, I&#x27;ll just trash it at some point but definitely won&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>No hard, waxy stick to push against sore or cracked lips.</li>
            <li>my lips had been in slightly dry beforehand, but not nearly as bad as this.</li>
            <li>The lip balm needs to be applied very frequently in order to keeping my lips moist.  </li>
            <li>It does not get sticky or dry like most lip balms, doesn&#x27;t have any flavor which I like when eating and drinking, and lasts a long time on your lips.</li>
            <li>Made my lips soft but tasted like sunscreen!</li>
            <li>This is a clear lip balm in a tube that you squirt out onto your lips.</li>
            <li>This was one of the few lip balms I found that fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I developed an allergy to this product.  </li>
            <li>make your lips soft and beauty.</li>
            <li>As I have exceptionally sensitive lips, even the slightest hint of a tingle in any product</li>
            <li>In general we both really like Aquaphor lip balm, it really works well on repairing dry lips from weather conditions.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it cost less because I go through it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a runnier liquid which has slight sweet taste and then thicker liquid.</li>
            <li>Aquaphor has raised the bar for those of us with chronic, easily dried lips - with this product, they added that extra, over the top part that anyone who goes outside needs - the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally like Eucerin products, but if you have a low tolerance for petroleum jelly products, this defiantly isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>This is really good especially with the bitter cold we have been getting in New England, keeps lips moist abut longer than the most  of the other products</li>
            <li>This product has an and of 30, and is broad spectrum.</li>
            <li>This is the gold standard as far as I am concerned, for a lip balm that isn&#x27;t waxy.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve never tried Aquaphor lip balm, it&#x27;s super moist and slick.</li>
            <li>Too bad, it is a good product otherwise</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Sunscreen is important, but a lot of us forget to protect our lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lips feel smooth.</li>
            <li> MY LIP SUPER SOFT AND NICE AND PROTECTS IT FROM THE SUN EVERYONE SHOULD BUY ONE!  </li>
            <li> Between this and the original formula, I use it every day all day.</li>
            <li> It helps my skin significantly in the winter.</li>
            <li> A nice lip balm, great hydration at a good price and hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> So overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels nice, but disappears far too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, this is some great stuff.</li>
            <li> imagine this would be great for anyone in extreme weather conditions.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and add a sheen to my lips, not as much as lip gloss, but makes my lips look moist and nice.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has high SPF and it can protect my lips when I go out in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I use Aquaphor (w/out sunscreen) frequently and love it.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the product with Sunscreen protection on Amazon, I ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li> With regular stick lip balm, you need to apply it, and apply more, and apply even more, to get your lips to feel like they&#x27;re soft again.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor products always work to heal my skin up fast, and I loved that this had SPF, but I really wanted the lip repair item to be non-petroleum based hence only 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and very absorbing.</li>
            <li> a little hot when I use it, not so good as the one without spf protect</li>
            <li> purchased while on accutane to help with the chronic dry lips and the sunscreen in this product changes the taste from the original version but makes this work great for anytime spent in the sun.  </li>
            <li> Your lips stay hydrated and healthy, and get protection from UVs at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how tiny this is!</li>
            <li> Love the feeling on my lips and the SPF is critical for someone who gets fever blisters in the sun.</li>
            <li> Pretty gross.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aquaphor has a funny taste,maybe from the sunscreen</li>
            <li> the lip protect works well, makes your lip soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I like this, but actually prefer the Aquaphor healing ointment and tend to gravitate towards that more.  </li>
            <li> This is a good foundation for lipstick, which I don&#x27;t use a lot of, but if I have a shade that&#x27;s too intense or dark, I use Aquaphor first and the put the lipstick over it and it cuts the intensity and lightens the color.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did more harm than good.</li>
            <li> I like this lip balm very much because it really calms and restores my lips overnight.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of softening, but doesn&#x27;t last very long, but which of them does?</li>
            <li> My derm recommended this to me while I am on accutane and it works fine, until the edges of your lips break out in gross pimples!</li>
            <li> Seems fine for moisturizing purposes, but this is something I&#x27;d only take to the beach--where I know I&#x27;m already going to smell like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a funny taste like lots of high spf lip protectants.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lip balm after a dermatologist told me that I needed to use a lip balm with an SPF of at least 30, with both UVA and UVB protection, as part of my daily routine (I have a very fair complexion--</li>
            <li> The ointment just needs one application for a whole day.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for keeping lips from drying out.</li>
            <li> It has spf 30 and is non-scented, and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It also lasts longer than some others and hydrates really well</li>
            <li> It does soften dry/chapped lips, but I&#x27;ve yet to  see it really REPAIR cracked/scabbed lips.</li>
            <li> Very moist on the lips and protective, although it leaves a taste.</li>
            <li> Perfect for cold new england winters!</li>
            <li> Works well but other products are better.</li>
            <li> Back to original Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> We use this for our daughter&#x27;s lips because she gets dry lips easily.  </li>
            <li> I discovered a new horror, my lips were very swollen.</li>
            <li> I used to use the regular size Aquaphor on my lips and that also worked well, but this formulation, made specifically for lips is lightly flavored, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> However, I wanted to start using more non-petroleum based ointments for topical use (especially on my lips.)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially I intended to only use this lip balm in the morning and use something cheaper when I wasn&#x27;t worried about sun exposure, but I like this one so much more than other lip balms that I pretty much exclusively use the Aquaphor now.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that every product I&#x27;ve ever used that has avobenzone in it has given me some kind of negative reaction.</li>
            <li> Since it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to return it, I&#x27;ll just trash it at some point but definitely won&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> No hard, waxy stick to push against sore or cracked lips.</li>
            <li> my lips had been in slightly dry beforehand, but not nearly as bad as this.</li>
            <li> The lip balm needs to be applied very frequently in order to keeping my lips moist.  </li>
            <li> It does not get sticky or dry like most lip balms, doesn&#x27;t have any flavor which I like when eating and drinking, and lasts a long time on your lips.</li>
            <li> Made my lips soft but tasted like sunscreen!</li>
            <li> This is a clear lip balm in a tube that you squirt out onto your lips.</li>
            <li> This was one of the few lip balms I found that fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to this product.  </li>
            <li> make your lips soft and beauty.</li>
            <li> As I have exceptionally sensitive lips, even the slightest hint of a tingle in any product</li>
            <li> In general we both really like Aquaphor lip balm, it really works well on repairing dry lips from weather conditions.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it cost less because I go through it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a runnier liquid which has slight sweet taste and then thicker liquid.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor has raised the bar for those of us with chronic, easily dried lips - with this product, they added that extra, over the top part that anyone who goes outside needs - the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally like Eucerin products, but if you have a low tolerance for petroleum jelly products, this defiantly isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> This is really good especially with the bitter cold we have been getting in New England, keeps lips moist abut longer than the most  of the other products</li>
            <li> This product has an and of 30, and is broad spectrum.</li>
            <li> This is the gold standard as far as I am concerned, for a lip balm that isn&#x27;t waxy.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve never tried Aquaphor lip balm, it&#x27;s super moist and slick.</li>
            <li> Too bad, it is a good product otherwise</li>
            <li> This product is not thick enough and leaves a dry bitter taste n my mouth.</li>
            <li> I used it last night and in the middle of the night I woke up to flakey, dry lips.</li>
            <li> sunscreen added in this product gives you that single tiny tube to take with you everywhere</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re out in the sun for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband that dutifully uses sunscreen on his face and arms when going outside due to skin cancer.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product and other made by them.</li>
            <li> It helps it stay dry , but supple.</li>
            <li> Helps with dry and cracked lips</li>
            <li> The dry cracking skin soon passed</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s apparently tough to find lip balm with SPF in a certain price point.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently taking Accutane for my skin and the most annoying side effect has been dry, flakey lips.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the SPF30 but between the Aquaphor without SPF, which I apply to my lips when I am inside the house, and this Aquaphor with SPF which I apply when going out, the SPF Aquaphor feels a tiny bit burning on the lips and after a little while, it dries out faster than the Aquaphor without SPF.</li>
            <li> It would be great to have SPF protection with the benefits of Aquaphor for daytime use, but this formula is terrible.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because anything I drink will taste bitter for about an hour.</li>
            <li> It smells like sunscreen and tastes really bitter.</li>
            <li> usually use (and really recommend) Decubal&#x27;s Lips and Dry Spot Balm, however it&#x27;s hard to find in the US</li>
            <li> Overall, my experience proved to be a nightmare from just a little lip balm!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also portable and pocket-sized, which the other Aquaphor tubes are not.</li>
            <li> Other than lanolin</li>
            <li> Following a small operation on my lip I was advised to use this product to help it recover.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to ingest it because you can taste the chemicals a little.</li>
            <li> I could even say that I always have at least a tiny crack on them and this balm helps heal and prevent those obnoxious flakes.</li>
            <li> Think cut plastic that hasn&#x27;t been smoothed down.  </li>
            <li> Be careful if you are acne prone!!</li>
            <li> Much less than from the brick &amp; mortar stores.</li>
            <li> My lips burnt a little every time I put it on.</li>
            <li> I am  using it at night, but I feel its a little greasy for day wear.</li>
            <li> I would use these as an emergency instead of an everyday sun protection lip balm.</li>
            <li> This is now part of my everyday lip care for my family and I.</li>
            <li> and I do not enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> so I order a few at a time.</li>
            <li> and I know I&#x27;m in trouble.  </li>
            <li> I apply very little and it still happens.</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to find locally</li>
            <li> It has been very dry &amp; cold this winter and my family has had a lot of trouble with chapped lips--more than usual.</li>
            <li> it stings hate writing reviews they demand a certain number of words</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this advice applies to everyone, but it can&#x27;t hurt!).  </li>
            <li> Left an unpleasant film and taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inevitable that some of this will get in your mouth, and it has a rather unpleasant sunscreen taste.</li>
            <li> However, the applicator tip has an uncut, rough rim that scratches my poor lips.  </li>
            <li> I had a real bad case of chapped lips due to weather and as soon as I applied this it was instant relief.</li>
            <li> Irritating for weak lips.</li>
            <li> I have always been very careful with what I put on my skin, but I never even thought something for my lips would result so badly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my skin does not like chemical sunscreen filters.</li>
            <li> This unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is lousy.</li>
            <li> I hope Aquaphor doesn&#x27;t discontinue the regular mini-tubes because they have this horrible product now.</li>
            <li> I like that it protects my lips and keeps them hydrated, but it is constantly getting into my mouth and I despise that horrible taste.</li>
            <li> WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS TRY AQUAPHOR</li>
            <li> it is so gross tasting and metallic tasting , or if it gets on a cup you are drinking from the awful taste will get in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Lip s can get burnt believe me, its weird.</li>
            <li> After using it less than a handful of times, my lips were dryer than ever and peeling horribly.</li>
            <li> I also like that this product don&#x27;t have bad chemical preservatives like paraben</li>
            <li> Besides from the bad taste</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has a terrible taste.  </li>
            <li> Terrible taste makes this a 3 star instead of 5 star review.</li>
            <li> It has a horrible after taste to the product, which is bothersome when you but it on your lips, all in all</li>
            <li> In addition, there is a terrible taste.</li>
            <li> Has a horrible taste, no wonder it was on sale</li>
            <li> And it does taste awful as others have mentioned.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use it around my nose because of a rash. It helps it stay dry , but supple. I don&#x27;t use it on the lips because it goes inside my mouth and I don&#x27;t like taste.</li>
            <li> Works well but other products are better.</li>
            <li> This is the gold standard as far as I am concerned, for a lip balm that isn&#x27;t waxy. I used to use the regular size Aquaphor on my lips and that also worked well, but this formulation, made specifically for lips is lightly flavored, which surprised me. It&#x27;s also portable and pocket-sized, which the other Aquaphor tubes are not. This is a good foundation for lipstick, which I don&#x27;t use a lot of, but if I have a shade that&#x27;s too intense or dark, I use Aquaphor first and the put the lipstick over it and it cuts the intensity and lightens the color. It is not a gloss though, it doesn&#x27;t add shininess - if this is all you use on your lips no one will see it. Recently I have decided to switch to Aquaphor with an SPF but it&#x27;s just as good and I recommend either one.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is some awesome stuff, and I really wanted this lip balm to work for me because of the sunscreen. Unfortunately my skin does not like chemical sunscreen filters. I&#x27;ve noticed that every product I&#x27;ve ever used that has avobenzone in it has given me some kind of negative reaction. With this product I broke out into a rash on my upper lip that would stick around for about a week. Other than that, this is some great stuff.</li>
            <li> a little hot when I use it, not so good as the one without spf protect</li>
            <li> Works so much better than pure Vaseline or the Aquaphor that isn&#x27;t branded &amp;#34;Lip Therapy.&amp;#34; Also, great for sun protection on sunny days. Just be careful not to ingest it because you can taste the chemicals a little.</li>
            <li> Terrible taste makes this a 3 star instead of 5 star review. I stopped using it because anything I drink will taste bitter for about an hour.</li>
            <li> One of the BEST lip balm&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Other than lanolin this is the best moisturizer for really dry lips. Also, SPF 30 should help protect lips from sun. I just wish it cost less because I go through it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I like this lip balm very much because it really calms and restores my lips overnight. I have very dry lips. I could even say that I always have at least a tiny crack on them and this balm helps heal and prevent those obnoxious flakes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a funny taste like lots of high spf lip protectants.</li>
            <li> Nothing better on the market for lip protection.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of softening, but doesn&#x27;t last very long, but which of them does?</li>
            <li> This product has an and of 30, and is broad spectrum. It has a horrible after taste to the product, which is bothersome when you but it on your lips, all in all I would use these as an emergency instead of an everyday sun protection lip balm.</li>
            <li> This product did the opposite of what it said it would.I used it last night and in the middle of the night I woke up to flakey, dry lips. my lips had been in slightly dry beforehand, but not nearly as bad as this. I put vasiline on them and went back to bed.I had only felt the dryness, I hadnt looked at my lips that night. Whwn I woke up and decided to finally look at my lips I discovered a new horror, my lips were very swollen. Some people may desire bigger lips but my lips were tingling and puffy. Overall, my experience proved to be a nightmare from just a little lip balm!</li>
            <li> Perfect for cold new england winters!</li>
            <li> Great stuff for chapped lips.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! Added SPF protection bonus!</li>
            <li> Best lip repair ever.  It&#x27;s more expensive than Vaseline or Chapstick but it is very effective.</li>
            <li> Used it while on Accutane - kept my lips moist and supple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice lip balm.  But comparing with the Aquaphor ointment, it&#x27;s no match.  The lip balm needs to be applied very frequently in order to keeping my lips moist.  The ointment just needs one application for a whole day.</li>
            <li> I am trying to phase out all beauty products containing petro chemicals, but I just can&#x27;t give this up! It hydrates my lips like nothing else. It doesn&#x27;t smell or have a weird taste like many medicated lip balms. The packaging often make a farting noise when you use it which is good for a cheap laugh!&lt;br /&gt;I imagine this would be great for anyone in extreme weather conditions.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor has raised the bar for those of us with chronic, easily dried lips - with this product, they added that extra, over the top part that anyone who goes outside needs - the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never tried Aquaphor lip balm, it&#x27;s super moist and slick. No hard, waxy stick to push against sore or cracked lips. It slides on, and soaks in within seconds. With regular stick lip balm, you need to apply it, and apply more, and apply even more, to get your lips to feel like they&#x27;re soft again. With Aquaphor, one application and your lips are happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen added in this product gives you that single tiny tube to take with you everywhere you go. Working outdoors? Check. Picnic with the family? Check. Shoveling that !@%#$* snow? Check. Your lips stay hydrated and healthy, and get protection from UVs at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it&#x27;s more expensive than stick balm. There&#x27;s a good reason for that. I won&#x27;t buy regular stick balm ever again.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for keeping lips from drying out.</li>
            <li> Gave me some LL Cool J enviable lips!</li>
            <li> All Aquaphor products are the best!</li>
            <li> This is a clear lip balm in a tube that you squirt out onto your lips. It has spf 30 and is non-scented, and it is very moisturizing. I use this for skiing when the extra sun protection and ease of application is needed. I would purchase this again and do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Burns my lips!  I must be allergic to something in the product and I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the sunscreen.  I use Aquaphor (w/out sunscreen) frequently and love it.  This unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I discovered Aquaphor last year and I am hooked. Between this and the original formula, I use it every day all day. It does not get sticky or dry like most lip balms, doesn&#x27;t have any flavor which I like when eating and drinking, and lasts a long time on your lips. It&#x27;s very low maintenance. It costs a bit more than most chapsticks but the tube lasts quite a while. I keep one in my car, purse, stroller, nightstand, bathroom.</li>
            <li> They say Aquaphor is the best for a permanent lip color procedure, so I got it, and it worked perfect.</li>
            <li> This is really good especially with the bitter cold we have been getting in New England, keeps lips moist abut longer than the most  of the other products</li>
            <li> Irritating for weak lips.</li>
            <li> Made my lips soft but tasted like sunscreen!</li>
            <li> my husband uses  it an  he thinks It does quite well he used it on vacation in Hawaii problems so glad dr. recommended it</li>
            <li> Does its job but you should only apply it every 2 hrs unlike the aquaphor without SPF. I love how tiny this is! So cute!</li>
            <li> The original Aquaphor is awesome for dry lips. This stuff is lousy. It smells like sunscreen and tastes really bitter. I can&#x27;t stand it. I hope Aquaphor doesn&#x27;t discontinue the regular mini-tubes because they have this horrible product now.</li>
            <li> Read the headline don&#x27;t like the feeling on lips it stings hate writing reviews they demand a certain number of words never again will I write a review.</li>
            <li> Works well and protects your lips. Buy it if you have fair skin and all. I&#x27;m a ginger and this works well for me. helps alot.</li>
            <li> Great SPF coverage, non-greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I usually LOVE aquaphor products.  However, I wanted to start using more non-petroleum based ointments for topical use (especially on my lips.)  I wrote to Aquaphor to find out whether the lip repair was without petroleum, they said it was, but when I received this item the ingredients stated it was petroleum based.  Aquaphor products always work to heal my skin up fast, and I loved that this had SPF, but I really wanted the lip repair item to be non-petroleum based hence only 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizing lip balm, but it tastes and smells very strongly of sunscreen. It does apply a lot easier than stick-type lip balms, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and very absorbing. I had a real bad case of chapped lips due to weather and as soon as I applied this it was instant relief. This is now part of my everyday lip care for my family and I.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lip balm after a dermatologist told me that I needed to use a lip balm with an SPF of at least 30, with both UVA and UVB protection, as part of my daily routine (I have a very fair complexion--I&#x27;m not sure if this advice applies to everyone, but it can&#x27;t hurt!).  This was one of the few lip balms I found that fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to its sunscreen benefits, I have really liked the quality of this lip balm.  It goes on very smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t leave that &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; residue that I get with some lip balms.  It also lasts longer than some others and hydrates really well (my lips chap easily so that is quite important to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I intended to only use this lip balm in the morning and use something cheaper when I wasn&#x27;t worried about sun exposure, but I like this one so much more than other lip balms that I pretty much exclusively use the Aquaphor now.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you are acne prone!! My derm recommended this to me while I am on accutane and it works fine, until the edges of your lips break out in gross pimples! I have always been very careful with what I put on my skin, but I never even thought something for my lips would result so badly. I know for sure this is what causes them, I&#x27;ve never had such a problem with acne around my lips before using this.</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing-- --eliminates dryness and effective for eliminating chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Nice feel on my lips. Not greasy, moisturized and protection on the beach was great.</li>
            <li> Left an unpleasant film and taste in my mouth. I normally like Eucerin products, but if you have a low tolerance for petroleum jelly products, this defiantly isn&#x27;t for you. My pediatrician turned me only EOS and I&#x27;m hooked on it, Passion Fruit&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I like that it protects my lips and keeps them hydrated, but it is constantly getting into my mouth and I despise that horrible taste. I apply very little and it still happens. ;-;</li>
            <li> It has been very dry &amp; cold this winter and my family has had a lot of trouble with chapped lips--more than usual. Doctor had samples of this at the receptionist desk. Tried it, loved it, had to order it! Great price from Amazon! Much less than from the brick &amp; mortar stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aquaphor Lip Repair for many years and love it.  When I saw the product with Sunscreen protection on Amazon, I ordered it right away.  Unfortunately it has a terrible taste.  Since it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to return it, I&#x27;ll just trash it at some point but definitely won&#x27;t use it.  I&#x27;ll have to buy the Aquaphor without the Sunscreen</li>
            <li> We use this for our daughter&#x27;s lips because she gets dry lips easily.  The doctor recommended this product and it works great.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to Aquaphor with sunscreen. The product arrived timely and was packaged well. It does not have a smooth texture and I do not enjoy the smell. Back to original Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> First, kudos to this company for a timely delivery and great packaging. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order from this company again. However, not this product. I expected this product to keep my lips moist and soft. It does not. The product just sits on top of lips and never penetrates.  Eventually it dissipates, but lips are dryer than ever. In addition, there is a terrible taste. This product does not deliver. However, 5 stars to the company for delivery and packaging.</li>
            <li> Love the feeling on my lips and the SPF is critical for someone who gets fever blisters in the sun.</li>
            <li> A nice lip balm, great hydration at a good price and hard to find locally.  So overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I love Aquaphor. It helps my skin significantly in the winter. This product is no exception and keeps them safe from the sun.</li>
            <li> purchased while on accutane to help with the chronic dry lips and the sunscreen in this product changes the taste from the original version but makes this work great for anytime spent in the sun.  I will be buying again for sure.</li>
            <li> The formula is pretty good and moisturizing.  However, the applicator tip has an uncut, rough rim that scratches my poor lips.  Think cut plastic that hasn&#x27;t been smoothed down.  Because of that, I apply the balm with my finger, which defeats the purpose of a more sanitary application of Aquaphor as compared to the tub version.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it since my medication causes lips to chap.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 months and have bought 5-6 of them (nightstand, backpack, office, pocket, etc)&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a couple weeks, the liquids separate. I thought it might be just the one but eventually they all do it.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a runnier liquid which has slight sweet taste and then thicker liquid. Pretty gross.&lt;br /&gt;Threw them all away and am sticking with Vaseline lip care.</li>
            <li> I love having these to put in my purse. Works great for chapped or dry lips and the addition of SPF makes it even better</li>
            <li> This product is not thick enough and leaves a dry bitter taste n my mouth.</li>
            <li> tastes of the sunscreen chemical, I prefer the one without the sunscreen, there are chap sticks with sunscreen that don&#x27;t taste of the sunscreen</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let it get in you mouth it tastes like bug spray</li>
            <li> Simply the best to protect my lips!</li>
            <li> This is great to have around in your car, purse or beach bag for the days you&#x27;re out in the sun for long periods of time. Sunscreen is important, but a lot of us forget to protect our lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does a great job protecting them. I just wish it didn&#x27;t taste like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love that it has high SPF and it can protect my lips when I go out in the sun.  It is very moisturizing and add a sheen to my lips, not as much as lip gloss, but makes my lips look moist and nice.  I also like that this product don&#x27;t have bad chemical preservatives like paraben</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband that dutifully uses sunscreen on his face and arms when going outside due to skin cancer.  I prefer the kind without the SPF 30 for myself as I can taste what seems like sun tan lotion with this.  He however NEEDS the protection and didn&#x27;t make any comments about the taste when I mentioned it to him.  In general we both really like Aquaphor lip balm, it really works well on repairing dry lips from weather conditions.  I was happy to learn that it is sold with an SPF 30 as we had never seen it before in places we shop.  It arrived promptly without any damage.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT BUT IT TASTE LIKE SUNBLOCK</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE THINGS!! MAKES MY LIP SUPER SOFT AND NICE AND PROTECTS IT FROM THE SUN EVERYONE SHOULD BUY ONE!  WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS TRY AQUAPHOR</li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to this product.  My lips burnt a little every time I put it on. I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> At last!  Something that actually works for exfoliative cheilitis.  My lips are smooth and healthy again.</li>
            <li> I used this lip balm on the inca trail and it worked quite well. I had to reapply it often but so did everyone else with their different lip balms.</li>
            <li> I prefer a thicker formula, that stays put on my lips.  This stuff feels nice, but disappears far too quickly.  It does soften dry/chapped lips, but I&#x27;ve yet to  see it really REPAIR cracked/scabbed lips.</li>
            <li> The best if your not lipstick kind of person and don&#x27;t like sticky gloss gives lips nice sheen  plus keeps from Sun and wind burn highly moisturizing</li>
            <li> I am  using it at night, but I feel its a little greasy for day wear.</li>
            <li> Seems fine for moisturizing purposes, but this is something I&#x27;d only take to the beach--where I know I&#x27;m already going to smell like sunscreen. It&#x27;s inevitable that some of this will get in your mouth, and it has a rather unpleasant sunscreen taste.</li>
            <li> BEST Lip Balm ever!  It can be difficult to find locally so I order a few at a time.</li>
            <li> Product did what it was supposed to.I don&#x27;t think it is better than Vaseline Lip Therapy.Aquaphor has a funny taste,maybe from the sunscreen but it helped my chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Moisturizers lips just fine, but if any gets in your mouth it is so gross tasting and metallic tasting , or if it gets on a cup you are drinking from the awful taste will get in your mouth. Too bad, it is a good product otherwise</li>
            <li> Aquaphor  is as good as  its write up  suggests. Very moist on the lips and protective, although it leaves a taste. A good buy and time for delivery was excellent.</li>
            <li> make your lips soft and beauty.</li>
            <li> This ointment makes my lips sting and tingle after applying.</li>
            <li> Has a horrible taste, no wonder it was on sale</li>
            <li> Helps with dry and cracked lips</li>
            <li> This brand is one of the best things you can use for chapped or dry lips.  This was a good price and you can&#x27;t always find this in stores.  I definitely recommend this product and other made by them.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor without SPF is the only lip balm I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction.  I need SPF protection for the summer, so I thought I would give this a try.  I ordered from Amazon since I can&#x27;t find it in stores.  So far it&#x27;s working great - no itchy rash.</li>
            <li> Following a small operation on my lip I was advised to use this product to help it recover. The dry cracking skin soon passed so I guess it worked, for which I am very glad.</li>
            <li> the lip protect works well, makes your lip soft and smooth</li>
            <li> goes on easily doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. soaks in and repairs lips and then keeps them from getting any more cracks.</li>
            <li> This product line is top notch, every one I use, it&#x27;s hydrating while not greasy</li>
            <li> Lip s can get burnt believe me, its weird. so get this. i love the products of aquaphor. you will as well.</li>
            <li> great product, keeps lips protected and soothed</li>
            <li> I like this, but actually prefer the Aquaphor healing ointment and tend to gravitate towards that more.  I found this made my lips tingle just a tiny bit (which may be the SPF component).  As I have exceptionally sensitive lips, even the slightest hint of a tingle in any product and I know I&#x27;m in trouble.  Don&#x27;t know if I will use this or not, as I prefer the healing ointment, which seems to work better under lipsticks and glosses.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my sun kissed and often chapped lips!</li>
            <li> Great product; it is soothing on the lips, not greasy.  I like to use it and let it set for about 3 minutes and then apply my lip color.  My lips feel smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the best for really dry lips.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the SPF30 but between the Aquaphor without SPF, which I apply to my lips when I am inside the house, and this Aquaphor with SPF which I apply when going out, the SPF Aquaphor feels a tiny bit burning on the lips and after a little while, it dries out faster than the Aquaphor without SPF. I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> Besides from the bad taste hehe it is just what I need,&lt;br /&gt;I usually use (and really recommend) Decubal&#x27;s Lips and Dry Spot Balm, however it&#x27;s hard to find in the US</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently taking Accutane for my skin and the most annoying side effect has been dry, flakey lips. The Aquaphor is the only thing that helps and the added sun protection is a bonus especially for beach or ski vacations. I love it! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This feels very nice on the lips.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did more harm than good. After using it less than a handful of times, my lips were dryer than ever and peeling horribly. Simply unbearable. Back to regular Aquaphor for me. It would be great to have SPF protection with the benefits of Aquaphor for daytime use, but this formula is terrible. And it does taste awful as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I was happy to see it being made with Sunscreen.  I will order this regularly!!!</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased.  It&#x27;s apparently tough to find lip balm with SPF in a certain price point.  Consistency is not as chalky as with stick balms, which I appreciate.</li>
