            <li>love it:)</li>
            <li>Perfect for on the go or wannabe teen makeup artists like myself.</li>
            <li>My favorite things about this are the mesh pockets and the material.</li>
            <li>It was a great price and for that I didn&#x27;t expect too much out of it.</li>
            <li>You should give this a try! :)</li>
            <li>love that it has zip pouches.</li>
            <li>Makes my life more organize and neat.</li>
            <li>The belt gives me easier access for somewhat hands free brush exchange!</li>
            <li>My daughter loved it, has quite a few brushes she is graduating from cosmotology school and is putting these to great use!</li>
            <li>they can do a much better job with that.</li>
            <li>I REALLY love this makeup apron.</li>
            <li>It is adjustable and holds so many brushes.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get the makeup brushes in the mail.</li>
            <li>The staff were friendly, and it was nice that there was a shuttle for us tro</li>
            <li>im satisfied with it and worth it ....holds everything nicely.</li>
            <li>such a great apron also really comes in handy!</li>
            <li>The apron is easy to clean and I love that all of Shany&#x27;s products are PETA certified.</li>
            <li>It will be easily reinforced.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>very stylish and elegant, plenty of room for carrying my makeup tools, made of beautiful and thick fabric which looks like satin&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too large belt, but nice for keeping brushes.</li>
            <li>I bought this item to help me with a school play and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>This was lightly used and despite that, the strap broke within 2 months.</li>
            <li>I can fit 2-3 brushes in each brush slot.</li>
            <li>The delivery was also very quick and made it in time for me to be able to use this product ;)</li>
            <li>The Brush belt is made of nice soft and durable fabric that is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m pretty sure she has something like this already,which she does.</li>
            <li>It is adjustable which is a good thing as some people have bigger waist like me.</li>
            <li>Belt looks great and is very functional with pockets and space for tall and short brushes.  </li>
            <li>But to be honest the brushes are full and who doesnt like extra brushes   </li>
            <li>It fits all my brushes nicely and the material is soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>But she told me that she loves this and uses it everyday its so handle and easy with all the pockets and pouches , and it makes her life so much easy and it very light weight and fits alot of her brushes.</li>
            <li>It was easy to clean and stayed put when having to run around quickly and multiple places.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made and adjustable strap is too big.</li>
            <li>It is exactly like one shown in the picture and described (thumbs up on that)  </li>
            <li>Better luck hopefully on the next belt I order.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure, prior to ordering, if this belt came with the brushes that are shown in the picture</li>
            <li>I have had this belt for about 2 weeks now and it has held up very well!  </li>
            <li>Holds SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>I love that you can put little things in the pockets and see them for easy access.</li>
            <li>it holds my barber shears and combs and clips and razors quite nicely and the belt part has held up better than the negative reviews have said!  </li>
            <li>The black apron will come in handy.</li>
            <li>After being embarrassed and having to ask the photographer at the photo shoot for safety pins, the other side had ripped off within the first hour of ever touching the product.</li>
            <li>Purchased belt but was to large in width and also straps are cheaply made ripped the 3rd day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have a few touch up items and enough room for disposables to do on the spot sampling.  </li>
            <li>Look like a real pro while doing your makeup.</li>
            <li>My daughter really like it...</li>
            <li>She is very petite</li>
            <li>I expected more even at this price point.</li>
            <li>The picture you have displayed for this product is VERY misleading to the customer.</li>
            <li>THIS BELT IS REALLY STURDY AND HAS ALL THE ROOM YOU NEED.</li>
            <li>the straps do not adjust to fit smaller size people</li>
            <li>perhaps a different color belt (like red), with the ability to make it smaller would be a GREAT addition.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like the apron itself.</li>
            <li>However, the straps ripped out after 5 uses the first time and then was shipped a new one</li>
            <li>so it was a little big for her waist, but other than that it&#x27;s awesome...</li>
            <li>This item has several large and useful pockets.  </li>
            <li>The apron/belt seems like its decent quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re soooooo soft!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic, well made, comfortable, a little big.</li>
            <li>In the photo it looks like a great belt unfortunately it was not.</li>
            <li>Its really easy to reach for brushes when you&#x27;re doing your makeup, a definite must have for future makeup artists!</li>
            <li>:  The only thing is...is that it is made to fit a larger waist.  </li>
            <li>this belt is stiff enough to use for shears and does hold them quite nice around your waist</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t fit as tight as I would like.</li>
            <li>They brush holder is WAY to large and doesn&#x27;t tighten to anyone except an XXL waist line DON&#x27;T BUY unless your a much larger person</li>
            <li>It fits a lot of brushes, had little zipper compartments to put tools in and has an adjustable strap so you can fit it around your waist.</li>
            <li>have had any problem so far.   </li>
            <li>Planned to use it on a photo shoot and within two minutes of taking it out of the packaging one of the sides of the belts had ripped off completely.</li>
            <li>The brushes were so light weight that there is nothing heavy that would tear it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this belt if you apply makeup daily and need something like this to assist you when applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I must admit I refused the idea of wearing a makeup apron for so long... until I worked in an outside photo shoot and realized how much I needed it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update after the next 2 shows I do to see how it holds up in action.</li>
            <li>therefore, if you are petite, you will have to make big adjustments, as in whip out your sewing machine and get busy</li>
            <li>Also would be fun gift for any little girl!</li>
            <li>Ive had it for a long time and the leather still looks new (no wrinkles nor any white spots !!!</li>
            <li>Was disappointed to see I hadn&#x27;t gotten the great deal I thought I had... it didn&#x27;t come with any brushes at all.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always using it has many pockets for business card or small little items a variety of slots for any size of makeup</li>

            <li> It fits a lot of brushes, had little zipper compartments to put tools in and has an adjustable strap so you can fit it around your waist.</li>
            <li> have had any problem so far.   </li>
            <li> Planned to use it on a photo shoot and within two minutes of taking it out of the packaging one of the sides of the belts had ripped off completely.</li>
            <li> The brushes were so light weight that there is nothing heavy that would tear it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this belt if you apply makeup daily and need something like this to assist you when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I must admit I refused the idea of wearing a makeup apron for so long... until I worked in an outside photo shoot and realized how much I needed it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update after the next 2 shows I do to see how it holds up in action.</li>
            <li> therefore, if you are petite, you will have to make big adjustments, as in whip out your sewing machine and get busy</li>
            <li> Also would be fun gift for any little girl!</li>
            <li> Ive had it for a long time and the leather still looks new (no wrinkles nor any white spots !!!</li>
            <li> Was disappointed to see I hadn&#x27;t gotten the great deal I thought I had... it didn&#x27;t come with any brushes at all.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always using it has many pockets for business card or small little items a variety of slots for any size of makeup</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the strap broke the first time I use it</li>
            <li> The black cover has a shine of a soft leather   </li>
            <li> So because of thisbi was not surprised that the one side of the belt ripped.</li>
            <li> Not a HUGE deal since I have a ton of brushes already, but I always want extra.</li>
            <li> the one thing that seems to be a consistent problem is the belt; it is way too big and actually, awkward.</li>
            <li> Very soft and delicate brushes!</li>
            <li> plenty of room for the other brushes that you should purchase from SHANY.</li>
            <li> Only con if you are a slim person you may have a little trouble with the belt.</li>
            <li> I was going to send it back because of the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> i am a size 2 and there is no way to adjust it down to that.</li>
            <li> but the belt I received did NOT come with any brushes which was disappointing because I don&#x27;t really need the belt.</li>
            <li> and I use my belts heavily.</li>
            <li> I use it over the shoulder and am small so there is nothing pulling.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend who is a makeup artist as a gift , and i thought it would be ridiculous</li>
            <li> Little disappointing that they weren&#x27;t included.</li>
            <li> so I will not vouch for any other products, but this was definitely not a very pleasant experience :(.</li>
            <li> several reviews others had received brushes but mine did not with any brushes just the apron very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the case does not bump the client while cutting the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;neg</li>
            <li> and you still would like this belt than you MUST modify the buckle part by cutting one side and making the belt part shorter.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> I honeslty have nothing bad to say about this brush</li>
            <li> (bad, I know)</li>
            <li> However, when I opened my package I was sadly disappointed to see that it was just the apron.</li>
            <li> I was almost disappointed that I had ordered this belt.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed I had thought it came with brushes and reading</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice product!!!!  I would definitely purchase again...  It holds a lot of brushes and this item can be rolled just in case you have to travel...  I will be telling all my makeup artist friends to purchase this item....</li>
            <li> I bought this item to help me with a school play and it was fantastic. It was easy to clean and stayed put when having to run around quickly and multiple places. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> They brush holder is WAY to large and doesn&#x27;t tighten to anyone except an XXL waist line DON&#x27;T BUY unless your a much larger person</li>
            <li> Good product works well. Only con if you are a slim person you may have a little trouble with the belt. Love this belt but it doesn&#x27;t fit as tight as I would like.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner at doing makeup and I needed a nice makeup belt that can hold a lot of brushes and this one was perfect and professional looking which is a plus. The delivery was also very quick and made it in time for me to be able to use this product ;)</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size for a brush belt. It fits a lot of brushes, had little zipper compartments to put tools in and has an adjustable strap so you can fit it around your waist. Definitely recommend if you need a brush belt.</li>
            <li> It is exactly like one shown in the picture and described (thumbs up on that)  The black cover has a shine of a soft leather   Ive had it for a long time and the leather still looks new (no wrinkles nor any white spots !!! and that is what I was looking for)  So I bought it just for the leather/cotton belt cuz I was happy with my own brushes  But to be honest the brushes are full and who doesnt like extra brushes   I tend to wash my brushes and I havnt have had any problem so far.   The brushes come in different sizes which gives you the ability to work the details out  Im impressed  I recommend this product</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made and adjustable strap is too big.</li>
            <li> Awesome product served its purpose. It was just what I needed for a great price. The staff were friendly, and it was nice that there was a shuttle for us tro get over to the casino. I would not stay there again, but the trip served its purpose</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fiance. She had another one of the same brand and it was damaged beyond repair after a lot of use... She loved it and it works great</li>
            <li> very good quality, had for over a year and still not one tear or hole</li>
            <li> I honeslty have nothing bad to say about this brush belt!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a makeup artist so I&#x27;m always using it has many pockets for business card or small little items a variety of slots for any size of makeup brushes!&lt;br /&gt;A must have</li>
            <li> I must admit I refused the idea of wearing a makeup apron for so long... until I worked in an outside photo shoot and realized how much I needed it! I&#x27;m so glad I found this one! SHANY is a great affordable brand and let me tell you this apron is well worh every dollar! very stylish and elegant, plenty of room for carrying my makeup tools, made of beautiful and thick fabric which looks like satin&lt;br /&gt;Great quality!!</li>
            <li> This makeup belt is very nice, delivery was fast and I am very impressed with how many brushes it holds, fits around my waist very well. I highly recommend this belt if you apply makeup daily and need something like this to assist you when applying makeup.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the size and pockets. Planned to use it on a photo shoot and within two minutes of taking it out of the packaging one of the sides of the belts had ripped off completely. I was not stretching it; the belt was already too big for my waist on its tightest setting. After being embarrassed and having to ask the photographer at the photo shoot for safety pins, the other side had ripped off within the first hour of ever touching the product. I have never ordered from Shany Cosmetics before so I will not vouch for any other products, but this was definitely not a very pleasant experience :(. Better luck hopefully on the next belt I order.</li>
            <li> same as the picture....im satisfied with it and worth it ....holds everything nicely. truly does hold up to 25 brushes and more...love it:)</li>
            <li> I cannot get enough of Shany&#x27;s Makeup Brushes with the Make up Apron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are so cute and handy! Perfect for on the go or wannabe teen makeup artists like myself. The Apron is perfect, I feel so professional!</li>
            <li> My favorite things about this are the mesh pockets and the material. I love that you can put little things in the pockets and see them for easy access. Also, I tend to rub powder off of my brushes onto my apron (bad, I know) so I love that this fabric is easy to wash! Still suggest hand-washing though to keep any laundry soap perfumes from getting onto your brushes, don&#x27;t want any chemicals on clients!</li>
            <li> This belt has good sized pockets for most brushes and the little pockets are excellent for storing products!! Again, an ideal gift</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and this apron! These are an excellent purchase and definitely worth the price. I bought this item mainly for the belt, but the brushes are quite nice and an excellent addition to my collection! The apron is easy to clean and I love that all of Shany&#x27;s products are PETA certified. Its really easy to reach for brushes when you&#x27;re doing your makeup, a definite must have for future makeup artists!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my cousin for christmas and she LOVES it! I recommend it to everyone. I should have brought one for myself.</li>
            <li> Im so happy with this product! It fits all my brushes nicely and the material is soft and pretty. Really good stuff!</li>
            <li> The belt had enough space for all my brushes and the holes were big enough, which is what I was worried about. It was a great price and for that I didn&#x27;t expect too much out of it. I do trade shows with a cosmetics brand and I use my belts heavily. So because of thisbi was not surprised that the one side of the belt ripped. It will be easily reinforced. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed I had thought it came with brushes and reading several reviews others had received brushes but mine did not with any brushes just the apron very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love Shany!! These brushes, like all of them, are amazing. I just can&#x27;t get enough! Look like a real pro while doing your makeup. This is the perfect little set and perfect way to store them. And they&#x27;re soooooo soft!!</li>
            <li> All of these brushes are wroth the price! Very soft and delicate brushes! The black apron will come in handy. (wearing it makes you feel like a pro) You should give this a try! :)</li>
            <li> This item has several large and useful pockets.  I am a make-up artist and I use it all the time.  My only complaint is that the strap broke the first time I use it and it is way too big around the waist.  I put it on the smallest extension and it just hangs off.  I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and weigh 130lbs.  I have a 27 inch waist.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed to see I hadn&#x27;t gotten the great deal I thought I had... it didn&#x27;t come with any brushes at all.  The belt itself is perfect for when I&#x27;m doing fashion and trade shows.  It&#x27;s great to have a few touch up items and enough room for disposables to do on the spot sampling.  I&#x27;ll update after the next 2 shows I do to see how it holds up in action.</li>
            <li> the pouch is great. love that it has zip pouches. plenty of room for the other brushes that you should purchase from SHANY. I like the touch very nice. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great set of brush with a price you can not bet! such a great apron also really comes in handy!</li>
            <li> It is adjustable which is a good thing as some people have bigger waist like me. Easy to use and it could hold up to 25 brushes. Makes my life more organize and neat.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure, prior to ordering, if this belt came with the brushes that are shown in the picture so I took a chance and ordered anyway. Several of the reviews left indicated that it DOES but the belt I received did NOT come with any brushes which was disappointing because I don&#x27;t really need the belt. The apron/belt seems like its decent quality but I haven&#x27;t used it yet so I can&#x27;t say as to how it will hold up with regular use. Just be forewarned that the brushes do NOT come with it.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this makeup apron came with a zipper pouch! It&#x27;s perfect for tissues and q tips! The belt gives me easier access for somewhat hands free brush exchange! perfect for those who love their brushes like me! Also would be fun gift for any little girl!</li>
            <li> My daughter really like it... She is very petite so it was a little big for her waist, but other than that it&#x27;s awesome...</li>
            <li> This was lightly used and despite that, the strap broke within 2 months. I expected more even at this price point.</li>
            <li> The Brush belt is made of nice soft and durable fabric that is easy to clean.  Brush belt holds multiple brushes and extra pockets to store brushes.</li>
            <li> Love the material, love everything about it! I can fit 2-3 brushes in each brush slot. Perfect for MUA&#x27;s on the go!</li>
            <li> Daughter in hair school is very happy.  She loved the set and thought it was perfect as she is a professional makeup artist now.</li>
            <li> Belt looks great and is very functional with pockets and space for tall and short brushes.  However, the straps ripped out after 5 uses the first time and then was shipped a new one and it ripped out in 2 uses.  I use it over the shoulder and am small so there is nothing pulling.  The brushes were so light weight that there is nothing heavy that would tear it.  Cannot believe manufacturing and quality control allowed these to be shipped out.  I had my last brush belt for 15 years and it never tore with tons of stuff in it.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get the makeup brushes in the mail. However, when I opened my package I was sadly disappointed to see that it was just the apron. The picture you have displayed for this product is VERY misleading to the customer. I will be returning this item for a refund and then buying another set of Shany brushes with the hope that the brushes are in fact included with the product.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it, has quite a few brushes she is graduating from cosmotology school and is putting these to great use!</li>
            <li> THIS BELT IS REALLY STURDY AND HAS ALL THE ROOM YOU NEED. IT ALSO FEATURES MULTIPLE POCKETS WITH MESH AND ZIPPER TO PUT IN YOUR TOOLS. VERY HAPPY WITH THIS BUY.</li>
            <li> This is great for any makeup artist that need to grab and brush or 2. Great price came in on time and good quality</li>
            <li> the straps do not adjust to fit smaller size people</li>
            <li> Gift for grandaughter but think she will be very happy with it.  It looks good and I believe it will wear well.</li>
            <li> i like the material of this apron. the one thing that seems to be a consistent problem is the belt; it is way too big and actually, awkward. they can do a much better job with that. perhaps a different color belt (like red), with the ability to make it smaller would be a GREAT addition. i am a size 2 and there is no way to adjust it down to that. therefore, if you are petite, you will have to make big adjustments, as in whip out your sewing machine and get busy or it is simply not for you.</li>
            <li> Too large belt, but nice for keeping brushes.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like the apron itself. It&#x27;s fantastic, well made, comfortable, a little big. I thought it would come with brushes since the photo has them, and it had no brushes. Not a HUGE deal since I have a ton of brushes already, but I always want extra. Little disappointing that they weren&#x27;t included.</li>
            <li> pos:  I was almost disappointed that I had ordered this belt.  i got to looking at the picture after I ordered this belt and it looked like it was made the way several aprons I have at work were made and with the same material.  I was going to send it back because of the negative reviews.  Boy was I wrong!  I have had this belt for about 2 weeks now and it has held up very well!  it holds my barber shears and combs and clips and razors quite nicely and the belt part has held up better than the negative reviews have said!  this belt is stiff enough to use for shears and does hold them quite nice around your waist the case does not bump the client while cutting the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;neg:  The only thing is...is that it is made to fit a larger waist.  if you have a skinny waist (size 8 or smaller women - or size 30 or smaller men) and you still would like this belt than you MUST modify the buckle part by cutting one side and making the belt part shorter.</li>
            <li> I REALLY love this makeup apron. Holds SO MUCH! Great quality too!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend who is a makeup artist as a gift , and i thought it would be ridiculous cause you know shes a makeup artist i&#x27;m pretty sure she has something like this already,which she does. But she told me that she loves this and uses it everyday its so handle and easy with all the pockets and pouches , and it makes her life so much easy and it very light weight and fits alot of her brushes.</li>
            <li> This is so awesome!  It is adjustable and holds so many brushes. It comes in handy when I&#x27;m helping my friends with their makeup. I load this up before I go and I have everything I need in one handy spot!</li>
            <li> Purchased belt but was to large in width and also straps are cheaply made ripped the 3rd day. In the photo it looks like a great belt unfortunately it was not.</li>
