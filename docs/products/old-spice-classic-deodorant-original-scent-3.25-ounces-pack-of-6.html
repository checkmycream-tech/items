            <li>GREAT DEODORANT</li>
            <li>I got this 6 pack for my hubby, great price on it and</li>
            <li>One time in a drug store I decided to smell all the deodorants and decide which one I liked the best.</li>
            <li>it does get 5 STARS for a really great deal.</li>
            <li>at a great price, so you may want to check yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either way, it works great on *preventing* odor, not just covering it</li>
            <li>so I am happy to give this one another go.</li>
            <li>so I am happy to give this one another go.</li>
            <li>Works great, no aluminum.</li>
            <li>I still give it two stars, instead of one, because of the great memories I&#x27;ve had with this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I can smell great again (eh?).</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>Good price, and great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective, no overpowering aroma,long-lasting and not at all intrusive!</li>
            <li>Scent lasts a good while, great value when you buy the 6 pack.</li>
            <li>pleasant smelling as always from time immemorial;</li>
            <li>Great product, excellent scent, great longevity, and incredibly affordable - hope to see Old Spice keep this formula and fragrance around</li>
            <li>it is good</li>
            <li>I was delighted.</li>
            <li>The 6-pack is a good value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Finding it online with good pricing was a bonus.</li>
            <li>Good fragrance- manly.  </li>
            <li>smells good.</li>
            <li>I loved that but did not know how to have it.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and am very glad that I do.</li>
            <li>Love the way this stuff smells &amp; works!  </li>
            <li>Love them both!</li>
            <li>a guy should smell like, and works freaking amazing.</li>
            <li>so try that kind.</li>
            <li>Considering the alternative, this product does the trick nicely.  </li>
            <li>So I already liked it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to always have a stick handy when you run out.</li>
            <li>IMO this original scent is a great smelling deodorant.</li>
            <li>But the classic is still the best.</li>
            <li>However, this version, which is the classic scent is a perfect balance of protection and fragrance.  </li>
            <li>smelling good always seem to work out better :).</li>
            <li>Not as good as I remember it from years ago, but still better than most.</li>
            <li>I am now very popular for my smell, which I attribute to the Old Spice stick and good odor genes.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works exactly as I expect and has a great smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild to your skin, cheap, and has a great scent.</li>
            <li>My favorite?  </li>
            <li>what more can a person want?</li>
            <li>The scent is notable, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>but the fact of the matter is it works and chicks love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>Ok I&#x27;m writing a review of deodorant.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>What more to say.</li>
            <li>love the scent, wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li>The scent is better than body odor, I suppose, but it has no staying power.</li>
            <li>MORE CAN I SAY ?  </li>
            <li>SMELLS MANLY AND REFRESHING</li>
            <li>I should have done more research before I bought this product</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Found a better deal at awl mart after the fact.</li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant of all time.</li>
            <li>As a barbershop owner he has to think a lot about the body while standing over the top of men&#x27;s heads.</li>
            <li>But I can say from experience, this is one of my top 3 favourites.</li>
            <li>My niece even smelled me once after a &amp;#34;French bath&amp;#34; and she remarked I smelled interesting</li>
            <li>Ok, so I don&#x27;t use this my husband does.</li>
            <li>but I am still satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>love this product</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>Be sure to note this is a deodorant and not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>Hubby&#x27;s favorite deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Great price for a high quality deodorant.</li>
            <li>good smell is long-lasting, even when I use it in Vietnam whose hot tropical climate keeps me sweating all the time.</li>
            <li>I  have signed up to get this a subscription which is real good deal especially with he free shipping.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a good supply and not have to head to the store as frequently.</li>
            <li>added bonus  from Amazon on this product is that you get free Super-Saver shipping if you buy $25 or more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no stickiness or clumping with this product which is important for most people.</li>
            <li>It was so popular that whenever we smelt this, we knew exactly that was an overseas Vietnamese :-)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad to see a 6 pack available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price for a lot of deodorant (probably too much).</li>
            <li>great product, a reasonable price, and delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>Received the right item that I ordered at a good price and delivery was quick with no damage, will shop again.</li>
            <li>Probably will for years to come because it&#x27;s the only thing that seems to work for me (and smells good, too!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many others, and always return to the original.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, with just one significant problem:  </li>
            <li>Easy application.  </li>
            <li>Easy to find color.  </li>
            <li>if your odor is strong, you might need something stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would strongly consider all buyers to avoid alcohol-based deodorants - to avoid complications of allergic reactions or side effects.</li>
            <li>Never felt the need.&lt;br /&gt;Others are either too strong or smell like perfume.</li>
            <li>It smells really strong when you take the cap off</li>
            <li>but once you apply it its not too strong at all.</li>
            <li>and I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the whole transaction.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I&#x27;ve used (and liked) for years.</li>
            <li>Spice Classic in the Original Scent is as good as it can get with the ever-attractive original fragrance worn by many of our grandfathers and still to this day manages to appease the ladies&#x27; sense of smell.</li>
            <li>The product itself seems fine, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out.  </li>
            <li>For deodorant purposes, it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>This deodorant works just fine.</li>
            <li>Classic Original Scent is that it works, smells almost as good as cologne, and isn&#x27;t visible on your clothes.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I wish they still were available but this is the closest thing to them.</li>
            <li>I still enjoy its effectiveness and non offensive scent.</li>
            <li>Want a different kind next time good price good value bang for buck</li>
            <li>While it is still not the safest, most natural option (for those of you that care), it is time-tested and effective</li>
            <li>While it is still not the safest, most natural option (for those of you that care), it is time-tested and effective</li>
            <li>I suspect this is a problem with most deodorants, but it feels like a bit of &amp;#34;planned obsolescence&amp;#34; to me, that is, getting you to buy more than you would need to if the caps and casing really &amp;#34;held it all in&amp;#34; until use.  </li>
            <li>: I received the \\&quot;brown label\\&quot; original scent which is what I  wanted.</li>
            <li>Its the original scent.</li>
            <li>I also found the scent to be light yet masculine and refreshing so it should appeal to most people considering this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We could not find the Original in the stores.  </li>
            <li>Smells clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin like other deodorants do, it doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts, and most importantly it makes me smell good.</li>
            <li>The good news is that this redesigned \\&quot;silver line\\&quot; actually IS the original scented, green-colored deodorant.</li>
            <li>, I am out of the U.S. and you always ask large amounts and have started using the product for more than 20 years, and I would advise every one buy from him without hesitation.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that spicey odor, it is more life pure alcohol or some thing</li>
            <li>This Old Spics Classic Deodorant pack is great.</li>
            <li>Of course sometimes I go through phases where my armpits are exceptionally stinky and on these rare occasions (like 3 times a year) I have to apply Old Spice deodorant up to 3 times</li>
            <li>Best smell in the world, but hard to find.</li>
            <li>So first off this is a really great value for six, big sticks of deodorant.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on a budget and deep some good deodorant</li>
            <li>This deodorant doesn&#x27;t hurt me like antiperspirants and the more modern scents out there.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is only good for about an hour.</li>
            <li>Great Product, easily refill household goods through amazon orders every few months.</li>
            <li>Strong alcohol smell when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>Other than that, smells great.</li>
            <li>Once applied, you&#x27;re lucky if it lasts for an hour -- after that, you won&#x27;t want to give anyone a hug.</li>
            <li>Scent disappears quickly</li>
            <li>just a quick caution before you buy a case of it.  </li>
            <li>quick and as advertised</li>
            <li>If they have this particular one, even better.</li>
            <li>had tremendous b.o. after bathing &amp; using this.</li>
            <li>Love the classic scent.</li>
            <li>I like this deodorant very much - it has the great classic Old Spice smell.  </li>
            <li>I love Old Spice original</li>
            <li>I love the original scent of Old Spice and have added it to my subscription to amazon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a smell made you smooth in the 70&#x27;s, 80&#x27;s, 90&#x27;s, 2000&#x27;s, and it continues to do exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Health wise this won&#x27;t hurt you in the long run.</li>
            <li>It smells good, lasts all day long and my wife likes how it smells on me.</li>
            <li>I have used Old Spice original (classic, I suppose is the same thing) for years and have enjoyed the pleasant scent and have had no reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The original scent classic is like the original cylindrical tube of the 60s.  </li>
            <li>A smile comment on the stick.  </li>
            <li>Works as expected for a good price.</li>
            <li>So far no luck, but I do smell better.</li>
            <li>I used to think this was a nice present</li>
            <li>I was glad to find this Old Spice Classic that I have been using for many years for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It evaporates pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is my brand and the price is right.</li>
            <li>The variation on the original scent has been banished to the &#x27;High Endurance&#x27; line being mislabeled as \\&quot;Original.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found most gels that my friends are fond of just don&#x27;t last long for me but for some reason this product lasts until I find time in the evenings for a nice shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For most of my life I&#x27;ve used the Old Spice High Endurance Deodorant, so I tried the Classic / Original for kicks.</li>
            <li>very fast shipping</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I must say that I absolutely love the classic Old Spice.</li>
            <li>For the record, I love Old Spice Classic deodorant and still use it to this day.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased to see that Old Spice has discontinued the use of triclosan in this classic line of deodorants.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased to see that Old Spice has discontinued the use of triclosan in this classic line of deodorants.</li>
            <li>First, let me state that I love the smell of Old Spice Classic.</li>
            <li>but I  got what I wanted in my first shipment.</li>
            <li>The order came on time, was exactly as ordered</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant my husband will use, and his having used it for most of his life means it works well.  </li>
            <li>Well, you don&#x27;t get more product for your money but it does double duty.</li>
            <li>I think this was my first deodorant when I was&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>husband only likes this brand ,so pleased i could purchase this online .</li>
            <li>TO FINDING A BETTER PRICE LOCALLY.</li>
            <li>I would attribute this to the denatured alcohol, which is the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>When you first apply it, it may still smell like this.</li>
            <li>the white one is better.</li>
            <li>For those of you who are interested, it seems to kill the smell of the pits for another 2-3 days in that situation which is a miracle.</li>
            <li>a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more affordable to just buy this deodorant at your local Dollar Store instead of the price-gouging online way.  </li>
            <li>I bought a 6-pack and by the time I got to the 5th and 6th stick, upon opening them for the first time, they had already dissipated a bit.  </li>
            <li>Does not last as long but leaves no tacky residue and smells great.</li>
            <li>And its in bulk and cheaper than a (insert funny analogy)</li>
            <li>The one and only Old Spice Classic deodorant used by generation after generation, and for good reason.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s there to say about Old Spice original scent deodorant?</li>
            <li>Besides, it has that timeless classic Old Spice  scent!!!!!</li>
            <li>, I would not change it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and last for a very long time which is important in our Israeli weather.</li>
            <li>But the fact that the original classic type was available in a large quantity and a low price made me feel like I couldn&#x27;t pass this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s objective of course, but I much prefer the Old Spice Pure Sport, which smells a lot more fresh.</li>
            <li>Yes, yes, this is the original formula Old Spice, that we used to get in the nice round container.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I strongly recommend you purchase this from your local store.</li>
            <li>, so get some Certain Dri for bedtime and apply this stuff in the AM to be covered for the day.</li>
            <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find Old Spice Classic Original in the store</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Classic, Original Scent, Deodorant for over 15 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As of writing my original review for this product I have discontinued using it and switched over to the High Endurance line of Old Spice&#x27;s deodorants.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>When I discovered that it was still made, but only available in the US, I thought a trip was called for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Ok was just as I expected.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to shop online and save some $$.  </li>
            <li>Who wants to trek to the drugstore to get this.</li>
            <li>very convenient way to buy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Around 2002, I was given one stick of Old Spice - Fresh.</li>
            <li>Makes shopping so much easier.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works very well.</li>
            <li>This was used as a gift and it was received with much appreciation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get it locally when its available.</li>
            <li>Old spice has many versions but only one that is just deodorant.  </li>
            <li>My husband has been using this specific Old Spice product for many years.</li>
            <li>yeah, if you love old spice like me, then hesitate no further my friend.</li>
            <li>Far cry from what i would consider was the original old spice scent and feel.</li>
            <li>Old Spice Original was for my husband whose skin is allergic and/or intolerant to the &amp;#34;special&amp;#34;  newer versions of Old Spice that irritate his underarms and cause a rash with repeated use.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t always find this type (original scent/formula) of this deodorant at a local retailer.</li>
            <li>The only difference is the \\&quot;Original Scent\\&quot; label at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>Classic is classic for a reason!</li>
            <li>He is so grateful to finally find and use the original version.</li>
            <li>Classic scent for a classic guy!</li>
            <li>Ok so it looked a great deal for the price, but man was i disappointed once i started using it.</li>
            <li>&quot; versions of Old Spice because the fragrance is way too strong and gives me a giant headache every time.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, Old Spice is ignoring 70 Million underarms in Canada with their original scent since they stopped producing the little red tube of original scent.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the internet it is available and arrived promptly through Amazon (without prohibition at the border..</li>
            <li>Some of these older reviews refer to the older packaging which featured both a \\&quot;brown line\\&quot; and a \\&quot;silver line\\&quot;, the earlier of which was the true original scent and the latter a variation.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it doesn&#x27;t smell like Old Spice Classic, it is very chemically smelling and has a high amount of Alcohol which is what I believe caused my irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a reason that Old Spice has been around for decades - not because old folks are still alive to enjoy it, but because the scent appeals across the generations.  </li>
            <li>The original scent is pretty rough in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Anyway Old Spice deodorant lasts all day if you apply it first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I avoid deodorants with aluminum because higher levels of aluminum have been found in the brains of people with alzheimers but the plethora of natural deodorants I tried did not work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Old Spice Classic Wide Solid in the Original Scent exclusively for about two years now (and off and on for many years before that).</li>
            <li>Receiving 6 Old Spice sticks at a regular interval is working out fine for me.  </li>
            <li>I did nothing but make fun of Old Spice and how Old man it was</li>
            <li>A classic.</li>
            <li>A classic</li>
            <li>classic is where its at</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic.</li>
            <li>This is a classic deodorant, not something that messes with your pores to try to keep you from sweating.</li>
            <li>hence the High Endurance</li>
            <li>it was the high endurance</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;High</li>
            <li>The ingredients in this stick are also cause for concern considering I came to realize that this stick contains triclosan, a carcinogen, whereas the High Endurance deodorants do not.</li>
            <li>Really, using the classic original scent, there&#x27;s no need to use any other cologne or after shave.</li>
            <li>It really is the old scent.</li>
            <li>I normally use.</li>
            <li>The container is a nice solid red color that stands out, especially if you accidentally drop it in nature.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you old spice/procter &amp; gamble for keeping the product at 3.25oz and not shrinking it like so many others down to 3 or 2.7</li>
            <li>I tried several other brands, but always found them to be chalky or have a very strong chemical-type smell.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who gets any negative reaction to antiperspirants can switch to this Original Scent Old Spice Deodorant and feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>I use Old Spice deodorants regularly from the High Endurance to Fresh Collection.</li>
            <li>i live in Kenya.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In sum, buy it, but buy it were you can immediately swap it for a new one if needed.</li>
            <li>We both like the classic Old Spice scent, and he likes that it *doesn&#x27;t* contain antiperspirant in addition to deodorant.  </li>
            <li>The classic scent is by far my favourite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After trying this, I can see why Old Spice is a timeless classic.</li>
            <li>Whether you are 20 or 80, you should be using old spice classic.  </li>
            <li>Poor hubby says it&#x27;s not quite strong enough any more; he needs to use Sports Enhanced Old Spice!</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this deodorant for as long as I can remember - we&#x27;ve been married 32 years - &#x27;nuff said!</li>
            <li>but I am docking 2 stars from my original 5 star rating for this product due to these developments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I am docking 2 stars from my original 5 star rating for this product due to these developments.    </li>
            <li>Its Old Spice!</li>
            <li>As far as I could tell, all the labels say Old Spice Classic on them then the scent followed closer to the bottom of the product.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and manly, without overpowering other colognes or soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Old Spice is powerful enough to eliminate the stench of sweaty stinky armpits on a mid summer 100-degree humid day with lots of hazy sunshine and intense outdoor work.  </li>
            <li>This way, I don&#x27;t run out and have to pay whatever a store wants to charge me, don&#x27;t have to make a special trip (waste gas) and with Prime shipping, no additional shipping or sales tax.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using Old Spice Classic, I&#x27;ve gone from being a 16 year old boy to a being a 26 year old man.</li>
            <li>It goes on slightly wet, but quickly dries and doesn&#x27;t stain his clothing.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smelling strongly of some type of alcohol and a little old spice smell.</li>
            <li>Most of this was due to natural aging, but Old Spice almost definitely played a role.</li>
            <li>Same price as buying 6 individual sticks at Super One</li>
            <li>I had a hard time trying to figure out how many stars to give this.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a strange acidic smell (it even sometimes hurts when you first apply it)</li>
            <li>I have even on the occasion spotted my GF stealing my Old Spice and using it.</li>
            <li>Also if it wasn&#x27;t for Old Spice</li>
            <li>What I like about Old Spice</li>
            <li>Been using Old Spice all my life.  </li>
            <li>Old Spice has 2 types of almost identically packaged \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; style.  </li>
            <li>I have used Old Spice for some time now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorants since I was an 8 year old boy.</li>
            <li>Old spice won out and I have been buying it since.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want him any where near me when he wears it.</li>
            <li>Old Spice, always.</li>
            <li>Been using Old Spice for years.</li>
            <li>Until nearly a month ago when I discovered this on Amazon and all the memories returned.</li>
            <li>and uh, neither one of us ever developed any sweaty contagious armpit fungus</li>
            <li>What did Old Spice change in their ingredients?</li>
            <li>I get these in bulk and add them to kits i give to young kids.</li>
            <li>This stuff cannot possibly be an Old Spice product.</li>
            <li>This six pack won&#x27;t get you drunk, but it&#x27;ll make you smell good.</li>
            <li>Having tried tons of deodorant products and brands, I settled on this one for its mild aroma and long lasting protection.</li>
            <li>The brown label is the Green colored deodorant and is what I would call the original scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both will say \\&quot;Original Round Stick</li>
            <li>It turns out my armpits do not bode well with the alcohol mixed into the ingredients of this particular cocktail of &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; inhibiting deodorant.  </li>
            <li>They caused mild irritation, a bit of a rash, and slight hypersensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use mostly just old spice, but this one is no good</li>
            <li>the redesigned label, you&#x27;ll want to read it carefully before ordering as the scent is shown on a colored banned about 4/5th of the way down from the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big proponent of High Endurance</li>
            <li>It helps to reduce sweat, smells great but is not overwhelming, and does not irritate my skin like other deodorants do (including other Old Spice</li>
            <li>is it normal for two men to share the same container of deodorant?  </li>
            <li>when buying &#x27;old spice&#x27; brand, go with the white colored deodorant stick versus the clear, gel-like deodorant.</li>
            <li>look forward to receiving Old Spice deodorant with a bottle of Old Spice aftershave every Christmas as a present.  </li>
            <li>the shipping was fast, combine with old spice shower gel and the smell will last all day long.</li>
            <li>It burnt my skin like no other deodorant before...</li>
            <li>I only wish they still made the original ROUND stick that was so convenient for travel...</li>
            <li>Although I ordered the wrong one, Original instead of Fresh</li>
            <li>I generally smell.  </li>
            <li>My brand, it is the CLEAR SOLID.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t always last all day if I am working outside and really working up a sweat, but this is obviously not an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>Before I begin, let me preface I am a fan of Old Spice and their various products.  </li>
            <li>10-20 years ago, any overseas Vietnamese who came back from the U.S.A. had this smell of Old Spice on them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various brands and tend to find Old Spice to be the one I prefer.</li>
            <li>Stick to the other Old Spice Classic products.</li>
            <li>Then by the time I get to work there is no smell which is fine, but after an hour if do anything more than sit at my desk I start to smell pretty awful.</li>
            <li>and I doubt seriously that USPS would process the return, therefore I am not returning it but using it to light my BBQ charcoal.</li>
            <li>This is the only Old Spice deodorant stick I can use, and it&#x27;s been my only deodorant for over forty years.</li>
            <li>Its smells like a strong alcohol wipe, and its not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li>Old Spice Classic Deodorant fights body odor with alcohol and triclosan instead of aluminum, and I have never experienced body odor with Old Spice Classic Deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorant for a long time.  </li>
            <li>For the first few applications, you could liken the scent to something of bug spray.</li>
            <li>One is a silver backing with black letters and the other is brown backing with white letters but both say \\&quot;original scent\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It not only takes away the bad smell; it replaces it with good smell (only works if you like the Old Spice smell).</li>
            <li>It goes on wet and burns a little (high alcohol content), but it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t leave the chalky residue that antiperspirants do</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve smelled bad and I&#x27;ve smelled good...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product, excellent scent, great longevity, and incredibly affordable - hope to see Old Spice keep this formula and fragrance around</li>
            <li> it is good</li>
            <li> I was delighted.</li>
            <li> The 6-pack is a good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Finding it online with good pricing was a bonus.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance- manly.  </li>
            <li> smells good.</li>
            <li> I loved that but did not know how to have it.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and am very glad that I do.</li>
            <li> Love the way this stuff smells &amp; works!  </li>
            <li> Love them both!</li>
            <li> a guy should smell like, and works freaking amazing.</li>
            <li> so try that kind.</li>
            <li> Considering the alternative, this product does the trick nicely.  </li>
            <li> So I already liked it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice to always have a stick handy when you run out.</li>
            <li> IMO this original scent is a great smelling deodorant.</li>
            <li> But the classic is still the best.</li>
            <li> However, this version, which is the classic scent is a perfect balance of protection and fragrance.  </li>
            <li> smelling good always seem to work out better :).</li>
            <li> Not as good as I remember it from years ago, but still better than most.</li>
            <li> I am now very popular for my smell, which I attribute to the Old Spice stick and good odor genes.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works exactly as I expect and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild to your skin, cheap, and has a great scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite?  </li>
            <li> what more can a person want?</li>
            <li> The scent is notable, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> but the fact of the matter is it works and chicks love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m writing a review of deodorant.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> What more to say.</li>
            <li> love the scent, wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> The scent is better than body odor, I suppose, but it has no staying power.</li>
            <li> MORE CAN I SAY ?  </li>
            <li> SMELLS MANLY AND REFRESHING</li>
            <li> I should have done more research before I bought this product</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> Found a better deal at awl mart after the fact.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant of all time.</li>
            <li> As a barbershop owner he has to think a lot about the body while standing over the top of men&#x27;s heads.</li>
            <li> But I can say from experience, this is one of my top 3 favourites.</li>
            <li> My niece even smelled me once after a &amp;#34;French bath&amp;#34; and she remarked I smelled interesting</li>
            <li> Ok, so I don&#x27;t use this my husband does.</li>
            <li> but I am still satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> love this product</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> Be sure to note this is a deodorant and not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Hubby&#x27;s favorite deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Great price for a high quality deodorant.</li>
            <li> good smell is long-lasting, even when I use it in Vietnam whose hot tropical climate keeps me sweating all the time.</li>
            <li> I  have signed up to get this a subscription which is real good deal especially with he free shipping.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a good supply and not have to head to the store as frequently.</li>
            <li> added bonus  from Amazon on this product is that you get free Super-Saver shipping if you buy $25 or more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no stickiness or clumping with this product which is important for most people.</li>
            <li> It was so popular that whenever we smelt this, we knew exactly that was an overseas Vietnamese :-)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad to see a 6 pack available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price for a lot of deodorant (probably too much).</li>
            <li> great product, a reasonable price, and delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> Received the right item that I ordered at a good price and delivery was quick with no damage, will shop again.</li>
            <li> Probably will for years to come because it&#x27;s the only thing that seems to work for me (and smells good, too!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many others, and always return to the original.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, with just one significant problem:  </li>
            <li> Easy application.  </li>
            <li> Easy to find color.  </li>
            <li> if your odor is strong, you might need something stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would strongly consider all buyers to avoid alcohol-based deodorants - to avoid complications of allergic reactions or side effects.</li>
            <li> Never felt the need.&lt;br /&gt;Others are either too strong or smell like perfume.</li>
            <li> It smells really strong when you take the cap off</li>
            <li> but once you apply it its not too strong at all.</li>
            <li> and I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with the whole transaction.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I&#x27;ve used (and liked) for years.</li>
            <li> Spice Classic in the Original Scent is as good as it can get with the ever-attractive original fragrance worn by many of our grandfathers and still to this day manages to appease the ladies&#x27; sense of smell.</li>
            <li> The product itself seems fine, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out.  </li>
            <li> For deodorant purposes, it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> This deodorant works just fine.</li>
            <li> Classic Original Scent is that it works, smells almost as good as cologne, and isn&#x27;t visible on your clothes.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I wish they still were available but this is the closest thing to them.</li>
            <li> I still enjoy its effectiveness and non offensive scent.</li>
            <li> Want a different kind next time good price good value bang for buck</li>
            <li> While it is still not the safest, most natural option (for those of you that care), it is time-tested and effective</li>
            <li> While it is still not the safest, most natural option (for those of you that care), it is time-tested and effective</li>
            <li> I suspect this is a problem with most deodorants, but it feels like a bit of &amp;#34;planned obsolescence&amp;#34; to me, that is, getting you to buy more than you would need to if the caps and casing really &amp;#34;held it all in&amp;#34; until use.  </li>
            <li> : I received the \\&quot;brown label\\&quot; original scent which is what I  wanted.</li>
            <li> Its the original scent.</li>
            <li> I also found the scent to be light yet masculine and refreshing so it should appeal to most people considering this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We could not find the Original in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Smells clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin like other deodorants do, it doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts, and most importantly it makes me smell good.</li>
            <li> The good news is that this redesigned \\&quot;silver line\\&quot; actually IS the original scented, green-colored deodorant.</li>
            <li> , I am out of the U.S. and you always ask large amounts and have started using the product for more than 20 years, and I would advise every one buy from him without hesitation.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that spicey odor, it is more life pure alcohol or some thing</li>
            <li> This Old Spics Classic Deodorant pack is great.</li>
            <li> Of course sometimes I go through phases where my armpits are exceptionally stinky and on these rare occasions (like 3 times a year) I have to apply Old Spice deodorant up to 3 times</li>
            <li> Best smell in the world, but hard to find.</li>
            <li> So first off this is a really great value for six, big sticks of deodorant.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on a budget and deep some good deodorant</li>
            <li> This deodorant doesn&#x27;t hurt me like antiperspirants and the more modern scents out there.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant is only good for about an hour.</li>
            <li> Great Product, easily refill household goods through amazon orders every few months.</li>
            <li> Strong alcohol smell when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> Other than that, smells great.</li>
            <li> Once applied, you&#x27;re lucky if it lasts for an hour -- after that, you won&#x27;t want to give anyone a hug.</li>
            <li> Scent disappears quickly</li>
            <li> just a quick caution before you buy a case of it.  </li>
            <li> quick and as advertised</li>
            <li> If they have this particular one, even better.</li>
            <li> had tremendous b.o. after bathing &amp; using this.</li>
            <li> Love the classic scent.</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant very much - it has the great classic Old Spice smell.  </li>
            <li> I love Old Spice original</li>
            <li> I love the original scent of Old Spice and have added it to my subscription to amazon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a smell made you smooth in the 70&#x27;s, 80&#x27;s, 90&#x27;s, 2000&#x27;s, and it continues to do exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Health wise this won&#x27;t hurt you in the long run.</li>
            <li> It smells good, lasts all day long and my wife likes how it smells on me.</li>
            <li> I have used Old Spice original (classic, I suppose is the same thing) for years and have enjoyed the pleasant scent and have had no reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The original scent classic is like the original cylindrical tube of the 60s.  </li>
            <li> A smile comment on the stick.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected for a good price.</li>
            <li> So far no luck, but I do smell better.</li>
            <li> I used to think this was a nice present</li>
            <li> I was glad to find this Old Spice Classic that I have been using for many years for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> It evaporates pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is my brand and the price is right.</li>
            <li> The variation on the original scent has been banished to the &#x27;High Endurance&#x27; line being mislabeled as \\&quot;Original.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found most gels that my friends are fond of just don&#x27;t last long for me but for some reason this product lasts until I find time in the evenings for a nice shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For most of my life I&#x27;ve used the Old Spice High Endurance Deodorant, so I tried the Classic / Original for kicks.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I must say that I absolutely love the classic Old Spice.</li>
            <li> For the record, I love Old Spice Classic deodorant and still use it to this day.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased to see that Old Spice has discontinued the use of triclosan in this classic line of deodorants.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased to see that Old Spice has discontinued the use of triclosan in this classic line of deodorants.</li>
            <li> First, let me state that I love the smell of Old Spice Classic.</li>
            <li> but I  got what I wanted in my first shipment.</li>
            <li> The order came on time, was exactly as ordered</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant my husband will use, and his having used it for most of his life means it works well.  </li>
            <li> Well, you don&#x27;t get more product for your money but it does double duty.</li>
            <li> I think this was my first deodorant when I was&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> husband only likes this brand ,so pleased i could purchase this online .</li>
            <li> TO FINDING A BETTER PRICE LOCALLY.</li>
            <li> I would attribute this to the denatured alcohol, which is the first ingredient.</li>
            <li> When you first apply it, it may still smell like this.</li>
            <li> the white one is better.</li>
            <li> For those of you who are interested, it seems to kill the smell of the pits for another 2-3 days in that situation which is a miracle.</li>
            <li> a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more affordable to just buy this deodorant at your local Dollar Store instead of the price-gouging online way.  </li>
            <li> I bought a 6-pack and by the time I got to the 5th and 6th stick, upon opening them for the first time, they had already dissipated a bit.  </li>
            <li> Does not last as long but leaves no tacky residue and smells great.</li>
            <li> And its in bulk and cheaper than a (insert funny analogy)</li>
            <li> The one and only Old Spice Classic deodorant used by generation after generation, and for good reason.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s there to say about Old Spice original scent deodorant?</li>
            <li> Besides, it has that timeless classic Old Spice  scent!!!!!</li>
            <li> , I would not change it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and last for a very long time which is important in our Israeli weather.</li>
            <li> But the fact that the original classic type was available in a large quantity and a low price made me feel like I couldn&#x27;t pass this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s objective of course, but I much prefer the Old Spice Pure Sport, which smells a lot more fresh.</li>
            <li> Yes, yes, this is the original formula Old Spice, that we used to get in the nice round container.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I strongly recommend you purchase this from your local store.</li>
            <li> , so get some Certain Dri for bedtime and apply this stuff in the AM to be covered for the day.</li>
            <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find Old Spice Classic Original in the store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Classic, Original Scent, Deodorant for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As of writing my original review for this product I have discontinued using it and switched over to the High Endurance line of Old Spice&#x27;s deodorants.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> When I discovered that it was still made, but only available in the US, I thought a trip was called for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Ok was just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to shop online and save some $$.  </li>
            <li> Who wants to trek to the drugstore to get this.</li>
            <li> very convenient way to buy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Around 2002, I was given one stick of Old Spice - Fresh.</li>
            <li> Makes shopping so much easier.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works very well.</li>
            <li> This was used as a gift and it was received with much appreciation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get it locally when its available.</li>
            <li> Old spice has many versions but only one that is just deodorant.  </li>
            <li> My husband has been using this specific Old Spice product for many years.</li>
            <li> yeah, if you love old spice like me, then hesitate no further my friend.</li>
            <li> Far cry from what i would consider was the original old spice scent and feel.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Original was for my husband whose skin is allergic and/or intolerant to the &amp;#34;special&amp;#34;  newer versions of Old Spice that irritate his underarms and cause a rash with repeated use.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t always find this type (original scent/formula) of this deodorant at a local retailer.</li>
            <li> The only difference is the \\&quot;Original Scent\\&quot; label at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Classic is classic for a reason!</li>
            <li> He is so grateful to finally find and use the original version.</li>
            <li> Classic scent for a classic guy!</li>
            <li> Ok so it looked a great deal for the price, but man was i disappointed once i started using it.</li>
            <li> &quot; versions of Old Spice because the fragrance is way too strong and gives me a giant headache every time.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, Old Spice is ignoring 70 Million underarms in Canada with their original scent since they stopped producing the little red tube of original scent.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the internet it is available and arrived promptly through Amazon (without prohibition at the border..</li>
            <li> Some of these older reviews refer to the older packaging which featured both a \\&quot;brown line\\&quot; and a \\&quot;silver line\\&quot;, the earlier of which was the true original scent and the latter a variation.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it doesn&#x27;t smell like Old Spice Classic, it is very chemically smelling and has a high amount of Alcohol which is what I believe caused my irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a reason that Old Spice has been around for decades - not because old folks are still alive to enjoy it, but because the scent appeals across the generations.  </li>
            <li> The original scent is pretty rough in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Anyway Old Spice deodorant lasts all day if you apply it first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I avoid deodorants with aluminum because higher levels of aluminum have been found in the brains of people with alzheimers but the plethora of natural deodorants I tried did not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Old Spice Classic Wide Solid in the Original Scent exclusively for about two years now (and off and on for many years before that).</li>
            <li> Receiving 6 Old Spice sticks at a regular interval is working out fine for me.  </li>
            <li> I did nothing but make fun of Old Spice and how Old man it was</li>
            <li> A classic.</li>
            <li> A classic</li>
            <li> classic is where its at</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic.</li>
            <li> This is a classic deodorant, not something that messes with your pores to try to keep you from sweating.</li>
            <li> hence the High Endurance</li>
            <li> it was the high endurance</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;High</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this stick are also cause for concern considering I came to realize that this stick contains triclosan, a carcinogen, whereas the High Endurance deodorants do not.</li>
            <li> Really, using the classic original scent, there&#x27;s no need to use any other cologne or after shave.</li>
            <li> It really is the old scent.</li>
            <li> I normally use.</li>
            <li> The container is a nice solid red color that stands out, especially if you accidentally drop it in nature.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you old spice/procter &amp; gamble for keeping the product at 3.25oz and not shrinking it like so many others down to 3 or 2.7</li>
            <li> I tried several other brands, but always found them to be chalky or have a very strong chemical-type smell.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who gets any negative reaction to antiperspirants can switch to this Original Scent Old Spice Deodorant and feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> I use Old Spice deodorants regularly from the High Endurance to Fresh Collection.</li>
            <li> i live in Kenya.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In sum, buy it, but buy it were you can immediately swap it for a new one if needed.</li>
            <li> We both like the classic Old Spice scent, and he likes that it *doesn&#x27;t* contain antiperspirant in addition to deodorant.  </li>
            <li> The classic scent is by far my favourite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying this, I can see why Old Spice is a timeless classic.</li>
            <li> Whether you are 20 or 80, you should be using old spice classic.  </li>
            <li> Poor hubby says it&#x27;s not quite strong enough any more; he needs to use Sports Enhanced Old Spice!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this deodorant for as long as I can remember - we&#x27;ve been married 32 years - &#x27;nuff said!</li>
            <li> but I am docking 2 stars from my original 5 star rating for this product due to these developments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am docking 2 stars from my original 5 star rating for this product due to these developments.    </li>
            <li> Its Old Spice!</li>
            <li> As far as I could tell, all the labels say Old Spice Classic on them then the scent followed closer to the bottom of the product.</li>
            <li> It smells clean and manly, without overpowering other colognes or soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Old Spice is powerful enough to eliminate the stench of sweaty stinky armpits on a mid summer 100-degree humid day with lots of hazy sunshine and intense outdoor work.  </li>
            <li> This way, I don&#x27;t run out and have to pay whatever a store wants to charge me, don&#x27;t have to make a special trip (waste gas) and with Prime shipping, no additional shipping or sales tax.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using Old Spice Classic, I&#x27;ve gone from being a 16 year old boy to a being a 26 year old man.</li>
            <li> It goes on slightly wet, but quickly dries and doesn&#x27;t stain his clothing.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smelling strongly of some type of alcohol and a little old spice smell.</li>
            <li> Most of this was due to natural aging, but Old Spice almost definitely played a role.</li>
            <li> Same price as buying 6 individual sticks at Super One</li>
            <li> I had a hard time trying to figure out how many stars to give this.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a strange acidic smell (it even sometimes hurts when you first apply it)</li>
            <li> I have even on the occasion spotted my GF stealing my Old Spice and using it.</li>
            <li> Also if it wasn&#x27;t for Old Spice</li>
            <li> What I like about Old Spice</li>
            <li> Been using Old Spice all my life.  </li>
            <li> Old Spice has 2 types of almost identically packaged \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; style.  </li>
            <li> I have used Old Spice for some time now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorants since I was an 8 year old boy.</li>
            <li> Old spice won out and I have been buying it since.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want him any where near me when he wears it.</li>
            <li> Old Spice, always.</li>
            <li> Been using Old Spice for years.</li>
            <li> Until nearly a month ago when I discovered this on Amazon and all the memories returned.</li>
            <li> and uh, neither one of us ever developed any sweaty contagious armpit fungus</li>
            <li> What did Old Spice change in their ingredients?</li>
            <li> I get these in bulk and add them to kits i give to young kids.</li>
            <li> This stuff cannot possibly be an Old Spice product.</li>
            <li> This six pack won&#x27;t get you drunk, but it&#x27;ll make you smell good.</li>
            <li> Having tried tons of deodorant products and brands, I settled on this one for its mild aroma and long lasting protection.</li>
            <li> The brown label is the Green colored deodorant and is what I would call the original scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both will say \\&quot;Original Round Stick</li>
            <li> It turns out my armpits do not bode well with the alcohol mixed into the ingredients of this particular cocktail of &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; inhibiting deodorant.  </li>
            <li> They caused mild irritation, a bit of a rash, and slight hypersensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use mostly just old spice, but this one is no good</li>
            <li> the redesigned label, you&#x27;ll want to read it carefully before ordering as the scent is shown on a colored banned about 4/5th of the way down from the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big proponent of High Endurance</li>
            <li> It helps to reduce sweat, smells great but is not overwhelming, and does not irritate my skin like other deodorants do (including other Old Spice</li>
            <li> is it normal for two men to share the same container of deodorant?  </li>
            <li> when buying &#x27;old spice&#x27; brand, go with the white colored deodorant stick versus the clear, gel-like deodorant.</li>
            <li> look forward to receiving Old Spice deodorant with a bottle of Old Spice aftershave every Christmas as a present.  </li>
            <li> the shipping was fast, combine with old spice shower gel and the smell will last all day long.</li>
            <li> It burnt my skin like no other deodorant before...</li>
            <li> I only wish they still made the original ROUND stick that was so convenient for travel...</li>
            <li> Although I ordered the wrong one, Original instead of Fresh</li>
            <li> I generally smell.  </li>
            <li> My brand, it is the CLEAR SOLID.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t always last all day if I am working outside and really working up a sweat, but this is obviously not an antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> Before I begin, let me preface I am a fan of Old Spice and their various products.  </li>
            <li> 10-20 years ago, any overseas Vietnamese who came back from the U.S.A. had this smell of Old Spice on them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various brands and tend to find Old Spice to be the one I prefer.</li>
            <li> Stick to the other Old Spice Classic products.</li>
            <li> Then by the time I get to work there is no smell which is fine, but after an hour if do anything more than sit at my desk I start to smell pretty awful.</li>
            <li> and I doubt seriously that USPS would process the return, therefore I am not returning it but using it to light my BBQ charcoal.</li>
            <li> This is the only Old Spice deodorant stick I can use, and it&#x27;s been my only deodorant for over forty years.</li>
            <li> Its smells like a strong alcohol wipe, and its not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Classic Deodorant fights body odor with alcohol and triclosan instead of aluminum, and I have never experienced body odor with Old Spice Classic Deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorant for a long time.  </li>
            <li> For the first few applications, you could liken the scent to something of bug spray.</li>
            <li> One is a silver backing with black letters and the other is brown backing with white letters but both say \\&quot;original scent\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It not only takes away the bad smell; it replaces it with good smell (only works if you like the Old Spice smell).</li>
            <li> It goes on wet and burns a little (high alcohol content), but it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t leave the chalky residue that antiperspirants do</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve smelled bad and I&#x27;ve smelled good...</li>
            <li> Adding another star from my previous rating - a solid 4/5.as the High Endurance deodorants do not.</li>
            <li> next time i&#x27;m buying the other old spice deoderant.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell quite the same as my previous bar of classic scent, though, and doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
            <li> I have been a sucker for the Old Spice scent since High School - and that was a long time ago.</li>
            <li> you find this deodorant in a store give it a try (it must be the exact wording \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; and \\&quot;Original Scent\\&quot;), if you like it grab a case from Amazon, it won&#x27;t go bad.</li>
            <li> According to him, Old Spice never lets him down.</li>
            <li> OLD SPICE HAS BEEN MY CHOICE FOR HALF A</li>
            <li> For some mysterious marketing strategy, Old Spice decided to take this product off Canadian shelves a few months ago.</li>
            <li> and I let him use it without thinking twice that it might be gross or leave the room wide open for spreading germs.  </li>
            <li> This is what I remember in the old round sticks.</li>
            <li> Smaller then expected</li>
            <li> I used the cylindrical (round) Old Spice Deodorant sticks for decades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been around forever (although it&#x27;s not really the same as the &amp;#34;round stick&amp;#34; formula) and it works.</li>
            <li> The grey colored banner is what you want for the scent this brand is known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are drying out from having been on Amazons shelf too long.</li>
            <li> I just got out of the shower today and without even using the deodorant my armpits became naturally red due to the Deodorant.</li>
            <li> Also, given how horrible some other current products smell, this one is far superior.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with the Old Spice classic scent?  </li>
            <li> Adding another star from my previous rating - a solid 4/5.</li>
            <li> and there was only half the deoderant in the containers.</li>
            <li> Well this deodorant is getting hard to find in the stores I frequent, so I bought a case of it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> GREAT stuff WITHOUT all the nasty chemicals that make deodorant moderately alarming to chemophobes.  </li>
            <li> I have used this Old Spice stick deodarant for 35 years, at least.  </li>
            <li> Everything was just as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the green color, not the Blue Sport stuff.</li>
            <li> does the job as expected</li>
            <li> However if you&#x27;re outside sweating in heat it might wear off in a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Then again I&#x27;ve never really thoroughly explored the deodorant aisle.  </li>
            <li> delivered on time, and was as expected</li>
            <li> , The main ingredient in this is alcohol and of course every time i put it on there is this INTENSE burning sensation on my arm pits and i have to constantly flap my arms around like an idiot to give it air in hopes that it will lessen the burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a couple other toiletries this way due to price and convenience.</li>
            <li> I like the product in other scents but accidentally ordered this one/</li>
            <li> but this is not BLUE stick I usually buy.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other newer smells.</li>
            <li> BUT THIS TIME I CANCELED MY ORDER DUE</li>
            <li> I have to stay away from antiperspirants due to the itching</li>
            <li> It does not gives the feeling of stickiness like some other deodorants do.</li>
            <li> I use it for about 50 years an although I tried other products during the years</li>
            <li> I wish I could use this deodorant, but I cannot due to either the alcohol level or I am allergic to an ingredient.</li>
            <li> My underarms looked like I spent way too much time at the beach with my arms up without sunscreen; they were red and peeling like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many deodorants and this is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> Still, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this old standard, and despite the evaporation I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> ; version turns my underarms into angry, red patches of rash after a single day&#x27;s use, and their other varieties somehow do the same.</li>
            <li> Four of the six containers were partially evaporated, leaving an oddly shaped mess rattling around inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells very medical/clinical, almost has a sort of stale mint smell.</li>
            <li> Six of them will last a year at least for me, maybe two...</li>
            <li> Formula\\&quot; but the silver label is not (or at least i don&#x27;t remember ever seeing a blue round stck).  </li>
            <li> of my previous update, I have given this deodorant another try</li>
            <li> As of my previous update, I have given this deodorant another try</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will even start smelling within half an hour after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Your change, trying to force your customers to buy obnoxious scents (which don&#x27;t come close to the \\&quot;original scent) or \\&quot;long term protection\\&quot; which is a truly evil scent, makes me think you have a totally different goal than customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ve started looking elsewhere for a new go-to deodorant.</li>
            <li> I am not sure of the difference (except as mentioned in other reviews)</li>
            <li> This deodorant burned my armpits so when I got the six-pack I was a little worried.</li>
            <li> I will do everything in my power to destroy your greedy</li>
            <li> One of the few sold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble using antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> Finding a deodorant without an antiperspirant is not easy.  </li>
            <li> This product is pretty painful to put on, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I look for the small sample ones at drug stores, for him to take on business</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll smell like an alcoholic.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say.</li>
            <li> After you get past that, it is like heaven.</li>
            <li> Not many stores in my area carry it though.</li>
            <li> Not much more I can ask for.</li>
            <li> stuff has a very harsh chemical smell and caused me to break out in a rash.</li>
            <li> When I saw the deodorant (which is hard to find) I had to buy it.</li>
            <li> I get a little frustrated when they send it because some of the deodorant seems to get on the outside of the packaging somehow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This also does nothing for wetness protection (some people appear to be confusing &#x27;deodorant&#x27; with &#x27;antiperspirant&#x27;)</li>
            <li> (After twenty-five years, I feel he deserves at least a six-pack.)</li>
            <li> I mean when I was in 7th grade gym class a kid asked me if he could borrow my deodorant</li>
            <li> This was a serious concern to me, as I have been using this for over 60 years.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the same blue deodorant I&#x27;ve always used, but this was some terrible smelling beige gel.</li>
            <li> However bad you think you smell, this will only make it worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to find this in the stores -</li>
            <li> Also, I always seem to buy the wrong scent type at least once a year.</li>
            <li> Its not too caustic.  </li>
            <li> But soon after, the alcohol evaporates, leaving the fragrance behind.</li>
            <li> I think that it could be very dangerous in a closed environment</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t failed me yet after 55</li>
            <li> Unfortunately i bought a six pack cause</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
            <li> and sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to find this one.  </li>
            <li> However, the worst part is that it doesn&#x27;t last even for an hour.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> However, the last two sticks I bought have given me terrible rashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a GREEN stick and it smells awful.</li>
            <li> If Amazon would guarantee that they have gone through every container of this in their warehouse and gotten rid of all of the dangerous stuff, I MIGHT consider ordering it again, but probably not.</li>
            <li> bad smell</li>
            <li> but it is greed with bad smill</li>
            <li> Plus I like that this is deodorant and doesnt have any of the bad stuff anti-perspirants have.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t go bad and you&#x27;ll use it anyway, so why not?</li>
            <li> disappointed in the chemical smell of this product.</li>
            <li> Drying out :-(</li>
            <li> (I hate having to wash that off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I HATE the smell.</li>
            <li> I always hated going to the store every time I ran out of this shiz, so I decided to see if amazon had it</li>
            <li> I have very bad underarm body odor.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst experience had with a deodorant, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Would never buy this crap again!</li>
            <li> But that burning sensation is terrible and i do NOT recommend this product one bit.</li>
            <li> This deodorant was horrible.</li>
            <li> Its awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> product as advertised.  very fast shipping</li>
            <li> what can I say it&#x27;s a classic&lt;br /&gt;and it is good</li>
            <li> For most of my life I&#x27;ve used the Old Spice High Endurance Deodorant, so I tried the Classic / Original for kicks. It&#x27;s not the worst experience had with a deodorant, but I won&#x27;t buy it again. There&#x27;s a strange acidic smell (it even sometimes hurts when you first apply it) and it&#x27;s not meant for someone who sweats a lot like I do--hence the High Endurance I normally use. I&#x27;m a big proponent of High Endurance so try that kind.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  A standard.  Great scent.  Easy application.  Easy to find color.  A smile comment on the stick.  My favorite?  If you grandfather had&#x27;t used this, you wouldn&#x27;t be here.  I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
            <li> Received the right item that I ordered at a good price and delivery was quick with no damage, will shop again. THANKS</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t always find this type (original scent/formula) of this deodorant at a local retailer. I  have signed up to get this a subscription which is real good deal especially with he free shipping. Oh, a detail: I received the \\&quot;brown label\\&quot; original scent which is what I  wanted. The picture shows a white or silver back ground label ...I am not sure of the difference (except as mentioned in other reviews) but I  got what I wanted in my first shipment. I will leave further comment if I ever receive something else.</li>
            <li> Considering the alternative, this product does the trick nicely.  Also, given how horrible some other current products smell, this one is far superior. Very effective!</li>
            <li> For some mysterious marketing strategy, Old Spice decided to take this product off Canadian shelves a few months ago. This was a serious concern to me, as I have been using this for over 60 years. When I discovered that it was still made, but only available in the US, I thought a trip was called for. Then I discovered that it could be purchased through Amazon. I was delighted. The order came on time, was exactly as ordered and I am very pleased with the whole transaction.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant my husband will use, and his having used it for most of his life means it works well.  We both like the classic Old Spice scent, and he likes that it *doesn&#x27;t* contain antiperspirant in addition to deodorant.  It goes on slightly wet, but quickly dries and doesn&#x27;t stain his clothing.  I look for the small sample ones at drug stores, for him to take on business trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a reason that Old Spice has been around for decades - not because old folks are still alive to enjoy it, but because the scent appeals across the generations.  It smells clean and manly, without overpowering other colognes or soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus  from Amazon on this product is that you get free Super-Saver shipping if you buy $25 or more.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t failed me yet after 55 years.&lt;br /&gt;But if your odor is strong, you might need something stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Health wise this won&#x27;t hurt you in the long run. (quote from a doctor)</li>
            <li> very good product very good product it is what is. what more can a person want? So get it and be happy, happy, happy.</li>
            <li> Was concerned by some of the reviews, but found it is an excellent antiperspirant as well as a deodorant . I have been a sucker for the Old Spice scent since High School - and that was a long time ago. Will order again - this is what I will only use in the future. Great price and value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Old Spice Classic Wide Solid in the Original Scent exclusively for about two years now (and off and on for many years before that). This is what I remember in the old round sticks. It smells good, lasts all day long and my wife likes how it smells on me. Really, using the classic original scent, there&#x27;s no need to use any other cologne or after shave. The scent is notable, but not overpowering. It goes on wet and burns a little (high alcohol content), but it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t leave the chalky residue that antiperspirants do (I hate having to wash that off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the real deal. If you want a deodorant that leaves you smelling manly, look no further. Hey, what else can you say about a product advertised by the likes of Jack Palance and Bruce Campbell?</li>
            <li> bad smell i didnt like the smell . i thought it is blue but it is greed with bad smill</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with the Old Spice classic scent?  Every female that smells it loooooves it!  Plus I like that this is deodorant and doesnt have any of the bad stuff anti-perspirants have.  I just apply a couple times a day and works well.</li>
            <li> I must say that I absolutely love the classic Old Spice. When I was a kid I did nothing but make fun of Old Spice and how Old man it was but the fact of the matter is it works and chicks love the smell of it. I have even on the occasion spotted my GF stealing my Old Spice and using it. Also if it wasn&#x27;t for Old Spice your Grandma may never have fallen for your Grandpa and we wouldnt be here discussing deodorant today.</li>
            <li> Husband loves the original/classic and we couldn&#x27;t find them in any stores.  Very happy husband now.</li>
            <li> Your change, trying to force your customers to buy obnoxious scents (which don&#x27;t come close to the \\&quot;original scent) or \\&quot;long term protection\\&quot; which is a truly evil scent, makes me think you have a totally different goal than customer satisfaction. Price? Profit? I will do everything in my power to destroy your greedy goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your former friend,&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m writing a review of deodorant.  Well this deodorant is getting hard to find in the stores I frequent, so I bought a case of it from Amazon.  What I like about Old Spice Classic Original Scent is that it works, smells almost as good as cologne, and isn&#x27;t visible on your clothes.  When I couldn&#x27;t find Old Spice Classic Original in the store I tried several other brands, but always found them to be chalky or have a very strong chemical-type smell.  Even scents like \\&quot;Ocean Breeze\\&quot; smell like benzene or something to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find this deodorant in a store give it a try (it must be the exact wording \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; and \\&quot;Original Scent\\&quot;), if you like it grab a case from Amazon, it won&#x27;t go bad.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a good supply and not have to head to the store as frequently. Good price, and great product.</li>
            <li> disappointed in the chemical smell of this product. Far cry from what i would consider was the original old spice scent and feel. Unfortunately i bought a six pack cause i live in Kenya. Had to give them away.</li>
            <li> Receiving 6 Old Spice sticks at a regular interval is working out fine for me.  This way, I don&#x27;t run out and have to pay whatever a store wants to charge me, don&#x27;t have to make a special trip (waste gas) and with Prime shipping, no additional shipping or sales tax.  The product itself seems fine, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out.  I&#x27;m buying a couple other toiletries this way due to price and convenience.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love the scent. The 6-pack is a good value. It doesn&#x27;t irritate me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s deodorant. What else can I say?</li>
            <li> I was glad to find this Old Spice Classic that I have been using for many years for a reasonable price.  It is my exclusive men&#x27;s deodorent!</li>
            <li> So first off this is a really great value for six, big sticks of deodorant. If you&#x27;re on a budget and deep some good deodorant this is great. However I don&#x27;t like the smell at all. It smells very medical/clinical, almost has a sort of stale mint smell. It&#x27;s objective of course, but I much prefer the Old Spice Pure Sport, which smells a lot more fresh.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. There is no Aluminum in it! Therefore it&#x27;s safer to use. You won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
            <li> I like the product in other scents but accidentally ordered this one/forgot what it smelled like.  The original scent is pretty rough in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price for a lot of deodorant (probably too much). It doesn&#x27;t smell quite the same as my previous bar of classic scent, though, and doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
            <li> I love Old Spice original but this is not BLUE stick I usually buy. It&#x27;s a GREEN stick and it smells awful. Reeks of alcohol. You&#x27;ll smell like an alcoholic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and  don&#x27;t want to change! It&#x27;s effective, no overpowering aroma,long-lasting and not at all intrusive!</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant very much - it has the great classic Old Spice smell.  It doesn&#x27;t always last all day if I am working outside and really working up a sweat, but this is obviously not an antiperspirant.  I purposefully switched to deodorant to get away from the aluminum based products.  This deodorant works exactly as I expect and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> Well, you don&#x27;t get more product for your money but it does double duty. It not only takes away the bad smell; it replaces it with good smell (only works if you like the Old Spice smell). Like the can says, &amp;#34;If your grandpa didn&#x27;t use it, you wouldn&#x27;t be here.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve smelled bad and I&#x27;ve smelled good... smelling good always seem to work out better :).</li>
            <li> What more to say. Its the original scent. A classic. I have tried the other newer smells. But the classic is still the best. My wife loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of this deodorant.  I get a little frustrated when they send it because some of the deodorant seems to get on the outside of the packaging somehow. Other than that, smells great.</li>
            <li> love the scent, wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells like rubbing alcohol with a hint of baby powder. The scent is better than body odor, I suppose, but it has no staying power. Once applied, you&#x27;re lucky if it lasts for an hour -- after that, you won&#x27;t want to give anyone a hug.</li>
            <li> Before I begin, let me preface I am a fan of Old Spice and their various products.  It turns out my armpits do not bode well with the alcohol mixed into the ingredients of this particular cocktail of &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; inhibiting deodorant.  They caused mild irritation, a bit of a rash, and slight hypersensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly consider all buyers to avoid alcohol-based deodorants - to avoid complications of allergic reactions or side effects.</li>
            <li> Since I started using Old Spice Classic, I&#x27;ve gone from being a 16 year old boy to a being a 26 year old man. Most of this was due to natural aging, but Old Spice almost definitely played a role. I am now very popular for my smell, which I attribute to the Old Spice stick and good odor genes. The container is a nice solid red color that stands out, especially if you accidentally drop it in nature. Because of this, I have never lost a stick outside.</li>
            <li> Works as expected for a good price.</li>
            <li> This is awesome. I don&#x27;t have to deal with the store now. Stores run out of stock often. Also, I always seem to buy the wrong scent type at least once a year. This Old Spics Classic Deodorant pack is great. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over 30 years and I will never change!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!!! Doesnt burn your arm pit like Schick or some of the others. Besides, it has that timeless classic Old Spice  scent!!!!!</li>
            <li> OLD SPICE HAS BEEN MY CHOICE FOR HALF A CENTURY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT MORE CAN I SAY ?  SMELLS MANLY AND REFRESHING</li>
            <li> Scent disappears quickly</li>
            <li> I think this was my first deodorant when I was&lt;br /&gt;a teen. I am now approaching 69 yrs.  Never changed. Never felt the need.&lt;br /&gt;Others are either too strong or smell like perfume.</li>
            <li> This is the only Old Spice deodorant stick I can use, and it&#x27;s been my only deodorant for over forty years. The &amp;#34;high endurance&amp;#34; version turns my underarms into angry, red patches of rash after a single day&#x27;s use, and their other varieties somehow do the same. I only wish they still made the original ROUND stick that was so convenient for travel...</li>
            <li> Ok was just as I expected. Smaller sized. Want a different kind next time good price good value bang for buck</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.  Its not too caustic.  and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  I hope you like it.</li>
            <li> The best underarm deodorant.  I would recommend it to everybody.  I use it every day and am very glad that I do.</li>
            <li> This deodorant burned my armpits so when I got the six-pack I was a little worried. I should have done more research before I bought this product but It still burned quite a bit from the alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> Been using Old Spice all my life.  Very convenient to shop online and save some $$.  I&#x27;ll be back soon!</li>
            <li> This stuff burns the armpits! Just google it. I bought some, today. Applied and in about 5 mins it was burn city! Would never buy this crap again!</li>
            <li> This is supposed to make girls think I&#x27;m riding a horse. So far no luck, but I do smell better.</li>
            <li> just a quick caution before you buy a case of it.  Old Spice has 2 types of almost identically packaged \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; style.  The only difference is the \\&quot;Original Scent\\&quot; label at the bottom.  One is a silver backing with black letters and the other is brown backing with white letters but both say \\&quot;original scent\\&quot;.  The silver label is actually a Blue deodorant and is a sport or sea breeze scent.  The brown label is the Green colored deodorant and is what I would call the original scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t be fooled.  Both will say \\&quot;Original Round Stick Formula\\&quot; but the silver label is not (or at least i don&#x27;t remember ever seeing a blue round stck).  And they are not the same scents.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my wife and she likes it. I like it too cause she doesn&#x27;t smell sweat anymore.</li>
            <li> This six pack won&#x27;t get you drunk, but it&#x27;ll make you smell good. The price for all six is what I would have paid for just two, so on price alone this is a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Have used since a teenager and am now 72. Would not change.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for he price. I am well stocked and happy.</li>
            <li> IF YOUR DAD HADNT WORE IT YOU WOULDNT ExiST!!!</li>
            <li> husband only likes this brand ,so pleased i could purchase this online .</li>
            <li> Put dis on you pits and smell like yo gramps did in Nam, fighting Nazis and boning yo GranGran. Ya heard?</li>
            <li> Found a better deal at awl mart after the fact.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Everything was just as expected.</li>
            <li> Finding a deodorant without an antiperspirant is not easy.  This is the only one I have found and sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to find this one.  Old spice has many versions but only one that is just deodorant.  My son&#x27;s skin turns red and irritated with antiperspirant.  He has used this for years with no reaction.</li>
            <li> quick and as advertised</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant of all time. A classic</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this specific Old Spice product for many years. Finding it online with good pricing was a bonus. As a barbershop owner he has to think a lot about the body while standing over the top of men&#x27;s heads. According to him, Old Spice never lets him down.</li>
            <li> I have used Old Spice for some time now. Buying the 6 pack saved me money. Not much more to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many deodorants and this is by far the worst. Its smells like a strong alcohol wipe, and its not pleasant at all. However, the worst part is that it doesn&#x27;t last even for an hour. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> GREAT DEODORANT BUT THIS TIME I CANCELED MY ORDER DUE TO FINDING A BETTER PRICE LOCALLY.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and just what I can no longer find at my grocery store.</li>
            <li> I have to stay away from antiperspirants due to the itching I have following their use...I do not have any problems using a deodorant without any antiperspirants in them.  I love the original scent of Old Spice and have added it to my subscription to amazon.  Having it on my subscription list means not having to remember to order it each time I get low on it and I get the savings with it.  Anyone who gets any negative reaction to antiperspirants can switch to this Original Scent Old Spice Deodorant and feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorants since I was an 8 year old boy. The classic scent is by far my favourite. For the first few applications, you could liken the scent to something of bug spray. I would attribute this to the denatured alcohol, which is the first ingredient. After you get past that, it is like heaven. When you first apply it, it may still smell like this. But soon after, the alcohol evaporates, leaving the fragrance behind. Please keep in mind, while I like the smell, it&#x27;s not for everyone. Before you commit to a six pack, go to your local grocery or drug store and smell some of the deodorants with slimier ingredients. If they have this particular one, even better. Not many stores in my area carry it though. Don&#x27;t buy anything until you know you know you like it. But I can say from experience, this is one of my top 3 favourites.</li>
            <li> GREAT stuff WITHOUT all the nasty chemicals that make deodorant moderately alarming to chemophobes.  Plus, if my grandfather hadn&#x27;t worn it, I would exist. So yeah, there&#x27;s that...</li>
            <li> Deodorant without anti-perspirant.  One of the few sold.  I don&#x27;t want the additional ingredients.  Good fragrance- manly.  Very good deal.</li>
            <li> Melting things with my mind</li>
            <li> classic is where its at</li>
            <li> Smaller then expected</li>
            <li> Love the way this stuff smells &amp; works!  It helps to reduce sweat, smells great but is not overwhelming, and does not irritate my skin like other deodorants do (including other Old Spice products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a smell made you smooth in the 70&#x27;s, 80&#x27;s, 90&#x27;s, 2000&#x27;s, and it continues to do exactly what it is supposed to.  Don&#x27;t fix what ain&#x27;t broke!</li>
            <li> Yes, yes, this is the original formula Old Spice, that we used to get in the nice round container.&lt;br /&gt;It is the green color, not the Blue Sport stuff. Hooray.</li>
            <li> had tremendous b.o. after bathing &amp; using this. next time i&#x27;m buying the other old spice deoderant. the white one is better. when buying &#x27;old spice&#x27; brand, go with the white colored deodorant stick versus the clear, gel-like deodorant. my experience is the former works and the latter, is, well...flaky and inconsistent...unless you like to smell like b.o.</li>
            <li> Of course deodorant product goes whatever flavor definition, I am out of the U.S. and you always ask large amounts and have started using the product for more than 20 years, and I would advise every one buy from him without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I got this 6 pack for my hubby, great price on it and the shipping was fast, combine with old spice shower gel and the smell will last all day long.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, what can I say. I remember my dad using it when I was a kid and I have tried different brands and always come back to this, the basics.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this deodorant for as long as I can remember - we&#x27;ve been married 32 years - &#x27;nuff said!</li>
            <li> One time in a drug store I decided to smell all the deodorants and decide which one I liked the best. Old spice won out and I have been buying it since. It seems to work in the &amp;#34;French bath&amp;#34; situation too, where you know you smell and you put in on because you don&#x27;t want to take a shower at the moment. For those of you who are interested, it seems to kill the smell of the pits for another 2-3 days in that situation which is a miracle. My niece even smelled me once after a &amp;#34;French bath&amp;#34; and she remarked I smelled interesting ha ha ha. So maybe it mixes well with whatever foul fragrances come from under you arm and makes them sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price too. Who wants to trek to the drugstore to get this. Six of them will last a year at least for me, maybe two...</li>
            <li> This is the only stick deodorant that doesn&#x27;t burn my pits after a while.  It smells really strong when you take the cap off but once you apply it its not too strong at all.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I don&#x27;t use this my husband does. For deodorant purposes, it&#x27;s fine but I HATE the smell. I don&#x27;t want him any where near me when he wears it.</li>
            <li> very convenient way to buy</li>
            <li> Husband will only use this deordorant</li>
            <li> I had a hard time trying to figure out how many stars to give this. For the record, I love Old Spice Classic deodorant and still use it to this day. Probably will for years to come because it&#x27;s the only thing that seems to work for me (and smells good, too!). However, I strongly recommend you purchase this from your local store. Why? The alcohol in this deodorant appears to leak out or evaporate during shipment or while being stored in their warehouse. Four of the six containers were partially evaporated, leaving an oddly shaped mess rattling around inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, buy it, but buy it were you can immediately swap it for a new one if needed.</li>
            <li> Of all the deodorant out there this one is for me. I&#x27;ve used many others, and always return to the original.</li>
            <li> Ok so it looked a great deal for the price, but man was i disappointed once i started using it., The main ingredient in this is alcohol and of course every time i put it on there is this INTENSE burning sensation on my arm pits and i have to constantly flap my arms around like an idiot to give it air in hopes that it will lessen the burn. I just got out of the shower today and without even using the deodorant my armpits became naturally red due to the Deodorant. I didn&#x27;t even have cuts on my pits so i have no idea why this is. This product is pretty painful to put on, but it gets the job done. But that burning sensation is terrible and i do NOT recommend this product one bit.</li>
            <li> Great Product, easily refill household goods through amazon orders every few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice deodorant for a long time.  So I already liked it.  But the fact that the original classic type was available in a large quantity and a low price made me feel like I couldn&#x27;t pass this up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product, a reasonable price, and delivered quickly.  Not much more I can ask for.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was the high endurance one but i was mistaken and ITS MY FAULT, it doesnt last all day.  it does get 5 STARS for a really great deal.</li>
            <li> I generally smell.  This deodorant doesn&#x27;t hurt me like antiperspirants and the more modern scents out there.  It really is the old scent.</li>
            <li> does the job as expected</li>
            <li> Old Spice, always. Love the classic scent. Been using Old Spice for years.</li>
            <li> I recently turned away from the antiperspirant kinds b/c of the aluminum ziconium ingredient. This happens to be alcohol based and includes the antimicrobial triclosan. IMO this original scent is a great smelling deodorant. I found the twin pack at a local wal*mark at a great price, so you may want to check yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you old spice/procter &amp; gamble for keeping the product at 3.25oz and not shrinking it like so many others down to 3 or 2.7</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly. Strong alcohol smell when you first put it on. Same price as buying 6 individual sticks at Super One but it gets shipped to your door.</li>
            <li> I used the cylindrical (round) Old Spice Deodorant sticks for decades. I wish they still were available but this is the closest thing to them.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s there to say about Old Spice original scent deodorant? It&#x27;s a classic. It&#x27;s been around forever (although it&#x27;s not really the same as the &amp;#34;round stick&amp;#34; formula) and it works. It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin like other deodorants do, it doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts, and most importantly it makes me smell good. Bonus points for this being a 6 stick set - it&#x27;s cheaper than you can find in the store and it&#x27;s nice to always have a stick handy when you run out.</li>
            <li> Having tried tons of deodorant products and brands, I settled on this one for its mild aroma and long lasting protection. I found most gels that my friends are fond of just don&#x27;t last long for me but for some reason this product lasts until I find time in the evenings for a nice shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no stickiness or clumping with this product which is important for most people. I also found the scent to be light yet masculine and refreshing so it should appeal to most people considering this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the redesigned label, you&#x27;ll want to read it carefully before ordering as the scent is shown on a colored banned about 4/5th of the way down from the top of the bottle. As far as I could tell, all the labels say Old Spice Classic on them then the scent followed closer to the bottom of the product. The grey colored banner is what you want for the scent this brand is known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this, I can see why Old Spice is a timeless classic.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  This is my brand and the price is right.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that I will use.  I don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;High Endurance\\&quot; versions of Old Spice because the fragrance is way too strong and gives me a giant headache every time.  However, this version, which is the classic scent is a perfect balance of protection and fragrance.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> My brand, it is the CLEAR SOLID. smells good.</li>
            <li> 10-20 years ago, any overseas Vietnamese who came back from the U.S.A. had this smell of Old Spice on them. It was so popular that whenever we smelt this, we knew exactly that was an overseas Vietnamese :-)&lt;br /&gt;Around 2002, I was given one stick of Old Spice - Fresh. I loved that but did not know how to have it. Until nearly a month ago when I discovered this on Amazon and all the memories returned. Although I ordered the wrong one, Original instead of Fresh but I am still satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The good smell is long-lasting, even when I use it in Vietnam whose hot tropical climate keeps me sweating all the time. It does not gives the feeling of stickiness like some other deodorants do. It does not leave stains on my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to find this in the stores - this is exactly what I&#x27;ve used (and liked) for years. Now I&#x27;ve got a year&#x27;s supply!</li>
            <li> The one and only Old Spice Classic deodorant used by generation after generation, and for good reason. With a lot of the various brands and lines out on the market I can&#x27;t help but find myself drawn towards that which has stood the test of time for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Spice Classic in the Original Scent is as good as it can get with the ever-attractive original fragrance worn by many of our grandfathers and still to this day manages to appease the ladies&#x27; sense of smell. Some of these older reviews refer to the older packaging which featured both a \\&quot;brown line\\&quot; and a \\&quot;silver line\\&quot;, the earlier of which was the true original scent and the latter a variation. Since the redesign, the \\&quot;brown line\\&quot; has seemingly been taken off the shelves. The good news is that this redesigned \\&quot;silver line\\&quot; actually IS the original scented, green-colored deodorant. The variation on the original scent has been banished to the &#x27;High Endurance&#x27; line being mislabeled as \\&quot;Original.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is surprisingly mild and subtle and lightens as the day goes on, but the odor protection lasts throughout the day and until the next. No stickiness, residue, or clumping with this deodorant, for it is not a gel nor a solid but something in between. Either way, it works great on *preventing* odor, not just covering it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also does nothing for wetness protection (some people appear to be confusing &#x27;deodorant&#x27; with &#x27;antiperspirant&#x27;), so get some Certain Dri for bedtime and apply this stuff in the AM to be covered for the day. Great product, excellent scent, great longevity, and incredibly affordable - hope to see Old Spice keep this formula and fragrance around forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;January 28, 2013 *UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of writing my original review for this product I have discontinued using it and switched over to the High Endurance line of Old Spice&#x27;s deodorants. The ingredients in this stick are also cause for concern considering I came to realize that this stick contains triclosan, a carcinogen, whereas the High Endurance deodorants do not. Just my personal preference but I am docking 2 stars from my original 5 star rating for this product due to these developments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;August 16, 2014 *UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of my previous update, I have given this deodorant another try and I am pleased to see that Old Spice has discontinued the use of triclosan in this classic line of deodorants. While it is still not the safest, most natural option (for those of you that care), it is time-tested and effective so I am happy to give this one another go. Adding another star from my previous rating - a solid 4/5.as the High Endurance deodorants do not. Just my personal preference but I am docking 2 stars from my original 5 star rating for this product due to these developments.    -----  August 16, 2014 *UPDATE*  -----    As of my previous update, I have given this deodorant another try and I am pleased to see that Old Spice has discontinued the use of triclosan in this classic line of deodorants.

            <li> I have used this Old Spice stick deodarant for 35 years, at least.  I now buy it in the longer thinner 3.25 ounce containers. The original scent classic is like the original cylindrical tube of the 60s.  I still enjoy its effectiveness and non offensive scent.</li>
            <li> Old Spice is powerful enough to eliminate the stench of sweaty stinky armpits on a mid summer 100-degree humid day with lots of hazy sunshine and intense outdoor work.  I always wondered something though- is it normal for two men to share the same container of deodorant?  I mean when I was in 7th grade gym class a kid asked me if he could borrow my deodorant and I let him use it without thinking twice that it might be gross or leave the room wide open for spreading germs.  But... is it gross?  I&#x27;ve been sharing the same deodorant with my dad for years and uh, neither one of us ever developed any sweaty contagious armpit fungus diseases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to receiving Old Spice deodorant with a bottle of Old Spice aftershave every Christmas as a present.  I used to think this was a nice present but I eventually figured out my family was sending me a hint- they&#x27;re telling me my armpits stink without actually coming out and saying it!  Anyway Old Spice deodorant lasts all day if you apply it first thing in the morning.  However if you&#x27;re outside sweating in heat it might wear off in a few hours.  Of course sometimes I go through phases where my armpits are exceptionally stinky and on these rare occasions (like 3 times a year) I have to apply Old Spice deodorant up to 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more affordable to just buy this deodorant at your local Dollar Store instead of the price-gouging online way.  Then again I&#x27;ve never seen a 6-pack of deodorant sold in stores.  They&#x27;re always sold individually in stores.  Then again I&#x27;ve never really thoroughly explored the deodorant aisle.  Hmmm.... maybe all those boxes on the bottom shelf contains packs of deodorant containers?  I&#x27;ve never checked.</li>
            <li> Whether you are 20 or 80, you should be using old spice classic.  Forget these nonsensical &amp;#34;madderhorn&amp;#34; smells...whatever that means.  Classic is classic for a reason!</li>
            <li> Been using it for years.  At my age of 89 why would I want to switch?  It does the job.,</li>
            <li> This is a classic deodorant, not something that messes with your pores to try to keep you from sweating. It&#x27;s mild to your skin, cheap, and has a great scent. I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for 25 years.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Original was for my husband whose skin is allergic and/or intolerant to the &amp;#34;special&amp;#34;  newer versions of Old Spice that irritate his underarms and cause a rash with repeated use.  He is so grateful to finally find and use the original version. We could not find the Original in the stores.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Used this for years. Never any irritation. Scent lasts a good while, great value when you buy the 6 pack. It won&#x27;t go bad and you&#x27;ll use it anyway, so why not?</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant my husband can use. Others make him breakout. So I have been buying him this product for 30 years now. Glad to see a 6 pack available on Amazon. Makes shopping so much easier. This is an excellent product. Love the scent.</li>
            <li> Works great, no aluminum.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, with just one significant problem:  It evaporates pretty quickly.  I bought a 6-pack and by the time I got to the 5th and 6th stick, upon opening them for the first time, they had already dissipated a bit.  I suspect this is a problem with most deodorants, but it feels like a bit of &amp;#34;planned obsolescence&amp;#34; to me, that is, getting you to buy more than you would need to if the caps and casing really &amp;#34;held it all in&amp;#34; until use.  Still, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this old standard, and despite the evaporation I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I use it for about 50 years an although I tried other products during the years, I would not change it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and last for a very long time which is important in our Israeli weather.</li>
            <li> Drying out :-( This is the 3nd time I purchased these and there was only half the deoderant in the containers. They are drying out from having been on Amazons shelf too long.</li>
            <li> First, let me state that I love the smell of Old Spice Classic. I use the body wash, after shave, and the cologne. When I saw the deodorant (which is hard to find) I had to buy it. I use Old Spice deodorants regularly from the High Endurance to Fresh Collection. This deodorant was horrible. Firstly, it doesn&#x27;t smell like Old Spice Classic, it is very chemically smelling and has a high amount of Alcohol which is what I believe caused my irritation. I wish I could use this deodorant, but I cannot due to either the alcohol level or I am allergic to an ingredient. Stick to the other Old Spice Classic products.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I remember it from years ago, but still better than most.</li>
            <li> Does not last as long but leaves no tacky residue and smells great.</li>
            <li> The product came to me and i so happy, i recomend to everyone !</li>
            <li> Poor hubby says it&#x27;s not quite strong enough any more; he needs to use Sports Enhanced Old Spice!</li>
            <li> This deodorant works very well. I have very bad underarm body odor. Sometimes I will even start smelling within half an hour after I get out of the shower. I avoid deodorants with aluminum because higher levels of aluminum have been found in the brains of people with alzheimers but the plethora of natural deodorants I tried did not work. Old Spice Classic Deodorant fights body odor with alcohol and triclosan instead of aluminum, and I have never experienced body odor with Old Spice Classic Deodorant. Although the deodorant contains alcohol it does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice Classic, Original Scent, Deodorant for over 15 years. However, the last two sticks I bought have given me terrible rashes. My underarms looked like I spent way too much time at the beach with my arms up without sunscreen; they were red and peeling like crazy. What did Old Spice change in their ingredients? Needless to say, I&#x27;ve started looking elsewhere for a new go-to deodorant. I still give it two stars, instead of one, because of the great memories I&#x27;ve had with this deodorant.</li>
            <li> It burnt my skin like no other deodorant before... I had to throw them away.</li>
            <li> Great price for a high quality deodorant. I&#x27;ve used various brands and tend to find Old Spice to be the one I prefer. Be sure to note this is a deodorant and not an antiperspirant. There is a difference. I&#x27;ve always had trouble using antiperspirants. This deodorant works just fine.</li>
            <li> For some reason, Old Spice is ignoring 70 Million underarms in Canada with their original scent since they stopped producing the little red tube of original scent.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the internet it is available and arrived promptly through Amazon (without prohibition at the border..).&lt;br /&gt;Now I can smell great again (eh?).</li>
            <li> I always hated going to the store every time I ran out of this shiz, so I decided to see if amazon had it and oh look, they do.  And its in bulk and cheaper than a (insert funny analogy).... amaright???  So yeah, if you love old spice like me, then hesitate no further my friend.</li>
            <li> Great. Used this for almost 20 years. Thought it was discontinued until found online.</li>
            <li> This was used as a gift and it was received with much appreciation.</li>
            <li> Classic scent for a classic guy! Love them both! (After twenty-five years, I feel he deserves at least a six-pack.)</li>
            <li> It smells like rubbing alcohol.Its awful. I was expecting the same blue deodorant I&#x27;ve always used, but this was some terrible smelling beige gel. Don&#x27;t buy this. However bad you think you smell, this will only make it worse.</li>
            <li> I get these in bulk and add them to kits i give to young kids.</li>
            <li> Hubby&#x27;s favorite deodorant.  Smells clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> delivered on time, and was as expected</li>
            <li> This deodorant is only good for about an hour. Goes on smelling strongly of some type of alcohol and a little old spice smell. Then by the time I get to work there is no smell which is fine, but after an hour if do anything more than sit at my desk I start to smell pretty awful. It&#x27;s like I never put anything on at all. I use mostly just old spice, but this one is no good and now I have 6 of them.</li>
            <li> Its Old Spice! Its perfect, smells like a guy should smell like, and works freaking amazing. Like the container says &amp;#34; If your granddad hadn&#x27;t worn it, you wouldn&#x27;t be here&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff cannot possibly be an Old Spice product. I have used Old Spice original (classic, I suppose is the same thing) for years and have enjoyed the pleasant scent and have had no reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has a very harsh chemical smell and caused me to break out in a rash. It doesn&#x27;t have that spicey odor, it is more life pure alcohol or some thing even stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fact is I took some out doors and touched a match to it, and it literally burst into flame. I think that it could be very dangerous in a closed environment and I doubt seriously that USPS would process the return, therefore I am not returning it but using it to light my BBQ charcoal. If Amazon would guarantee that they have gone through every container of this in their warehouse and gotten rid of all of the dangerous stuff, I MIGHT consider ordering it again, but probably not. I&#x27;ll get it locally when its available. And I recommend that you do too.</li>
            <li> Best smell in the world, but hard to find.</li>
            <li> pleasant smelling as always from time immemorial;</li>
    </ol>
