            <li> Excellent fast service and great product.</li>
            <li> Have ordered Maja soaps many many times over the years.  I use them for scenting the linen closet and drawers.  I put them in &amp;#34;winter&#x27;  or &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; handbags when I store them out of season.  I put them in the bag with blankets or quilts I am storing.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time I ordered these Maja round soaps from Amazon, recently, and both times they smell very fresh.  I had ordered Maja rectangular soaps from a different page/ vendor on Amazon and they had little scent.  Amazon Customer Service was great and directed me to these.  The box does say made in Mexico, not Spain, but I am pleased with them.  I suppose Maja has different companies distributing and producing their soaps and scent quality may vary, or some vendors may ship old packages.  Don&#x27;t accept &amp;#34;stale&amp;#34; soap.  Contact Customer Support at 1-866-216-1072.  Amazon stands behind their products.</li>
            <li> The package arrived and was exactly as advertised.  I have used this soap for 40 yrs. and used to buy it while traveling I Spain.</li>
            <li> Love the scent! Been looking for these for years - nostalgia reasons.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> smells amazing popular company in Spain for years. Myrurgia, creator of Maja fragrance was founded in Barcelona, Spain in 1916. Maja is easily recognized by it&#x27;s logo of a Spanish Dancer. Maja by Myrurgia is a Oriental Spicy The fragrance features nutmeg, carnation, patchouli, cloves, vetiver, rose, geranium, citruses and lavender carnation, patchouli.

            <li> I LOVE this soap!  It is too bad the perfume/toilette does not smell like the soap.  This soap is fresh and engaging - you feel as if you had just received a spa treatment.  I only wish the matching products (lotion, powder, perfume/toilette) smelled as wonderful as the soap does!  Hello!  Is anyone listening out there?  I receive oh, so many compliments from the scent of the soap... hint, hint, hint!</li>
            <li> I have been using Maja soap since 1972, and have ordered it from Amazon for many years now.  This is the first complaint I have ever had.  When I unwrapped it, the color was a very light green-almost white (usually dark green).  It did NOT have the scent to Maja both in the shower and out of the shower. Is this an imitation or a defective batch of soap?  I am truly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the Maja scent.  I&#x27;m 73 and I&#x27;ve been using it since I was 18. This olive oil based soap has me without a wrinkle.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product- long lasting with good lathering and wonderful smell!</li>
            <li> So happy to have found these soaps.  Packaging was perfect and I received them right away</li>
            <li> fabulous value!!!! I love this soap. I keep it in the shower at all times.</li>
            <li> Dad has been using this soap for years and loves it</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what we were looking for.  It has a delicate scent and the scent lasts all day long.  It leaves the skin feeling soft and supple.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better hand and body soap.</li>
            <li> While in Spain this soap was in the hotel&#x27;s we stayed in. Since 1974 I have used nothing else.  The soap is now made in Mexico and is the same wonderful quality</li>
            <li> So glad to find this soap. My mom loved it and was missing it as it is difficult to find.</li>
