            <li>With 2 days of treatment, I was able to do way more with her feet than soaking and a pumice stone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works ok.  </li>
            <li>Have used better ones</li>
            <li>a must have , I love it</li>
            <li>Glad I found this one.</li>
            <li>Love it going to buy another ..</li>
            <li>Love this foot file and keep it in the shower to use &amp;#34;as needed&amp;#34; on heels and bottom of feet.  </li>
            <li>It has a rougher side and a smoother side which I love.</li>
            <li>Very durable and works great on removing callous.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>Overall she has been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Its very sturdy and a the price is great too.</li>
            <li>Works better than the rest.</li>
            <li>*sure* to follow with a pumace and/or chemical exfoliant after use.</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>Great product - highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is a well made product, but neither side is suitable for light exfoliating or polishing.  </li>
            <li>find using it when my feet are dry works best for me</li>
            <li>but I just discovered a nickel plated version that is just fantastic and works better than this one.</li>
            <li>Great product, my feet feels so soft already.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of removing corns or calluses and then can smooth the entire foot until it&#x27;s smooth.  </li>
            <li>- you can really get a good grip on it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use due to the size of the file  very impressed.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and store in the bathtub.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of elbow grease.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy and easy to hold ...</li>
            <li>strong and durable</li>
            <li>Nice big handle for a good grip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is hands down the best foot file EVER!  </li>
            <li>This file has two sides, a course and a fine side.</li>
            <li>The file is huge...</li>
            <li>In no time, you&#x27;ll have smooth feet again...</li>
            <li>I can have smooth feet</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Liked so much</li>
            <li>Within minutes my feet were 98% pain free while walking.</li>
            <li>The handle seems comfortable, but I&#x27;m used to holding a foot file about 1/3 of this size.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I definitely didn&#x27;t need one of those cheese grater looking files, but I definitely needed more than the cheapy-ones from Sally&#x27;s, and this fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>but original price was $34.95...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long and great to when cleaning your feet.</li>
            <li>It definitely worth the expense!</li>
            <li>This is a nice foot file, as I live in the Southwest, therefore I&#x27;m always barefoot.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time just the action of filing made the calluses more sore than when I started...</li>
            <li>The two sides give the ability to get the rougher areas (like the heel) quickly and the more gentle areas (around the toes/arch) easily.  </li>
            <li>This thing does a great job on the rough edges of my heel.</li>
            <li>Better then metal grader style but be gentle</li>
            <li>and I found the Diane European Foot File had good reviews</li>
            <li>The two different grits and the price are good for the client and for my business.</li>
            <li>It is extremely durable and great to leave in the shower.</li>
            <li>I bought several for my baths, and gifts and they are exceptional.</li>
            <li>/&gt;.spectacular super recommendedðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m well pleased with these....will buy more soon just to have on hand for the future.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very rough/calloused feet to begin with, but this does a great job of removing dead skin from my feet, which I used to be able to scrape off with my fingernails after every shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable, easy to hold, and has two sides for filing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but be careful.  </li>
            <li>If you have something that needs to be exfoliated this is the right tool for the job.</li>
            <li>Softens feet right up.  </li>
            <li>It does job good, but in my opinion the file is for a pretty rough skin.</li>
            <li>The abrasive seems very soundly glued to the wooden handle and has not warped when being washed with soap and water.</li>
            <li>I have been a licensed nail tech for 7 years and have tried many different foot files.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;5-1/4&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>I keep it in the shower, use at the end of a hot shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products, including the egg.</li>
            <li>This foot file does exactly what I need</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more when needed.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Larger than anticipated, it is comfortable to handle and works well and works quickly.</li>
            <li>The Red side is really good for fast removal of bulk &amp; they really do remove the old buildup &amp; calluses.</li>
            <li>I love this thing, I actually don&#x27;t need to worry too much about my calluses, it does the job if used all the time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several files &amp; until now only one was any good...</li>
            <li>But this is just right for regular maintenance of smooth feet.  </li>
            <li>I live in a small town and have not been able to find a decent file.....until now!!!!!  </li>
            <li>and I like to use the coarse side first then polish it up with the fine side</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower, first the red side then the black, and it leaves my feet feeling great.  </li>
            <li>Usually I use more fine files, but if you&#x27;re looking for a heavy-duty file this one will work for you very well.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the large size of this file.</li>
            <li>Extremely large foot scraper, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>This file is much better, I have been getting this file for the last 2 years and will continue to purchase it as long as it is  available to me.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t tell a difference between coarse vs fine</li>
            <li>It takes a little to get used to it, but if it lasts anytime at all, it is more than worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Just ensure your heels are wet and wet as needed to get a great result.</li>
            <li>It does the job of a professional one and keeps my feet soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much,</li>
            <li>Very lustful for the price.</li>
            <li>She has suffered with this her whole life; its terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;sandpaper&amp;#34; is sturdy and glued on very well.  </li>
            <li>wife now tells me she wants to get a pedicure, have fancy toes, and wear backless shoes.  </li>
            <li>I really like this foot file.  </li>
            <li>High quality product!</li>
            <li>Both sides work very well.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Really works well.  </li>
            <li>I really, really like this foot file.  </li>
            <li>The handle make the foot file so much easier to use.</li>
            <li>Really gets those calluses off the feet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working very well at smoothing out my heels without shredding them or causing pain.</li>
            <li>really aggravating because it took</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very hopeful while buying this too</li>
            <li>My feet weathered many conditions during military maneuvers and I needed something like a rasp.</li>
            <li>One side is very course and the other is OK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely sturdy and made of wood, so you can use it with appropriate force without fear of breaking it.  </li>
            <li>with just the right rough surface to clean my heels.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, remove all the dry skin on your feat, easily and fast.  </li>
            <li>but when it is dry, it is quite fine.</li>
            <li>One side is more gentle (red), and I only need to use that.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this...</li>
            <li>Be careful if you enjoy having your heels looking like a baby, your feet my hurt!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of this file, my wife&#x27;s feet look normal again.  </li>
            <li>The wood is thick and durable and provides a nice grip.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the shower and seriously, this is better than any pumice stone or pedi egg I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>But this was better than other similar products I have used.</li>
            <li>I knew I wanted something better than those cheese-grater callous removers, but I was having trouble finding one of those files the pedicurists use... until now!</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, lasts long and works very well</li>
            <li>I bought this to go along with some professional callous remover solution and so far haven&#x27;t felt the need to even try the solution because this already works so well.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, 2 different grits, and</li>
            <li>so far no complaints&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I opened the package of the file size</li>
            <li>My feet are soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li>This fixed ALL of that.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alike a professional pedicure spatula.</li>
            <li>an old one made by Dannyco.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is a little high but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>must admit, I don&#x27;t have busted, super crusty feet, but I did have dry heels and calluses on my big toes</li>
            <li>But as most of the other files out there are not rough enough or durable enough to make baby soft feet</li>
            <li>This is especially for people with very rough feet, and works better than any other foot files out in the market.</li>
            <li>It was extremely affordable for such a high quality tool that works very well.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know it was going to be huge and thick.</li>
            <li>This really works and smooths out the rough edges on your heels.  </li>
            <li>If your feet have lost their sparkle (seems weird to say, but that&#x27;s honestly how it feels), then give this file a try.</li>
            <li>it to do - gets rid of dry dead skin and leaves the roughest parts of my feet feeling as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>- I had a wooden one of these previously, and the sandpaper came off after a few weeks&#x27; use, so I was hesitant to get this one, but it seems to be even better than the plastic one it replaces.  </li>
            <li>No other words necessary!!</li>
            <li>, this is better than the wavy file foot filer, the ones they sell at walmart, it really buffs down tough callouses, this is definitely a must have!</li>
            <li>It is just what I wanted, have been looking for this type for a long time since my old one is not in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>just so I have it at the ready when this one gets worn down.</li>
            <li>File has 2 different grits and works pretty well for dried heels.</li>
            <li>It comes with 2 different grits...a red one for really grinding that callus off and a black one for smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Very gentle on my feet, does a great job quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  </li>

            <li> love this file.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I love this file.  </li>
            <li> With 2 days of treatment, I was able to do way more with her feet than soaking and a pumice stone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works ok.  </li>
            <li> Have used better ones</li>
            <li> a must have , I love it</li>
            <li> Glad I found this one.</li>
            <li> Love it going to buy another ..</li>
            <li> Love this foot file and keep it in the shower to use &amp;#34;as needed&amp;#34; on heels and bottom of feet.  </li>
            <li> It has a rougher side and a smoother side which I love.</li>
            <li> Very durable and works great on removing callous.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love the size</li>
            <li> Overall she has been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Its very sturdy and a the price is great too.</li>
            <li> Works better than the rest.</li>
            <li> *sure* to follow with a pumace and/or chemical exfoliant after use.</li>
            <li> I really love this.</li>
            <li> Great product - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a well made product, but neither side is suitable for light exfoliating or polishing.  </li>
            <li> find using it when my feet are dry works best for me</li>
            <li> but I just discovered a nickel plated version that is just fantastic and works better than this one.</li>
            <li> Great product, my feet feels so soft already.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of removing corns or calluses and then can smooth the entire foot until it&#x27;s smooth.  </li>
            <li> - you can really get a good grip on it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use due to the size of the file  very impressed.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and store in the bathtub.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of elbow grease.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy and easy to hold ...</li>
            <li> strong and durable</li>
            <li> Nice big handle for a good grip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is hands down the best foot file EVER!  </li>
            <li> This file has two sides, a course and a fine side.</li>
            <li> The file is huge...</li>
            <li> In no time, you&#x27;ll have smooth feet again...</li>
            <li> I can have smooth feet</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Liked so much</li>
            <li> Within minutes my feet were 98% pain free while walking.</li>
            <li> The handle seems comfortable, but I&#x27;m used to holding a foot file about 1/3 of this size.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I definitely didn&#x27;t need one of those cheese grater looking files, but I definitely needed more than the cheapy-ones from Sally&#x27;s, and this fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> but original price was $34.95...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long and great to when cleaning your feet.</li>
            <li> It definitely worth the expense!</li>
            <li> This is a nice foot file, as I live in the Southwest, therefore I&#x27;m always barefoot.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time just the action of filing made the calluses more sore than when I started...</li>
            <li> The two sides give the ability to get the rougher areas (like the heel) quickly and the more gentle areas (around the toes/arch) easily.  </li>
            <li> This thing does a great job on the rough edges of my heel.</li>
            <li> Better then metal grader style but be gentle</li>
            <li> and I found the Diane European Foot File had good reviews</li>
            <li> The two different grits and the price are good for the client and for my business.</li>
            <li> It is extremely durable and great to leave in the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought several for my baths, and gifts and they are exceptional.</li>
            <li> /&gt;.spectacular super recommendedðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well pleased with these....will buy more soon just to have on hand for the future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very rough/calloused feet to begin with, but this does a great job of removing dead skin from my feet, which I used to be able to scrape off with my fingernails after every shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very durable, easy to hold, and has two sides for filing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but be careful.  </li>
            <li> If you have something that needs to be exfoliated this is the right tool for the job.</li>
            <li> Softens feet right up.  </li>
            <li> It does job good, but in my opinion the file is for a pretty rough skin.</li>
            <li> The abrasive seems very soundly glued to the wooden handle and has not warped when being washed with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I have been a licensed nail tech for 7 years and have tried many different foot files.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;5-1/4&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I keep it in the shower, use at the end of a hot shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products, including the egg.</li>
            <li> This foot file does exactly what I need</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more when needed.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Larger than anticipated, it is comfortable to handle and works well and works quickly.</li>
            <li> The Red side is really good for fast removal of bulk &amp; they really do remove the old buildup &amp; calluses.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, I actually don&#x27;t need to worry too much about my calluses, it does the job if used all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several files &amp; until now only one was any good...</li>
            <li> But this is just right for regular maintenance of smooth feet.  </li>
            <li> I live in a small town and have not been able to find a decent file.....until now!!!!!  </li>
            <li> and I like to use the coarse side first then polish it up with the fine side</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower, first the red side then the black, and it leaves my feet feeling great.  </li>
            <li> Usually I use more fine files, but if you&#x27;re looking for a heavy-duty file this one will work for you very well.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the large size of this file.</li>
            <li> Extremely large foot scraper, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> This file is much better, I have been getting this file for the last 2 years and will continue to purchase it as long as it is  available to me.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t tell a difference between coarse vs fine</li>
            <li> It takes a little to get used to it, but if it lasts anytime at all, it is more than worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Just ensure your heels are wet and wet as needed to get a great result.</li>
            <li> It does the job of a professional one and keeps my feet soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much,</li>
            <li> Very lustful for the price.</li>
            <li> She has suffered with this her whole life; its terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;sandpaper&amp;#34; is sturdy and glued on very well.  </li>
            <li> wife now tells me she wants to get a pedicure, have fancy toes, and wear backless shoes.  </li>
            <li> I really like this foot file.  </li>
            <li> High quality product!</li>
            <li> Both sides work very well.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  </li>
            <li> Really works well.  </li>
            <li> I really, really like this foot file.  </li>
            <li> The handle make the foot file so much easier to use.</li>
            <li> Really gets those calluses off the feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working very well at smoothing out my heels without shredding them or causing pain.</li>
            <li> really aggravating because it took</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very hopeful while buying this too</li>
            <li> My feet weathered many conditions during military maneuvers and I needed something like a rasp.</li>
            <li> One side is very course and the other is OK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely sturdy and made of wood, so you can use it with appropriate force without fear of breaking it.  </li>
            <li> with just the right rough surface to clean my heels.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, remove all the dry skin on your feat, easily and fast.  </li>
            <li> but when it is dry, it is quite fine.</li>
            <li> One side is more gentle (red), and I only need to use that.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this...</li>
            <li> Be careful if you enjoy having your heels looking like a baby, your feet my hurt!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of this file, my wife&#x27;s feet look normal again.  </li>
            <li> The wood is thick and durable and provides a nice grip.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and seriously, this is better than any pumice stone or pedi egg I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> But this was better than other similar products I have used.</li>
            <li> I knew I wanted something better than those cheese-grater callous removers, but I was having trouble finding one of those files the pedicurists use... until now!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, lasts long and works very well</li>
            <li> I bought this to go along with some professional callous remover solution and so far haven&#x27;t felt the need to even try the solution because this already works so well.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, 2 different grits, and</li>
            <li> so far no complaints&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I opened the package of the file size</li>
            <li> My feet are soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li> This fixed ALL of that.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alike a professional pedicure spatula.</li>
            <li> an old one made by Dannyco.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is a little high but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> must admit, I don&#x27;t have busted, super crusty feet, but I did have dry heels and calluses on my big toes</li>
            <li> But as most of the other files out there are not rough enough or durable enough to make baby soft feet</li>
            <li> This is especially for people with very rough feet, and works better than any other foot files out in the market.</li>
            <li> It was extremely affordable for such a high quality tool that works very well.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it was going to be huge and thick.</li>
            <li> This really works and smooths out the rough edges on your heels.  </li>
            <li> If your feet have lost their sparkle (seems weird to say, but that&#x27;s honestly how it feels), then give this file a try.</li>
            <li> it to do - gets rid of dry dead skin and leaves the roughest parts of my feet feeling as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> - I had a wooden one of these previously, and the sandpaper came off after a few weeks&#x27; use, so I was hesitant to get this one, but it seems to be even better than the plastic one it replaces.  </li>
            <li> No other words necessary!!</li>
            <li> , this is better than the wavy file foot filer, the ones they sell at walmart, it really buffs down tough callouses, this is definitely a must have!</li>
            <li> It is just what I wanted, have been looking for this type for a long time since my old one is not in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> just so I have it at the ready when this one gets worn down.</li>
            <li> File has 2 different grits and works pretty well for dried heels.</li>
            <li> It comes with 2 different grits...a red one for really grinding that callus off and a black one for smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both are pretty rough, rougher than any of the previous foot files I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the last one I purchased was not as good as the ones I&#x27;ve gotten in the past.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again if the current one is retired although it will still take a long time to replace it.</li>
            <li> The wood is thick and solid, and the sandpaper seems to be attached very well</li>
            <li> I wish they weren&#x27;t as wide as they are because it makes it difficult to get into certain places on your feet, but for the price, I really can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> Long handle makes rubbing the feet way easier.</li>
            <li> So much easier to handle than the small ones from the drugstore!  </li>
            <li> I find that both sides are coarse and this is not exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> After my last foot file started peeling (the emory board part was peeling off like a sticker) and the one before that broke in half (plastic)</li>
            <li> It has a red side and a black side</li>
            <li> I prefer it dry than wet.</li>
            <li> Works well on wet or dry feet.  </li>
            <li> It was larger than the previous files she has used.  </li>
            <li> For the price and the way it takes off rough dry skin on your heels</li>
            <li> I have feet that get very dry, unsightly.</li>
            <li> this works wonders on rough feet and the red side is for dry exfoliation, the black for wet.</li>
            <li> Works great for when the backs of your feet start to get dry and you just wanna slough it off without using a pedi egg (which is terrible for you, by the way).</li>
            <li> I just wished the course paper was glued extra tightly on to the wood handle mine</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried several, from $40 to those little do-nothing pumice stones from the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> You can wash it (rinse it) after use without the rough paper coming off from the wood.</li>
            <li> Some of the cheaper ones cannot be rinsed as the rough paper comes off the wood when wet.</li>
            <li> I got a pedi in the Philippines and they used this tool and it gets off so much dead skin, but they also used a regular foot scrubber as well but had to get this never seen anyone use this before!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and expected.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it wet as yet</li>
            <li> Also, having both a wet side and a try side seems to be convenient.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are insanely rough and seemed to be made for men.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day when I&#x27;m in the shower and it has helped soften my feet.</li>
            <li> No more trying to maneuver that tiny &amp;#34;ped egg&amp;#34; thingy.</li>
            <li> The foot file is well made and the file pad is a lighter coarseness on one side and coarser on the other side.  </li>
            <li> can foresee using this on a weekly basis in the summer (when my feet are their driest due to being in sandals and exposed all the time) and every other week at other times of the year.</li>
            <li> one wrong (or too intense) movement</li>
            <li> it has a really thick wooden handle.  </li>
            <li> It clears up extremely hard cracked calloused sole with little effort.</li>
            <li> started lifting a little on the corner, but thats because i like using it in my shower.</li>
            <li> If you have serious, deep cracks, I&#x27;m not sure this is the file for you.</li>
            <li> If I had some really, really serious callouses I&#x27;d recommend this product, but for even my Colorado dry feet, it overkill.</li>
            <li> I gave myself a few days to see how I was going to like it</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower to limit the amount of dead skin then slather petroleum jelly on my feet and wear socks for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I bought a few just in case they run out</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on pedeggs or blades.</li>
            <li> I like the foot file lots because it helps remove ther dead dtried calluses off the bottom of my foot.</li>
            <li> It is not a permanent fix but does work for a few days.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have heavy calluses, those are just too harsh!  </li>
            <li> Both sides are rough so unless you are a tough guy you will need a smoothing pad.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of foot files in the past, they all ended up with the handle broken.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a regular foot file, instead of a pumice stone or one of those scary things that looks like a cheese grater.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with the price, either, on such poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Does the job for removing hard skin on the heels.</li>
            <li> and this one makes that hard to figure out.</li>
            <li> I have one complaint of this one.  </li>
            <li> , I decided to try this one because it is made out of thick wood.</li>
            <li> Their made of 1/4-3/8&amp;#34; thick wood that does not bend &amp; give.</li>
            <li> (if you walk around barefoot on hard wood at home, you might know what I mean).</li>
            <li> Am not very happy with how it works either.  </li>
            <li> broken being in the shower</li>
            <li> I have bought endless foot files and all of them disappointed me .</li>
            <li> Her calluses were so bad and thick and cracked.  </li>
            <li> I hate getting dried, scaly skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a foot file that works &amp; this one does, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you have nasty calluses like my wife, I recommend you get this file and use it a little every day.  </li>
            <li> I recommend these to anyone who has those painful, burning calluses &amp; buildup on their feet.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s good, but be careful.  You can &amp;#34;grate too much&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very effective !!! Its a must have ..believe me!</li>
            <li> this file is the best. I have been using this file in place of the pumice stone. This file is much better, I have been getting this file for the last 2 years and will continue to purchase it as long as it is  available to me. Thanks so much,</li>
            <li> Does the job for removing hard skin on the heels. Works as expected. You can wash it (rinse it) after use without the rough paper coming off from the wood. Some of the cheaper ones cannot be rinsed as the rough paper comes off the wood when wet.</li>
            <li> Durable and effective.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I would buy it again but it is so well built it make take awhile.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this.  Very lustful for the price.</li>
            <li> Amazingly effective product</li>
            <li> After my last foot file started peeling (the emory board part was peeling off like a sticker) and the one before that broke in half (plastic), I decided to try this one because it is made out of thick wood. It is extremely durable and great to leave in the shower. Works great for when the backs of your feet start to get dry and you just wanna slough it off without using a pedi egg (which is terrible for you, by the way). Just apply lotion after for great results :)</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to keep in the shower. I&#x27;d give it five stars but I just discovered a nickel plated version that is just fantastic and works better than this one. But this was better than other similar products I have used.</li>
            <li> love this file. strong and durable</li>
            <li> Better then metal grader style but be gentle</li>
            <li> Love this.  Easy to use and store in the bathtub.  I use it every other day when I&#x27;m in the shower and it has helped soften my feet.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this file.  My wife had reptile feet.  Her calluses were so bad and thick and cracked.  One time we had to go to a foot doctor and have her calluses removed with a scalpel.  She has suffered with this her whole life; its terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using advice from the web, I soaked her feet in water and baking soda for 30 minutes each day for a week and then worked on her calluses with a pumice stone.  That helped some.  Then I was researching foot files and I found the Diane European Foot File had good reviews so I bought it.  With 2 days of treatment, I was able to do way more with her feet than soaking and a pumice stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this file, my wife&#x27;s feet look normal again.  The file is huge...we joked that it could be used to give a good spanking.  The wood is thick and durable and provides a nice grip.  The &amp;#34;sandpaper&amp;#34; is sturdy and glued on very well.  Rinsing it off was not a problem.  It comes with 2 different grits...a red one for really grinding that callus off and a black one for smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase.  It was extremely affordable for such a high quality tool that works very well.  If you have nasty calluses like my wife, I recommend you get this file and use it a little every day.  In no time, you&#x27;ll have smooth feet again...and you won&#x27;t need to go to the foot doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife now tells me she wants to get a pedicure, have fancy toes, and wear backless shoes.  Now she can...</li>
            <li> I never write reviews for things but this product deserves it! I use it in the shower and seriously, this is better than any pumice stone or pedi egg I&#x27;ve ever used! I bought this to go along with some professional callous remover solution and so far haven&#x27;t felt the need to even try the solution because this already works so well.</li>
            <li> I wish they weren&#x27;t as wide as they are because it makes it difficult to get into certain places on your feet, but for the price, I really can&#x27;t complain.  They do the job without hurting your feet.</li>
            <li> It works ok.  Have used better ones</li>
            <li> a must have , I love it</li>
            <li> Luv this from time.. it works great...Very good purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this foot file.  I gave myself a few days to see how I was going to like it and how I thought it would hold up.  So far, so good.  It does an excellent job of removing corns or calluses and then can smooth the entire foot until it&#x27;s smooth.  It takes a little to get used to it, but if it lasts anytime at all, it is more than worth the price.  Glad I found this one.</li>
            <li> I have been a licensed nail tech for 7 years and have tried many different foot files.  This one by Diane is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  The red side is so course that you don&#x27;t even need to use callus remover on even the roughest feet.  The price on Amazon is a little high but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Good quality, works well!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, 2 different grits, and I like it so well that I bought one for a friend.  I use it with callus remover and it works well.</li>
            <li> Better than store items that cost more!</li>
            <li> My feet are like a crocks back...Thank god for this foot file...I can have smooth feet again!&lt;br /&gt;I bought two~</li>
            <li> Love it going to buy another ..</li>
            <li> Love this is works wonders! ðŸ˜Š I got a pedi in the Philippines and they used this tool and it gets off so much dead skin, but they also used a regular foot scrubber as well but had to get this never seen anyone use this before!</li>
            <li> Larger than anticipated, it is comfortable to handle and works well and works quickly. The abrasive seems very soundly glued to the wooden handle and has not warped when being washed with soap and water. If you have something that needs to be exfoliated this is the right tool for the job.</li>
            <li> Works great,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this once. so far no complaints&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Receiving two is a nice for sharing with a family member</li>
            <li> Love this foot file and keep it in the shower to use &amp;#34;as needed&amp;#34; on heels and bottom of feet.  This is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of elbow grease.  It has a rougher side and a smoother side which I love.</li>
            <li> Amazing. No other words necessary!!</li>
            <li> High quality product!</li>
            <li> This is a well made product, but neither side is suitable for light exfoliating or polishing.  Both are pretty rough, rougher than any of the previous foot files I&#x27;ve owned.  If I had some really, really serious callouses I&#x27;d recommend this product, but for even my Colorado dry feet, it overkill.</li>
            <li> I thought I was to receive two but got just one!!!!  It is a good product though and I will be happy, I guess!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and expected.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the large size of this file. No more trying to maneuver that tiny &amp;#34;ped egg&amp;#34; thingy. This file has two sides, a course and a fine side. Both sides work very well. This is a must have product.</li>
            <li> THE best foot file I have used~ this works wonders on rough feet and the red side is for dry exfoliation, the black for wet. I bought several for my baths, and gifts and they are exceptional. Five Strong Stars!</li>
            <li> I love this thing, I actually don&#x27;t need to worry too much about my calluses, it does the job if used all the time</li>
            <li> Very durable and works great on removing callous. Great price</li>
            <li> The foot file is well made and the file pad is a lighter coarseness on one side and coarser on the other side.  It will work well on the heel and larger areas of the feet.  I was surprised when I opened the package of the file size, (the handle is 4-3/4&amp;#34; in length and the file area is&lt;br /&gt;5-1/4&amp;#34;). I&#x27;ve already used the item and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic .&lt;br /&gt;.spectacular super recommendedðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  Really works well.  Highly recommend, remove all the dry skin on your feat, easily and fast.  Love it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this foot callous file.  Says its the best she ever had.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need it..... but original price was $34.95...sale $3.95....I bought 5 as extra gifts, It does a good job, depending on condition of feet.</li>
            <li> This foot file is a must for anyone who does their own mani and pedi. Just ensure your heels are wet and wet as needed to get a great result. Be careful if you enjoy having your heels looking like a baby, your feet my hurt!&lt;br /&gt;This product was recommended by my manicurist and I just love it!</li>
            <li> Extremely large foot scraper, but it does the job.  Both sides are rough so unless you are a tough guy you will need a smoothing pad.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and very effective</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of foot files in the past, they all ended up with the handle broken.&lt;br /&gt;There is no chance of that with with this file. STURDY, and effective.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time.  I find that both sides are coarse and this is not exactly what I wanted.  I tend to buy some things by review and this time I feel the reviews did not help me.</li>
            <li> I hate getting dried, scaly skin on my feet.  I use this in the shower to limit the amount of dead skin then slather petroleum jelly on my feet and wear socks for a few hours.  My feet are soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.  I have one complaint of this one.  It has a red side and a black side but I can&#x27;t tell a difference between coarse vs fine and I like to use the coarse side first then polish it up with the fine side and this one makes that hard to figure out.</li>
            <li> This works!  I am using it daily and it is durable. Use in conjunction with a good heel cream</li>
            <li> I really, really like this foot file.  It&#x27;s extremely sturdy and made of wood, so you can use it with appropriate force without fear of breaking it.  The two sides give the ability to get the rougher areas (like the heel) quickly and the more gentle areas (around the toes/arch) easily.  Great product - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works really good on my feet</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  Not happy with the price, either, on such poor quality.  The picture shows a nice wood finish, but it&#x27;s just an unfinished piece of plywood.  Am not very happy with how it works either.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product, my feet feels so soft already. I have not tried it wet as yet but when it is dry, it is quite fine.</li>
            <li> it has a really thick wooden handle.  it works great.  My last plastic one broke.</li>
            <li> Huge!  So much easier to handle than the small ones from the drugstore!  Works great.  Love it!!  My feet approve!</li>
            <li> The handle make the foot file so much easier to use. It&#x27;s long and great to when cleaning your feet.</li>
            <li> This is a nice foot file, as I live in the Southwest, therefore I&#x27;m always barefoot.  You do need to use a foot cream at night in order to obtain optimal results with any of the foot file that you may use.</li>
            <li> Love it! Really gets those calluses off the feet.</li>
            <li> I love it. Best foot scrub ever made. It did the job with no problem. I prefer it dry than wet.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic!  I love the size - you can really get a good grip on it.  Also, having both a wet side and a try side seems to be convenient.  It&#x27;s working very well at smoothing out my heels without shredding them or causing pain.</li>
            <li> still using them,great product</li>
            <li> This is a good foot file.  Works well on wet or dry feet.  I prefer using when my feet are dry--smoother results.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this foot file.  She was amazed at the size of it.  It was larger than the previous files she has used.  She also commented that it seemed to be coarser than others she has had.  Overall she has been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, lasts long and works very well</li>
            <li> very big. One side is very course and the other is OK. I like a finer paper to finish.</li>
            <li> This is the nicest file I have ever purchased. Its perfect to use in the shower. Its very sturdy and a the price is great too.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and very durable. Will def buy again and buying my mom one as well.</li>
            <li> Nice, sturdy hand tool that gets the job done</li>
            <li> too scratchy!! one wrong (or too intense) movement and you get an injury (</li>
            <li> This is the best foot file I have EVER used. Ever. And I&#x27;ve tried several, from $40 to those little do-nothing pumice stones from the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit, I don&#x27;t have busted, super crusty feet, but I did have dry heels and calluses on my big toes that never seemed to go away (if you walk around barefoot on hard wood at home, you might know what I mean). This fixed ALL of that. In one use. I definitely didn&#x27;t need one of those cheese grater looking files, but I definitely needed more than the cheapy-ones from Sally&#x27;s, and this fit the bill perfectly. If you have serious, deep cracks, I&#x27;m not sure this is the file for you. But if you&#x27;re looking for awesome foot maintenance for light to medium scraggly feet, then give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can foresee using this on a weekly basis in the summer (when my feet are their driest due to being in sandals and exposed all the time) and every other week at other times of the year. If your feet have lost their sparkle (seems weird to say, but that&#x27;s honestly how it feels), then give this file a try. I&#x27;m going to order another one just so I have it at the ready when this one gets worn down.</li>
            <li> Works better than the rest. One side is more gentle (red), and I only need to use that.</li>
            <li> My wife has callous buildup on the bottom of her feet.  She&#x27;s pickey about the the kind of file she uses but seems to like this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great foot file!! I keep it in the shower, use at the end of a hot shower.  Softens feet right up.  Follow up with a nice foot cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products, including the egg. This by far us the best product. It clears up extremely hard cracked calloused sole with little effort. I bought a few just in case they run out</li>
            <li> This is a must have for anyone who walks a lot and/or has a problem with callouses. I&#x27;ve been using these exclusively for years now. Unfortunately the last one I purchased was not as good as the ones I&#x27;ve gotten in the past. But I&#x27;ll assume that was just a one time thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are insanely rough and seemed to be made for men. But as most of the other files out there are not rough enough or durable enough to make baby soft feet I took the chance on this product. I&#x27;m so happy I did!. I&#x27;ve paid upward of $15 in search of a good file, and these are the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be *sure* to follow with a pumace and/or chemical exfoliant after use. These files are for removing unwanted callouses, but not for smoothing the skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money on pedeggs or blades. They don&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> Wow. I knew I wanted something better than those cheese-grater callous removers, but I was having trouble finding one of those files the pedicurists use... until now! I got this European foot file and a pumice bar, but since trying out this foot file I haven&#x27;t opened the pumice bar yet! This foot file does exactly what I need it to do - gets rid of dry dead skin and leaves the roughest parts of my feet feeling as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This file rocks!</li>
            <li> This is especially for people with very rough feet, and works better than any other foot files out in the market. I just wished the course paper was glued extra tightly on to the wood handle mine started lifting a little on the corner, but thats because i like using it in my shower. oops! Still a good investment!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very rough/calloused feet to begin with, but this does a great job of removing dead skin from my feet, which I used to be able to scrape off with my fingernails after every shower. Now I don&#x27;t have to!</li>
            <li> This wooden foot file is just what I was looking for.  Sturdy and easy to hold ... with just the right rough surface to clean my heels.</li>
            <li> For the price and the way it takes off rough dry skin on your heels this is hands down the best foot file EVER!  Liked so much I ordered two.  They&#x27;ll probably last me a life time</li>
            <li> It definitely worth the expense! It&#x27;s alike a professional pedicure spatula.</li>
            <li> Excellent  product.works great.</li>
            <li> Use it at night, then put cream on with socks. It is just what I wanted, have been looking for this type for a long time since my old one is not in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I really love this. Long handle makes rubbing the feet way easier. with the rope, I can just hang it on the wall of the bathroom. the best part of the item is two side filing paper with high quality. I will buy this again if the current one is retired although it will still take a long time to replace it.</li>
            <li> works well arrived in time .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a regular foot file, instead of a pumice stone or one of those scary things that looks like a cheese grater.  If you don&#x27;t have heavy calluses, those are just too harsh!  But this is just right for regular maintenance of smooth feet.  I use it in the shower, first the red side then the black, and it leaves my feet feeling great.  The wood is thick and solid, and the sandpaper seems to be attached very well - I had a wooden one of these previously, and the sandpaper came off after a few weeks&#x27; use, so I was hesitant to get this one, but it seems to be even better than the plastic one it replaces.  I&#x27;m very glad I found this!</li>
            <li> This foot file works wonders, this is better than the wavy file foot filer, the ones they sell at walmart, it really buffs down tough callouses, this is definitely a must have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several files &amp; until now only one was any good...an old one made by Dannyco. But don&#x27;t guess they make foot files anymore. But these files are great. Two sided with different grains emery cloth. The Red side is really good for fast removal of bulk &amp; they really do remove the old buildup &amp; calluses. I&#x27;d tried the plastic ones you find everywhere &amp; it took for ever to get the job done. Most of the time just the action of filing made the calluses more sore than when I started...really aggravating because it took ~ 12-24 hrs before my feet started feeling better.&lt;br /&gt; I recommend these to anyone who has those painful, burning calluses &amp; buildup on their feet. Within minutes my feet were 98% pain free while walking. Their made of 1/4-3/8&amp;#34; thick wood that does not bend &amp; give. Nice big handle for a good grip.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m well pleased with these....will buy more soon just to have on hand for the future.</li>
            <li> Very good product, easy to handle. Does the job,good for any type of skin. Great quality, inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s very durable, easy to hold, and has two sides for filing. I used it twice already, and am very happy with the purchase! I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have feet that get very dry, unsightly. This foot file right here, is perfect! By far the best one I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I will definitely purchase more when needed. I highly recommend this...</li>
            <li> Works really well! Very gentle on my feet, does a great job quickly&lt;br /&gt;I find using it when my feet are dry works best for me</li>
            <li> It does job good, but in my opinion the file is for a pretty rough skin. Usually I use more fine files, but if you&#x27;re looking for a heavy-duty file this one will work for you very well.</li>
            <li> I love this file! It does the job of a professional one and keeps my feet soft and smooth. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I live in a small town and have not been able to find a decent file.....until now!!!!!  Sturdy, and has two surfaces with different levels of abrasion.  Exactly what I needed at an excellent price.  You will not regret this purchase!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it was going to be huge and thick. The handle seems comfortable, but I&#x27;m used to holding a foot file about 1/3 of this size. If you wear size 13 and up, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I needed.  Excellent</li>
            <li> With the summer upon us it&#x27;s time for the sandals and flip flops .My feet are in good form but I see that if I don&#x27;t take care of them they start to have calluses . I have bought endless foot files and all of them disappointed me . I wasn&#x27;t very hopeful while buying this too but when it arrived and I saw the file I was amazed . It has a great handle and the file area is huge unlike the others we find .I gave myself a pedicure that day and it did the job well .my mom is also loving .hasnt broken being in the shower and I am very happy would have been happier if would have bought two .</li>
            <li> These footcare files are just perfect. The two different grits and the price are good for the client and for my business.</li>
            <li> File has 2 different grits and works pretty well for dried heels.</li>
            <li> I like the foot file lots because it helps remove ther dead dtried calluses off the bottom of my foot.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This foot file works!!! I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a foot file that works &amp; this one does, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Shipped on time &amp; as advertised.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t need to buy another one.</li>
            <li> This really works and smooths out the rough edges on your heels.  It is not a permanent fix but does work for a few days.</li>
            <li> This thing does a great job on the rough edges of my heel. My feet weathered many conditions during military maneuvers and I needed something like a rasp. Well this is the closest thing, only safer to use!</li>
            <li> Great file for feet with not severe calluses. Easy to use due to the size of the file  very impressed.</li>
