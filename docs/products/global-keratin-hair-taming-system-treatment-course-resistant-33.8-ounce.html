            <li>my hair came out pin straight!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it specially living in Miami with the humidity.</li>
            <li>The directions were easy to follow and thorough on the back of the bottle.</li>

            <li>Fast &amp; Good,will buy again</li>
            <li>much better!A WELL VENTILATED AREA.  </li>
            <li>every 6 months sometimes less sometimes more</li>
            <li>Less product is used because it is thicker and adheres to hair better.  </li>
            <li>less (make sure to Google it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes it hard to do on your own.</li>
            <li>I normally pay 150 for 10 ounces.</li>
            <li>I color and condition it just like normal then followed the instructions for the GK system by shampooing my hair TWICE with a clarifying shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This global keratin irritates your nose and eye, the one I had before was not irritating or burningat all.</li>
            <li>my hair is strait and soft now</li>
            <li>normally color my hair prior to doing the keratin treatment because if you do it afterwards you have to wait two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Usually I re-do the treatment every 3-4 months, but it really depends on how much you shampoo.  </li>

            <li> I usually get Keratin treatment done at a salon but they are expensive. Since money is tight I decided to have it done at home. I came across GK Hair Tamming System at Amazon. I ordered the product and delivery was very quick. I did the treatment at home with the assistance of another person to apply and flat iron. I&#x27;m happy to say that I got the salon results. My hair is so soft and beautifull and frizz free specially on humid days. I only spend half of the time (20 minutes) now to wash and blow dry my hair. I also bought the shampoo, conditioner and the frizz free serum and they work beautifully together. I definitely recommend this product to all my friends and family. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:c340d8674f8faba759570130713e234c]]I have been doing the Coppola Keratin Smoothing Treatment for several years now and I have been happy with the results.  However, after someone emailed me asking me questions about the review I wrote up for it they asked me if I ever tried GK Taming system.  That was the first time I have ever heard of it.  I did some research and saw that it actually involved one less step and it cost less.  I decided to give it a try and here are my results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Less time involved since GK does not require to let the product sit in your hair for 20-30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;~ You only have to blow dry your hair 100% dry ONCE unlike Coppola Keratin Smoothing Treatment which requires to be done twice.&lt;br /&gt;~ Less product is used because it is thicker and adheres to hair better.  I used only 2 ounces compared to the 4 ounces I would use of Coppola.&lt;br /&gt;~ The results are healthy straighter shiny looking hair!&lt;br /&gt;~ Cost less (make sure to Google it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes you read that right....my hair came out pin straight!  When I used Coppola brand it came out straight but not pin straight and looking naturally straight just by using a blow dryer.  My hair was full of shine and movement.  It lays flat without looking dull or lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally color my hair prior to doing the keratin treatment because if you do it afterwards you have to wait two weeks.  I color and condition it just like normal then followed the instructions for the GK system by shampooing my hair TWICE with a clarifying shampoo.  Coloring before the treatment also seals in the color better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you go to the GK website it states to rinse out the product after applying to your damp hair.  DO NOT RINSE OUT!  I took a towel and gently patted my hair to make sure there was not over saturation and then blow dried it until it was completed dry with a paddle brush and then finished off with a thermal round brush as instructed.  After it is dry, section your off and start flat ironing.  MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN  A WELL VENTILATED AREA.  I also had a fan blowing because the treatment might smell great when you apply it, but when you start using heat on it the smell and burning will begin.  Try your hardest to keep your hair away from your eyes and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After flat ironing my hair looked beautiful.  I am Latina I have long dark brown hair.  It shined and felt like silk.  When I walk it moved and flowed like a super model&#x27;s hair.  Usually I re-do the treatment every 3-4 months, but it really depends on how much you shampoo.  Make sure to use sulfate free products since they will help make the product last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it is time for a re-application, it is done to the entire head all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that I a no longer a Coppola user and I now a GK user.  It is easier and faster to use and best of all the results are much better!A WELL VENTILATED AREA.
