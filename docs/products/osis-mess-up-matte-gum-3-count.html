            <li>It is my favorite hair styling product and you can get a variety of nice effects depending on how you apply it</li>
            <li>Perfect and natural hair style.</li>
            <li>But when I opened, it was just as I was expecting, brand new and very good quality</li>
            <li>Love that one</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product,,, works well.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>and I love that it comes in this 3-pack.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never found anything better than this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for short hair!</li>
            <li>as it is one of the best brands, it really works and you can get this pack of 3 for a reasonable price...</li>
            <li>I only choose Redken and Schwarzkopf, nice texture, great packaging and a very good deal; I got the product around 1 week later than promised, but it was not the vendor&#x27;s responsibility; it was my country&#x27;s customs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and does not leave any visible residue.</li>
            <li>You have to strongly wash your hands to remove it after applying.</li>
            <li>The price for the 3 pack was like getting one for free.</li>
            <li>but the best thing about it is it doesn&#x27;t get hard</li>
            <li>, you can reshape, it&#x27;s not flakey and adds a nice natural looking texture to your hair.</li>
            <li>super hold.  </li>
            <li>I have silver hair and most other products leave some kind of funky under color.</li>
            <li>What took a good 5 minutes now thats a minute or less.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, no greasy hair like every other product available in stores.</li>
            <li>I tried many different products, but this one put an end to my quest.</li>
            <li>Best stuff ever for making your short hair look &amp;#34;lived in.&amp;#34; I bought 4 different products to try when I cut my hair short</li>
            <li>Love this molding cream I have been using for the last 2 years</li>
            <li>Overall, strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have asian hair - it never looks good out of the shower, when it&#x27;s dry or basically ever.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different products in my hair over the last few years and this one I am really happy with.</li>
            <li>I am a guy and normally wouldn&#x27;t even rate something like this</li>
            <li>Natural freedom with direction for your hair.</li>
            <li>Miss the old metal canisters.</li>
            <li>this product works very well for short spiky hair styles, even in the sultry south Florida heat and humidity.  </li>
            <li>I use it for a long time and i like so much.</li>
            <li>This stuff has made my hair actually look normal now</li>
            <li>and this is by far the big winner.</li>

            <li> as it is one of the best brands, it really works and you can get this pack of 3 for a reasonable price...</li>
            <li> My son loves this product!</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting from this product. It&#x27;s a thick cream that stick to your hands and hair. You have to strongly wash your hands to remove it after applying. Have to use shampoo if you want to remove from hair.</li>
            <li> As described...happy wth purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years now and while I have tried other products inbetween I always come back to this one because it is the only one that lets me control my hair properly while still being matte.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different products in my hair over the last few years and this one I am really happy with. It&#x27;s a bit creamy and you don&#x27;t need a lot. It holds my hair well but does not make it heavy, hard, or shiny. The plastic cases are sealed with foil to keep the product moist and seals well after opened. The price for the 3 pack was like getting one for free.</li>
            <li> Everithing was perfect</li>
            <li> I ordered wrong item.  Now I fHave what I want  super hold.  Love that one</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. What little hair I do have left is extremely unruly. Works perfectly, apply with finger strokes through your hair. spreads cleanly, no build up, brushes in place. Windy day just use your palms to place your hair in place. Natural freedom with direction for your hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I can use to keep my curls down!</li>
            <li> I use this daily for over a year now! It is my favorite hair styling product and you can get a variety of nice effects depending on how you apply it</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years now, it is not a &amp;#34;gluey&amp;#34; hair product but lets you do what you want to do shape-wise to your coif. I have silver hair and most other products leave some kind of funky under color. This stuff is a neutral white color and I don&#x27;t look look like I tried to dye my hair  blue or pink or something else weird. I am a guy and normally wouldn&#x27;t even rate something like this but it is a really good product that works for me so what the hey!</li>
            <li> Very good product. I use it for a long time and i like so much. Perfect and natural hair style.</li>
            <li> I must confess I was a bit afraid, thinking it could be a fake or copycat product. But when I opened, it was just as I was expecting, brand new and very good quality</li>
            <li> Miss the old metal canisters. Keeps the product fresher, longer. But great product otherwise.</li>
            <li> I love this product,,, works well.</li>
            <li> This products strength lies in its versatility.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and does not leave any visible residue. Does not change the tone of your hair. I tried many different products, but this one put an end to my quest. Tried on short hair to make is look &#x27;messy&#x27;. Cannot comment on other hair types. Overall, strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, no greasy hair like every other product available in stores. (Beeswax &amp;#62; Petroleum)</li>
            <li> this product works very well for short spiky hair styles, even in the sultry south Florida heat and humidity.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever for making your short hair look &amp;#34;lived in.&amp;#34; I bought 4 different products to try when I cut my hair short and this is by far the big winner. Tossing the rest!</li>
            <li> I have asian hair - it never looks good out of the shower, when it&#x27;s dry or basically ever. This stuff has made my hair actually look normal now haha. It holds well but the best thing about it is it doesn&#x27;t get hard, you can reshape, it&#x27;s not flakey and adds a nice natural looking texture to your hair. I no longer need to hairspray and blow dry my hair. What took a good 5 minutes now thats a minute or less.</li>

            <li> I have a really short pixie cut and this is the only styling cream that works for me. I absolutely love it and I&#x27;ve bought it over and over again. You can&#x27;t beat the pricing on Amazon and I love that it comes in this 3-pack. I typically like to try different products but I&#x27;ve never found anything better than this. It&#x27;s perfect for short hair!</li>
            <li> Perfect at what it is supposed to do and easy to apply, have tried fancier products but this works best</li>
            <li> Love this molding cream I have been using for the last 2 years</li>
