            <li>Very effective.</li>
            <li>Really excellent first time to try and are the best I have used.</li>
            <li>My dentist tells me xylitol is actually good for your teeth; it helps prevent cavities.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look good to me either.</li>
            <li>Minty taste, good value for money.</li>
            <li>Just good results.</li>
            <li>Tried Xylimelts and found them exceptional.</li>
            <li>It continually emits a really pleasant mint taste into the mouth, and makes it fresh and very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad someone did not see me (LOL)</li>
            <li>I am very glad that Amazon carries the product.</li>
            <li>I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tabs have a mild minty taste and very pleasant</li>
            <li>but I have seen better results with this product!</li>
            <li>The Xylimelts have more than met my expectations!  </li>
            <li>However, it took care of my problem so well that I&#x27;ve ordered more!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I wish I had found them much sooner!!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are absolutely the best thing I&#x27;ve found for keeping my mouth from drying out at night when I sleep.</li>
            <li>saw these on Amazon and decided to buy a box for her to try, even though they&#x27;re kind of pricy.  </li>
            <li>If you use this, check with your own dentist first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The XyliMelts have to be placed in your mouth between the cheek and gum and &amp;#34;allowed to melt&amp;#34; on their own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sweetie commented on how nice it was that they stayed in place on the side of her tongue when she used them.  </li>
            <li>came in handy after my surgery</li>
            <li>Good luck :)</li>
            <li>The disk is pleasant tasting and easy to use.</li>
            <li>using the two together have improved her condition greatly ...... and the fix was not very expensive!!</li>
            <li>Including my own mother : )  </li>
            <li>After reordering I took better look at package info .</li>
            <li>My daughter is a dental hygienist for many years in another state.</li>
            <li>I can speak to others with more confidence because my mouth feels better.</li>
            <li>It is important to press the tab securely at the gumline for a good 15 secs.</li>
            <li>The xylimelts are gone in the morning by the time I wake up, but my mouth is still noticeably more moist.</li>
            <li>More moistened?</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>and I have used it for months and will continue until something better comes along if ever.</li>
            <li>so she&#x27;d be sure not to run out,</li>
            <li>I did, but I do use xylimelts once in awhile when chewing gum would not be appropriate, like during a wedding.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the instructions and place the tab between top gum and inside of cheek.</li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I was also pleased that this product does not contain sugar but uses XYLITOL instead.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>The box suggests using just two, but I find three to be the magic number.  </li>
            <li>I have a prescription to stimulate my salivary glands into producing more saliva, and this works well during the daytime and evening when I am awake.  </li>
            <li>I love that it sticks somewhere in your mouth so that it&#x27;s not in the way.  </li>
            <li>It is okay...</li>
            <li>Taste OK also.</li>
            <li>use it mostly at night before I go to sleep for both</li>
            <li>I wake up with no aftertaste, and my mouth in better shape than before I had these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works best at night or during physical exertion.  </li>
            <li>He gets more sleep and feels much better.</li>
            <li>They work better than other&lt;br /&gt;products</li>
            <li>Oh, and the taste pretty good.</li>
            <li>There is a nice, mild mint flavor.  </li>
            <li>These are the best I have found for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>XYLIMELTS are the best product I have found for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>But, it is clean, easy, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about drool!</li>
            <li>With this product, my mouth feels a lot more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Great for dry mouth, nice taste.</li>
            <li>I can easily talk with the tabs in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Easy to apple and taste is minty.</li>
            <li>(I do not care for strong mints).</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of sticking it on the roof of my mouth where it dissolved really quickly!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the ultimate, GREAT breath mint, also.</li>
            <li>Sometimes 2 are all I need to make it comfortable through the night.  </li>
            <li>XyliMelts keeps his mouth moist for hours and has a light, non-offensive taste.</li>
            <li>She uses them at night and says they last the night for her and greatly reduce the discomfort of the inside of her mouth drying out.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and so glad it&#x27;s a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It sticks well to the mucosa, so make sure it is in the right spot.  </li>
            <li>The melt lasts an hour, two if you are very calm (asleep or not talking/moving the mouth).</li>
            <li>This was originally a 5 star review, but today I was told by my dentist to stop using Xylimelts every night.</li>
            <li>Discovered these originally at a dental convention.  </li>
            <li>As I have dry mouth issues, these mints work great to keep my mouth moist and they are tasty, too.</li>
            <li>Great dry mouth relief.</li>
            <li>Works great for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Ok, so ive been having dry mouth problems for a while now and just didnt know what to do , tried to drink more and more water which helped a bit but would keep me going to the bathroom all night.</li>
            <li>The first night she slept clear through the night and woke up with her mouth feeling good.  </li>
            <li>I love Xylimelts so much, I had forgotten one day and nonchalantly, placed the tabs in while in a parking lot preparing to enter a meeting.  </li>
            <li>The only good news is that the gut problems ended within a day of quitting Xylimelts.</li>
            <li>You have to keep them in place for a minute or two to get full adhesion.</li>
            <li>It seems to need a full 20 seconds of holding the mint there for it to stick well.</li>
            <li>They work so well , the time release means you don&#x27;t have to use countless mint candies and they taste good.  </li>
            <li>She says these help a good deal and seem to last a while after using them.</li>
            <li>I get a full night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>the most effective  products I&#x27;ve ever used for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>If you want a more effective dry mouth product, try Dentiva lozenges!  </li>
            <li>I have the mild mint flavor, and I like the taste.  </li>
            <li>I just stick one or two to the inside of my cheek and get hours of adequate saliva production, and two in my mouth at night allow me to get an almost \\&quot;normal\\&quot; nights sleep.  </li>
            <li>Always delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>She couldn&#x27;t believe how well and quickly they worked.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to use in middle of night and tastes great.</li>
            <li>I also use the XyliMelt mints when I want my breath to feel really fresh.</li>
            <li>I am undecided if I will try it again or not because I don&#x27;t feel that its different or better than using a sugar free candy, for example.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to give this product five-stars, but the short-lasting action of this product prevents me from doing so.  </li>
            <li>When I sleep with these, although they are gone when I wake, my mouth is relieved, moist and fresh.</li>
            <li>Wish it did work and interested in others&#x27; knowledge of superior products that do work toward dry mouth.</li>
            <li>The taste is pleasant, slightly minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>It tastes sour to me because my taste buds were scrambled by radiation, but most people should be able to tolerate it</li>
            <li>They work for my dry mouth&amp; help me to feel better!</li>
            <li>Apparently this was more than my digestive system could handle.  </li>
            <li>It does great at keeping my mouth moist over night, but I am not sure what it is doing to my teeth.</li>
            <li>Saw may reduce plaque and prevent tooth decay and its first ingredient was xylitol.</li>
            <li>In addition, be prepared to place these outstanding tabs inside your mouth in a private place.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since 2004 I&#x27;ve had three neck surgeries, including removal of most of the salivary glands on my left side and two rounds of radiation on my mouth and neck.</li>
            <li>To me, this discomfort is better than peeling my tongue off the roof of my mouth in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li>By the fourth morning she told me to order more</li>
            <li>I got this for him and at first it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I found it works best on the gums tissue above the upper molars (back teeth) rather than on the cheek, since this area is stable and doesn&#x27;t move with speaking or chewing.  </li>
            <li>A regular candy or gum does better for moisture.  </li>
            <li>but the taste is not so hot.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in years I&#x27;m sleeping almost through the night.</li>
            <li>Need to place two tablets in my mouth when I go to bed and two more in the middle of the night, and up rested.</li>
            <li>Nothing can fix dry mouth completely; but this is a good product..</li>
            <li>I find the taste pleasant and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product if you are willing to shell out the money for it!</li>
            <li>The XyliMelts are much more convenient and last much longer.  </li>
            <li>again, works very well, but does NOT last for more than 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>I just used these last night and woke up with quite fresh breath and my teeth were SMOOTH and clean-feeling.  </li>
            <li>XyliMelts are easy for me to place on the roof of my mouth,and they actually stay.</li>
            <li>MUCH BETTER THAN DEALING WITH A DRY MOUTH.THE</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a solution for dry mouth for many patients as well as myself.</li>
            <li>My husband has used many products for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY dry mouth remedies.  </li>
            <li>I am well pleased with Zylimelts for my dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>Lot better than dry mouth though...</li>
            <li>Biotene makes better products for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I was suffering from night time dry mouth, which has had a detrimental effect on my otherwise healthy gums.</li>
            <li>These are about the size of a large aspirin.</li>
            <li>It was hard finding a good place to put them.  </li>
            <li>But I will go back to the oral gel I had been using, very good but not nearly as effective as this product.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>They really help me.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY DOESN&#x27;T MATTER.</li>
            <li>Each tablet has a smooth, rounded white side and a textured tan side; the tan side is designed to adhere to your gums or cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is better than expected.</li>
            <li>My wife is sure that as soon as he tries them, he&#x27;ll become a customer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Much prefer this brand to Quantum, that one leaves a gummy residue, that has to be picked of.</li>
            <li>this seller delivered ery fast, as promised.</li>
            <li>My experience with them was that I continued to get too much saliva, and without control at night, it came out of my mouth onto the pillow just like before.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The XyliMelts really work; in the morning I have no drymouth.</li>
            <li>really do like this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks  for  </li>
            <li>These &amp;#34;XyliMelts&amp;#34; melt so fast that they don&#x27;t really do anything.  </li>
            <li>My niece who also has sjogrens told me about this product and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I gave samples out to a few people and no one liked it.</li>
            <li>So much better then other product.</li>
            <li>This one adheres easily, works for dry mouth and keeping that saliva flowing at night.</li>
            <li>After that it&#x27;s fine, as long as you don&#x27;t fool with it with your tongue.</li>
            <li>And once you figure it out, they really do stick to the inside of your mouth still allowing you to talk normally.</li>
            <li>The xylimelts do work, but after the tablet has dissipated your mouth will become dry pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>Also, at first it feels very cool on the tooth over which it&#x27;s placed, but that also goes away in a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>I wish they included more tabs in the box or made it less</li>
            <li>I find that the Biotene oral balance gel is better, though the tablets are less obtrusive than having a tube in your pocket that you take a dab of gel from.</li>
            <li>I went to the company&#x27;s website and found that they make two flavors, mild mint (which is not labeled as such), and mint-free (which says mint-free on the front of the box).  </li>
            <li>, I found that it only provided mild improvement.</li>
            <li>This is a simple, inexpensive solution to a big problem for many people.</li>
            <li>Gross after taste and the glue doesn&#x27;t dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li>It works OK for night time dry mouth, and it is flatter than most hard candy.</li>
            <li>Internet ratings rated it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I also sleep with a CPAP, which may have exacerbated the original dry mouth, but using XyliMelts has overcome the problem.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything I come across, and so far nothing has really worked.  </li>
            <li>After having radiation to my tonsil area &amp; neck, the saliva glands on the left side of my mouth were pretty much fried.</li>
            <li>After a few more days, all was well.  </li>
            <li>My teeth on the right side are basically decay-free, but on the left I&#x27;m looking at probably four crowns and probably 2-3 root canals.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product for dry mouth!!!  </li>
            <li>Not only does it taste better than other saliva stimulating dics</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to trash the product, so I left it at five stars, but the seller&#x27;s service was pretty abysmal.</li>
            <li>They came in and she tried a couple and WOW!</li>
            <li>But if I wake up dry it&#x27;s easy to reapply and go back to sleep.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mouth moisting benefits as well as the xyilotol which is very good at keeping bad bacteria from multiplying.</li>
            <li>This indeed does help with dry mouth without leaving any residue or aftertaste other than mint.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s interesting</li>
            <li>my tabs had not melted completely.</li>
            <li>product is made with xylitol, a naturally occurring sugar substitute (derived from plant fibers), which stimulates the production of saliva.  </li>
            <li>I turned out to be one of the multitude of people who is wildly allergic to Xylitol.  </li>
            <li>would order it on a regular basis, but to me - the price is too much .</li>
            <li>Bought samples directly from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>With a few more trys in different parts of the mouth it worked well.  </li>
            <li>The sticky substance that keeps it in place is kind of irritating on my teeth too.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, still a great product , i mean it is helping , just wish it was a little more.. but everyone should try it , much better than all those other expensive mouth washes (ive tried biotine and all that stuff)..</li>
            <li>Since the reason I bought these in the first place was so that I wouldn&#x27;t wake up repeatedly during the night with dry mouth, this product was of no use to me.</li>
            <li>, i guess this might be one of those things where depending on how dry your mouth gets in the first place it will work or wont till the morning.</li>
            <li>I bought them because Biotene has discontinued its gum which was always such a quick fix for my dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>Not long lasting enough to be worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also bought a box for a very good friend who also suffers from CPAP induced dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>Highly and definitely recommend Xylimelts!</li>
            <li>I do not buy the mint type because the regular seem to be fine tasting with already a little minty flavor.</li>
            <li>Small price to pay for sound sleep, dental health and comfort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had dry mouth ever since the doctor prescribed a certain medication.</li>
            <li>Really helps dry mouth &amp; throat from CPAP.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little weird at first putting them in your mouth between your jaw and gum line, and they don&#x27;t taste that good.  </li>
            <li>and I will highly recommend it to anyone who has a dry mouth issue.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering from dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with dry mouth problems.</li>
            <li>I used one last night and actually slept all night for the first time in a very long time..</li>
            <li>When I started to get it more frequently over the past few months</li>
            <li>So they have their place, I use them in social setting where I don&#x27;t want to use the tube.</li>
            <li>But when I tried it, the mints dissolved at such a rate that there was a constant trickle to the back of my throat, causing me to cough and constantly clear my throat during the night.  </li>
            <li>I would not discourage anyone from trying it because there is no risk, and it is not a major investment considering the potential payoff and it clearly works for some folks (from the reviews here).</li>
            <li>Medication that I take gives me a dry mouth, but this product really does work to alleviate dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>I used my first 30 day supply and am a few nights into the second order.</li>
            <li>The only issue I really have with them is that they are difficult to adhere to the sides of the gums (even when I get them to stick they manage to release themselves later, not a huge deal), they only last about 5 to 6 hours (which means I typically apply them in the middle of the night when the dry mouth starts to occur), and the taste they give off isn&#x27;t what I would call great.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really excellent first time to try and are the best I have used.</li>
            <li> My dentist tells me xylitol is actually good for your teeth; it helps prevent cavities.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look good to me either.</li>
            <li> Minty taste, good value for money.</li>
            <li> Just good results.</li>
            <li> Tried Xylimelts and found them exceptional.</li>
            <li> It continually emits a really pleasant mint taste into the mouth, and makes it fresh and very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad someone did not see me (LOL)</li>
            <li> I am very glad that Amazon carries the product.</li>
            <li> I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tabs have a mild minty taste and very pleasant</li>
            <li> but I have seen better results with this product!</li>
            <li> The Xylimelts have more than met my expectations!  </li>
            <li> However, it took care of my problem so well that I&#x27;ve ordered more!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I wish I had found them much sooner!!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are absolutely the best thing I&#x27;ve found for keeping my mouth from drying out at night when I sleep.</li>
            <li> saw these on Amazon and decided to buy a box for her to try, even though they&#x27;re kind of pricy.  </li>
            <li> If you use this, check with your own dentist first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The XyliMelts have to be placed in your mouth between the cheek and gum and &amp;#34;allowed to melt&amp;#34; on their own.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sweetie commented on how nice it was that they stayed in place on the side of her tongue when she used them.  </li>
            <li> came in handy after my surgery</li>
            <li> Good luck :)</li>
            <li> The disk is pleasant tasting and easy to use.</li>
            <li> using the two together have improved her condition greatly ...... and the fix was not very expensive!!</li>
            <li> Including my own mother : )  </li>
            <li> After reordering I took better look at package info .</li>
            <li> My daughter is a dental hygienist for many years in another state.</li>
            <li> I can speak to others with more confidence because my mouth feels better.</li>
            <li> It is important to press the tab securely at the gumline for a good 15 secs.</li>
            <li> The xylimelts are gone in the morning by the time I wake up, but my mouth is still noticeably more moist.</li>
            <li> More moistened?</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> and I have used it for months and will continue until something better comes along if ever.</li>
            <li> so she&#x27;d be sure not to run out,</li>
            <li> I did, but I do use xylimelts once in awhile when chewing gum would not be appropriate, like during a wedding.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the instructions and place the tab between top gum and inside of cheek.</li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I was also pleased that this product does not contain sugar but uses XYLITOL instead.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> The box suggests using just two, but I find three to be the magic number.  </li>
            <li> I have a prescription to stimulate my salivary glands into producing more saliva, and this works well during the daytime and evening when I am awake.  </li>
            <li> I love that it sticks somewhere in your mouth so that it&#x27;s not in the way.  </li>
            <li> It is okay...</li>
            <li> Taste OK also.</li>
            <li> use it mostly at night before I go to sleep for both</li>
            <li> I wake up with no aftertaste, and my mouth in better shape than before I had these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works best at night or during physical exertion.  </li>
            <li> He gets more sleep and feels much better.</li>
            <li> They work better than other&lt;br /&gt;products</li>
            <li> Oh, and the taste pretty good.</li>
            <li> There is a nice, mild mint flavor.  </li>
            <li> These are the best I have found for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> XYLIMELTS are the best product I have found for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> But, it is clean, easy, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about drool!</li>
            <li> With this product, my mouth feels a lot more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth, nice taste.</li>
            <li> I can easily talk with the tabs in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Easy to apple and taste is minty.</li>
            <li> (I do not care for strong mints).</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of sticking it on the roof of my mouth where it dissolved really quickly!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the ultimate, GREAT breath mint, also.</li>
            <li> Sometimes 2 are all I need to make it comfortable through the night.  </li>
            <li> XyliMelts keeps his mouth moist for hours and has a light, non-offensive taste.</li>
            <li> She uses them at night and says they last the night for her and greatly reduce the discomfort of the inside of her mouth drying out.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and so glad it&#x27;s a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It sticks well to the mucosa, so make sure it is in the right spot.  </li>
            <li> The melt lasts an hour, two if you are very calm (asleep or not talking/moving the mouth).</li>
            <li> This was originally a 5 star review, but today I was told by my dentist to stop using Xylimelts every night.</li>
            <li> Discovered these originally at a dental convention.  </li>
            <li> As I have dry mouth issues, these mints work great to keep my mouth moist and they are tasty, too.</li>
            <li> Great dry mouth relief.</li>
            <li> Works great for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Ok, so ive been having dry mouth problems for a while now and just didnt know what to do , tried to drink more and more water which helped a bit but would keep me going to the bathroom all night.</li>
            <li> The first night she slept clear through the night and woke up with her mouth feeling good.  </li>
            <li> I love Xylimelts so much, I had forgotten one day and nonchalantly, placed the tabs in while in a parking lot preparing to enter a meeting.  </li>
            <li> The only good news is that the gut problems ended within a day of quitting Xylimelts.</li>
            <li> You have to keep them in place for a minute or two to get full adhesion.</li>
            <li> It seems to need a full 20 seconds of holding the mint there for it to stick well.</li>
            <li> They work so well , the time release means you don&#x27;t have to use countless mint candies and they taste good.  </li>
            <li> She says these help a good deal and seem to last a while after using them.</li>
            <li> I get a full night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> the most effective  products I&#x27;ve ever used for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> If you want a more effective dry mouth product, try Dentiva lozenges!  </li>
            <li> I have the mild mint flavor, and I like the taste.  </li>
            <li> I just stick one or two to the inside of my cheek and get hours of adequate saliva production, and two in my mouth at night allow me to get an almost \\&quot;normal\\&quot; nights sleep.  </li>
            <li> Always delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> She couldn&#x27;t believe how well and quickly they worked.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use in middle of night and tastes great.</li>
            <li> I also use the XyliMelt mints when I want my breath to feel really fresh.</li>
            <li> I am undecided if I will try it again or not because I don&#x27;t feel that its different or better than using a sugar free candy, for example.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to give this product five-stars, but the short-lasting action of this product prevents me from doing so.  </li>
            <li> When I sleep with these, although they are gone when I wake, my mouth is relieved, moist and fresh.</li>
            <li> Wish it did work and interested in others&#x27; knowledge of superior products that do work toward dry mouth.</li>
            <li> The taste is pleasant, slightly minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> It tastes sour to me because my taste buds were scrambled by radiation, but most people should be able to tolerate it</li>
            <li> They work for my dry mouth&amp; help me to feel better!</li>
            <li> Apparently this was more than my digestive system could handle.  </li>
            <li> It does great at keeping my mouth moist over night, but I am not sure what it is doing to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Saw may reduce plaque and prevent tooth decay and its first ingredient was xylitol.</li>
            <li> In addition, be prepared to place these outstanding tabs inside your mouth in a private place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since 2004 I&#x27;ve had three neck surgeries, including removal of most of the salivary glands on my left side and two rounds of radiation on my mouth and neck.</li>
            <li> To me, this discomfort is better than peeling my tongue off the roof of my mouth in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> By the fourth morning she told me to order more</li>
            <li> I got this for him and at first it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I found it works best on the gums tissue above the upper molars (back teeth) rather than on the cheek, since this area is stable and doesn&#x27;t move with speaking or chewing.  </li>
            <li> A regular candy or gum does better for moisture.  </li>
            <li> but the taste is not so hot.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in years I&#x27;m sleeping almost through the night.</li>
            <li> Need to place two tablets in my mouth when I go to bed and two more in the middle of the night, and up rested.</li>
            <li> Nothing can fix dry mouth completely; but this is a good product..</li>
            <li> I find the taste pleasant and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product if you are willing to shell out the money for it!</li>
            <li> The XyliMelts are much more convenient and last much longer.  </li>
            <li> again, works very well, but does NOT last for more than 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> I just used these last night and woke up with quite fresh breath and my teeth were SMOOTH and clean-feeling.  </li>
            <li> XyliMelts are easy for me to place on the roof of my mouth,and they actually stay.</li>
            <li> MUCH BETTER THAN DEALING WITH A DRY MOUTH.THE</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a solution for dry mouth for many patients as well as myself.</li>
            <li> My husband has used many products for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY dry mouth remedies.  </li>
            <li> I am well pleased with Zylimelts for my dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> Lot better than dry mouth though...</li>
            <li> Biotene makes better products for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from night time dry mouth, which has had a detrimental effect on my otherwise healthy gums.</li>
            <li> These are about the size of a large aspirin.</li>
            <li> It was hard finding a good place to put them.  </li>
            <li> But I will go back to the oral gel I had been using, very good but not nearly as effective as this product.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> They really help me.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY DOESN&#x27;T MATTER.</li>
            <li> Each tablet has a smooth, rounded white side and a textured tan side; the tan side is designed to adhere to your gums or cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is better than expected.</li>
            <li> My wife is sure that as soon as he tries them, he&#x27;ll become a customer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Much prefer this brand to Quantum, that one leaves a gummy residue, that has to be picked of.</li>
            <li> this seller delivered ery fast, as promised.</li>
            <li> My experience with them was that I continued to get too much saliva, and without control at night, it came out of my mouth onto the pillow just like before.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The XyliMelts really work; in the morning I have no drymouth.</li>
            <li> really do like this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks  for  </li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;XyliMelts&amp;#34; melt so fast that they don&#x27;t really do anything.  </li>
            <li> My niece who also has sjogrens told me about this product and it really works.  </li>
            <li> I gave samples out to a few people and no one liked it.</li>
            <li> So much better then other product.</li>
            <li> This one adheres easily, works for dry mouth and keeping that saliva flowing at night.</li>
            <li> After that it&#x27;s fine, as long as you don&#x27;t fool with it with your tongue.</li>
            <li> And once you figure it out, they really do stick to the inside of your mouth still allowing you to talk normally.</li>
            <li> The xylimelts do work, but after the tablet has dissipated your mouth will become dry pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> Also, at first it feels very cool on the tooth over which it&#x27;s placed, but that also goes away in a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> I wish they included more tabs in the box or made it less</li>
            <li> I find that the Biotene oral balance gel is better, though the tablets are less obtrusive than having a tube in your pocket that you take a dab of gel from.</li>
            <li> I went to the company&#x27;s website and found that they make two flavors, mild mint (which is not labeled as such), and mint-free (which says mint-free on the front of the box).  </li>
            <li> , I found that it only provided mild improvement.</li>
            <li> This is a simple, inexpensive solution to a big problem for many people.</li>
            <li> Gross after taste and the glue doesn&#x27;t dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li> It works OK for night time dry mouth, and it is flatter than most hard candy.</li>
            <li> Internet ratings rated it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I also sleep with a CPAP, which may have exacerbated the original dry mouth, but using XyliMelts has overcome the problem.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything I come across, and so far nothing has really worked.  </li>
            <li> After having radiation to my tonsil area &amp; neck, the saliva glands on the left side of my mouth were pretty much fried.</li>
            <li> After a few more days, all was well.  </li>
            <li> My teeth on the right side are basically decay-free, but on the left I&#x27;m looking at probably four crowns and probably 2-3 root canals.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for dry mouth!!!  </li>
            <li> Not only does it taste better than other saliva stimulating dics</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to trash the product, so I left it at five stars, but the seller&#x27;s service was pretty abysmal.</li>
            <li> They came in and she tried a couple and WOW!</li>
            <li> But if I wake up dry it&#x27;s easy to reapply and go back to sleep.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mouth moisting benefits as well as the xyilotol which is very good at keeping bad bacteria from multiplying.</li>
            <li> This indeed does help with dry mouth without leaving any residue or aftertaste other than mint.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s interesting</li>
            <li> my tabs had not melted completely.</li>
            <li> product is made with xylitol, a naturally occurring sugar substitute (derived from plant fibers), which stimulates the production of saliva.  </li>
            <li> I turned out to be one of the multitude of people who is wildly allergic to Xylitol.  </li>
            <li> would order it on a regular basis, but to me - the price is too much .</li>
            <li> Bought samples directly from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> With a few more trys in different parts of the mouth it worked well.  </li>
            <li> The sticky substance that keeps it in place is kind of irritating on my teeth too.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, still a great product , i mean it is helping , just wish it was a little more.. but everyone should try it , much better than all those other expensive mouth washes (ive tried biotine and all that stuff)..</li>
            <li> Since the reason I bought these in the first place was so that I wouldn&#x27;t wake up repeatedly during the night with dry mouth, this product was of no use to me.</li>
            <li> , i guess this might be one of those things where depending on how dry your mouth gets in the first place it will work or wont till the morning.</li>
            <li> I bought them because Biotene has discontinued its gum which was always such a quick fix for my dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> Not long lasting enough to be worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also bought a box for a very good friend who also suffers from CPAP induced dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> Highly and definitely recommend Xylimelts!</li>
            <li> I do not buy the mint type because the regular seem to be fine tasting with already a little minty flavor.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay for sound sleep, dental health and comfort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry mouth ever since the doctor prescribed a certain medication.</li>
            <li> Really helps dry mouth &amp; throat from CPAP.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weird at first putting them in your mouth between your jaw and gum line, and they don&#x27;t taste that good.  </li>
            <li> and I will highly recommend it to anyone who has a dry mouth issue.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering from dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with dry mouth problems.</li>
            <li> I used one last night and actually slept all night for the first time in a very long time..</li>
            <li> When I started to get it more frequently over the past few months</li>
            <li> So they have their place, I use them in social setting where I don&#x27;t want to use the tube.</li>
            <li> But when I tried it, the mints dissolved at such a rate that there was a constant trickle to the back of my throat, causing me to cough and constantly clear my throat during the night.  </li>
            <li> I would not discourage anyone from trying it because there is no risk, and it is not a major investment considering the potential payoff and it clearly works for some folks (from the reviews here).</li>
            <li> Medication that I take gives me a dry mouth, but this product really does work to alleviate dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I used my first 30 day supply and am a few nights into the second order.</li>
            <li> The only issue I really have with them is that they are difficult to adhere to the sides of the gums (even when I get them to stick they manage to release themselves later, not a huge deal), they only last about 5 to 6 hours (which means I typically apply them in the middle of the night when the dry mouth starts to occur), and the taste they give off isn&#x27;t what I would call great.</li>
            <li> Waking every night with my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth because my mouth is as dry as the Sahara desert was a major inconvenience.</li>
            <li> The only potential issue is that they can be a little rough when you first put them in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Originally I was going to give this product five stars because it worked the way it claimed it would, sticking to my gums and dissolving very slowly thus alleviating mouth dryness.  </li>
            <li> I was waking up numerous times a night with dry mouth--the kind one gets with a severe cold.  </li>
            <li> I only use them at bedtime because such a pain to use during the day because they are sitting in  your mouth a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Biotene gel, spray, mouthwash &amp; toothpaste but the results did not last nearly as long as Xylimelts.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like, but there are 60 in a pack.</li>
            <li> I have found that the additives in other dry mouth stuff affects my sensitive stomach.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t to keen on the directions &amp;#34;place between gums and cheek&amp;#34; and still can feel them there hours later even after they desolve, but they do help my dry mouth.</li>
            <li> but they still left my mouth dry in the morning.</li>
            <li> when I wake up, my mouth isn&#x27;t so dry; I can sleep through the night, and sometimes I can get by using only one tablet.  </li>
            <li> I had oral cancer which left me with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that my mouth isn&#x27;t as dry when I wake up.</li>
            <li> If I wake up coughing from dry mouth sometime in the middle of the night, I take another 2.  </li>
            <li> I have severe dry mouth from meds I take and this product has been such a relief ..</li>
            <li> i can feel my mouth not being so dry anymore and has a subtle mint flavor to it which is nice, but i thought it might work for longer, i mean when i wake up my mouth isnt as dry</li>
            <li> My only criticism, and it is a minor one, is that they make a sticky residue on my lips, but I&#x27;d rather have the residue than a mouth so dry that it hurts to swallow.</li>
            <li> I do have second day shipping and rec&#x27;d them in two days, tried other products they only work for about five minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various remedies for dry mouth (Biotene, Oasis, etc.), but have never found anything that can prevent dry mouth overnight.  </li>
            <li> only thing that bothered me is that this product is a tad expensive, considering how fast it goes for frequent use.</li>
            <li> But we ordered and I had to excuse myself to use the restroom and REMOVE MY Xylimelt tabs hahaha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Based on the order status, it just took forever for the things to get shipped (once they were, it didn&#x27;t take long to get to me).</li>
            <li> She had bought several over-the-counter products that gave minimal relief.  </li>
            <li> DISOLVE SLOWLY WHICH I REALLY LIKE,HOWEVER</li>
            <li> I have a friend whose mouth always got dry during her long singing rehearsals when she could not drink anything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because the product is as good as all the other reviews say it is.</li>
            <li> After using XyiMelts, he will not go back to any other product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They really do stick to your teeth/gums (which is weird, but cool) and dissolve slowly.</li>
            <li> Last night I woke up with extreme dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> My wife came back from a very long dental appointment with extreme dry mouth syndrome.  </li>

            <li> I only use 1 tablet a night to cut down the cost.</li>
            <li> These are wonderous little tablets that stick to the inside of your mouth and last all night long as it dissolves.</li>
            <li> They do wonders for dry mouth!  </li>
            <li> Someone like me with a very dry mouth, would go through about a box a week.</li>
            <li> I use a VPAP machine which leaves my mouth very dry.</li>
            <li> It also left me with a mint taste in my mouth and sometimes little bits of the candy that didn&#x27;t dissolve overnight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough about these little things that have been a life-changer for me.</li>
            <li> Just wish they would last a little longer than 6 hrs.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that as they dissolve, they are rough and irritate the tissue a little.</li>
            <li> Dry mouth (due to Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome) was affecting my sleep.</li>
            <li> I wear a CPAP at night plus have a dry mouth due to rheumatoid arthritis even with pilocarpine and restasis.  </li>
            <li> Mouth gets real dry overnight.  </li>
            <li> YOU CAN PUT THEM IN YOUR POCKET,YOU DON&#x27;T WORRY IF THEY GET WET AND DISSOLVE.</li>
            <li> These melts have given me a few extra hours of sleep each night.</li>
            <li> It feels a bit rough there until it smooths out with some melting.</li>
            <li> I find it does help and may help anyone that tries it.</li>
            <li> Before I used this product I would wake up at night with such a dry mouth and throat that I could hardly swallow.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you put them in during the day that it is NOT right before a meal.</li>
            <li> You have to place one piece (round and like hard candy) into both sides of the back of your mouth and make them stick to your gums or back teeth.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes there is even a small amount still left in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the toothpastes, gum, mouthwashes, sprays, and other melts and lozenges, but NOTHING did the trick - as soon as the lozenges melted, that was the end of relief.</li>
            <li> No better than regular mints.</li>
            <li> Doctors seemed clueless re a remedy, and I was often dragging around due to lack of sleep.  </li>
            <li> Now I only wake up once a night which is usual.  </li>
            <li> This was an extremely frustrating state to live with.</li>
            <li> If you have sleeping dry mouth, be warned the product only lasts a few hours &amp; you&#x27;ll stick wake up with dry mouth, just not as in tense.</li>
            <li> As they begin to dissolve, the edges become less rough.  </li>
            <li> This one has a particularly unpleasant taste, along with not doing much to relieve the problem of dry mouth, and there are endless other problems that seem to go along with dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> ENTs and oncologists all push these &amp;#34;saliva enhancing&amp;#34; products - in short they don&#x27;t work, or at least didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that they are that harsh to your gum tissue as the rough edge begins to dissolve within 15 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;ve put on and adjusted my CPAP (I use the nose pillow type) and lay down to sleep, I&#x27;ve already forgotten I have a XyliMelt in place.  </li>
            <li> No more waking at night with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I took the package along to my appointment and she was not familiar with the product.</li>
            <li> (Do wish it lasted a little longer).</li>
            <li> Had tried other mouth wash solutions in the past.</li>
            <li> Seems to work, a little on the pricy side, I may order again.</li>
            <li> These little mints have two sides.</li>
            <li> They melt very slowly and last for hours.</li>
            <li> Sugar free mints left him with dental decay and all of the samples from the dentist tasted terrible.  </li>
            <li> I woke up a few times with them floating in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come across two that seem to sooth for  few minutes, but nothing that performs as it claims.</li>
            <li> I use these overnight and wake up NOT with a dried out mouth or inside of cheeks.</li>
            <li> Also use when walking so don&#x27;t have to carry heavy water bottle.</li>
            <li> This product helps so much, especially in public situations where it becomes unable to talk due to no saliva.</li>
            <li> I mean excessive dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> If you really need one and you don&#x27;t have them with you - you are VERY sad.</li>
            <li> I have had a difficult time sleeping due to severe dry mouth..</li>
            <li> This is not very effective for me.</li>
            <li> Initially it felt weird to have the XyliMelt lump on my gums, but I got used to it in just a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> Warning, you may drool a little!</li>
            <li> I usually buy them at Rite Aid, which has them on sale often.</li>
            <li> so well I&#x27;ll just get past the money thing.</li>
            <li> These provide a small coating in my mouth which prevents the dryness.  </li>
            <li> I was anxious to try XyliMelts.  </li>
            <li> The only difference between XyliMints and my prescription was that the Xylamints were difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> No more sleepless nights, I wake up with my mouth feeling moist and no halitosis.  </li>
            <li> I always wake up with a gross, dry mouth and bad morning breath.  </li>
            <li> As well, the dry mouth is so bad that I often have difficulty simply *speaking,* and end up sounding like a drunk as I try to be articulate and stumble through teeth-sticking, tongue gymnastics.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for over six months and have not experienced any of the tissue irritation that some other reviewers have complained about.</li>

            <li> I notice that some people who have reviewed this product have complained about the taste.  </li>
            <li> I was desperate enough to try these</li>
            <li> and it slowly melts during the night and</li>
            <li> These will stay put on the roof of your mouth while you go to sleep and melt slowly.</li>
            <li> Lozenger adheres to inside of cheek and disolves slowly.  </li>
            <li> Having dry mouth is really bad for tooth decay and xylitol helps slow down the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t to keen on the directions &amp;#34;place between gums and cheek&amp;#34; and still can feel them there hours later even after they desolve, but they do help my dry mouth.</li>
            <li> A symptom of Bells Palsy is dry mouth, I started getting cavities, 7 of then and I lost a tooth too. Then my hygenists suggested something with xylitol. I have beeb using these at night before I go to sleep so I am no longer waking up gagging because I have NO saliva. These mints saved my life. I get so tweaky when I haven&#x27;t slept.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for something like this to relieve the dry mouth I have suffered since 2007. I had oral cancer and had my neck area radiated-it caused the salivery glands to quit working &amp; I&#x27;ll never get the use of them back. I drink gallons of water-and occasionally chew gum or use mints (SalivaSure) for short term relief. This product allows me close to an hour of relief! That&#x27;s heaven on earth to me.</li>
            <li> I have been using another product for dry mouth at night for nany months. After reordering I took better look at package info . Saw may reduce plaque and prevent tooth decay and its first ingredient was xylitol. My daughter is a dental hygienist for many years in another state. I called to ask if this is as great as I thought. And she said yes.  XyliMelts is perfect for me. So much better then other product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dental hygienist and sampled this product myself.  Not only does it taste better than other saliva stimulating dics but I have seen better results with this product! Including my own mother : )  This was the only thing that resolved the cracks/dryness at the corners of the mouth after sleeping!</li>
            <li> This product works very well. XyliMelts are easy for me to place on the roof of my mouth,and they actually stay. They really help me. I&#x27;ve suffered from dry mouth for over 20 years and XyliMelts and the XyliMelt mints are the most effective  products I&#x27;ve ever used for dry mouth. With this product, my mouth feels a lot more comfortable. I don&#x27;t have the cotton mouth feeling when I wake up in the morning. I can speak to others with more confidence because my mouth feels better. I also use the XyliMelt mints when I want my breath to feel really fresh.</li>
            <li> With no saliva, there was no melting.</li>
            <li> If you really need one and you don&#x27;t have them with you - you are VERY sad. They do the job as intended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry mouth ever since the doctor prescribed a certain medication. Xylimelts has saved my craving for constant moisture. Before this wonderful product, I couldn&#x27;t go anywhere without a bottle of water in my hand. I can easily talk with the tabs in my mouth. I do not buy the mint type because the regular seem to be fine tasting with already a little minty flavor. I would recommend buying the regular. It is important to press the tab securely at the gumline for a good 15 secs. If I am in a hurry and don&#x27;t do that, they WILL fall out. Be careful if you put them in during the day that it is NOT right before a meal. I once had an experience where I went to a business lunch and my tabs had not melted completely. It makes me chuckle now when I think about it! But we ordered and I had to excuse myself to use the restroom and REMOVE MY Xylimelt tabs hahaha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  In addition, be prepared to place these outstanding tabs inside your mouth in a private place. I love Xylimelts so much, I had forgotten one day and nonchalantly, placed the tabs in while in a parking lot preparing to enter a meeting.  I&#x27;m glad someone did not see me (LOL) for it may have looked like I was picking my teeth! So you can see I use the product, probably just twice a day. Some days I don&#x27;t need it at all. But when I need it, it&#x27;s there and I will highly recommend it to anyone who has a dry mouth issue.</li>
            <li> THE XYLIMELTS SICK TO THE CHEEK OF YOUR MOUTH GREAT. THEY DISOLVE SLOWLY WHICH I REALLY LIKE,HOWEVER THE TASTE COULD BE IMPROVED A BIT.BUT MUCH BETTER THAN DEALING WITH A DRY MOUTH.THE WERE DELIVERED WITHIN THE TIME QUOTED ME. THE XYLIMELTS WERE PACKAGED PROFESSIONALL.I WOULD DEFINATELY GO THROUGH THIS SELLER AGAIN. I LIKE THE WAY THE XYLIMELTS ARE PACKAGED YOU JUST POP THEM OUT OF THE BARRIER. YOU CAN PUT THEM IN YOUR POCKET,YOU DON&#x27;T WORRY IF THEY GET WET AND DISSOLVE. WITH THE GREAT PACKAGING THE XYLIMELTS ARE PROTECTED. I CAN DROP THEM IN MY PURSE OR PUT THEM IN MY POCKET. IT REALLY DOESN&#x27;T MATTER. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.THANKS, APRICOT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various remedies for dry mouth (Biotene, Oasis, etc.), but have never found anything that can prevent dry mouth overnight.  I tried this product last night, and it worked!  You just put one tablet on each side of your mouth between your gums and your cheeks, and they&#x27;ll stay in place and dissolve very slowly.  I was afraid they might slip around and I might swallow one while sleeping, but that doesn&#x27;t happen.  Each tablet has a smooth, rounded white side and a textured tan side; the tan side is designed to adhere to your gums or cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made with xylitol, a naturally occurring sugar substitute (derived from plant fibers), which stimulates the production of saliva.  My dentist tells me xylitol is actually good for your teeth; it helps prevent cavities.  The taste is pleasant, slightly minty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I notice that some people who have reviewed this product have complained about the taste.  I went to the company&#x27;s website and found that they make two flavors, mild mint (which is not labeled as such), and mint-free (which says mint-free on the front of the box).  I have the mild mint flavor, and I like the taste.  If you don&#x27;t like mint, know that you have another option.</li>
            <li> I have a severe dry mouyh problem exacerbated by the use of a C-PAP machine. I had been using Ora-Moist tabs but they still left my mouth dry in the morning. Tried Xylimelts and found them exceptional. Two in the mouh at night and my mouth is still moist in the AM.</li>
            <li> As I have dry mouth issues, these mints work great to keep my mouth moist and they are tasty, too.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for dry mouth!!!  Medication that I take gives me a dry mouth, but this product really does work to alleviate dry mouth.  This was recommended by my ENT.</li>
            <li> Great. This is better than expected. I would order again as needed&lt;br /&gt;No problems here at all and I am happy.</li>
            <li> I actually like the minty taste, but I&#x27;ve seen several reviewers saying they didn&#x27;t. How does the saying go? \\&quot;There&#x27;s no accounting for taste\\&quot; ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since 2004 I&#x27;ve had three neck surgeries, including removal of most of the salivary glands on my left side and two rounds of radiation on my mouth and neck. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve had problems with dryness in my mouth. My teeth on the right side are basically decay-free, but on the left I&#x27;m looking at probably four crowns and probably 2-3 root canals. Don&#x27;t skip your regular dental appts, kids...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve started a regimen of Biotene mouthwash and these xylimelts tabs, esp. before bed. The xylimelts are gone in the morning by the time I wake up, but my mouth is still noticeably more moist. More moistened? However you say it, they appear to be helping, but time will tell whether or not it helps with the decay issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that was the product. Now about the seller... \\&quot;Red Tag\\&quot; took FOREVER. I ordered them on Jan 11 and they arrived Jan 24. Two weeks??? Based on the order status, it just took forever for the things to get shipped (once they were, it didn&#x27;t take long to get to me). I&#x27;m definitely spoiled by Amazon Prime, which in this case didn&#x27;t do diddly-poo for me. I didn&#x27;t want to trash the product, so I left it at five stars, but the seller&#x27;s service was pretty abysmal.</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist. I have been looking for a solution for dry mouth for many patients as well as myself. Overnight usually seems to be the worst time when dry mouth occurs. I ordered these as a trial. I have given them to patients and used them myself. And, yes, they work to alleviate the problem.  The only issue I have is that as they dissolve, they are rough and irritate the tissue a little. It is tolerable, but slightly uncomfortable. To me, this discomfort is better than peeling my tongue off the roof of my mouth in the middle of the night. So, yes...I recommend them. Oh, and the taste pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s, and in spite of taking a prescription (for dry mouth), drinking a ton of water, using a humidifier and using the Biotene gel at bedtime, I was still waking up with my tongue stuck to my teeth every night. I came across a discussion about these on a forum and thought I&#x27;d give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They really do stick to your teeth/gums (which is weird, but cool) and dissolve slowly. I used one last night and actually slept all night for the first time in a very long time..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry mouth however, I don&#x27;t know why and don&#x27;t have any of the known risk factors. I tried this product hoping it would help however, I found that it only provided mild improvement. I am undecided if I will try it again or not because I don&#x27;t feel that its different or better than using a sugar free candy, for example. I would not discourage anyone from trying it because there is no risk, and it is not a major investment considering the potential payoff and it clearly works for some folks (from the reviews here).</li>
            <li> After having radiation to my tonsil area &amp; neck, the saliva glands on the left side of my mouth were pretty much fried. I&#x27;ve tried Biotene gel, spray, mouthwash &amp; toothpaste but the results did not last nearly as long as Xylimelts. These melts have given me a few extra hours of sleep each night. I stick one melt in each cheek. I have been using them for over six months and have not experienced any of the tissue irritation that some other reviewers have complained about. They are pricey, but what price would you pay for some extra sleep? I usually buy them at Rite Aid, which has them on sale often. (Sorry Amazon!)</li>
            <li> A symptom of Scleroderma is dry mouth - I mean excessive dry mouth.  Biotene gel provides relief, but I have to use it almost constantly.  The XyliMelts are much more convenient and last much longer.  I just stick one or two to the inside of my cheek and get hours of adequate saliva production, and two in my mouth at night allow me to get an almost \\&quot;normal\\&quot; nights sleep.  My only criticism, and it is a minor one, is that they make a sticky residue on my lips, but I&#x27;d rather have the residue than a mouth so dry that it hurts to swallow.</li>
            <li> Too many of these in a short space of time will wear a hole in your tongue but not as badly as others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are absolutely the best thing I&#x27;ve found for keeping my mouth from drying out at night when I sleep. They stay put when I put them in my cheeks like the directions suggested so I don&#x27;t have to worry about choking on them in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> Originally I was going to give this product five stars because it worked the way it claimed it would, sticking to my gums and dissolving very slowly thus alleviating mouth dryness.  However it turned out to give me a horrible stomach upset--cramps, runs, and--dare I mention it--terrible gas. I needed two or three Xylimelts over the course of a night to keep my mouth moist.  Apparently this was more than my digestive system could handle.  I turned out to be one of the multitude of people who is wildly allergic to Xylitol.  The only good news is that the gut problems ended within a day of quitting Xylimelts.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it had a mint flavor, which I preferred to the citrus flavor of OraMoist.  But when I tried it, the mints dissolved at such a rate that there was a constant trickle to the back of my throat, causing me to cough and constantly clear my throat during the night.  I tried it several times, in different locations in my mouth, with the same result. Since the reason I bought these in the first place was so that I wouldn&#x27;t wake up repeatedly during the night with dry mouth, this product was of no use to me. Although more expensive, OraMoist does the job. It tastes sour to me because my taste buds were scrambled by radiation, but most people should be able to tolerate it okay.</li>
            <li> it works for me and I have used it for months and will continue until something better comes along if ever.</li>
            <li> My wife suffers from a pretty bad case of dry mouth.  She has to use a CPAP and that agravates the situation.  She&#x27;s been chewing gum continuously during her waking hours for three or four years now.  She would wake up in the night with discomfort from dry mouth.  Since she&#x27;s had chemo and radiation treatments it&#x27;s even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw these on Amazon and decided to buy a box for her to try, even though they&#x27;re kind of pricy.  The first night she slept clear through the night and woke up with her mouth feeling good.  By the fourth morning she told me to order more so she&#x27;d be sure not to run out, which I&#x27;ve just done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also bought a box for a very good friend who also suffers from CPAP induced dry mouth.  My wife is sure that as soon as he tries them, he&#x27;ll become a customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The darn things are pricy but they work so well I&#x27;ll just get past the money thing.</li>
            <li> This product worked well to alleviate my drymouth and ensure sounder sleep. And all I need is one instead of two. Drawback: it&#x27;s locally unavailable. I prefer a brick-and-mortar store to the Internet.</li>
            <li> Waking every night with my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth because my mouth is as dry as the Sahara desert was a major inconvenience. Dry mouth (due to Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome) was affecting my sleep. When I don&#x27;t get good sleep, I&#x27;m irritable, my symptoms exacerbate and everything goes downhill!  After reading the reviews for this product, I decided to try them and to my delight, they do work!  I put one on each side of the inside of my mouth before I fall asleep and it slowly melts during the night and when I wake up, my mouth isn&#x27;t so dry; I can sleep through the night, and sometimes I can get by using only one tablet.  I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering from dry mouth.</li>
            <li> My brother-in-law from San Antonio brought me some samples last year and they do what they say they will do. I&#x27;ve tried to buy them from pharmacies but none carry the product. I am very glad that Amazon carries the product. I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I use a ton of these. They work great!</li>
            <li> Greatly relieves a troublesome syndrome with minimum effort and time. Will reorder as needed in future. works as it is advertised</li>
            <li> UPDATE posted 8/14/12: This was originally a 5 star review, but today I was told by my dentist to stop using Xylimelts every night. I used my first 30 day supply and am a few nights into the second order. I took the package along to my appointment and she was not familiar with the product. She showed me the changes in my cheek and gum tissue and sides of tongue in the area where the discs stick. She said she has never seen this in my prior exams and didn&#x27;t like the looks of it. It didn&#x27;t look good to me either. My last dental exam and cleaning was in June before I started using Xylimelts. I have go back to get checked on 9/5. I&#x27;m so disappointed because the product is as good as all the other reviews say it is. But I will go back to the oral gel I had been using, very good but not nearly as effective as this product. If you use this, check with your own dentist first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE after 9/5 Dentist visit: The condition cleared up when I stopped using Xylimelts, so my dentist told me to go back to [[ASIN:B003XIXH38 Biotene Oral Balance Gel, 1.5-Ounce (Pack of 2)]]. I did, but I do use xylimelts once in awhile when chewing gum would not be appropriate, like during a wedding.</li>
            <li> what happened to biotene gums? nothing works like them. hope they return. nothing works like them. hope they return. thanks</li>
            <li> My husband has used many products for dry mouth.  After using XyiMelts, he will not go back to any other product.  He has already recommended it to my sister  and given her samples... and to anyone else who admits they have a problem with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> It does great at keeping my mouth moist over night, but I am not sure what it is doing to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Minty taste, good value for money. They don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like, but there are 60 in a pack. Make sure you follow the instructions and place the tab between top gum and inside of cheek. I made the mistake of sticking it on the roof of my mouth where it dissolved really quickly!</li>
            <li> ENTs and oncologists all push these &amp;#34;saliva enhancing&amp;#34; products - in short they don&#x27;t work, or at least didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I wake in the night with my mouth glued shut and grabbing my water. These disk help to moisturize my mouth and bring me relief. I&#x27;m on my third re-order of this product which by the way, was recommended by my Dentist.</li>
            <li> Much prefer this brand to Quantum, that one leaves a gummy residue, that has to be picked of. This one adheres easily, works for dry mouth and keeping that saliva flowing at night. (Do wish it lasted a little longer). But if I wake up dry it&#x27;s easy to reapply and go back to sleep. No gummy residue.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help combat my chronic dry mouth. I was extremely pleased with the results. The melts would stick to the inside of your mouth so that you can have it in your mouth even while you sleep. I tend to get cotton mouth during sleep, and these tabs were helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tabs have a mild minty taste and very pleasant (I do not care for strong mints). I was also pleased that this product does not contain sugar but uses XYLITOL instead. Having dry mouth is really bad for tooth decay and xylitol helps slow down the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that bothered me is that this product is a tad expensive, considering how fast it goes for frequent use. Someone like me with a very dry mouth, would go through about a box a week. I wish they included more tabs in the box or made it less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you are willing to shell out the money for it!</li>
            <li> I wear a CPAP at night plus have a dry mouth due to rheumatoid arthritis even with pilocarpine and restasis.  These provide a small coating in my mouth which prevents the dryness.  There is a nice, mild mint flavor.  I like how these stick to my gums and not float around in my mouth.  Sometimes there is even a small amount still left in the morning.</li>
            <li> The XyliMelts do work but are so inconvenient to use.  I bought them because Biotene has discontinued its gum which was always such a quick fix for my dry mouth.  The XyliMelts have to be placed in your mouth between the cheek and gum and &amp;#34;allowed to melt&amp;#34; on their own.  I only use them at bedtime because such a pain to use during the day because they are sitting in  your mouth a long time.  Too bad.  Am looking for another gum for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> They work for my dry mouth&amp; help me to feel better! They help me to distinguish, between hunger, thirst &amp; mouth dryness!</li>
            <li> I had oral cancer which left me with dry mouth. This stuff tastes like the neighbor dog relieved himself in my mouth.  Need I say more?</li>
            <li> It works OK for night time dry mouth, and it is flatter than most hard candy. But there are others out there that are smaller for the same result.</li>
            <li> They do wonders for dry mouth!  The box suggests using just two, but I find three to be the magic number.  If you have sleeping dry mouth, be warned the product only lasts a few hours &amp; you&#x27;ll stick wake up with dry mouth, just not as in tense. I&#x27;d love to give this product five-stars, but the short-lasting action of this product prevents me from doing so.  Give it a try...it&#x27;s expensive, but it worked for my dry mouth problems...</li>
            <li> this is the best price I have found for this excellent product. I use a VPAP machine which leaves my mouth very dry. Xylimelts work the best of all the products I have tried to keep my mouth moist all night. this seller delivered ery fast, as promised. I will definately order from them again.</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist of 29 years and my husband suffers from dry mouth. I got this for him and at first it didn&#x27;t work. With a few more trys in different parts of the mouth it worked well.  It sticks well to the mucosa, so make sure it is in the right spot.  I found it works best on the gums tissue above the upper molars (back teeth) rather than on the cheek, since this area is stable and doesn&#x27;t move with speaking or chewing.  It dissolves and is especially helpful when speaking or sleeping.  Very good product!</li>
            <li> Got this for my mother when she started suffering from dry mouth.  Tried several different items for this, and she said that they all seemed to provide some relief.</li>
            <li> I take lots of prescription medication which causes my mouth to be extremely dry all the time.  I have a prescription to stimulate my salivary glands into producing more saliva, and this works well during the daytime and evening when I am awake.  However, when I use them at bedtime, I don&#x27;t have control and they make me drool profusely.  So, I had to find something for those sleeping hours so that I didn&#x27;t have to change pillow cases daily.  I was anxious to try XyliMelts.  My experience with them was that I continued to get too much saliva, and without control at night, it came out of my mouth onto the pillow just like before.  The only difference between XyliMints and my prescription was that the Xylamints were difficult to use.  You have to place one piece (round and like hard candy) into both sides of the back of your mouth and make them stick to your gums or back teeth.  It was hard for me to get them to stay where I put them.  It was hard finding a good place to put them.  And then, it did no good.  It also left me with a mint taste in my mouth and sometimes little bits of the candy that didn&#x27;t dissolve overnight.  I finally decided that I would go back to my routine of waking up in the nighttime and drinking water--enough to keep my mouth lubricated for a few hours of sleep.  I then wake up and do it all over again.  But, it is clean, easy, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about drool!</li>
            <li> This product works great for our patients who have Xerostomia.  One of our patients uses them when she goes for her morning walks, and says that they work great and she doesn&#x27;t need to carry a bottle of water with her.  They also help at night with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product when going to sleep and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that my mouth isn&#x27;t as dry when I wake up. I haven&#x27;t tried using it during the day. My dentist was happy to see me using it and has recommended using products containing Xylitol, as this one does.</li>
            <li> Tasted just like breath mints, didn&#x27;t feel any effect on dry mouth. Wish it did work and interested in others&#x27; knowledge of superior products that do work toward dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Really excellent first time to try and are the best I have used. Had tried other mouth wash solutions in the past.</li>
            <li> These will stay put on the roof of your mouth while you go to sleep and melt slowly. Seems to work, a little on the pricy side, I may order again.</li>
            <li> Only work while they&#x27;re in your mouth.  Not long lasting enough to be worth the price.</li>
            <li> Best thing I have found on the market. Hint: I only use 1 tablet a night to cut down the cost.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I am a mouth breather at night and It does a great job for me at night to keep my mouth moist.</li>
            <li> The Xylimelts have more than met my expectations!  I never wake with my mouth so dry that I cannot swallow.  I only use one at night and it takes care of the dryness.  I wish I had found them much sooner!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was desperate enough to try these and they just don&#x27;t work well enough and they don&#x27;t stay stuck to your tooth or gum like they are supposed to. I woke up a few times with them floating in my mouth. I guess they could possibly be a choking hazard.</li>
            <li> I so wanted this to work.  I love that it sticks somewhere in your mouth so that it&#x27;s not in the way.  It has no taste only a chalky texture, but I wouldn&#x27;t even mind that if it only worked.  But nothing.  A regular candy or gum does better for moisture.  And at this price? just forget it.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth (from Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome).  I always start with 2 XyliMelts every night.  They last hours!  Sometimes that&#x27;s all it takes.  If I wake up coughing from dry mouth sometime in the middle of the night, I take another 2.  I like how they adhere to my teeth and/or gums and stay there!  You have to keep them in place for a minute or two to get full adhesion.</li>
            <li> It is okay...I have to take about four at a day ...but the taste is not so hot.  Don&#x27;t know if I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry mouth from having my salivary gland severed. I bought this I have found that the additives in other dry mouth stuff affects my sensitive stomach. These not only work but they don&#x27;t affect my stomach. And once you figure it out, they really do stick to the inside of your mouth still allowing you to talk normally.</li>
            <li> Discovered these originally at a dental convention.  Really helps dry mouth &amp; throat from CPAP.  Should help with dental issues.  Lozenger adheres to inside of cheek and disolves slowly.  It has not dislodges in a year of nightly use.</li>
            <li> This is not very effective for me.</li>
            <li> I have terrible dry mouth from COPD, my punishment for 50 years of smoking.  I have tried everything I come across, and so far nothing has really worked.  This one has a particularly unpleasant taste, along with not doing much to relieve the problem of dry mouth, and there are endless other problems that seem to go along with dry mouth.  I&#x27;ve come across two that seem to sooth for  few minutes, but nothing that performs as it claims.</li>
            <li> These are the best I have found for dry mouth. Easy to apple and taste is minty.</li>
            <li> Great product. Always delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought there was NO solution. I have had an exceedingly bad problem with dry mouth for years, after having come out of cancer treatment twice and having been given a regimen of drugs that would make a desert of a lake. As well, the dry mouth is so bad that I often have difficulty simply *speaking,* and end up sounding like a drunk as I try to be articulate and stumble through teeth-sticking, tongue gymnastics. I have tried all the toothpastes, gum, mouthwashes, sprays, and other melts and lozenges, but NOTHING did the trick - as soon as the lozenges melted, that was the end of relief. This was an extremely frustrating state to live with. A 50 year old never having had a cavity, I was BUMMED when I got three of them as a result of this cruel dry-mouth punishment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xylimelts are the answer to my prayers. They do everything that the information states. I would say that you have to get used to sticking it to the teeth/gums; I put it on the upper back gum/molar. It seems to need a full 20 seconds of holding the mint there for it to stick well. It feels a bit rough there until it smooths out with some melting. After that it&#x27;s fine, as long as you don&#x27;t fool with it with your tongue. The melt lasts an hour, two if you are very calm (asleep or not talking/moving the mouth). It continually emits a really pleasant mint taste into the mouth, and makes it fresh and very pleasant. When I sleep with these, although they are gone when I wake, my mouth is relieved, moist and fresh. It stimulates a wetter, nicer mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ultimate, GREAT breath mint, also. Had I known about these when I was dating, I would have been thrilled...to know that for hours, my mouth would have been mint-fresh...ahhh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough about these little things that have been a life-changer for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY dry mouth remedies.  I found that Xylimelts work the best for me.  The disk is pleasant tasting and easy to use. However, they last about 3 hours, which fits with my bathroom schedule, so it is not an issue for me.</li>
            <li> This is a simple, inexpensive solution to a big problem for many people. These little mints have two sides. One side gently, but firmly sticks to the side of your mouth so it won&#x27;t fall out while you sleep. They melt very slowly and last for hours. They taste a little minty with a touch of something unpleasant, but just a wee touch, not bothersome. For the first time in years I&#x27;m sleeping almost through the night. I used to wake up with my mouth so parched it hurt. Warning, you may drool a little! Small price to pay for sound sleep, dental health and comfort.</li>
            <li> Great dry mouth relief. I use these overnight and wake up NOT with a dried out mouth or inside of cheeks. Highly and definitely recommend Xylimelts!</li>
            <li> I got these to help the dry mouth I get from wearing Invisalign braces. I find that the Biotene oral balance gel is better, though the tablets are less obtrusive than having a tube in your pocket that you take a dab of gel from. So they have their place, I use them in social setting where I don&#x27;t want to use the tube.</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with Zylimelts for my dry mouth.  Sometimes 2 are all I need to make it comfortable through the night.  Sometimes it takes 4.  That does get expensive.</li>
            <li> I use these almost every night, and they do just what they say they will do.  It&#x27;s a little weird at first putting them in your mouth between your jaw and gum line, and they don&#x27;t taste that good.  but they work.</li>
            <li> These are wonderous little tablets that stick to the inside of your mouth and last all night long as it dissolves. Not a trace of dry mouth.  Taste OK also.</li>
            <li> Works well with my CPAP machine. Just wish they would last a little longer than 6 hrs. thank you XyliMelts</li>
            <li> This indeed does help with dry mouth without leaving any residue or aftertaste other than mint.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s interesting how the tablet is made - it has a concave surface on one side that actually will adhere to , say, the roof of your mouth by suction if by chance you fall asleep with it in, it won&#x27;t go anywhere - and i do fall asleep with it in my mouth quite often.&lt;br /&gt;I use it mostly at night before I go to sleep for both it&#x27;s mouth moisting benefits as well as the xyilotol which is very good at keeping bad bacteria from multiplying. I wake up with no aftertaste, and my mouth in better shape than before I had these.&lt;br /&gt; I only wish there were a larger version to use whenever I&#x27;m out and about and don&#x27;t have time to keep putting the tablets in my mouth. These are about the size of a large aspirin. One the size of a lifesaver would be perfect!</li>
            <li> My wife came back from a very long dental appointment with extreme dry mouth syndrome.  She suffered quietly for 2 days, then let me know what was going on.  She had bought several over-the-counter products that gave minimal relief.  After researching dry mouth syndrome and how to treat it, the XyliMelts kept coming up over and over, so we ordered some.  They came in and she tried a couple and WOW! What a difference!  Within an hour or so, she was feeling quite a bit of relief.  After a few more days, all was well.  We used this in conjunction with another product that came up when this was ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweetie commented on how nice it was that they stayed in place on the side of her tongue when she used them.  She couldn&#x27;t believe how well and quickly they worked.</li>
            <li> I hate getting dry mouth at night. Horrible feeling. When I started to get it more frequently over the past few months I felt I needed to find a solution. I tried the mouth guard thing. I&#x27;ve tried Biotene products. None of it worked. Xylimelts did though! The only issue I really have with them is that they are difficult to adhere to the sides of the gums (even when I get them to stick they manage to release themselves later, not a huge deal), they only last about 5 to 6 hours (which means I typically apply them in the middle of the night when the dry mouth starts to occur), and the taste they give off isn&#x27;t what I would call great. Lot better than dry mouth though...</li>
            <li> I have had a difficult time sleeping due to severe dry mouth.. these have changed my nights!  No more sleepless nights, I wake up with my mouth feeling moist and no halitosis.  These are a life saver for those who suffer from dry mouth issues. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The xylimelts do work, but after the tablet has dissipated your mouth will become dry pretty quickly.  The sticky substance that keeps it in place is kind of irritating on my teeth too.  Works best at night or during physical exertion.  I notice that when I take to the tables with my ping pong racket the xylimelts keep my mouth moist and my game at a higher level.</li>
            <li> Keeps my husbands mouth moist all night. He gets more sleep and feels much better. You should try it! Its great.</li>
            <li> What a find, heard about them from a friend, our medications cause extreme dry mouth, (very unpleasant).  They work so well , the time release means you don&#x27;t have to use countless mint candies and they taste good.  They offer this with no flavor, between the two I prefer the minty one.  It&#x27;s a five star product with a four star rating because it&#x27;s a bit pricey for me.</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Internet ratings rated it highly. Keeps mouth moist at night with cpap.  Very convenient to use in middle of night and tastes great.</li>
            <li> My father suffers dry mouth as a result of medications that he must take.  Sugar free mints left him with dental decay and all of the samples from the dentist tasted terrible.  XyliMelts keeps his mouth moist for hours and has a light, non-offensive taste.</li>
            <li> No better than regular mints. They do not stick to your cheeks as they are supposed to do. I don&#x27;t recommend them. Biotene makes better products for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> bessssssssssssst product I&#x27;ve ever used !!! I have severe dry mouth from meds I take and this product has been such a relief ..</li>
            <li> As a head and neck cancer survivor I suffer from dry mouth at night. No amount of water would help. These tablets gave me the help I needed to sleep through the night. They added the needed moisture to my mouth at night so that I could sleep peacefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Denise</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Keeps mouth moist so can finally sleep at night.  Also use when walking so don&#x27;t have to carry heavy water bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this nightly It helps my dry mouth a lot. Use also in the day when needed.  Nothing can fix dry mouth completely; but this is a good product..</li>
            <li> would order it on a regular basis, but to me - the price is too much . Thats why I give just four stars.&lt;br /&gt;But again, works very well, but does NOT last for more than 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> came in handy after my surgery</li>
            <li> I have night time dry mouth. My dentist recommended these. Very effective. Only issue is that one tablet lasts about 4 hours so you may have to reapply during the night to cover 8 hours of sleep. However, it took care of my problem so well that I&#x27;ve ordered more! Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought  my wife XyliMelts to try for her &#x27;dry mouth&#x27; condition. She uses them at night and says they last the night for her and greatly reduce the discomfort of the inside of her mouth drying out. She&#x27;s also using adhesive breathing strips on the bridge of her nose to help her breathe thru her nose and not her mouth ...... using the two together have improved her condition greatly ...... and the fix was not very expensive!!</li>
            <li> Ok, so ive been having dry mouth problems for a while now and just didnt know what to do , tried to drink more and more water which helped a bit but would keep me going to the bathroom all night. Anyways, did some research and came across these and based on the reviews decided to try it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it does work well , i mean the minute i put one in my mouth i can feel my mouth not being so dry anymore and has a subtle mint flavor to it which is nice, but i thought it might work for longer, i mean when i wake up my mouth isnt as dry but it still is a bit, i guess this might be one of those things where depending on how dry your mouth gets in the first place it will work or wont till the morning. Anyways, still a great product , i mean it is helping , just wish it was a little more.. but everyone should try it , much better than all those other expensive mouth washes (ive tried biotine and all that stuff).. Good luck :)</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth caused by my Cpap machine.  Bought samples directly from the manufacturer.  They work better than other&lt;br /&gt;products I have tried but still do not last the night.  Last night I woke up with extreme dry mouth.  There was still part of the XyliMelt tablet stuck to my gum.  I am still searching for the perfect mouth moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product actually made my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth. The flavor was unpleasant. I gave samples out to a few people and no one liked it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found this product. I was suffering from night time dry mouth, which has had a detrimental effect on my otherwise healthy gums. The XyliMelts really work; in the morning I have no drymouth. I used to have to literally tear my tongue from the roof of my mouth in the morning. I also sleep with a CPAP, which may have exacerbated the original dry mouth, but using XyliMelts has overcome the problem. I find the taste pleasant and not overwhelming.  Initially it felt weird to have the XyliMelt lump on my gums, but I got used to it in just a few seconds.  Also, at first it feels very cool on the tooth over which it&#x27;s placed, but that also goes away in a few seconds.  By the time I&#x27;ve put on and adjusted my CPAP (I use the nose pillow type) and lay down to sleep, I&#x27;ve already forgotten I have a XyliMelt in place.  I love this product, and so glad it&#x27;s a reasonable price. I highly recommend it to anyone with dry mouth problems. BTW, I&#x27;ve experienced no \\&quot;gummy\\&quot; or \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; residue issues that others mentioned.  Just good results.</li>
            <li> Best deal I could find on these, my wife loves them and helps in the evening when she is sleeping.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth, nice taste. Didn&#x27;t both my burning tongue like similar product with lemon flavor. Used it before bedtime and lasted several hours. Artificial sweetener did make me hungry, though.</li>
            <li> really do like this product.  I have hashimotos disease.  This product helps so much, especially in public situations where it becomes unable to talk due to no saliva.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t  find  these  around  here.  Thanks  for  the  great  service.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d  recommend  this  product  to  anyone  who  suffers  from  dry  mouth.</li>
            <li> Before I used this product I would wake up at night with such a dry mouth and throat that I could hardly swallow. My dental hygenist recommended this product to me and it has been WONDERFUL. No more waking at night with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Works great for dry mouth. Keeps my husband from gagging in his sleep. Makes giving oral presentations easier because he doesn&#x27;t cough &amp; gag.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as I had hoped</li>
            <li> Does not do as advertised</li>
            <li> helps with my dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Dry mouth is difficult, but XyliMelts work for me!</li>
            <li> I have a friend whose mouth always got dry during her long singing rehearsals when she could not drink anything.  She says these help a good deal and seem to last a while after using them.</li>
            <li> Gross after taste and the glue doesn&#x27;t dissolve quickly. They will stick but I wish the glue was flavored too...</li>
            <li> Mouth gets real dry overnight.  Use one of these and problem cured.  Was happy to find a solution to my problems.</li>
            <li> If you want a more effective dry mouth product, try Dentiva lozenges!  These &amp;#34;XyliMelts&amp;#34; melt so fast that they don&#x27;t really do anything.  And one side of the disc tastes gross.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m not wasting any more money on this.</li>
            <li> I always wake up with a gross, dry mouth and bad morning breath.  I just used these last night and woke up with quite fresh breath and my teeth were SMOOTH and clean-feeling.  My mouth and teeth weren&#x27;t fuzzy at all!  The only potential issue is that they can be a little rough when you first put them in your mouth.  As they begin to dissolve, the edges become less rough.  I don&#x27;t feel that they are that harsh to your gum tissue as the rough edge begins to dissolve within 15 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> XYLIMELTS are the best product I have found for dry mouth. I do have second day shipping and rec&#x27;d them in two days, tried other products they only work for about five minutes.</li>
            <li> I was waking up numerous times a night with dry mouth--the kind one gets with a severe cold.  Doctors seemed clueless re a remedy, and I was often dragging around due to lack of sleep.  My niece who also has sjogrens told me about this product and it really works.  Now I only wake up once a night which is usual.  Need to place two tablets in my mouth when I go to bed and two more in the middle of the night, and up rested.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this it&#x27;s to explore I wear a Cpac device it helps my mouth from drying out. I find it does help and may help anyone that tries it.</li>
            <li> I was using another product that would become gummy and uncomfortable. I would still have to get up to drink two to three times per night. This product is excellent. I get a full night&#x27;s sleep. Highly recommended.</li>
