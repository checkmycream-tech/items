            <li>It helped, but didn&#x27;t make my skin perfect.</li>
            <li>However, their probiotics are the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Always Excellent!</li>
            <li>Best soap ever!!</li>
            <li>Soap is substantial and feels great.</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>I was happy with this</li>
            <li>Though I am happy if it works for others.</li>
            <li>Amazing soap!</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing!</li>
            <li>I always love the way my skin looks &amp; feels with this wonderful soap bar.  </li>
            <li>Love this excellent soap and will continue to reorder.</li>
            <li>I just cannot stop saying good things about this soap.</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this product in good faith.</li>
            <li>I love the idea and love Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s probiotics (best I&#x27;ve ever used), but this soap irritated my skin and broke me out during 3 separate trials.  </li>
            <li>its touted by many as some great cure for acne...</li>
            <li>I love this soap!  </li>
            <li>Love this soap!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>What a nice soap.  </li>
            <li>It makes really nice dense foam.</li>
            <li>Nice soap, but just some $10 soap.  </li>
            <li>My daughter, who has some issues with acne, also loves the soap and got her own bar.  </li>
            <li>I bought this soap because the reviews then reported that this soap is effective for evening out skin tone.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on skin too</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also helped with my eczema, has a nice lather and no off-putting smell.</li>
            <li>even so, this is really nice soap.</li>
            <li>Probably because the majority of acne products and soaps on the market have some kind of anti-bacterial formula in them, and that&#x27;s not going to help you if your acne</li>
            <li>If you have skin problems of any kind, try this soap.</li>
            <li>recommendations when it comes to acne is to stick with treatments that are known to be effective.</li>
            <li>And, it comes in the mail very quickly, too!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I got this soap, but I love love love love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>I follow with my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Try it and enjoy!</li>
            <li>I had a couple of prominent sun spots on my face and now they have faded to the point that I have to look close for them.</li>
            <li>It works even better if you take Dr. Ohira&#x27;s probiotics with it.  </li>
            <li>will say that it seems to work ok as a deoderant soap, so gave it 2 stars for that.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would never be able to get off of them.</li>
            <li>and I make sure to wash thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for seven months and my skin is better.  </li>
            <li>More words to fill space for amazon.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this soap.....</li>
            <li>goofy</li>
            <li>This soap is the best and helps cure any skin issues with bacteria or yeast related.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s prevented more acne from appearing.</li>
            <li>I love them both.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no waxy residue like most soaps leave in my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to try a soap &amp;#34;beauty bar.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I love the idea, but this irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, leaves no residue, has a pleasant, barely there scent and works great as a shaving cream substitute, too!</li>
            <li>soap is pretty good, but I think it&#x27;s a bit too pricey.</li>
            <li>Great so far.</li>
            <li>I have a very oily skin and the soap cleans my oily face really good.  </li>
            <li>Vendor was good and fast though.</li>
            <li>left my skin feeling good but did nothing to better it, was hoping after reviews,that trying this soap would make a difference on my oily skin, minimized the oil,but its ok, just kinda of step for soap with ok response.</li>
            <li>This soap is very mild and doesn&#x27;t aggravate rosacea, although it&#x27;s a bit drying.</li>
            <li>Ohhira does not seem to have a strong grasp on acne.</li>
            <li>And no, antimicrobial does NOT mean it is good for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to wash my face with, no dry feeling afterwards, and very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is drying, but my face is almost completely clear and becoming more so with consistent use, exfoliation, coconut oil and a great BB cream.</li>
            <li>First off, this makes a marvelous facial soap.  </li>
            <li>otherwise it melts away quickly!</li>
            <li>It cleans so completely, it would be great for teens with mild acne problems.  </li>
            <li>The soap is so gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>and it would still be cheap.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So a light wash with this will keep you smelling fresh!</li>
            <li>It is a bit small, and darker than it looks in the photo, but it&#x27;s just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Worth the 11 bucks, and no plastic surgery!</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for my face because of acne problems (please keep reading to find a miracle cure).</li>
            <li>It is easy on your skin and keeps you smelling clean and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>It feels CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this soap works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>so I am not certain how the good bacteria are able to survive.</li>
            <li>I guess I thought this &#x27;probiotic&#x27; soap was going to do something really special to my skin.....</li>
            <li>It was a good soap but left a film in the shower, like i said.  </li>
            <li>; WELL all of Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s products are awesome their more expensive but I have learned you get what you pay for from computers to cars to body products</li>
            <li>Decades of acne, tried everything, etc., including trying to &amp;#34;heal the gut&amp;#34; (an approach that I think has a great deal of scientific merit, though it&#x27;s not clear anyone knows exactly how to do this).</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s just so gentle at the same time super effective.</li>
            <li>The acne isn&#x27;t completely gone (yet!), but it keeps getting better every day.</li>
            <li>However, with the latter you must be sure to get a product that doesn&#x27;t also include anything that&#x27;s going to make you break out!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using the CYCLIC Nano silver Facial Cleanser Soap Bar, which I liked</li>
            <li>I have adult acne, aging skin and thought I&#x27;d try this product to supplement my lovely skincare regimine.  </li>
            <li>I always liked it, but it left a film in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It is definately worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t feel right NOT sharing information about and inexpensive remedy with people that are suffering.</li>
            <li>It felt like that feeling you get right after you washed your face with Noxzema.  </li>
            <li>And, it lasts so nice &amp; long</li>
            <li>Rinses easily, leaves my skin soft, and works well as a shower bar as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a body wash or soap I loved, my skin is almost always dry and bumpy, so I&#x27;m excited to find something that FINALLY works!</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s too expensive, but I was was so impressed by the reviews that I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Dr Ohhira!</li>
            <li>It really works great, no more itching.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve battled moderate acne for most my life.</li>
            <li>, like most acne sufferers, have tried a bazillion different remedies for years.</li>
            <li>It cleans well and leaves your skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Second week and thereafter, things got better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this soap to lots of parents of teens dealing with acne and it has helped them so much!</li>
            <li>I am used to buying $3 or even $5 bars of soaps, but this is my first $10</li>
            <li>but it does such a lovely job.  </li>
            <li>but it helps them red puffy spots that get so sore better then anything else she has tried</li>
            <li>:) I normally wouldn&#x27;t post something like this, and I apologize if this subject bothered anyone, but I know there are so many people with this problem.</li>
            <li>Absolutely pure, soft, fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin scrupulously clean, yet soft and moist</li>
            <li>This bar makes my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>My face and body were positively benefited by this probiotic soap.</li>
            <li>That pretty much sums up six years of research on my part.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product, and I also take Dr Ohhira&#x27;s probiotics daily.</li>
            <li>This soap really did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>these work REALLY well on my skin), but my face erupted.</li>
            <li>I found it to be very drying, even though it says it&#x27;s supposed to be moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and I saw that my face hadn&#x27;t really changed</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick with this system, it is really working for me</li>
            <li>(Proactiv Solution Revitalizing Toner and Avalon Organics Lavender Ultimate Moisture Cream to be precise)</li>
            <li>I bought Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s kampuku soap on a whim of desperation and didn&#x27;t really expect it to work.</li>
            <li>This was for my whole body and it stayed that way, unlike some soaps that go away after a day.  </li>
            <li>It came fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Additionally, taking probiotics internally has been shown to be effective in clinical studies, as have topical probiotics.</li>
            <li>However, this does not mean take toxic doses!</li>
            <li>There is another skin disorder that is caused by fungi that looks similar to acne, but they are very distinct conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have no fresh spots as I type this, and old marks are fading nicely.</li>
            <li>This product is good for sensitive facial skin and leaves no afterfilm or dry skin feel.</li>
            <li>Diet also play some role (and actually has been studied quite extensively) and its a good idea to avoid sugar and dairy and to focus on consuming anti inflammatory foods such as salmon and vegetables.</li>
            <li>but it lasts a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I really like this soap and find it naturally deodorizes between showers too!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap for all ages.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>no other product has improved my skin as fast and as inexpensively as this has!  </li>
            <li>So it is good and gives you an experience with soap that I never experienced before.</li>
            <li>I was trying to go more natural and get off of my prescription topicals (Differin gel and previously, Benzaclin...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no magic bullet, but can help keep bacteria away and makes skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t get any new zits.</li>
            <li>This made my skin very soft, and started clearing up some of the inflammation on my face-</li>
            <li>she still has some small breakouts but is so much better than before.</li>
            <li>It works as advertised, but as far as healing properties go, I cannot say that this worked!  </li>
            <li>but apparently my skin needs and wants what is in this soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using pure black soap for a long time, and although this is pricey, I think I like it more for my face.</li>
            <li>it leaves your hands and body so clean without any film from other soap products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s probiotics and, after reading the number of positive reviews on this site, I decided to try the soap.  </li>
            <li>bought this for my daughter to try and clear up her acne.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t clear up my acne..</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I am 67 years old.  </li>
            <li>But my face is really oily, so I changed it to washing with the soap once in the morning, jojoba oil, and then wash with water at night, apply differin gel, and lastly the jojoba oil again.</li>
            <li>This soap in combination with bkack soap clear nearly all of my acne scars in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for three months and my skin is so clear and soft.  </li>
            <li>She started using this soap and within 4 or 5 days her face looked at least 50% better.</li>
            <li>It felt smooth, but a natural smoothness that did not feel fake or smooth because of a lotion.  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to it at the alive expo in 2012.</li>
            <li>It did make my skin soft...</li>
            <li>Also good for people with troubled skin issues.</li>
            <li>Overall, i think this product is a little overrated, and i am going back to my Neutrogena facial soap bar, which is much cheaper and better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My skin instantly felt better and looked less red after one use.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think that you are better off with an African black soap for acne.</li>
            <li>it did last a decent amount of time, but $10?  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the probiotic supplement too, I feel like what ever was causing and sustaining my acne now gets knocked out from the inside and the outside.</li>
            <li>Upon further investigation I discovered it contains coconut oil which is highly comedogenic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to say for sure that this soap is the only factor in my skin&#x27;s improvement, but I&#x27;m taking it!</li>
            <li>I have the combination skin type and the soap was over drying for my skin, it was so drying that i unconsciously started to scratches my face from time to time (and i normally used the Lancome Bienfait Multi Vital High Potency Daily Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 after washing my face with the soap; and i actually used like double the amount of lotions while with the use of the soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Believe me this is no small thing for me to report, my acne was just incessant for years, cystic and constant.</li>
            <li>it is a little pricey, but worth every penney.</li>
            <li>I have acne-prone skin and have done much better with the oil cleansing method (usually half castor oil and half evening primrose oil).</li>
            <li>I was hopeful to clear up the tiny bumps on my forehead, but sigh to no avail.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like going to the store and seeing the same old brands shoved in my face.</li>
            <li>I have tried every natural product for acne and this is the only thing that has ever worked.</li>
            <li>Delivery was earlier than expected and much appreciated.</li>
            <li>it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>This product smells like a very inexpensive soap (reminds me of old fashioned &amp;#34;motel&amp;#34; soap) and is a small bar.  </li>
            <li>I have bumps on the backs of my arms and legs, and they are noticeably less, and much much smoother since I started using it.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I got this soap, but I love love love love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this soap.  </li>
            <li> I follow with my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Try it and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I had a couple of prominent sun spots on my face and now they have faded to the point that I have to look close for them.</li>
            <li> It works even better if you take Dr. Ohira&#x27;s probiotics with it.  </li>
            <li> will say that it seems to work ok as a deoderant soap, so gave it 2 stars for that.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would never be able to get off of them.</li>
            <li> and I make sure to wash thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for seven months and my skin is better.  </li>
            <li> More words to fill space for amazon.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap.....</li>
            <li> goofy</li>
            <li> This soap is the best and helps cure any skin issues with bacteria or yeast related.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s prevented more acne from appearing.</li>
            <li> I love them both.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no waxy residue like most soaps leave in my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to try a soap &amp;#34;beauty bar.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I love the idea, but this irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, leaves no residue, has a pleasant, barely there scent and works great as a shaving cream substitute, too!</li>
            <li> soap is pretty good, but I think it&#x27;s a bit too pricey.</li>
            <li> Great so far.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily skin and the soap cleans my oily face really good.  </li>
            <li> Vendor was good and fast though.</li>
            <li> left my skin feeling good but did nothing to better it, was hoping after reviews,that trying this soap would make a difference on my oily skin, minimized the oil,but its ok, just kinda of step for soap with ok response.</li>
            <li> This soap is very mild and doesn&#x27;t aggravate rosacea, although it&#x27;s a bit drying.</li>
            <li> Ohhira does not seem to have a strong grasp on acne.</li>
            <li> And no, antimicrobial does NOT mean it is good for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great to wash my face with, no dry feeling afterwards, and very clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is drying, but my face is almost completely clear and becoming more so with consistent use, exfoliation, coconut oil and a great BB cream.</li>
            <li> First off, this makes a marvelous facial soap.  </li>
            <li> otherwise it melts away quickly!</li>
            <li> It cleans so completely, it would be great for teens with mild acne problems.  </li>
            <li> The soap is so gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> and it would still be cheap.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So a light wash with this will keep you smelling fresh!</li>
            <li> It is a bit small, and darker than it looks in the photo, but it&#x27;s just wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Worth the 11 bucks, and no plastic surgery!</li>
            <li> I originally bought it for my face because of acne problems (please keep reading to find a miracle cure).</li>
            <li> It is easy on your skin and keeps you smelling clean and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> It feels CLEAN.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this soap works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> so I am not certain how the good bacteria are able to survive.</li>
            <li> I guess I thought this &#x27;probiotic&#x27; soap was going to do something really special to my skin.....</li>
            <li> It was a good soap but left a film in the shower, like i said.  </li>
            <li> ; WELL all of Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s products are awesome their more expensive but I have learned you get what you pay for from computers to cars to body products</li>
            <li> Decades of acne, tried everything, etc., including trying to &amp;#34;heal the gut&amp;#34; (an approach that I think has a great deal of scientific merit, though it&#x27;s not clear anyone knows exactly how to do this).</li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s just so gentle at the same time super effective.</li>
            <li> The acne isn&#x27;t completely gone (yet!), but it keeps getting better every day.</li>
            <li> However, with the latter you must be sure to get a product that doesn&#x27;t also include anything that&#x27;s going to make you break out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the CYCLIC Nano silver Facial Cleanser Soap Bar, which I liked</li>
            <li> I have adult acne, aging skin and thought I&#x27;d try this product to supplement my lovely skincare regimine.  </li>
            <li> I always liked it, but it left a film in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It is definately worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t feel right NOT sharing information about and inexpensive remedy with people that are suffering.</li>
            <li> It felt like that feeling you get right after you washed your face with Noxzema.  </li>
            <li> And, it lasts so nice &amp; long</li>
            <li> Rinses easily, leaves my skin soft, and works well as a shower bar as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a body wash or soap I loved, my skin is almost always dry and bumpy, so I&#x27;m excited to find something that FINALLY works!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s too expensive, but I was was so impressed by the reviews that I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Dr Ohhira!</li>
            <li> It really works great, no more itching.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled moderate acne for most my life.</li>
            <li> , like most acne sufferers, have tried a bazillion different remedies for years.</li>
            <li> It cleans well and leaves your skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Second week and thereafter, things got better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this soap to lots of parents of teens dealing with acne and it has helped them so much!</li>
            <li> I am used to buying $3 or even $5 bars of soaps, but this is my first $10</li>
            <li> but it does such a lovely job.  </li>
            <li> but it helps them red puffy spots that get so sore better then anything else she has tried</li>
            <li> :) I normally wouldn&#x27;t post something like this, and I apologize if this subject bothered anyone, but I know there are so many people with this problem.</li>
            <li> Absolutely pure, soft, fragrance free.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin scrupulously clean, yet soft and moist</li>
            <li> This bar makes my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> My face and body were positively benefited by this probiotic soap.</li>
            <li> That pretty much sums up six years of research on my part.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product, and I also take Dr Ohhira&#x27;s probiotics daily.</li>
            <li> This soap really did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> these work REALLY well on my skin), but my face erupted.</li>
            <li> I found it to be very drying, even though it says it&#x27;s supposed to be moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and I saw that my face hadn&#x27;t really changed</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick with this system, it is really working for me</li>
            <li> (Proactiv Solution Revitalizing Toner and Avalon Organics Lavender Ultimate Moisture Cream to be precise)</li>
            <li> I bought Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s kampuku soap on a whim of desperation and didn&#x27;t really expect it to work.</li>
            <li> This was for my whole body and it stayed that way, unlike some soaps that go away after a day.  </li>
            <li> It came fast in the mail.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Additionally, taking probiotics internally has been shown to be effective in clinical studies, as have topical probiotics.</li>
            <li> However, this does not mean take toxic doses!</li>
            <li> There is another skin disorder that is caused by fungi that looks similar to acne, but they are very distinct conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no fresh spots as I type this, and old marks are fading nicely.</li>
            <li> This product is good for sensitive facial skin and leaves no afterfilm or dry skin feel.</li>
            <li> Diet also play some role (and actually has been studied quite extensively) and its a good idea to avoid sugar and dairy and to focus on consuming anti inflammatory foods such as salmon and vegetables.</li>
            <li> but it lasts a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I really like this soap and find it naturally deodorizes between showers too!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap for all ages.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> no other product has improved my skin as fast and as inexpensively as this has!  </li>
            <li> So it is good and gives you an experience with soap that I never experienced before.</li>
            <li> I was trying to go more natural and get off of my prescription topicals (Differin gel and previously, Benzaclin...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no magic bullet, but can help keep bacteria away and makes skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get any new zits.</li>
            <li> This made my skin very soft, and started clearing up some of the inflammation on my face-</li>
            <li> she still has some small breakouts but is so much better than before.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised, but as far as healing properties go, I cannot say that this worked!  </li>
            <li> but apparently my skin needs and wants what is in this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using pure black soap for a long time, and although this is pricey, I think I like it more for my face.</li>
            <li> it leaves your hands and body so clean without any film from other soap products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s probiotics and, after reading the number of positive reviews on this site, I decided to try the soap.  </li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter to try and clear up her acne.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t clear up my acne..</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old.  </li>
            <li> But my face is really oily, so I changed it to washing with the soap once in the morning, jojoba oil, and then wash with water at night, apply differin gel, and lastly the jojoba oil again.</li>
            <li> This soap in combination with bkack soap clear nearly all of my acne scars in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for three months and my skin is so clear and soft.  </li>
            <li> She started using this soap and within 4 or 5 days her face looked at least 50% better.</li>
            <li> It felt smooth, but a natural smoothness that did not feel fake or smooth because of a lotion.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to it at the alive expo in 2012.</li>
            <li> It did make my skin soft...</li>
            <li> Also good for people with troubled skin issues.</li>
            <li> Overall, i think this product is a little overrated, and i am going back to my Neutrogena facial soap bar, which is much cheaper and better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My skin instantly felt better and looked less red after one use.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think that you are better off with an African black soap for acne.</li>
            <li> it did last a decent amount of time, but $10?  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the probiotic supplement too, I feel like what ever was causing and sustaining my acne now gets knocked out from the inside and the outside.</li>
            <li> Upon further investigation I discovered it contains coconut oil which is highly comedogenic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say for sure that this soap is the only factor in my skin&#x27;s improvement, but I&#x27;m taking it!</li>
            <li> I have the combination skin type and the soap was over drying for my skin, it was so drying that i unconsciously started to scratches my face from time to time (and i normally used the Lancome Bienfait Multi Vital High Potency Daily Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 after washing my face with the soap; and i actually used like double the amount of lotions while with the use of the soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Believe me this is no small thing for me to report, my acne was just incessant for years, cystic and constant.</li>
            <li> it is a little pricey, but worth every penney.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin and have done much better with the oil cleansing method (usually half castor oil and half evening primrose oil).</li>
            <li> I was hopeful to clear up the tiny bumps on my forehead, but sigh to no avail.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like going to the store and seeing the same old brands shoved in my face.</li>
            <li> I have tried every natural product for acne and this is the only thing that has ever worked.</li>
            <li> Delivery was earlier than expected and much appreciated.</li>
            <li> it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This product smells like a very inexpensive soap (reminds me of old fashioned &amp;#34;motel&amp;#34; soap) and is a small bar.  </li>
            <li> I have bumps on the backs of my arms and legs, and they are noticeably less, and much much smoother since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> I have a long history of skin woes dating back to infancy.  </li>
            <li> I still break out occasionally but not nearly as often as it used to.</li>
            <li> I do not believe that it is a milled soap as it doesn&#x27;t last as long as one should.</li>
            <li> First week, zits got a little worse but they seemed to heal much faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite shocked that a soap is making my skin look so much better!  </li>
            <li> Other than the above mentioned, a zinc supplement may help, as will ensuring your diet contains enough vitamin A.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the soap leaves my skin soft and is somewhat helping with my acne breakouts, but not a significant difference with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Nothing got rid of the acne for long.</li>
            <li> Due to cost, I use this soap only to wash my face</li>
            <li> This includes things like salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, retin-a, and other related vitamin A topicals.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is it&#x27;s expensive (as most quality organic products are) and the bar is small.</li>
            <li> If you get the winter dry patches and use this, those spots will go away.  </li>
            <li> Because my skin is dry I put on layers of lotion throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This bar is down to a sliver, doesn&#x27;t last a very long time, so I&#x27;m going to try without it and see if the bumps return or not.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin!</li>
            <li> a little high in price, but not many soaps like this on the market.</li>
            <li> but you only need a little.</li>
            <li> You will be surprised how common they are.  </li>
            <li> I will report back after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> but we have bought other Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> (she got dry skin type), and it make her breaks out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Then when I handled it I noticed that it was very hard, which meant that it would last long.  </li>
            <li> There is hardly any smell to the soap, my only wish was that they could make this in body wash form.  </li>
            <li> Wish I could find it in quantity for less.</li>
            <li> This soap typically lasts me one year.</li>
            <li> Cleared up the little acne/pimples i had on my face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that I waste money for little reward.  </li>
            <li> (I have not experienced any issues with drying, despite the current winter weather).  </li>
            <li> After a few days my acne cleared.</li>
            <li> I had an itchy rash on both hands, gone within a few days of using this Kampuku soap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bar</li>
            <li> But... I&#x27;m lazy....</li>
            <li> I went through the entire bar and nothing, to expensive for no results.  </li>
            <li> I have not had the mysterious random rash I would break out with since using this soap.</li>
            <li> I used the small sample the Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s rep gave me.</li>
            <li> I used this soap 1 time and no more</li>
            <li> Hardly use it after a week with no noticeable change of our dry/oily skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after using the soap for several weeks according to instructions my face has broken out severely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right before trying this, I had one of the worst acne breakouts that was lasting several months.</li>
            <li> but I felt it broke me out worse.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve used Ohhira&#x27;s soap, my reliance on moisturizers has significantly decreased.  </li>
            <li> Total crap.</li>
            <li> I am terribly prone to MRSA lesions, particularly on my legs, and antibiotic after antibiotic was not the answer.</li>
            <li> However, like someone else mentioned it&#x27;s expensive for every day use.</li>
            <li> but it is quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> so it seems expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately with this product that was the case.</li>
            <li> and i was skeptical on buying her this stuff.to my surprise it has helped it hasnt cleared it up</li>
            <li> As for people saying it&#x27;s expensive...</li>
            <li> Boy... was I wrong!</li>
            <li> I had pimples within two days of using this on my face, so discontinued and used the remainder in the shower as a very expensive depderant</li>
            <li> The bad cystic stuff stopped popping up.</li>
            <li> Oil cleansing methods and oil based serums are a really bad idea if you are acne prone.</li>
            <li> stupid if you ask me.</li>
            <li> My worst problem now is rosacea.  </li>
            <li> One of the worst offenders is Argan oil...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is good for sensitive facial skin and leaves no afterfilm or dry skin feel. It does not irritate.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  It&#x27;s a small bar but it lasts a decent amount of time.  It&#x27;s a wonderful deodorant soap.  However, like someone else mentioned it&#x27;s expensive for every day use.</li>
            <li> This is a review for the product &#x27;Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Probiotic Kampuku Bar Soap 80 Grams&#x27;. I have the combination skin type and the soap was over drying for my skin, it was so drying that i unconsciously started to scratches my face from time to time (and i normally used the Lancome Bienfait Multi Vital High Potency Daily Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 after washing my face with the soap; and i actually used like double the amount of lotions while with the use of the soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my roommate had tried the soap too (she got dry skin type), and it make her breaks out after a few uses. Overall, i think this product is a little overrated, and i am going back to my Neutrogena facial soap bar, which is much cheaper and better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have a long history of skin woes dating back to infancy.  My worst problem now is rosacea.  My skin instantly felt better and looked less red after one use.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how it will help after long-term usage.  I will report back after a few weeks.  Soap is substantial and feels great.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  I use it on my face.  It makes my skin feel so soft and clean.  It also takes off my mascara!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s too expensive, but I was was so impressed by the reviews that I gave it a try.  Wow. What a nice soap.  Absolutely pure, soft, fragrance free. Rinses easily, leaves my skin soft, and works well as a shower bar as well.  It is a bit small, and darker than it looks in the photo, but it&#x27;s just wonderful.  Wish I could find it in quantity for less.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily skin and the soap cleans my oily face really good.  It makes really nice dense foam. However, it didn&#x27;t work as miracle for my acne.  I use it day and night and it&#x27;s been lasting over two months now.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old.  This is the best cleansing soap I have used even for a woman of my age.  I follow with my favorite moisturizer.  I highly recommend this soap for all ages. It cleans so completely, it would be great for teens with mild acne problems.  My test is the extent to which washing my face removes all eye make-up.  This one is the best at that!  Try it and enjoy!</li>
            <li> This soap is very mild and doesn&#x27;t aggravate rosacea, although it&#x27;s a bit drying.</li>
            <li> I always love the way my skin looks &amp; feels with this wonderful soap bar.  And, it lasts so nice &amp; long I don&#x27;t feel that I waste money for little reward.  And, it comes in the mail very quickly, too!  Thanks, Dr Ohhira! &amp; Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful soap</li>
            <li> This soap is helpful for acne, but only in combination with diet changes as well. It&#x27;s no magic bullet, but can help keep bacteria away and makes skin clean and fresh. Also, you can use it as a deoderant soap. This is my new favorite product, and I also take Dr Ohhira&#x27;s probiotics daily.</li>
            <li> Amazing soap! Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin! Love this soap! Also use Dr. Ohara probiotic! Best on the market! Would recommend both products!</li>
            <li> I guess I thought this &#x27;probiotic&#x27; soap was going to do something really special to my skin.....nope.  Just soap.  Nice soap, but just some $10 soap.  Oh well.    Vendor was good and fast though.</li>
            <li> I did not repurchase this product. But nothing against it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s probiotics and, after reading the number of positive reviews on this site, I decided to try the soap.  I&#x27;d been using the CYCLIC Nano silver Facial Cleanser Soap Bar, which I liked but it is quite expensive.  My skin is aging and on the oily/normal side.  First off, this makes a marvelous facial soap.  It leaves my skin scrupulously clean, yet soft and moist (I have not experienced any issues with drying, despite the current winter weather).  I also like it for a bath bar, for the same reasons.  My daughter, who has some issues with acne, also loves the soap and got her own bar.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because the reviews then reported that this soap is effective for evening out skin tone. Well, they are not kidding! I had a couple of prominent sun spots on my face and now they have faded to the point that I have to look close for them. I use this soap maybe 2 times a week when im giving myself a steam and facial. A year later those spots are disappearing. Worth the 11 bucks, and no plastic surgery!</li>
            <li> It really works great, no more itching.  It works even better if you take Dr. Ohira&#x27;s probiotics with it.  it is a little pricey, but worth every penney.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled moderate acne for most my life. A friend recommended this soap. After a few days my acne cleared. I have very sensitive skin and this soap works amazingly well. I still break out occasionally but not nearly as often as it used to. This soap typically lasts me one year. I use it several times a day on my face or hands so it seems expensive but you only need a little.</li>
            <li> This soap really did not work for me.  I have adult acne, aging skin and thought I&#x27;d try this product to supplement my lovely skincare regimine.  This product smells like a very inexpensive soap (reminds me of old fashioned &amp;#34;motel&amp;#34; soap) and is a small bar.  I do not believe that it is a milled soap as it doesn&#x27;t last as long as one should. I had pimples within two days of using this on my face, so discontinued and used the remainder in the shower as a very expensive depderant soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it seems to work ok as a deoderant soap, so gave it 2 stars for that.  Overall, I think that you are better off with an African black soap for acne.</li>
            <li> This soap has saved my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, like most acne sufferers, have tried a bazillion different remedies for years. I have moderate to severe acne with oily sensative skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right before trying this, I had one of the worst acne breakouts that was lasting several months. I was trying to go more natural and get off of my prescription topicals (Differin gel and previously, Benzaclin... these work REALLY well on my skin), but my face erupted. I thought I would never be able to get off of them. Then I saw this at the health food store and the cashier said that customers have said great things about it. So I bought it. I found it to be very drying, even though it says it&#x27;s supposed to be moisturizing. Even so, it helped to heal up my existing acne. I saw my skin improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it was so drying, but I could see it was working, I started to use it only at night and washed with water in the morning. But my face is really oily, so I changed it to washing with the soap once in the morning, jojoba oil, and then wash with water at night, apply differin gel, and lastly the jojoba oil again. But... I&#x27;m lazy....so sometimes I don&#x27;t wash my face at night. This happened for a couple days and I saw that my face hadn&#x27;t really changed and I didn&#x27;t get any new zits. So I just stopped using my medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks now and all I do is wash it once in the morning, jojoba oil, and rinse with water at night and apply a liberal amount of jojoba oil at night. I use a buf-puf with the soap and I make sure to wash thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two products are literal miracles for my over-sensitive, oily acne prone (or used to be?) skin. Now I gotta figure out how to get rid of acne scars!</li>
            <li> My sister, an esthetician, suggested this product when I started with chronic hives.  Antihistamines, which was recommended to offset the hives, dries out your skin.  I have been using this product for seven months and my skin is better.  Plan to continue.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  It cleans well and leaves your skin soft and smooth.  Also it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This products does what it says it will do.  It is easy on your skin and keeps you smelling clean and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I always liked it, but it left a film in the shower.  More words to fill space for amazon.  It was a good soap but left a film in the shower, like i said.  is it necessary to have a word limit?  stupid if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap.....it leaves your hands and body so clean without any film from other soap products.</li>
            <li> This soap in combination with bkack soap clear nearly all of my acne scars in 3 weeks. It is definately worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to MD/ND(Naturopath Doctor) &amp; used several  Probiotics but this is the only one in ? 3-5 years that works.  It took ~ 3-7 days to work. I&#x27;ve taken / used soap/pills x 40 days &amp; almost gone.</li>
            <li> had burns and this helped soooth them....goofy I know but we have bought other Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s products and they are of the quality you heard your grandparents tell when &amp;#34; I whish they made things with quality and care like the used too&amp;#34; WELL all of Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s products are awesome their more expensive but I have learned you get what you pay for from computers to cars to body products</li>
            <li> Cleared up the little acne/pimples i had on my face.  Feels nice on skin too</li>
            <li> This soap is great.  I have been using it for three months and my skin is so clear and soft.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter to try and clear up her acne. she was on prescription washes and topicals as well as oral antibiotics for weeks and weeks with no relief. She started using this soap and within 4 or 5 days her face looked at least 50% better. We stopped all prescriptions and she has just been using this by itself. she still has some small breakouts but is so much better than before.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap and find it naturally deodorizes between showers too! So a light wash with this will keep you smelling fresh!</li>
            <li> Decades of acne, tried everything, etc., including trying to &amp;#34;heal the gut&amp;#34; (an approach that I think has a great deal of scientific merit, though it&#x27;s not clear anyone knows exactly how to do this). Nothing got rid of the acne for long. Tried this soap just on my face, being as how it&#x27;s pricy and all. First week, zits got a little worse but they seemed to heal much faster. Second week and thereafter, things got better. The bad cystic stuff stopped popping up. I&#x27;m in my third or fourth week or so and cautiously optimistic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this soap to lots of parents of teens dealing with acne and it has helped them so much! Great product.</li>
            <li> I love the idea and love Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s probiotics (best I&#x27;ve ever used), but this soap irritated my skin and broke me out during 3 separate trials.  I have acne-prone skin and have done much better with the oil cleansing method (usually half castor oil and half evening primrose oil).</li>
            <li> I bought this soap on a hunch that a topical probiotic product might help with my skin problems. I am terribly prone to MRSA lesions, particularly on my legs, and antibiotic after antibiotic was not the answer. I started using this soap each time I shower (along with the SK1N body lotion) about three months ago and have not had an infection since I started. This is a BIG deal. It&#x27;s hard to say for sure that this soap is the only factor in my skin&#x27;s improvement, but I&#x27;m taking it! It&#x27;s also helped with my eczema, has a nice lather and no off-putting smell. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this soap in conjunction with the same brand probiotic supplements for about one month now and my skin is clearer than it has been in YEARS. Regarding the soap regime: I just wash once in the morning and twice at night (the second pm wash with my clarasonic). I&#x27;m going to stick with this system, it is really working for me and I love that it&#x27;s just so gentle at the same time super effective. Believe me this is no small thing for me to report, my acne was just incessant for years, cystic and constant. It was so demoralising and now it&#x27;s gone. I have no fresh spots as I type this, and old marks are fading nicely. I tone and moisturise after each wash (Proactiv Solution Revitalizing Toner and Avalon Organics Lavender Ultimate Moisture Cream to be precise) I highly recommend the probiotic supplement too, I feel like what ever was causing and sustaining my acne now gets knocked out from the inside and the outside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over 6months. I haven&#x27;t seen a different. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a scent to the soap.</li>
            <li> Great product. Used it before. Also good for people with troubled skin issues.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best and helps cure any skin issues with bacteria or yeast related. I have been using it for weeks and works great to cure Blepharitis of the eye lids (bacteria that grows on them)</li>
            <li> I have no idea if the probiotics are actually doing anything but even so, this is really nice soap. Very moisturizing, leaves no residue, has a pleasant, barely there scent and works great as a shaving cream substitute, too! The only thing I suggest is covering it when it&#x27;s not in use otherwise it melts away quickly! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> For years, I have suffered from moderate acne breakouts and I have tried a lot of different products. None of them helped with the breakouts. Probably because the majority of acne products and soaps on the market have some kind of anti-bacterial formula in them, and that&#x27;s not going to help you if your acne *isn&#x27;t* caused by bacteria.     I bought Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s kampuku soap on a whim of desperation and didn&#x27;t really expect it to work. Boy... was I wrong! I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about my month. My skin is clearer. It feels CLEAN. There is no odor and it doesn&#x27;t leave this film on your skin. And it&#x27;s done a lot for my acne. The acne isn&#x27;t completely gone (yet!), but it keeps getting better every day. Best of all? It&#x27;s prevented more acne from appearing. You can feel the soap closing the pores on your face and keeping the moisture in. I just cannot stop saying good things about this soap. If you have skin problems of any kind, try this soap. Come on. I dare you!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I got this soap, but I love love love love it!  I have bumps on the backs of my arms and legs, and they are noticeably less, and much much smoother since I started using it.  This bar is down to a sliver, doesn&#x27;t last a very long time, so I&#x27;m going to try without it and see if the bumps return or not.  It&#x27;s also great to wash my face with, no dry feeling afterwards, and very clean and smooth.  There is hardly any smell to the soap, my only wish was that they could make this in body wash form.  I&#x27;ve never found a body wash or soap I loved, my skin is almost always dry and bumpy, so I&#x27;m excited to find something that FINALLY works!</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the concept of using probiotics in my face soap to help treat acne. Unfortunately after using the soap for several weeks according to instructions my face has broken out severely. I cannot recommend this product in good faith.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing! I originally bought it for my face because of acne problems (please keep reading to find a miracle cure). It helped, but didn&#x27;t make my skin perfect. I use the moisturizer from Dr Ohhira as well. I love them both. The miracle cure I mentioned earlier is for hemmorroids. I was in a lot of pain, and OTC remedies weren&#x27;t working at all. I tried this soap in the shower on my hemmorroids, and within 2 days they were cured. It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m cured! :) I normally wouldn&#x27;t post something like this, and I apologize if this subject bothered anyone, but I know there are so many people with this problem. I wouldn&#x27;t feel right NOT sharing information about and inexpensive remedy with people that are suffering.</li>
            <li> I have  no idea what this soap is supposed to accomplish. I just don&#x27;t like going to the store and seeing the same old brands shoved in my face.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference with our skin. Hardly use it after a week with no noticeable change of our dry/oily skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it hoping it would help my facial skin and complexion but it didn&#x27;t.  I went through the entire bar and nothing, to expensive for no results.  However, their probiotics are the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> left my skin feeling good but did nothing to better it, was hoping after reviews,that trying this soap would make a difference on my oily skin, minimized the oil,but its ok, just kinda of step for soap with ok response. Might for work for others, but not for me</li>
            <li> Love this excellent soap and will continue to reorder. Been using this soap for 4 o five years because it helps reduce dryness and itching. Delivery was earlier than expected and much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Probiotic capsules and came across this soap and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve noticed that the soap leaves my skin soft and is somewhat helping with my acne breakouts, but not a significant difference with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is pretty good, but I think it&#x27;s a bit too pricey.</li>
            <li> I have not had the mysterious random rash I would break out with since using this soap. I will keep updating if my rash comes back. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I like this soap! I like Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s probiotics, and probiotics are on our skin, therefore I prefer to use probiotics rather than antibiotics on mine skin.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised, but as far as healing properties go, I cannot say that this worked!  I am used to buying $3 or even $5 bars of soaps, but this is my first $10 bar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened it, I noticed that it was quite small.  This got me concerned!  Then when I handled it I noticed that it was very hard, which meant that it would last long.  it did last a decent amount of time, but $10?  I would buy again if it were $5, but not at $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin did feel refreshed after drying.  It felt smooth, but a natural smoothness that did not feel fake or smooth because of a lotion.  It felt like that feeling you get right after you washed your face with Noxzema.  This was for my whole body and it stayed that way, unlike some soaps that go away after a day.  So it is good and gives you an experience with soap that I never experienced before.</li>
            <li> Due to cost, I use this soap only to wash my face but it does such a lovely job.  I do like that it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> The soap is so gentle yet effective. I was introduced to it at the alive expo in 2012. I used the small sample the Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s rep gave me. It lasted for over a month of daily use. My face and body were positively benefited by this probiotic soap. I love it</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking the probiotics would help my acne prone skin. It did make my skin soft...but I felt it broke me out worse. Upon further investigation I discovered it contains coconut oil which is highly comedogenic. Coconut oil is also antimicrobial so I am not certain how the good bacteria are able to survive. And no, antimicrobial does NOT mean it is good for acne prone skin. Those who believe oil is the magic cure to acne are wrong. One of the worst offenders is Argan oil...its touted by many as some great cure for acne...but it is so comedogenic that even using it on my arms caused them to break out. But that&#x27;s an aside point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Ohhira does not seem to have a strong grasp on acne. He is not a medical doctor, but a Dr. of microbiology. While he is an expert when it comes to what probiotics, he also refers to acne as a fungal infection on his website. Acne is not related to fungi. There is another skin disorder that is caused by fungi that looks similar to acne, but they are very distinct conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendations when it comes to acne is to stick with treatments that are known to be effective. This includes things like salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, retin-a, and other related vitamin A topicals. Diet also play some role (and actually has been studied quite extensively) and its a good idea to avoid sugar and dairy and to focus on consuming anti inflammatory foods such as salmon and vegetables. Additionally, taking probiotics internally has been shown to be effective in clinical studies, as have topical probiotics. However, with the latter you must be sure to get a product that doesn&#x27;t also include anything that&#x27;s going to make you break out! Unfortunately with this product that was the case. Other than the above mentioned, a zinc supplement may help, as will ensuring your diet contains enough vitamin A. However, this does not mean take toxic doses! And avoid oil! Oil cleansing methods and oil based serums are a really bad idea if you are acne prone. Research which ingredients are comedogenic. You will be surprised how common they are.  And finally, work with a dermatologist as they are equipped to help you with acne. That pretty much sums up six years of research on my part.</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it as face soap daily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often leave reviews, but I just had to review this soap! No matter what I bathed in my skin has always itched after I showered. I have even tried baby wash! I used this soap 1 time and no more itching!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> my wife has rosacea  and i was skeptical on buying her this stuff.to my surprise it has helped it hasnt cleared it up but it helps them red puffy spots that get so sore better then anything else she has tried</li>
            <li> This made my skin very soft, and started clearing up some of the inflammation on my face- overall it didn&#x27;t clear up my acne.. But it did help with the redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using pure black soap for a long time, and although this is pricey, I think I like it more for my face. It is drying, but my face is almost completely clear and becoming more so with consistent use, exfoliation, coconut oil and a great BB cream. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This is terrifically healing for your skin.  If you get the winter dry patches and use this, those spots will go away.  I use it on face and body and my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> This bar makes my skin soft and clean. There&#x27;s no waxy residue like most soaps leave in my skin. Because my skin is dry I put on layers of lotion throughout the day. Since I&#x27;ve used Ohhira&#x27;s soap, my reliance on moisturizers has significantly decreased.  The only drawback is it&#x27;s expensive (as most quality organic products are) and the bar is small. It lasted me just under a month.</li>
            <li> Always Excellent! Best soap ever!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite shocked that a soap is making my skin look so much better!  I had an itchy rash on both hands, gone within a few days of using this Kampuku soap.  I use it on my body and face and am seeing such drastic improvements in the look and texture of my skin.  Discolorations are lightening and even the KP on my upper thighs is clearing up.  As for people saying it&#x27;s expensive...no other product has improved my skin as fast and as inexpensively as this has!  $10.00?  I&#x27;d pay twice that for the benefits I&#x27;m getting and it would still be cheap.  I have no idea how this is working so well but apparently my skin needs and wants what is in this soap.</li>
            <li> Great so far. I love the smell. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like this soap. I felt like I was cleaner after using it! It came fast in the mail. I was happy with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Its a little high in price, but not many soaps like this on the market. Unless you get the PH ones.&lt;br /&gt;So this  one will do.</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to try a soap &amp;#34;beauty bar.&amp;#34;  Total crap.</li>
            <li> I love the idea, but this irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> No difference before or after using this product.  I was hopeful to clear up the tiny bumps on my forehead, but sigh to no avail. Though I am happy if it works for others.</li>
            <li> I have tried every natural product for acne and this is the only thing that has ever worked. I highly recommend!</li>
