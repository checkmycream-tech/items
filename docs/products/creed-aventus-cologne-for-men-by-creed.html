            <li>It does smell real good .</li>
            <li>Well, the description inside the box does shows Arabic letters but the smell is perfect.</li>
            <li>its awesome is all I can say.</li>
            <li>Into the evening I kept smelling the napkin and just kept thinking how awesome a fragrance this was.  </li>
            <li>but WOWZERS, I love AVENTUS!!!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the best of all Creeds but it is in the top 5!!</li>
            <li>Is the packaging beautiful?</li>
            <li>I have not tried this method with Buy D Best yet since I lucked out with a good batch.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good office fragrance because it can be distracting...in a wonderful way.  </li>
            <li>Creed Aventus smells awesome, I love it!</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, this is some great juice.</li>
            <li>Over all, I am happy with its quality for what I have paid.</li>
            <li>even at the end of the day I can no longer smell it people still compliment me and the price was great.</li>
            <li>Great smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spraying on my wrist it smells great.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still Aventus at a great price, and Amazon is taking care of it for me.</li>
            <li>I will not be happy with Amazon if I wake up tomorrow morning with carbuncles on my skin.</li>
            <li>Still a great smelling fragrance</li>
            <li>Great deal at a great price.</li>
            <li>Creed Aventus is a great cologne.</li>
            <li>Lots of complements and smells great.</li>
            <li>For those who care, my lot number was A42B11Y02, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This was well packaged for shipping, arrived promptly and smells great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy I chose to purchase from here.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smokey pineapple with great longevity and projection.  </li>
            <li>Great service great cologne</li>
            <li>This is a great fragrance.</li>
            <li>The projection isn&#x27;t something great at all.i</li>
            <li>Has a great smell.</li>
            <li>Smells great .</li>
            <li>Because, if u are, welcome to the masses if u think this cologne is going to make u stand out.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend was so happy to receive this for his birthday.</li>
            <li>Cologne smells GREAT.</li>
            <li>Base-notes of citrus or pineapple, very warm and tropical smelling.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing !</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a pleasant fragrance, but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too strong but a great scent!</li>
            <li>Authentic Creed at a very good price</li>
            <li>Not just a smell good contest.</li>
            <li>Bottomline, this is some good juice.</li>
            <li>Fifteen hours of longevity, persisting through activity and cigar smoke and still bearing that quality is why Creed Aventus is as good as you can get.</li>
            <li>And he loved it.</li>
            <li>Jeff Bezos, get someone on quality control for perfumes ASAP, this doesn&#x27;t look good AT ALL.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Never knew anything could smell this good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it lasted a good while, maybe it wassensory adaptation after wearing it a while.</li>
            <li>is a good buy.</li>
            <li>and he loved this!&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I purchased at a good price (for a creed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However it is still a good cologne to have in your collection</li>
            <li>It projects a good four to six feet even after 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nevertheless she loved the Tobacco Vanille on me.</li>
            <li>Also, the hottest girl at work (age 27 Pakistani) loved it too</li>
            <li>The item was new,but it wasn&#x27;t sealed.it is good if you r going to use it,but I think for gift it needed to be sealed</li>
            <li>Please keep in mind that Creed is known for their superior product quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>One day I was at the store after work and the cashier told me my cologne smelled good.  </li>
            <li>It smelled incredible, still smoky but more refined, and very potent.  </li>
            <li>I own both the Aventus and Portugal by Creed and they are both AMAZING!</li>
            <li>My husband is very pleased with the gift.</li>
            <li>Cologne smells amazing, just like samples I got from Saks Fifth Ave, so I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne for my boyfriend and price is amazing !</li>
            <li>So many truly EXCELLENT and unique colognes at this price point.</li>
            <li>The good news is, Amazon being a great and honest company still gave me a full refund, knowing the product was a counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell is great, longevity is fine.</li>
            <li>This scent is amazing.  </li>
            <li>While smelling amazing</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great product and accurate description.</li>
            <li>&amp; I said let me go to Amazon they have amazing prices.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and</li>
            <li>I have sampled Aventus before purchasing and I used to think the sample smelled amazing.</li>
            <li>what kind of eczema one could get from even spraying the darn thing.</li>
            <li>but I had smelled Creed before and knew I liked it</li>
            <li>I received the 4 oz bottle for my birthday and am thrilled.</li>
            <li>Six or seven women rose from their cubicles to discover the provenance of the holy smell.</li>
            <li>This cologne is truly unique and smells great.</li>
            <li>By far the best smelling cologne I own...</li>
            <li>However, to be fair, it is the real thing at a great price.</li>
            <li>Very strong even for one squirt.  </li>
            <li>My most treasured fragrance I own.</li>
            <li>its so great&lt;br /&gt;i receive it on a nice packaging and it comes safe</li>
            <li>Simply amazing women love this scent</li>
            <li>You will get your moneys worth out of this bottle and also a lot of compliments because it smells so great.</li>
            <li>I was concerned it wouldn&#x27;t be the real deal, but all seems well and good!  </li>
            <li>This is really good, I smelt every top colognes in the market and this one is still the king of Cologne, nothing even come close, very sophisticate yet pleasant.</li>
            <li>The real thing smells great, which was why I wanted to get my own</li>
            <li>The product is great and it was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>The cologne on first spray smells great.  </li>
            <li>After paying hundreds more at Nordstrom I gave Amazon a try</li>
            <li>this one is my top 2 in the creed line, my ladies cant resist on complementing me on it.</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>The most I&#x27;ve ever paid for a fragrance</li>
            <li>The women love Creed Aventus.</li>
            <li>The cologne I have received smells mostly like alcohol and some plantlike, musky smell, not Aventus.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li>After seeing some of the reviews here, I was worried about whether or not the thing is authentic.</li>
            <li>Now if we come to the juice itself, i think it is just phenomenal.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i bought this and verified for myself.</li>
            <li>Ok so I purchase this and it has an Arabic paper inside instead of the creed one.</li>
            <li>Thank God I purchased Aventus through a reputable company.</li>
            <li>Love this Aventus smell as they quit making Woods by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch which was my signature smell.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want too many people smelling like me.  </li>
            <li>8-)  </li>
            <li>Many tell me they can smell the fragrance hours after i have applied it.  </li>
            <li>fils depuis 1760&amp;#34; with two Creed family members printed on top surrounded by gold metallic print.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Elegant without being overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many compliments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  OK</li>
            <li>I cannot begin to tell how many compliments I received since I purchased Creed.</li>
            <li>Unlike most Creeds, this is an unquestionable powerhouse on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have many Creed fragrances</li>
            <li>but this one is my favorite</li>
            <li>, i was a bit concerned to buy this one on Amazon after reading many reviews</li>
            <li>Never in my life have I received so many compliments on my &#x27;perfume&#x27; ...</li>
            <li>It is, in fact, authentic.</li>
            <li>will be enjoying the scent all day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than Aventus</li>
            <li>Wore it to work and received many compliments, \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>: I spray myself one more time yesterday to try again, and again, nothing.</li>
            <li>I was told by as many as six</li>
            <li>yeah the women love it.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>have never gotten so many compliments on any cologne I ever had.</li>
            <li>and when I saw the discounted rate on Amazon (after weighing that there were more 5star reviews then 1 or 2 star) I thought I would take a chance.</li>
            <li>Even though the bottle and atomizer seem authentic, it smells of gas when it is applied</li>
            <li>My mom and sister (age: 24) also love it.</li>
            <li>gets me more compliments than L&#x27;eau D&#x27;Issey, which was my reigning champ until I bought Creed&#x27;s Millesime Imperial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some ppl complain about creed because of the price,i am not doing that because i actually love the house of creed and my #1 cologne</li>
            <li>30mins.this is more so</li>
            <li>Be safe with it</li>
            <li>Now Im like i got to have it :)</li>
            <li>I do notice this cologne being a more sophisticated product ..</li>
            <li>I love this cologne ..  </li>
            <li>women love it ..  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any pineapple/citrus in the top notes.</li>
            <li>Please make sure you buy from a reputable vendor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this for a while now, mostly to work</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: 10/10, don&#x27;t hesitate, this is a great cologne for year round wear and definitely unique at a great price here!</li>
            <li>My favorite mens cologne.came in nice original box</li>
            <li>It was great at first, but then got too sweet, and eventually gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>If you google search for good batch numbers, you can request it through certain vendors.  </li>
            <li>I have been fortunate to have been the recipient of many colognes as gifts over the years.</li>
            <li>I hope I can enjoy it like I enjoy Original Santal, GIT, MI, Le Labo Bergamote 22, Rose 31, Bond no9 Bleecker Street, and my signature Hermes Terre d&#x27;Hermes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very nice and masculine fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It is sophisticated, sporty and unique.</li>
            <li>Neiman Marcus or Creed Boutique are best, but there are other legit online dealers.  </li>
            <li>This cologne is way too strong and overpowering.  </li>
            <li>the essence in this perfume is not as strong.</li>
            <li>(6) women, strangers, that smells nice, or you smell good and a couple of them were with a male partner.</li>
            <li>I checked out this fragrance at a department store, and it is quite strong.</li>
            <li>Creed is an average fragrance at best.</li>
            <li>I can honestly still sometimes smell creed on my clothes after I&#x27;ve washed them on a hot cycle with detergent.</li>
            <li>best cologne hands down.</li>
            <li>It was a new batch, one of the good ones, being sold in an arabic speaking country</li>
            <li>Weomen seem to like it fine, what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I pleasantly woke up around 10am with her head on my chest, pretty eyes looking up at me, and the first thing she said that morning was \\&quot;You smell amazing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Amazing smell very masculine love</li>
            <li>EXACTLY THE SAME, WAYYY BETTER PRICE!!!</li>
            <li>It smells like someone peeled out in a semi over a huge pile of pineapples.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the deliverer is so fast and the perfume is so nice</li>
            <li>The box was precise as is all its packaging.</li>
            <li>Would the authentic one be worth $150.</li>
            <li>The frangrance is fairly light when it dries.  </li>
            <li>box from Creed is supremely well detailed.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I can enjoy the scent like everyone around me.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have to use three sprays to enjoy..</li>
            <li>Not eve worth keeping for free though, not the Creed I know and love from Neiman Marcus.</li>
            <li>But man this stuff must smell really good because I had a couple co-works ask me to come near so they could share the scent with someone they told about</li>
            <li>Its the real deal!!!</li>
            <li>,i really do feel that one is just as light now,it used to be great when the bottle was gold color,the new one is just to light for me</li>
            <li>Aventus has a very distinct scent to it, which is why it smells so unique and costs $200.  </li>
            <li>its not the original.</li>
            <li>i had to go to neiman markus to buy the original</li>
            <li>, the bottle and the box seems to be original.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>Friendly price compared to Mega retailers and authorized boutiques.</li>
            <li>The product is not the original.</li>
            <li>I bought this looking for a unique scent that no one else is wearing.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a sign that this juice is worth the $$!</li>
            <li>If they could bottle the tears of Zeus, I&#x27;m pretty sure this would be it.</li>
            <li>It is truly a unique fragrance and you (and others)</li>
            <li>But the air was full of Aventus for all to enjoy.</li>
            <li>but so worth it!</li>
            <li>There is no sillage with this precise Parfum I bought, as has been touted by many regarding the real deal.</li>
            <li>theres a good possibility you may be meeting a couple of them at every social gathering in 2013.</li>
            <li>I cannot say for certain if this purchase was authentic or not.</li>
            <li>Someone special purchased a 1 oz bottle of Creed Aventus for me some months ago.</li>
            <li>Once you find the right scent for your body type, you won&#x27;t go anywhere else!</li>
            <li>I was super excited about the Aventus colonge by Creed when I sprayed some on me in Saks fifth Ave.</li>
            <li>Sweet but not fruity.</li>
            <li>Many of the feedback doubted its origin as real</li>
            <li>Does not stay more than a couple of hours and does not smell like a real one.</li>
            <li>For the price you pay for this I would just get it from a department store to be sure it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>Also my co-workers again informed me how much they enjoyed the scent...</li>
            <li>I LOVE TOBACCO VANILLE but have never smelled the MUCH cheaper L&#x27;Occitane.</li>
            <li>It is unique and due to its price, many people don&#x27;t own this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was also quick.</li>
            <li>I watched several videos on the internet with authentic Creed box openings and how to spot a legit package, and yes this is authentic</li>
            <li>The item came as described and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it and the ladies absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The price was GREAT half the price of what I could of paid in the store.</li>
            <li>The scent is good on first spray and for about 10 mins later and thats about it.</li>
            <li>Since using Creed, every single person I&#x27;ve come within hugging distance of, has said something about how good I smell.</li>
            <li>I should of known to good to be true, the smell is is not the same as the real creed aventus.  </li>
            <li>I can safely say - that tiny sprits lasted easily 8 hrs and was intoxicating, even as it faded.</li>
            <li>a lot, its a very classy sexy powerful orgasmic scent.</li>
            <li>Ladies tell me I smell sexy and manly (ages 19 - 46) and even my father (who&#x27;s one of those tough old school Clint Eastwood types) says it&#x27;s the best one he&#x27;s smelled.</li>
            <li>Creed really stands out letting people know that is not a cologne you just buy on a Duty Free Airport.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li>Complete Quality fragrance love</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price point because it lasts.  </li>
            <li>the juice is so fresh</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap oil or to be precise, a VERY diluted form of the real thing doused with vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Is it worth $350.</li>
            <li>YES, this is 100% authentic Creed cologne, provided you buy from AMAZON directly (should say Prime eligible if you are a Prime member).</li>
            <li>Authentic Creed Aventus (from Amazon direct).  </li>
            <li>bought this after Millesime Imperial and was surprised that Aventus gets me even more compliments.</li>
            <li>you want to smell like a burned pineapple pizza, have fun.</li>
            <li>A sophisticated mature gentleman&#x27;s  cologne.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it....</li>
            <li>Smelling the bottle again I got hints of fresh pineapple.  </li>
            <li>However, after years of dominating the market since 2010, there are a lot of Aventus clones out there to beat the Aventus incredulous price, Insurrection Pure II by Rayane Tradition is one of the best, the top notes is different from Aventus and smells very synthetic, but when the middle and basenotes kicks in(about 15 mins), it smells exactly like Aventus, for people who doesn&#x27;t smell a lot of cologne they can&#x27;t discern between Aventus and Insurrection Pure II.</li>
            <li>There are other colognes out there that smell similar to Aventus but none of them perform or smell as awesome.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll get you lucky ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now convinced they are right on amazon.</li>
            <li>Strong and masculine taste!</li>
            <li>Creeds scents are masculine, clean, sophisticated    Cons: I was introduced to this by a female who couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about it</li>
            <li>If you buy from amazon directly and not a 3rd party seller on amazon you can be confident you will get authentic</li>
            <li>I say buy from either Neiman and Marcus or Lucky Scent which are both official retailers that you know you&#x27;re getting the real deal.  </li>
            <li>This is a highly sought after cologne and if you&#x27;re not paying full price odds are you are being duped.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting, good for work and those special occasions!Give it</li>
            <li>This product has the old creed sprayer thats huge still..</li>
            <li>Ok this is not a review of what the seller is receiving from anyone on Amazon, but of the actual cologne itself.  </li>
            <li>Fast overseas shipping!</li>
            <li>I am 24 and have had a massive crush on a stunning girl since sophomore year of college.</li>
            <li>but it is my go to when I am dressing up for a romantic or sophisticated evening.</li>
            <li>Purchase this product in person from a local retailer to make sure you are getting the real stuff!</li>
            <li>but it smells exactly like the sample I got a while ago.</li>
            <li>The only thing that worries me is that the cap doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on and that the edge of the label started to lift off - ok</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Thanks everyone !</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t  smell like the one I first smelled  on a guy where I worked  at.</li>
            <li>so the parfum concentration is higher than the Eau de Toilette.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>It also took a couple of weeks more to receive the 2nd replacement bottle.</li>
            <li>where I go I get so many compliments and the smell last for hours.</li>
            <li>This is a must for the guy that wants to be noticed!</li>
            <li>I got it as a birthday gift and instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the real thing!</li>
            <li>I love Tobacco Vanille but my female friend</li>
            <li>my conclusion is that they might have reduced the potency of their cologne just like christian dior fahreheit is no longer that potent anymore</li>
            <li>Long lasting, great scent</li>
            <li>The first day I recieved it colonge</li>
            <li>When I first smelled this, I sprayed it on a napkin.  </li>
            <li>This is real man&#x27;s cologne!  </li>
            <li>I reckon the only way one can be sure is if one has the real thing to compare with.</li>
            <li>The top plastic protector over the spray nozzle is also thick plastic, with some metallic silver crown logo or seal, also on par with what was seen in my authentic bottle investigation online.</li>
            <li>and it is still pretty much out there making itself noticed...</li>
            <li>first this scent smelled very strong to me, almost overwhelming, but a few minutes later I began to like it</li>
            <li>The real authentic stuff that is fresh will cost more, but should last you 2-3x as long, as it will take less to promote the scent and have longevity when worn.</li>
            <li>The box and the bottle look way too original and detailed that I really don&#x27;t think thief will spent so much money creating an exact copy.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, and I got a compliment less than 10 minutes after putting it on.</li>
            <li>The scents are long lasting, good quality ingredients and the cologne &amp;#34;adapts&amp;#34; to the wearer&#x27;s body chemistry.</li>
            <li>fabrics, to a certain degree.</li>
            <li>certainly.</li>
            <li>The smell just never gives up, and it smells like pure euphoria.</li>
            <li>(insert pamphlet is in Arabic, box and bottle in French) but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>and when I opened the atomizer, the white ring was smaller than what I found online, but turns out this is the newest batch and Creed has been changing the atomizer to the one in the album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smelled very weak at first, but after an hour it smells VERY pleasant and potent.</li>
            <li>I also have the Green Irish and is smell great.</li>
            <li>really upset about it there is no plastic around the box,</li>
            <li>At 7pm we each got ready</li>
            <li>I can take that much of a doubt...</li>
            <li>and i have the real deal and compared it.....</li>
            <li>I can say, yes this is real deal.</li>
            <li>Very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Just get the real thing ...</li>
            <li>The product is real and not a copy.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>(Gucci Intense, Curve,</li>
            <li>Did just that &amp; found it for a reasonable price as I thought.</li>
            <li>Its not the real thing.</li>
            <li>I purchase the real one at Neman&#x27;s 1oz $185.  </li>
            <li>but this one you can tell is the real thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like what I smelled so much</li>
            <li>It smells very manly with a smoky pineapple</li>
            <li>Sooooo much cheaper than buying at Neiman&#x27;s</li>
            <li>because their wasn&#x27;t that much cologne with that much effects out there like creed</li>
            <li>so I know what the real product looks, feels, and smells.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell the difference, to the point where I feel my saleswoman might have been mistaken.</li>
            <li>I still think I could have bought the real thing.</li>
            <li>and i do not sweat much at all.</li>
            <li>Everything seems real about the packaging.</li>
            <li>want the real thing for 190 dollars...</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know the difference between the real one and the counterfeit.</li>
            <li>It looks real to me.</li>
            <li>I guess one day I&#x27;ll buy straight from the company</li>
            <li>Smell real to me.</li>
            <li>All the hype over this scent is for real.  </li>
            <li>Mature, and masculine, and definitely unique.</li>
            <li>am just dissapointed that this isn&#x27;t anywhere as good as my other creed that includes the silver mountain water,green irish tweed</li>
            <li>the smell don&#x27;t last like the original.</li>
            <li>and if you are interested in a Creed product, pay the extra $100 and purchase it from a reputable retailer and not some third party vendor on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Its either an excellent reproduction or simply such an old foreign imported batch, that it just doesnt have that fresh run power anymore, but it simply does not last on the skin.</li>
            <li>Even the smell was unique and fantastic (although it did not last long).</li>
            <li>a low end Audi or bmwer is gonna make you special.</li>
            <li>I will only be wearing this for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>But cap was loose and the top note are completely gone</li>
            <li>If you do too, DO NOT buy this product--go to Neiman Marcus or another retailer and be ready to pay a little more money.</li>
            <li>Creed is ten times better at this price especially when its legit!</li>
            <li>Their items are a bit more expensive, but I, for one, will pay more for quality.</li>
            <li>The extra $100-$200 I would have had to pay to an elite perfumery will be spent on a nice evening out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was all smoky and actually seemed to be fading quickly.  </li>
            <li>Its a little more than I wanted to spend</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell great either and doesn&#x27;t last as long as suggested by other reviewers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update - After wearing this for the past three months, just about every female I know has commented on how good it smells and asks what it is.</li>
            <li>Despite all this, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s good enough to justify the price.</li>
            <li>I have other creeds and I smell them fine on me, however I could not smell Aventus.</li>
            <li>Because I wear Creed almost daily, Tom Ford being my other favorite I can say it is real...</li>
            <li>My bottle I received as a gift in May came right before another bottle gift from a French Colony.</li>
            <li>amazing, long lasting, My 3rd bottle..</li>
            <li>/&gt;After wearing Aventus, I almost feel like throwing my other colognes away, they just smell cheap and synthetic</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the box may not be the exact same thing that you would find on high end department stores in the US but the content itself is legit.</li>
            <li>For the price, I can live with that</li>
            <li>My suggestion is probably buy it from a reputable dealer in person and not from a dirty disneyland place like Dubai, online - where itseems most are receiving their product from.</li>
            <li>It is exactly the same product, packaging, smell etc...</li>
            <li>The cocky bastard simply said, \\&quot;it really works well with my skin.\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li>My girl didnt like it at first, but later she it grew on her, she loves the way I smell now.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s authentic or counterfeit</li>
            <li>I am a huge scent connoisseur and but I am not typically a Creed lover due to</li>
            <li>When you first spray this it will clear an entire room.</li>
            <li>and this is the only product that I have had a consistent problem with that was shipped directly from Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li>I am a man and Santal, Green Irish Tweed, Royal Oud, Aventis and Tom Ford Black Orchid, Nero Portofino, Rive D&#x27;Ambre are all exceptional!</li>
            <li>Buy a sample first and know what it smells like, and how long it lasts before you go ahead and buy online directly from amazon.</li>
            <li>This is by far the priciest cologne I&#x27;ve owned, but it is my official go to now</li>
            <li>and you have to call Amazon directly to deal with a customer service rep. who will keep you on hold for a while and grill you about the issue before issuing a refund.  </li>
            <li>To me it smells so masculine.  </li>
            <li>However the amazon purchases were COMPLETELY AUTHENTIC***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered my bottle from Amazon directly, assuming that it would be legit.</li>
            <li>and I actually ordered from this merchant before and got the real deal.</li>
            <li>Ever time he would come in,  the room will fill with the essence and could be smelled from far.</li>
            <li>I purchased directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I bought my bottle directly from Amazon, and it&#x27;s legit.</li>
            <li>For those of you who purchase a cologne because of its longevity - there is always Old Spice.</li>
            <li>It far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>This was a $200 purchase directly from amazon</li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>It does not fit the bottle and seems to be cheap</li>
            <li>did not expect deceit from Amazon (I bought directly from Amazon)!&lt;br /&gt;it is made somewhere in the United Arab Emirates, everywhere inside the package Arabic characters - on the passport, on the certificate.</li>
            <li>(meaning if I put the counterfeit on its fragrance won&#x27;t last as long as true Creed).</li>
            <li>because how I smell, it can be scary wearing this stuff, I had women say I smell good before</li>
            <li>alas,one of the other buyers was absolutely right,it just doesn&#x27;t look like the real thing after comparing it to the bottle on the Aventus website and it also came with a piece of paper with Arabic scrawled all over it.</li>
            <li>My first order came with 2 bottles of creed 4 oz in a small first rate package with no protection.  </li>
            <li>As a preface, my friend has the exact same cologne that he bought at a physical department store</li>
            <li>a few weeks with this cologne, I can easily say it&#x27;s definitely growing on me.  </li>
            <li>She said it won&#x27;t &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; as long as the real stuff</li>
            <li>The rep sprayed a sprits on my wrist so I could \\&quot;live with it\\&quot; before deciding to spend big dollars on it.</li>
            <li>The aroma from the bottle that I purchased at Saks lingered in my closet constantly, this new bottle the smell fades within hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is still a bit expensive, but it is definitely more reasonable with Amazon than the department stores.</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope they&#x27;re sending me a genuine one this time; else I will ask for my money back and just go buy the very expensive one through the Creed Boutique.</li>
            <li>The smell of the actual cologne smells like pure alcohol with a tiny mix of fragrance mixed in.</li>
            <li>There is a bar code and some description in French on the bottom and back of the box, also in high quality metallic print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>so they scratch the batch number off the bottle (which was BARELY visible when you put the bottle on it&#x27;s side).</li>
            <li>But if someone spent that much effort on duplicating a bottle, the cap and label -</li>
            <li>If they had to jerk off a bald eagle or whales as they did in the old days of Parfum making to make this stuff, that might be a different story.</li>
            <li>but theres no way of getting around that apparently.  </li>
            <li>but definitely still noticeable if you smell directly where it was applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, If you check the pictures of 4 oz Creed Aventus on Neiman Marcus or Creed Boutique you will realize that the \\&quot;Creed\\&quot; sign on the 4 oz bottle is in silver whereas on this bottle it is black.</li>
            <li>I sprayed a little on the day before work and for the first 3 hours it held up.</li>
            <li>Also, having worn this daily for about 4 months now, surprisingly I have not received a single compliment on it - that may be due to the lack of sillage and longevity or strength in this particular batch (if it is fake).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d just like to make people of aware of it though because this is not a cheap cologne.  </li>
            <li>Please keep in mind Creed atomizers are know for a heavy, consistent spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but then it also dries down very well after about an hour.</li>
            <li>Uhm if you are married or don&#x27;t want ugly women after you then this is not for you, no lie never ever had so many women after me</li>
            <li>It does fade after about thirty minutes and becomes something decent, but the initial attack is way too extreme.</li>
            <li>Last week I ordered Creed Aventus and I knew right away it is not authentic.</li>

            <li> My sister then said \\&quot;that is the best one you</li>
            <li> and probably to stay best for a while</li>
            <li> It does smell real good .</li>
            <li> Well, the description inside the box does shows Arabic letters but the smell is perfect.</li>
            <li> its awesome is all I can say.</li>
            <li> Into the evening I kept smelling the napkin and just kept thinking how awesome a fragrance this was.  </li>
            <li> but WOWZERS, I love AVENTUS!!!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the best of all Creeds but it is in the top 5!!</li>
            <li> Is the packaging beautiful?</li>
            <li> I have not tried this method with Buy D Best yet since I lucked out with a good batch.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good office fragrance because it can be distracting...in a wonderful way.  </li>
            <li> Creed Aventus smells awesome, I love it!</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, this is some great juice.</li>
            <li> Over all, I am happy with its quality for what I have paid.</li>
            <li> even at the end of the day I can no longer smell it people still compliment me and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Great smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spraying on my wrist it smells great.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still Aventus at a great price, and Amazon is taking care of it for me.</li>
            <li> I will not be happy with Amazon if I wake up tomorrow morning with carbuncles on my skin.</li>
            <li> Still a great smelling fragrance</li>
            <li> Great deal at a great price.</li>
            <li> Creed Aventus is a great cologne.</li>
            <li> Lots of complements and smells great.</li>
            <li> For those who care, my lot number was A42B11Y02, and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This was well packaged for shipping, arrived promptly and smells great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I chose to purchase from here.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smokey pineapple with great longevity and projection.  </li>
            <li> Great service great cologne</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> The projection isn&#x27;t something great at all.i</li>
            <li> Has a great smell.</li>
            <li> Smells great .</li>
            <li> Because, if u are, welcome to the masses if u think this cologne is going to make u stand out.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend was so happy to receive this for his birthday.</li>
            <li> Cologne smells GREAT.</li>
            <li> Base-notes of citrus or pineapple, very warm and tropical smelling.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing !</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a pleasant fragrance, but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too strong but a great scent!</li>
            <li> Authentic Creed at a very good price</li>
            <li> Not just a smell good contest.</li>
            <li> Bottomline, this is some good juice.</li>
            <li> Fifteen hours of longevity, persisting through activity and cigar smoke and still bearing that quality is why Creed Aventus is as good as you can get.</li>
            <li> And he loved it.</li>
            <li> Jeff Bezos, get someone on quality control for perfumes ASAP, this doesn&#x27;t look good AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Never knew anything could smell this good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it lasted a good while, maybe it wassensory adaptation after wearing it a while.</li>
            <li> is a good buy.</li>
            <li> and he loved this!&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I purchased at a good price (for a creed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However it is still a good cologne to have in your collection</li>
            <li> It projects a good four to six feet even after 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nevertheless she loved the Tobacco Vanille on me.</li>
            <li> Also, the hottest girl at work (age 27 Pakistani) loved it too</li>
            <li> The item was new,but it wasn&#x27;t sealed.it is good if you r going to use it,but I think for gift it needed to be sealed</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind that Creed is known for their superior product quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> One day I was at the store after work and the cashier told me my cologne smelled good.  </li>
            <li> It smelled incredible, still smoky but more refined, and very potent.  </li>
            <li> I own both the Aventus and Portugal by Creed and they are both AMAZING!</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with the gift.</li>
            <li> Cologne smells amazing, just like samples I got from Saks Fifth Ave, so I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne for my boyfriend and price is amazing !</li>
            <li> So many truly EXCELLENT and unique colognes at this price point.</li>
            <li> The good news is, Amazon being a great and honest company still gave me a full refund, knowing the product was a counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell is great, longevity is fine.</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing.  </li>
            <li> While smelling amazing</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product and accurate description.</li>
            <li> &amp; I said let me go to Amazon they have amazing prices.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and</li>
            <li> I have sampled Aventus before purchasing and I used to think the sample smelled amazing.</li>
            <li> what kind of eczema one could get from even spraying the darn thing.</li>
            <li> but I had smelled Creed before and knew I liked it</li>
            <li> I received the 4 oz bottle for my birthday and am thrilled.</li>
            <li> Six or seven women rose from their cubicles to discover the provenance of the holy smell.</li>
            <li> This cologne is truly unique and smells great.</li>
            <li> By far the best smelling cologne I own...</li>
            <li> However, to be fair, it is the real thing at a great price.</li>
            <li> Very strong even for one squirt.  </li>
            <li> My most treasured fragrance I own.</li>
            <li> its so great&lt;br /&gt;i receive it on a nice packaging and it comes safe</li>
            <li> Simply amazing women love this scent</li>
            <li> You will get your moneys worth out of this bottle and also a lot of compliments because it smells so great.</li>
            <li> I was concerned it wouldn&#x27;t be the real deal, but all seems well and good!  </li>
            <li> This is really good, I smelt every top colognes in the market and this one is still the king of Cologne, nothing even come close, very sophisticate yet pleasant.</li>
            <li> The real thing smells great, which was why I wanted to get my own</li>
            <li> The product is great and it was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> The cologne on first spray smells great.  </li>
            <li> After paying hundreds more at Nordstrom I gave Amazon a try</li>
            <li> this one is my top 2 in the creed line, my ladies cant resist on complementing me on it.</li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> The most I&#x27;ve ever paid for a fragrance</li>
            <li> The women love Creed Aventus.</li>
            <li> The cologne I have received smells mostly like alcohol and some plantlike, musky smell, not Aventus.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> After seeing some of the reviews here, I was worried about whether or not the thing is authentic.</li>
            <li> Now if we come to the juice itself, i think it is just phenomenal.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i bought this and verified for myself.</li>
            <li> Ok so I purchase this and it has an Arabic paper inside instead of the creed one.</li>
            <li> Thank God I purchased Aventus through a reputable company.</li>
            <li> Love this Aventus smell as they quit making Woods by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch which was my signature smell.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want too many people smelling like me.  </li>
            <li> 8-)  </li>
            <li> Many tell me they can smell the fragrance hours after i have applied it.  </li>
            <li> fils depuis 1760&amp;#34; with two Creed family members printed on top surrounded by gold metallic print.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Elegant without being overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So many compliments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  OK</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to tell how many compliments I received since I purchased Creed.</li>
            <li> Unlike most Creeds, this is an unquestionable powerhouse on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have many Creed fragrances</li>
            <li> but this one is my favorite</li>
            <li> , i was a bit concerned to buy this one on Amazon after reading many reviews</li>
            <li> Never in my life have I received so many compliments on my &#x27;perfume&#x27; ...</li>
            <li> It is, in fact, authentic.</li>
            <li> will be enjoying the scent all day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than Aventus</li>
            <li> Wore it to work and received many compliments, \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> : I spray myself one more time yesterday to try again, and again, nothing.</li>
            <li> I was told by as many as six</li>
            <li> yeah the women love it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> have never gotten so many compliments on any cologne I ever had.</li>
            <li> and when I saw the discounted rate on Amazon (after weighing that there were more 5star reviews then 1 or 2 star) I thought I would take a chance.</li>
            <li> Even though the bottle and atomizer seem authentic, it smells of gas when it is applied</li>
            <li> My mom and sister (age: 24) also love it.</li>
            <li> gets me more compliments than L&#x27;eau D&#x27;Issey, which was my reigning champ until I bought Creed&#x27;s Millesime Imperial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some ppl complain about creed because of the price,i am not doing that because i actually love the house of creed and my #1 cologne</li>
            <li> 30mins.this is more so</li>
            <li> Be safe with it</li>
            <li> Now Im like i got to have it :)</li>
            <li> I do notice this cologne being a more sophisticated product ..</li>
            <li> I love this cologne ..  </li>
            <li> women love it ..  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any pineapple/citrus in the top notes.</li>
            <li> Please make sure you buy from a reputable vendor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for a while now, mostly to work</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: 10/10, don&#x27;t hesitate, this is a great cologne for year round wear and definitely unique at a great price here!</li>
            <li> My favorite mens cologne.came in nice original box</li>
            <li> It was great at first, but then got too sweet, and eventually gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> If you google search for good batch numbers, you can request it through certain vendors.  </li>
            <li> I have been fortunate to have been the recipient of many colognes as gifts over the years.</li>
            <li> I hope I can enjoy it like I enjoy Original Santal, GIT, MI, Le Labo Bergamote 22, Rose 31, Bond no9 Bleecker Street, and my signature Hermes Terre d&#x27;Hermes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very nice and masculine fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It is sophisticated, sporty and unique.</li>
            <li> Neiman Marcus or Creed Boutique are best, but there are other legit online dealers.  </li>
            <li> This cologne is way too strong and overpowering.  </li>
            <li> the essence in this perfume is not as strong.</li>
            <li> (6) women, strangers, that smells nice, or you smell good and a couple of them were with a male partner.</li>
            <li> I checked out this fragrance at a department store, and it is quite strong.</li>
            <li> Creed is an average fragrance at best.</li>
            <li> I can honestly still sometimes smell creed on my clothes after I&#x27;ve washed them on a hot cycle with detergent.</li>
            <li> best cologne hands down.</li>
            <li> It was a new batch, one of the good ones, being sold in an arabic speaking country</li>
            <li> Weomen seem to like it fine, what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I pleasantly woke up around 10am with her head on my chest, pretty eyes looking up at me, and the first thing she said that morning was \\&quot;You smell amazing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell very masculine love</li>
            <li> EXACTLY THE SAME, WAYYY BETTER PRICE!!!</li>
            <li> It smells like someone peeled out in a semi over a huge pile of pineapples.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the deliverer is so fast and the perfume is so nice</li>
            <li> The box was precise as is all its packaging.</li>
            <li> Would the authentic one be worth $150.</li>
            <li> The frangrance is fairly light when it dries.  </li>
            <li> box from Creed is supremely well detailed.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I can enjoy the scent like everyone around me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have to use three sprays to enjoy..</li>
            <li> Not eve worth keeping for free though, not the Creed I know and love from Neiman Marcus.</li>
            <li> But man this stuff must smell really good because I had a couple co-works ask me to come near so they could share the scent with someone they told about</li>
            <li> Its the real deal!!!</li>
            <li> ,i really do feel that one is just as light now,it used to be great when the bottle was gold color,the new one is just to light for me</li>
            <li> Aventus has a very distinct scent to it, which is why it smells so unique and costs $200.  </li>
            <li> its not the original.</li>
            <li> i had to go to neiman markus to buy the original</li>
            <li> , the bottle and the box seems to be original.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> Friendly price compared to Mega retailers and authorized boutiques.</li>
            <li> The product is not the original.</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a unique scent that no one else is wearing.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a sign that this juice is worth the $$!</li>
            <li> If they could bottle the tears of Zeus, I&#x27;m pretty sure this would be it.</li>
            <li> It is truly a unique fragrance and you (and others)</li>
            <li> But the air was full of Aventus for all to enjoy.</li>
            <li> but so worth it!</li>
            <li> There is no sillage with this precise Parfum I bought, as has been touted by many regarding the real deal.</li>
            <li> theres a good possibility you may be meeting a couple of them at every social gathering in 2013.</li>
            <li> I cannot say for certain if this purchase was authentic or not.</li>
            <li> Someone special purchased a 1 oz bottle of Creed Aventus for me some months ago.</li>
            <li> Once you find the right scent for your body type, you won&#x27;t go anywhere else!</li>
            <li> I was super excited about the Aventus colonge by Creed when I sprayed some on me in Saks fifth Ave.</li>
            <li> Sweet but not fruity.</li>
            <li> Many of the feedback doubted its origin as real</li>
            <li> Does not stay more than a couple of hours and does not smell like a real one.</li>
            <li> For the price you pay for this I would just get it from a department store to be sure it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Also my co-workers again informed me how much they enjoyed the scent...</li>
            <li> I LOVE TOBACCO VANILLE but have never smelled the MUCH cheaper L&#x27;Occitane.</li>
            <li> It is unique and due to its price, many people don&#x27;t own this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was also quick.</li>
            <li> I watched several videos on the internet with authentic Creed box openings and how to spot a legit package, and yes this is authentic</li>
            <li> The item came as described and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it and the ladies absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> The price was GREAT half the price of what I could of paid in the store.</li>
            <li> The scent is good on first spray and for about 10 mins later and thats about it.</li>
            <li> Since using Creed, every single person I&#x27;ve come within hugging distance of, has said something about how good I smell.</li>
            <li> I should of known to good to be true, the smell is is not the same as the real creed aventus.  </li>
            <li> I can safely say - that tiny sprits lasted easily 8 hrs and was intoxicating, even as it faded.</li>
            <li> a lot, its a very classy sexy powerful orgasmic scent.</li>
            <li> Ladies tell me I smell sexy and manly (ages 19 - 46) and even my father (who&#x27;s one of those tough old school Clint Eastwood types) says it&#x27;s the best one he&#x27;s smelled.</li>
            <li> Creed really stands out letting people know that is not a cologne you just buy on a Duty Free Airport.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li> Complete Quality fragrance love</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price point because it lasts.  </li>
            <li> the juice is so fresh</li>
            <li> It smells like cheap oil or to be precise, a VERY diluted form of the real thing doused with vegetable oil.</li>
            <li> Is it worth $350.</li>
            <li> YES, this is 100% authentic Creed cologne, provided you buy from AMAZON directly (should say Prime eligible if you are a Prime member).</li>
            <li> Authentic Creed Aventus (from Amazon direct).  </li>
            <li> bought this after Millesime Imperial and was surprised that Aventus gets me even more compliments.</li>
            <li> you want to smell like a burned pineapple pizza, have fun.</li>
            <li> A sophisticated mature gentleman&#x27;s  cologne.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it....</li>
            <li> Smelling the bottle again I got hints of fresh pineapple.  </li>
            <li> However, after years of dominating the market since 2010, there are a lot of Aventus clones out there to beat the Aventus incredulous price, Insurrection Pure II by Rayane Tradition is one of the best, the top notes is different from Aventus and smells very synthetic, but when the middle and basenotes kicks in(about 15 mins), it smells exactly like Aventus, for people who doesn&#x27;t smell a lot of cologne they can&#x27;t discern between Aventus and Insurrection Pure II.</li>
            <li> There are other colognes out there that smell similar to Aventus but none of them perform or smell as awesome.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll get you lucky ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now convinced they are right on amazon.</li>
            <li> Strong and masculine taste!</li>
            <li> Creeds scents are masculine, clean, sophisticated    Cons: I was introduced to this by a female who couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about it</li>
            <li> If you buy from amazon directly and not a 3rd party seller on amazon you can be confident you will get authentic</li>
            <li> I say buy from either Neiman and Marcus or Lucky Scent which are both official retailers that you know you&#x27;re getting the real deal.  </li>
            <li> This is a highly sought after cologne and if you&#x27;re not paying full price odds are you are being duped.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting, good for work and those special occasions!Give it</li>
            <li> This product has the old creed sprayer thats huge still..</li>
            <li> Ok this is not a review of what the seller is receiving from anyone on Amazon, but of the actual cologne itself.  </li>
            <li> Fast overseas shipping!</li>
            <li> I am 24 and have had a massive crush on a stunning girl since sophomore year of college.</li>
            <li> but it is my go to when I am dressing up for a romantic or sophisticated evening.</li>
            <li> Purchase this product in person from a local retailer to make sure you are getting the real stuff!</li>
            <li> but it smells exactly like the sample I got a while ago.</li>
            <li> The only thing that worries me is that the cap doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on and that the edge of the label started to lift off - ok</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Thanks everyone !</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t  smell like the one I first smelled  on a guy where I worked  at.</li>
            <li> so the parfum concentration is higher than the Eau de Toilette.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> It also took a couple of weeks more to receive the 2nd replacement bottle.</li>
            <li> where I go I get so many compliments and the smell last for hours.</li>
            <li> This is a must for the guy that wants to be noticed!</li>
            <li> I got it as a birthday gift and instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the real thing!</li>
            <li> I love Tobacco Vanille but my female friend</li>
            <li> my conclusion is that they might have reduced the potency of their cologne just like christian dior fahreheit is no longer that potent anymore</li>
            <li> Long lasting, great scent</li>
            <li> The first day I recieved it colonge</li>
            <li> When I first smelled this, I sprayed it on a napkin.  </li>
            <li> This is real man&#x27;s cologne!  </li>
            <li> I reckon the only way one can be sure is if one has the real thing to compare with.</li>
            <li> The top plastic protector over the spray nozzle is also thick plastic, with some metallic silver crown logo or seal, also on par with what was seen in my authentic bottle investigation online.</li>
            <li> and it is still pretty much out there making itself noticed...</li>
            <li> first this scent smelled very strong to me, almost overwhelming, but a few minutes later I began to like it</li>
            <li> The real authentic stuff that is fresh will cost more, but should last you 2-3x as long, as it will take less to promote the scent and have longevity when worn.</li>
            <li> The box and the bottle look way too original and detailed that I really don&#x27;t think thief will spent so much money creating an exact copy.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, and I got a compliment less than 10 minutes after putting it on.</li>
            <li> The scents are long lasting, good quality ingredients and the cologne &amp;#34;adapts&amp;#34; to the wearer&#x27;s body chemistry.</li>
            <li> fabrics, to a certain degree.</li>
            <li> certainly.</li>
            <li> The smell just never gives up, and it smells like pure euphoria.</li>
            <li> (insert pamphlet is in Arabic, box and bottle in French) but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> and when I opened the atomizer, the white ring was smaller than what I found online, but turns out this is the newest batch and Creed has been changing the atomizer to the one in the album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smelled very weak at first, but after an hour it smells VERY pleasant and potent.</li>
            <li> I also have the Green Irish and is smell great.</li>
            <li> really upset about it there is no plastic around the box,</li>
            <li> At 7pm we each got ready</li>
            <li> I can take that much of a doubt...</li>
            <li> and i have the real deal and compared it.....</li>
            <li> I can say, yes this is real deal.</li>
            <li> Very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Just get the real thing ...</li>
            <li> The product is real and not a copy.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> (Gucci Intense, Curve,</li>
            <li> Did just that &amp; found it for a reasonable price as I thought.</li>
            <li> Its not the real thing.</li>
            <li> I purchase the real one at Neman&#x27;s 1oz $185.  </li>
            <li> but this one you can tell is the real thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like what I smelled so much</li>
            <li> It smells very manly with a smoky pineapple</li>
            <li> Sooooo much cheaper than buying at Neiman&#x27;s</li>
            <li> because their wasn&#x27;t that much cologne with that much effects out there like creed</li>
            <li> so I know what the real product looks, feels, and smells.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell the difference, to the point where I feel my saleswoman might have been mistaken.</li>
            <li> I still think I could have bought the real thing.</li>
            <li> and i do not sweat much at all.</li>
            <li> Everything seems real about the packaging.</li>
            <li> want the real thing for 190 dollars...</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know the difference between the real one and the counterfeit.</li>
            <li> It looks real to me.</li>
            <li> I guess one day I&#x27;ll buy straight from the company</li>
            <li> Smell real to me.</li>
            <li> All the hype over this scent is for real.  </li>
            <li> Mature, and masculine, and definitely unique.</li>
            <li> am just dissapointed that this isn&#x27;t anywhere as good as my other creed that includes the silver mountain water,green irish tweed</li>
            <li> the smell don&#x27;t last like the original.</li>
            <li> and if you are interested in a Creed product, pay the extra $100 and purchase it from a reputable retailer and not some third party vendor on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Its either an excellent reproduction or simply such an old foreign imported batch, that it just doesnt have that fresh run power anymore, but it simply does not last on the skin.</li>
            <li> Even the smell was unique and fantastic (although it did not last long).</li>
            <li> a low end Audi or bmwer is gonna make you special.</li>
            <li> I will only be wearing this for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> But cap was loose and the top note are completely gone</li>
            <li> If you do too, DO NOT buy this product--go to Neiman Marcus or another retailer and be ready to pay a little more money.</li>
            <li> Creed is ten times better at this price especially when its legit!</li>
            <li> Their items are a bit more expensive, but I, for one, will pay more for quality.</li>
            <li> The extra $100-$200 I would have had to pay to an elite perfumery will be spent on a nice evening out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was all smoky and actually seemed to be fading quickly.  </li>
            <li> Its a little more than I wanted to spend</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell great either and doesn&#x27;t last as long as suggested by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update - After wearing this for the past three months, just about every female I know has commented on how good it smells and asks what it is.</li>
            <li> Despite all this, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s good enough to justify the price.</li>
            <li> I have other creeds and I smell them fine on me, however I could not smell Aventus.</li>
            <li> Because I wear Creed almost daily, Tom Ford being my other favorite I can say it is real...</li>
            <li> My bottle I received as a gift in May came right before another bottle gift from a French Colony.</li>
            <li> amazing, long lasting, My 3rd bottle..</li>
            <li> /&gt;After wearing Aventus, I almost feel like throwing my other colognes away, they just smell cheap and synthetic</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the box may not be the exact same thing that you would find on high end department stores in the US but the content itself is legit.</li>
            <li> For the price, I can live with that</li>
            <li> My suggestion is probably buy it from a reputable dealer in person and not from a dirty disneyland place like Dubai, online - where itseems most are receiving their product from.</li>
            <li> It is exactly the same product, packaging, smell etc...</li>
            <li> The cocky bastard simply said, \\&quot;it really works well with my skin.\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li> My girl didnt like it at first, but later she it grew on her, she loves the way I smell now.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s authentic or counterfeit</li>
            <li> I am a huge scent connoisseur and but I am not typically a Creed lover due to</li>
            <li> When you first spray this it will clear an entire room.</li>
            <li> and this is the only product that I have had a consistent problem with that was shipped directly from Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li> I am a man and Santal, Green Irish Tweed, Royal Oud, Aventis and Tom Ford Black Orchid, Nero Portofino, Rive D&#x27;Ambre are all exceptional!</li>
            <li> Buy a sample first and know what it smells like, and how long it lasts before you go ahead and buy online directly from amazon.</li>
            <li> This is by far the priciest cologne I&#x27;ve owned, but it is my official go to now</li>
            <li> and you have to call Amazon directly to deal with a customer service rep. who will keep you on hold for a while and grill you about the issue before issuing a refund.  </li>
            <li> To me it smells so masculine.  </li>
            <li> However the amazon purchases were COMPLETELY AUTHENTIC***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered my bottle from Amazon directly, assuming that it would be legit.</li>
            <li> and I actually ordered from this merchant before and got the real deal.</li>
            <li> Ever time he would come in,  the room will fill with the essence and could be smelled from far.</li>
            <li> I purchased directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought my bottle directly from Amazon, and it&#x27;s legit.</li>
            <li> For those of you who purchase a cologne because of its longevity - there is always Old Spice.</li>
            <li> It far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> This was a $200 purchase directly from amazon</li>
            <li> wow...</li>
            <li> It does not fit the bottle and seems to be cheap</li>
            <li> did not expect deceit from Amazon (I bought directly from Amazon)!&lt;br /&gt;it is made somewhere in the United Arab Emirates, everywhere inside the package Arabic characters - on the passport, on the certificate.</li>
            <li> (meaning if I put the counterfeit on its fragrance won&#x27;t last as long as true Creed).</li>
            <li> because how I smell, it can be scary wearing this stuff, I had women say I smell good before</li>
            <li> alas,one of the other buyers was absolutely right,it just doesn&#x27;t look like the real thing after comparing it to the bottle on the Aventus website and it also came with a piece of paper with Arabic scrawled all over it.</li>
            <li> My first order came with 2 bottles of creed 4 oz in a small first rate package with no protection.  </li>
            <li> As a preface, my friend has the exact same cologne that he bought at a physical department store</li>
            <li> a few weeks with this cologne, I can easily say it&#x27;s definitely growing on me.  </li>
            <li> She said it won&#x27;t &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; as long as the real stuff</li>
            <li> The rep sprayed a sprits on my wrist so I could \\&quot;live with it\\&quot; before deciding to spend big dollars on it.</li>
            <li> The aroma from the bottle that I purchased at Saks lingered in my closet constantly, this new bottle the smell fades within hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is still a bit expensive, but it is definitely more reasonable with Amazon than the department stores.</li>
            <li> I sincerely hope they&#x27;re sending me a genuine one this time; else I will ask for my money back and just go buy the very expensive one through the Creed Boutique.</li>
            <li> The smell of the actual cologne smells like pure alcohol with a tiny mix of fragrance mixed in.</li>
            <li> There is a bar code and some description in French on the bottom and back of the box, also in high quality metallic print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> so they scratch the batch number off the bottle (which was BARELY visible when you put the bottle on it&#x27;s side).</li>
            <li> But if someone spent that much effort on duplicating a bottle, the cap and label -</li>
            <li> If they had to jerk off a bald eagle or whales as they did in the old days of Parfum making to make this stuff, that might be a different story.</li>
            <li> but theres no way of getting around that apparently.  </li>
            <li> but definitely still noticeable if you smell directly where it was applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, If you check the pictures of 4 oz Creed Aventus on Neiman Marcus or Creed Boutique you will realize that the \\&quot;Creed\\&quot; sign on the 4 oz bottle is in silver whereas on this bottle it is black.</li>
            <li> I sprayed a little on the day before work and for the first 3 hours it held up.</li>
            <li> Also, having worn this daily for about 4 months now, surprisingly I have not received a single compliment on it - that may be due to the lack of sillage and longevity or strength in this particular batch (if it is fake).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just like to make people of aware of it though because this is not a cheap cologne.  </li>
            <li> Please keep in mind Creed atomizers are know for a heavy, consistent spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but then it also dries down very well after about an hour.</li>
            <li> Uhm if you are married or don&#x27;t want ugly women after you then this is not for you, no lie never ever had so many women after me</li>
            <li> It does fade after about thirty minutes and becomes something decent, but the initial attack is way too extreme.</li>
            <li> Last week I ordered Creed Aventus and I knew right away it is not authentic.</li>
            <li> If I get another grey market bottle I&#x27;ll likely just stick with it since I&#x27;ve still got the real deal, albeit one with missing numbers.</li>
            <li> In reality, I simply walked past the living room straight to my brother&#x27;s bedroom.</li>
            <li> and it just does not smell the same and does not last as long.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind Creed has changed their sprayers on the newr Aventus and Green Irish Tweed as I bought 2 bottles from Nieman Marcus to compare to and one had the new spayer and was informed its brand new from creed and is supposed to leak less than the mammoth spayers...</li>
            <li> The atomizer itself is wobbly and sprays very little and is very wobbly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product I purchased on Amazon was the real thing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I was led to believe.</li>
            <li> Long lasting - yes,</li>
            <li> Long story short.</li>
            <li> Strange for a French cologne sold by a US retailer, no?</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make a long story short, do yourself a favor</li>
            <li> Not too long lasting but</li>
            <li> One squirt will last a very long time so you dont have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the fact that it is very very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Couple those traits with the Arabic packaging, and it&#x27;s easy to see why this might appear to be a fake.</li>
            <li> Make a long story short, I found out my bottle is from the \\&quot;grey market\\&quot;, if you don&#x27;t know what that is, look it up.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have stated it smells different and doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Guys get this one even blind buy, it&#x27;s fantastic... for those that need to read it,</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 1 months time and the smell does not remain long after use.  </li>
            <li> So it must stay on the skin for a long time.  </li>
            <li> According to several users on Basenotes, this is to be expected from this batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time (even after a shower) and projects.</li>
            <li> Rather than on the bottom lip or directly on the bottom of the bottle it was faintly etched on the glass, right where the black wrap ends on the back.</li>
            <li> weak like all creed fragances, and funny container or bottle.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The cologne lasts a very long time</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time</li>
            <li> but that will be in a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cap on the bottle is loose.</li>
            <li> also a little goes a long way so a bottle will last.  </li>
            <li> under cap it should have white atomizer spray thingy under black cap.</li>
            <li> I usually would prefer to sample a fragrance prior to purchasing especially if it&#x27;s $200.  </li>
            <li> I owned this cologne previously and know it last longer than 30 minutes...</li>
            <li> Probably the biggest giveaway is the the &amp;#34;CREED&amp;#34; symbol on the actual bottle is colored black, but the paint on the letter E is peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed given the cost of the product and the general strong reliability of Amazon.</li>
            <li> so all u get is this sickly bitter birch mix with black current...</li>
            <li> and I expected the cologne to actually smell like something after half an hour..</li>
            <li> When I opened the packaging, the cap wasn&#x27;t even 100% tightly in place, which is a red flag for an unopened product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> Seems very hard to fake this kind of craftsmanship and care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The number at the bottom of the back of the bottle is very hard to read (almost completely transparent), but it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the package did not come with the plastic seal from the outside of the box, little fragrance contains a lot of alcohol</li>
            <li> Keep your money and blind buy Insurrection Pure II only cost 24 dollars for 3oz, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> For the price Amazon charges, there is no reason not to buy this fragrance through them, it&#x27;s a great product and an insane bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> However, it seems doesn&#x27;t last as long as batch Z01 that I got from a decant in the past.  </li>
            <li> Buying such an expensive cologne in this format made me really nervous</li>
            <li> and I was curious</li>
            <li> no, there is no ingredient in there that is rare or difficult to obtain.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I am amazed that those people who comment on the international writing as some proof that this product is not genuine or made for the \\&quot;Arabic Market.\\&quot;  Creed was founded in 1760 in FRANCE</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be updating this message and the one I did for Green Irish Tweed</li>
            <li> Read the sites reviews and be careful.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this one.  </li>
            <li> I mean love it to the point I have random women in the street</li>
            <li> First, to clear up some concerns I had personally being my first time ever purchasing cologne (especially as expensive as Creed) online and seeing some reviewers claiming this is not authentic Creed cologne.</li>
            <li> Grey market bottles are not imitations, just untraceable ones from what I read last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told Amazon, and they are sending me another bottle in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> disappointed cause I could have spent that 171.00 dollars with 145 dollars more bought it out of Saks.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a LONG way</li>
            <li> They will explain the boxes and inserts and labels to show batch numbers and other ways to tell that the bottle you have isn&#x27;t legit.  </li>
            <li> I have other Creed products that i purchased at Dept stores</li>
            <li> /&gt;To compare it with other colognes I&#x27;ve had, I would say it&#x27;s a mixture of Ralph Lauren Polo and Kenneth Cole Reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as shown from the other buyer&#x27;s pictures.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the depth and complexity of the scent until I compared it to some other colognes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost a pungent smell due to the alcohol content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thought I got a fake at first because the batch number was S042 which I&#x27;ve never seen before</li>
            <li> I asked a woman what she thought after getting no complements (i get complements on other colognes)</li>
            <li> But after reading through multiple reviews and since the Nieman Marcus near me was sold out, I made an exception and went through with the blind</li>
            <li> One spray fills up an entire room and it&#x27;s not a very pleasant odor either.</li>
            <li> So 4 stars, because it&#x27;s not entirely right</li>
            <li> This cologne is known to have bad batches which I wasn&#x27;t aware of prior to my purchase.  </li>
            <li> heavy, thick glass and feels like it was well thought out (as silly as that may sound).</li>
            <li> The gift was ordered in mid January and was late getting here.</li>
            <li> why i am thinking that just maybe i was infactuated with their perfumes back in late 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Upon opening the package I can say with absolute, 100% certainty that it is a fake product.</li>
            <li> It seems to be like a watered down version.</li>
            <li> Of course there will be other languages on the packaging!</li>
            <li> The second one was shipped back again with poor packaging in a small padded envelope.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Creed Aventus for the last 5 years and the last 2 bottles that were shipped to me from Amazon were either fake or spoiled.  </li>
            <li> but the smell is not what I like, slightly chemical.</li>
            <li> The bottles that I saw on the internet have black digital-clock-like lot numbers says:</li>
            <li> Creed logo is black, inserts in Arabic, etc.</li>
            <li> : On my bottle the lot code was in an odd location.</li>
            <li> but this stuff makes them aggressive, I seriously had no clue that was possible.</li>
            <li> After that smell was very shallow and had almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasent tabacco scent when dried down.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is not original.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this product ,not original</li>
            <li> Lots of Apple/pineapple and little bit of smokiness.</li>
            <li> But after smelling the newest bottle, the sample one smells a little too smokey.</li>
            <li> It is probably a little too \\&quot;smoky\\&quot; for me.</li>
            <li> I sprayed a little on my wrist the night before bed.</li>
            <li> Box was missing the Creed Card in the inside, but who cares about a card?</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t noticed a note missing or anything like that.</li>
            <li> few hours go by and it fades.</li>
            <li> THis is only because your NOSE GETS TIRED.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money.</li>
            <li> That is why I went for another one when the last bottle was exhausted.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money buying this product from pickyourpefume.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments while I was wearing the sample.</li>
            <li> The $100 less difference was too hard to pass up</li>
            <li> This stuff projects like crazy and is very loud.</li>
            <li> The Cologne Has An Heavy odor Not Suitable for men under 50.</li>
            <li> Now to everyone buying this, be forewarned that this cologne (especially the Aventus line) has a lot of Fake bottles on the market.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s sucks and waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think a small one oz is around that price maybe cheaper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too lazy to go get the bottle to provide you with the serial number.</li>
            <li> Packaging all wrong, scent different, embossment on bottle messed up.  </li>
            <li> and I can tell it is not authentic</li>
            <li> The scent is  unbelievable.</li>
            <li> opening the box you see a small card board stock that says &amp;#34;more than two hundred years of experience&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> no more words to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so unfortunate and frustrating that I spent such an amount for this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure whether it is amazon&#x27;s improper storage of the cologne that affected the smell.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product and waited anxiously for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> how hard would it be to obtain a number and ink it onto the bottle.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t panic if it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> but my husband has hardly used it since then.</li>
            <li> this is a bad product, not original, the smell does not last anything</li>
            <li> at least my experience.</li>
            <li> At least $230-250 on these sites.</li>
            <li> I found at least 5 things from the fonts to the texture of the bottle</li>
            <li> Needless to say for the $$$ it is not worth it....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous</li>
            <li> Everything I read online said that if the batch is missing it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> no original code in the bottom of the bottle, instant smell, very bad packaging......</li>
            <li> I thought it was a fake :/ because others say it lasts like 8-12 hours</li>
            <li> My nose must be broken because the compliments kept coming for five hours then it must have become a close to the skin because they came after a hug.</li>
            <li> for me this is a bad product, not original</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real, at least the one I received is.</li>
            <li> nothing fake about it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this fake product in amazon and still has five stars!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife thinks it smells stale and musty, but the fragrance does not have an expiration date listed.  </li>
            <li> So, Amazon gets 5 stars for customer service, 1 star for selling a fake with Arabic writing, wrong color of the Creed emblem and inferior box and printing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is one advice I can suggest for skeptical customers.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one is nothing close to what I know of Creed Aventus.</li>
            <li> unfortunately amazon does not allow you to return cologne either...</li>
            <li> i should have bought this in the 2.50z and the royal oud in the 4.0 oz.i blind bought this based on reviews on the net.i can&#x27;t smell it even after 2hrs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, I fell for it and bought a fake product.</li>
            <li> t&#x3D;does keep a faint smell after 4 hours .</li>
            <li> I thought I had a fake on my hands.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive, don&#x27;t get ripped off!  </li>
            <li> can not tell you my disappointment and anger.</li>
            <li> This thing is a BLOODY fake.</li>
            <li> smells really bad like bacon oil...</li>
            <li> You cannot return colognes which is the bad news.  </li>
            <li> I told the saleswoman at the mall that I felt bad for showcasing Aventus with her and buying it online, but I saved $150 by getting it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed if you purchase this product.</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Image album: [...]&lt;</li>
            <li> Succulent pineapple notes and a heady base of birch and oakmoss.</li>
            <li> Are we so culture-centric that we have become idiots?</li>
            <li> I hated this cologne, smells like citrus and bathroom cleaner.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This purchase was terrible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Creed is a culture! Not just a smell good contest. After paying hundreds more at Nordstrom I gave Amazon a try Creed Santal was the purchase. Because I wear Creed almost daily, Tom Ford being my other favorite I can say it is real...at least my experience. I am a man and Santal, Green Irish Tweed, Royal Oud, Aventis and Tom Ford Black Orchid, Nero Portofino, Rive D&#x27;Ambre are all exceptional!</li>
            <li> this one is my top 2 in the creed line, my ladies cant resist on complementing me on it. Awesome</li>
            <li> Ok this is not a review of what the seller is receiving from anyone on Amazon, but of the actual cologne itself.  This scent is amazing.  I purchased a bottle from Neiman Marcus for around $325 on sale for the 4 oz size.  The cologne lasts a very long time and I get so many compliments on it.  This is by far the priciest cologne I&#x27;ve owned, but it is my official go to now and I will stick with it...also a little goes a long way so a bottle will last.  Now to everyone buying this, be forewarned that this cologne (especially the Aventus line) has a lot of Fake bottles on the market.  Even official retailers online have been accused and proven to sell fakes.  If you want to learn how to tell the difference check videos on Youtube.  They will explain the boxes and inserts and labels to show batch numbers and other ways to tell that the bottle you have isn&#x27;t legit.  This is a highly sought after cologne and if you&#x27;re not paying full price odds are you are being duped.  I say buy from either Neiman and Marcus or Lucky Scent which are both official retailers that you know you&#x27;re getting the real deal.  It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Fast overseas shipping! great cologne!</li>
            <li> My favorite mens cologne.came in nice original box</li>
            <li> Holy moly. The most I&#x27;ve ever paid for a fragrance but WOWZERS, I love AVENTUS!!! My most treasured fragrance I own. Creed is the bomb.period</li>
            <li> I thought about it a lot when buying the cologne, but I definitely don&#x27;t regret my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The Creed Aventus smells awesome, I love it!</li>
            <li> its not the original. the smell don&#x27;t last like the original. i had to go to neiman markus to buy the original and i made the comparison</li>
            <li> Got mine yesterday. Its the real deal!!! nothing fake about it. It lasts a very long time and I&#x27;ve already gotten several compliments since yesterday! I sprayed 2 sprays on yesterday afternoon, then later that night I took a shower. It is now 5:30 am the following day and I can still smell it. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Best fragrance,you can smell it miles away,complement from everyone,great price,recommend it if you want to make a statement of yourself?</li>
            <li> Purchased this one from a third party seller. Box was missing the Creed Card in the inside, but who cares about a card? Bottomline, this is some good juice. As a matter of fact, this is some great juice. The women love Creed Aventus. It isn&#x27;t the best of all Creeds but it is in the top 5!!</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne I think I have ever used. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> for me this is a bad product, not original, the smell does not last anything, I apply three times in the day&lt;br /&gt;the package did not come with the plastic seal from the outside of the box, little fragrance contains a lot of alcohol</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this fake product in amazon and still has five stars!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really upset about it there is no plastic around the box, no original code in the bottom of the bottle, instant smell, very bad packaging......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sucks and waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy it don&#x27;t buy it don&#x27;t buy it don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I am 24 and have had a massive crush on a stunning girl since sophomore year of college. Over the summer I convinced her to come to NYC with me and stay two nights so we could explore the city a bit. At 7pm we each got ready and I put on my Aventus. I took her to a rooftop bar for dinner and the sunset then walked her halfway up the city to Central Park and wandered around there until about 1am talking and joking around while sharing a cigar. Eventually we walked back to our hotel room and did our thing for about two hours or so before falling asleep. I pleasantly woke up around 10am with her head on my chest, pretty eyes looking up at me, and the first thing she said that morning was \\&quot;You smell amazing\\&quot;. Fifteen hours of longevity, persisting through activity and cigar smoke and still bearing that quality is why Creed Aventus is as good as you can get. Buy this bottle. It has excellent projection as well but is designed for a date or night out setting. While smelling amazing I wouldn&#x27;t wear this day to day or to work but it is my go to when I am dressing up for a romantic or sophisticated evening.</li>
            <li> Weomen seem to like it fine, what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I hated this cologne, smells like citrus and bathroom cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is really good, I smelt every top colognes in the market and this one is still the king of Cologne, nothing even come close, very sophisticate yet pleasant. However, after years of dominating the market since 2010, there are a lot of Aventus clones out there to beat the Aventus incredulous price, Insurrection Pure II by Rayane Tradition is one of the best, the top notes is different from Aventus and smells very synthetic, but when the middle and basenotes kicks in(about 15 mins), it smells exactly like Aventus, for people who doesn&#x27;t smell a lot of cologne they can&#x27;t discern between Aventus and Insurrection Pure II. Keep your money and blind buy Insurrection Pure II only cost 24 dollars for 3oz, you won&#x27;t regret it. Creed, your monopoly is over, time to reduce the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Creed Aventus for the last 5 years and the last 2 bottles that were shipped to me from Amazon were either fake or spoiled.  Aventus has a very distinct scent to it, which is why it smells so unique and costs $200.  The cologne I have received smells mostly like alcohol and some plantlike, musky smell, not Aventus.  Beware as they will not let you return it and you have to call Amazon directly to deal with a customer service rep. who will keep you on hold for a while and grill you about the issue before issuing a refund.  I&#x27;ve been an Amazon customer for years and this is the only product that I have had a consistent problem with that was shipped directly from Amazon Prime.  Purchase this product in person from a local retailer to make sure you are getting the real stuff!</li>
            <li> amazing, long lasting, My 3rd bottle..</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne. To me it smells so masculine.  However, it seems doesn&#x27;t last as long as batch Z01 that I got from a decant in the past.  Over all, I am happy with its quality for what I have paid.</li>
            <li> Creed is an average fragrance at best. Definitely not what I was expecting.  The Cologne Has An Heavy odor Not Suitable for men under 50.</li>
            <li> I like the smell. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I was led to believe. I&#x27;m not sure if the product I purchased on Amazon was the real thing.</li>
            <li> Not what I was waiting for. Long lasting - yes, but the smell is not what I like, slightly chemical.</li>
            <li> I just received my bottle of Creed Aventus today. After seeing some of the reviews here, I was worried about whether or not the thing is authentic. There are two things that appear to be fishy about the bottle. First of all, If you check the pictures of 4 oz Creed Aventus on Neiman Marcus or Creed Boutique you will realize that the \\&quot;Creed\\&quot; sign on the 4 oz bottle is in silver whereas on this bottle it is black. I searched online and some people say that this is the Middle Eastern version. The second thing is the lot number at the bottom of the bottle. The bottles that I saw on the internet have black digital-clock-like lot numbers says: \\&quot;LOT:xxxxxxxxx\\&quot;. On the bottle I received, the lot number appears to be engraved on the bottle rather than printed. Also, it does not have \\&quot;LOT:\\&quot; at the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than these two things, the bottle and the box seems to be original. Now if we come to the juice itself, i think it is just phenomenal. I am by no means expert on this area but it smells exactly like the sample I got a while ago. Some people are concerned about how they store the bottles and how that may cause some of the notes to die out but I haven&#x27;t noticed a note missing or anything like that. Anyways, It has been about 3 hours since I sprayed it on me and it is still pretty much out there making itself noticed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the box may not be the exact same thing that you would find on high end department stores in the US but the content itself is legit. And for $140 discount, (it costs $320 + tax on Creed boutique) I can take that much of a doubt...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon :)</li>
            <li> Fragrance is not original. x(</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments when I wear this, even at the end of the day I can no longer smell it people still compliment me and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Another one I was hesitant to buy this because i thought maybe it&#x27;s faux. Well i had been buying it in Nordstroms and i have the real deal and compared it..... EXACTLY THE SAME, WAYYY BETTER PRICE!!! I sweated bullets thinking i&#x27;m going to be taken for. I&#x27;m glad i bought this and verified for myself. I can say, yes this is real deal. This was the third one i purchased.</li>
            <li> Great smell. One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> its so great&lt;br /&gt;i receive it on a nice packaging and it comes safe&lt;br /&gt;the deliverer is so fast and the perfume is so nice</li>
            <li> Long story short. I purchased a bottle of Aventus from amazon through Beauty Encounter and also one from EPICMART. When they came they seemed legit.&lt;br /&gt;MUST HAVE LOT number etched as well as bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Look under cap it should have white atomizer spray thingy under black cap. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spraying on my wrist it smells great. few hours go by and it fades. THis is only because your NOSE GETS TIRED. I thought it was a fake :/ because others say it lasts like 8-12 hours so I got worried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then.. I purchased a $330 dollar 4oz Aventus from NEIMAN MARCUS and when it came everything was the same expect different lot number. However the amazon purchases were COMPLETELY AUTHENTIC***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after 12 hours from spraying I still get compliments**!! Trust Amazon. BUT Pay the big bucks just in case. At least $230-250 on these sites. Never lower as CREED is luxury in a bottle. Buy from CREED BOUTIQUE if still nervous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**WELL WORTH THE MONEY** It&#x27;ll get you lucky ;) Complete Quality fragrance love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just trust me. Promise</li>
            <li> Creed is ten times better at this price especially when its legit! Keep in mind Creed has changed their sprayers on the newr Aventus and Green Irish Tweed as I bought 2 bottles from Nieman Marcus to compare to and one had the new spayer and was informed its brand new from creed and is supposed to leak less than the mammoth spayers... This product has the old creed sprayer thats huge still..</li>
            <li> I know this is a pricey fragrance but a little goes a LONG way, you DO NOT have to douse yourself with an eau de parfume. I have been using this fragrance for about 5 yrs and it is definitely my signature scent. I have countless times when I thought I was going to get attacked by women (and men) You will NOT be disappointed if you purchase this product. Also remember that it is an eau de parfume which wears MUCH differently than eau de toilette...you won&#x27;t smell it on yourself but I guarantee people will smell it on you.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice and masculine fragrance.  It is well worth the price point because it lasts.  My husband is very pleased with the gift.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a counterfeit product.  I have been using it for 1 months time and the smell does not remain long after use.  I have other Creed products that i purchased at Dept stores and that is not the quality that one can expect with Creed.  Also, the box came with Arabic writing which leads me to believe that this is merchandise that was designed for domestic purchase.  I am quite disappointed given the cost of the product and the general strong reliability of Amazon.</li>
            <li> This cologne is way too strong and overpowering.  One spray fills up an entire room and it&#x27;s not a very pleasant odor either.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my nephew. And he loved it.</li>
            <li> Creed smells WONDERFUL and when he puts it on the scent lasts forever. He receives several compliments. The price was GREAT half the price of what I could of paid in the store.</li>
            <li> Very satisfactory. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Ok so I purchase this and it has an Arabic paper inside instead of the creed one. I think it was from the Arabian market. But cap was loose and the top note are completely gone so all u get is this sickly bitter birch mix with black current...smells really bad like bacon oil... Just get the real thing ...I think a small one oz is around that price maybe cheaper n the juice is so fresh</li>
            <li> My wife thinks it smells stale and musty, but the fragrance does not have an expiration date listed.  So buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing women love this scent I mean love it to the point I have random women in the street stop me to say I smell so good !!!</li>
            <li> I ordered my bottle from Amazon directly, assuming that it would be legit. Cologne smells amazing, just like samples I got from Saks Fifth Ave, so I was very pleased. But then I noticed that I couldn&#x27;t find the batch number on the bottle, and the sheet that comes in the box was in Arabic, raising the question of it&#x27;s authenticity. Everything I read online said that if the batch is missing it&#x27;s fake. Make a long story short, I found out my bottle is from the \\&quot;grey market\\&quot;, if you don&#x27;t know what that is, look it up. It was a new batch, one of the good ones, being sold in an arabic speaking country so they scratch the batch number off the bottle (which was BARELY visible when you put the bottle on it&#x27;s side). Grey market bottles are not imitations, just untraceable ones from what I read last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told Amazon, and they are sending me another bottle in a couple of days. So 4 stars, because it&#x27;s not entirely right but it&#x27;s still Aventus at a great price, and Amazon is taking care of it for me. If I get another grey market bottle I&#x27;ll likely just stick with it since I&#x27;ve still got the real deal, albeit one with missing numbers. For the price, I can live with that</li>
            <li> weak like all creed fragances, and funny container or bottle.</li>
            <li> The only thing that worries me is that the cap doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on and that the edge of the label started to lift off - ok so 2 things. I&#x27;m pretty sure that if I went into Neiman Marcus to get this &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; product and spend $330, i would NOT have these problems. I&#x27;m too lazy to go get the bottle to provide you with the serial number. But if someone spent that much effort on duplicating a bottle, the cap and label - how hard would it be to obtain a number and ink it onto the bottle. SOoooOoo......buyer please beware.&lt;br /&gt;Never, ever, ever again guys.</li>
            <li> Packaging all wrong, scent different, embossment on bottle messed up.  Sold ny Amazon.com, and then taken off Prime and replaced with a warning that item was under review because customers were complaining.  You cannot return colognes which is the bad news.  The good news is, Amazon being a great and honest company still gave me a full refund, knowing the product was a counterfeit.  Not eve worth keeping for free though, not the Creed I know and love from Neiman Marcus.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this product ,not original this is a bad product, not original, the smell does not last anything</li>
            <li> I ordered the 4 OZ bottle end of August and just received it. This thing is a BLOODY fake. It smells like cheap oil or to be precise, a VERY diluted form of the real thing doused with vegetable oil. I reckon the only way one can be sure is if one has the real thing to compare with. Who knows what the heck is in it and what kind of eczema one could get from even spraying the darn thing. I will not be happy with Amazon if I wake up tomorrow morning with carbuncles on my skin. Anyhoo, I immediately called Amazon and since it&#x27;s a flammable item and can&#x27;t be returned, they told me to toss it and are sending me another bottle within 3-5 days. I sincerely hope they&#x27;re sending me a genuine one this time; else I will ask for my money back and just go buy the very expensive one through the Creed Boutique. So, Amazon gets 5 stars for customer service, 1 star for selling a fake with Arabic writing, wrong color of the Creed emblem and inferior box and printing. Thank God I purchased Aventus through a reputable company. They need to check their perfumes though before sending it out. Jeff Bezos, get someone on quality control for perfumes ASAP, this doesn&#x27;t look good AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I been using Creed Aventus for years and I actually ordered from this merchant before and got the real deal. Last week I ordered Creed Aventus and I knew right away it is not authentic. I found at least 5 things from the fonts to the texture of the bottle and I can tell it is not authentic and I can also tell by the way it smells and this is not Creed Aventus.</li>
            <li> Pros: Friendly price compared to Mega retailers and authorized boutiques. Creeds scents are masculine, clean, sophisticated    Cons: I was introduced to this by a female who couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about it and I was curious so I went to check it out at an authorized retailer. I was told and read reviews, that women drop to their knees at this scent, which Ive never heard before about Parfums for men. The rep sprayed a sprits on my wrist so I could \\&quot;live with it\\&quot; before deciding to spend big dollars on it. I can safely say - that tiny sprits lasted easily 8 hrs and was intoxicating, even as it faded. The $100 less difference was too hard to pass up but I got hooked after the sample spray. I cannot say for certain if this purchase was authentic or not. The box was precise as is all its packaging. The scent is good on first spray and for about 10 mins later and thats about it. There is no sillage with this precise Parfum I bought, as has been touted by many regarding the real deal. Its either an excellent reproduction or simply such an old foreign imported batch, that it just doesnt have that fresh run power anymore, but it simply does not last on the skin. fabrics, to a certain degree. Also, having worn this daily for about 4 months now, surprisingly I have not received a single compliment on it - that may be due to the lack of sillage and longevity or strength in this particular batch (if it is fake).  Would the authentic one be worth $150. certainly. Is it worth $350. no, there is no ingredient in there that is rare or difficult to obtain. If they had to jerk off a bald eagle or whales as they did in the old days of Parfum making to make this stuff, that might be a different story. Is the packaging beautiful? yes, but I do not walk around with the box, its the contents that matter on this product as its heard and not seen.  My suggestion is probably buy it from a reputable dealer in person and not from a dirty disneyland place like Dubai, online - where itseems most are receiving their product from. The real authentic stuff that is fresh will cost more, but should last you 2-3x as long, as it will take less to promote the scent and have longevity when worn.</li>
            <li> I was concerned it wouldn&#x27;t be the real deal, but all seems well and good!  Love this Aventus smell as they quit making Woods by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch which was my signature smell.  I would recommend this from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it.  Don&#x27;t want too many people smelling like me.  8-)  However, to be fair, it is the real thing at a great price.</li>
            <li> The frangrance is fairly light when it dries.  It has a pleasent tabacco scent when dried down. Many tell me they can smell the fragrance hours after i have applied it.  So it must stay on the skin for a long time.  Good product.  The price is still a bit expensive, but it is definitely more reasonable with Amazon than the department stores.</li>
            <li> The best cologn I ever owned the smell is just something else , if you haven&#x27;t tried this brand yet , must try !!</li>
            <li> This purchase was terrible.  I want my money back.  The product is not the original.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Great Item! Item just as described!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Its a little more than I wanted to spend but theres no way of getting around that apparently.  Still a great smelling fragrance and I highly recommend it and the ladies absolutely love it. Because it is a bit pricey you can be assured that not EVERYONE is wearing it, making it a bit exclusive</li>
            <li> I get compliments every time I wear it</li>
            <li> I usually would prefer to sample a fragrance prior to purchasing especially if it&#x27;s $200.  But after reading through multiple reviews and since the Nieman Marcus near me was sold out, I made an exception and went through with the blind purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To compare it with other colognes I&#x27;ve had, I would say it&#x27;s a mixture of Ralph Lauren Polo and Kenneth Cole Reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pleasant fragrance, but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:edit:&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks with this cologne, I can easily say it&#x27;s definitely growing on me.  The sillage is addicting and will have you sniffing your wrists throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one advice I can suggest for skeptical customers.  This cologne is known to have bad batches which I wasn&#x27;t aware of prior to my purchase.  If you google search for good batch numbers, you can request it through certain vendors.  I have not tried this method with Buy D Best yet since I lucked out with a good batch.  If they can&#x27;t, my friends tell me that Creed Boutique is a vendor that will provide this service for you.  Their items are a bit more expensive, but I, for one, will pay more for quality.</li>
            <li> The product is real and not a copy. Great deal at a great price. Thanks I The scent is  unbelievable. Never knew anything could smell this good. Thanks everyone !</li>
            <li> Great product and accurate description. 100% genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was also quick.</li>
            <li> Creed Aventus is a great cologne. One squirt will last a very long time so you dont have to use a lot. You will get your moneys worth out of this bottle and also a lot of compliments because it smells so great.</li>
            <li> I opened this bottle from Amazon after finishing a bottle (that I purchased at Saks). As other reviews have stated it smells different and doesn&#x27;t last as long. The aroma from the bottle that I purchased at Saks lingered in my closet constantly, this new bottle the smell fades within hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the bottle came with an Arabic info card. Strange for a French cologne sold by a US retailer, no?</li>
            <li> First, to clear up some concerns I had personally being my first time ever purchasing cologne (especially as expensive as Creed) online and seeing some reviewers claiming this is not authentic Creed cologne. YES, this is 100% authentic Creed cologne, provided you buy from AMAZON directly (should say Prime eligible if you are a Prime member). I watched several videos on the internet with authentic Creed box openings and how to spot a legit package, and yes this is authentic (See my pictures in the Customer Images section above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Box:&lt;br /&gt;The box from Creed is supremely well detailed. The company logo for Creed is embossed on the box, and there is some silver metallic in the middle with the Creed logo. There is a bar code and some description in French on the bottom and back of the box, also in high quality metallic print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the box you see a small card board stock that says &amp;#34;more than two hundred years of experience&amp;#34;. There is some background information about Creed in English, French, Italian, and German.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a card with the Creed logo and &amp;#34;de pere en fils depuis 1760&amp;#34; with two Creed family members printed on top surrounded by gold metallic print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottle:&lt;br /&gt;Very heavy, thick glass and feels like it was well thought out (as silly as that may sound). On the back of the bottle along the bottom is the batch ID. The top plastic protector over the spray nozzle is also thick plastic, with some metallic silver crown logo or seal, also on par with what was seen in my authentic bottle investigation online. Seems very hard to fake this kind of craftsmanship and care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent:&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality scent. Base-notes of citrus or pineapple, very warm and tropical smelling. Mature, and masculine, and definitely unique. My girlfriend loves the smell, makes me spray her sweatshirts after she washes them so they smell like &amp;#34;me&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it lasted a good while, maybe it wassensory adaptation after wearing it a while. It seems like it lasted 4-6 hours and got slightly more faint after that but definitely still noticeable if you smell directly where it was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After wearing Aventus, I almost feel like throwing my other colognes away, they just smell cheap and synthetic (Gucci Intense, Curve, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 10/10, don&#x27;t hesitate, this is a great cologne for year round wear and definitely unique at a great price here!</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a unique scent that no one else is wearing. Expensive, but worth it. Lots of complements and smells great. Sweet but not fruity. Elegant without being overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - After wearing this for the past three months, just about every female I know has commented on how good it smells and asks what it is. That&#x27;s a sign that this juice is worth the $$!</li>
            <li> If they could bottle the tears of Zeus, I&#x27;m pretty sure this would be it. The smell just never gives up, and it smells like pure euphoria. It clings to your clothes until you wash them, then sometimes, its still clinging. I can honestly still sometimes smell creed on my clothes after I&#x27;ve washed them on a hot cycle with detergent. Now that&#x27;s some impressive stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compliments. So many compliments. Since using Creed, every single person I&#x27;ve come within hugging distance of, has said something about how good I smell. Makes SexPanther look like a joke cologne, and we all know how well that stuff works.</li>
            <li> One of the greatest fragrances I ever tried!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  OK but it doesn&#x27;t  smell like the one I first smelled  on a guy where I worked  at. Ever time he would come in,  the room will fill with the essence and could be smelled from far. I feel like the essence in this perfume is not as strong.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing ! Love this cologne for my boyfriend and price is amazing !</li>
            <li> It came as scheduled&lt;br /&gt;The scent is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;It is a Millesime (Eau de Parfum) so the parfum concentration is higher than the Eau de Toilette.&lt;br /&gt;If you take that into consideration then the cost is equivalent to the Eau de Toilette.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to tell how many compliments I received since I purchased Creed. I own both the Aventus and Portugal by Creed and they are both AMAZING! It is unique and due to its price, many people don&#x27;t own this product. The scents are long lasting, good quality ingredients and the cologne &amp;#34;adapts&amp;#34; to the wearer&#x27;s body chemistry. Once you find the right scent for your body type, you won&#x27;t go anywhere else!</li>
            <li> The package I received is legitimate, although it is from a batch intended for the Middle-Eastern/Eastern market (A42B12C01). Packaging is slightly different. Creed logo is black, inserts in Arabic, etc. as shown from the other buyer&#x27;s pictures. The number at the bottom of the back of the bottle is very hard to read (almost completely transparent), but it&#x27;s there. According to several users on Basenotes, this is to be expected from this batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is great, longevity is fine. Aventus is known for rapid olfactory fatigue and pronounced batch variation. Couple those traits with the Arabic packaging, and it&#x27;s easy to see why this might appear to be a fake. It&#x27;s real, at least the one I received is. I purchased directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have tried samples at the mall but ordered online through amazon and it just does not smell the same and does not last as long. It seems to be like a watered down version.</li>
            <li> My first order came with 2 bottles of creed 4 oz in a small first rate package with no protection.  One of the boxes opened, bottle opened and leaked. I sent one back. The second one was shipped back again with poor packaging in a small padded envelope. The box is torn up. I will not buy from this seller again. The gift was ordered in mid January and was late getting here. It also took a couple of weeks more to receive the 2nd replacement bottle. I can&#x27;t give this to anyone as a gift in this box.</li>
            <li> I bought my bottle directly from Amazon, and it&#x27;s legit. Packaging and everything was on point. I did get a middle-eastern market bottle (insert pamphlet is in Arabic, box and bottle in French) but that&#x27;s fine. For those who care, my lot number was A42B11Y02, and it&#x27;s great. Succulent pineapple notes and a heady base of birch and oakmoss. Unlike most Creeds, this is an unquestionable powerhouse on my skin. Lasts a long time (even after a shower) and projects. Smells amazing, and I got a compliment less than 10 minutes after putting it on. For the price Amazon charges, there is no reason not to buy this fragrance through them, it&#x27;s a great product and an insane bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: On my bottle the lot code was in an odd location. Rather than on the bottom lip or directly on the bottom of the bottle it was faintly etched on the glass, right where the black wrap ends on the back. I have had another middle-east Creed bottle (Millesime Imperial) and it was the same on that one as well, so don&#x27;t panic if it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about the Aventus colonge by Creed when I sprayed some on me in Saks fifth Ave. that I couldn&#x27;t go too sleep until I searched it out on the Internet.Found it &amp; I said let me go to Amazon they have amazing prices.Did just that &amp; found it for a reasonable price as I thought.Couldnt wait tell it got here but when it finally showed up I open it &amp; sprayed it to my surprise it wasn&#x27;t the 100 percent smell I sprayed on me @ Saks .So disappointed cause I could have spent that 171.00 dollars with 145 dollars more bought it out of Saks.Its not the real thing.Its a knock off.</li>
            <li> I should of known to good to be true, the smell is is not the same as the real creed aventus.  I purchase the real one at Neman&#x27;s 1oz $185.  It smells amazing and where I go I get so many compliments and the smell last for hours. When seen the 4oz product for $158 could not believe. Many of the feedback doubted its origin as real I&#x27;m now convinced they are right on amazon. The smell is not the same and it does not last. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Buying such an expensive cologne in this format made me really nervous but I had smelled Creed before and knew I liked it and it was almost $100 cheaper on Amazon than local department stores.  This was well packaged for shipping, arrived promptly and smells great.  Not too strong but a great scent!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband for our 3rd anniversary after reading the reviews and sorely regret this.&lt;br /&gt;I used the Amazon prime as recommended but alas,one of the other buyers was absolutely right,it just doesn&#x27;t look like the real thing after comparing it to the bottle on the Aventus website and it also came with a piece of paper with Arabic scrawled all over it.It doesn&#x27;t smell great either and doesn&#x27;t last as long as suggested by other reviewers.Bought it in January but my husband has hardly used it since then.I would not recommend this product to anyone.IT IS A FRAUD!!!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my fiance.&lt;br /&gt;He loves the creed line and he loved this!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I chose to purchase from here.&lt;br /&gt;It came in perfect packaging and 100% authentic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy with it!</li>
            <li> Thank you. The item came as described and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> The product is great and it was exactly what I was expecting. I have many Creed fragrances but this one is my favorite, i was a bit concerned to buy this one on Amazon after reading many reviews but this one you can tell is the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;People notice you when you walk into a room and women just will come and ask you what you are wearing. Creed really stands out letting people know that is not a cologne you just buy on a Duty Free Airport.&lt;br /&gt;I just simply decided to make it my signature cologne from now on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money. You will be disappointed. Does not stay more than a couple of hours and does not smell like a real one.</li>
            <li> I have been fortunate to have been the recipient of many colognes as gifts over the years. Someone special purchased a 1 oz bottle of Creed Aventus for me some months ago. Never in my life have I received so many compliments on my &#x27;perfume&#x27; ... For those who question the authenticity of this product sold by Amazon - you are simply misguided. It is, in fact, authentic. Amazon prices seem to fluctuate between two figures. It happens to be at the low at the moment I am writing this review. For those of you who purchase a cologne because of its longevity - there is always Old Spice. This cologne is truly unique and smells great. It also lasts but is no petrulli that can&#x27;t be removed with pumice.  You must remember that these fragrances mix with your individual body chemistry and what \\&quot;works\\&quot; for one may be rancid for another - literally. I didn&#x27;t realize the depth and complexity of the scent until I compared it to some other colognes.  I received the 4 oz bottle for my birthday and am thrilled. Again - only compliments from the most unlikely of people. Thank you to my giftor and to Amazon. The extra $100-$200 I would have had to pay to an elite perfumery will be spent on a nice evening out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am amazed that those people who comment on the international writing as some proof that this product is not genuine or made for the \\&quot;Arabic Market.\\&quot;  Creed was founded in 1760 in FRANCE (thats not a town in the USA)  and is one of the 100 oldest businesses in the world. Of course there will be other languages on the packaging! Are we so culture-centric that we have become idiots? My bottle I received as a gift in May came right before another bottle gift from a French Colony. (If you think Colony is a medical procedure, just call it a day). It is exactly the same product, packaging, smell etc...</li>
            <li> Best men&#x27;s cologne I have ever tried! This is a must for the guy that wants to be noticed!</li>
            <li> Authentic Creed Aventus (from Amazon direct).  Received a sample of Aventus from Neiman-Marcus and the 4 oz from Amazon is the same.  Smokey pineapple with great longevity and projection.  It is truly a unique fragrance and you (and others) will be enjoying the scent all day.</li>
            <li> If you buy from amazon directly and not a 3rd party seller on amazon you can be confident you will get authentic creed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first this scent smelled very strong to me, almost overwhelming, but a few minutes later I began to like it a lot, its a very classy sexy powerful orgasmic scent.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than Aventus</li>
            <li> When you first spray this it will clear an entire room. It&#x27;s awful. It does fade after about thirty minutes and becomes something decent, but the initial attack is way too extreme. For the price you pay for this I would just get it from a department store to be sure it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Great product ! As described!</li>
            <li> The best!! no more words to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.heliflights.us</li>
            <li> I have other creeds and I smell them fine on me, however I could not smell Aventus. Wore it to work and received many compliments, \\&quot;you smell good\\&quot;. I was even told I wear the scent well and what was it, I want it for my husband... I will put it away for a while then come back to it. Hopefully I can enjoy the scent like everyone around me. Three stars because I couldn&#x27;t smell it. My nose must be broken because the compliments kept coming for five hours then it must have become a close to the skin because they came after a hug. But man this stuff must smell really good because I had a couple co-works ask me to come near so they could share the scent with someone they told about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a time to have olfactory breakdown. And I purchased at a good price (for a creed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7.27.12: I spray myself one more time yesterday to try again, and again, nothing. But, when I woke for work I got a whiff of the Aventus coming from my body, and Yeah, hell yeah. I like what I smelled so much, I tried again and I got a whiff a couple times at work. But the air was full of Aventus for all to enjoy. I was told by as many as six (6) women, strangers, that smells nice, or you smell good and a couple of them were with a male partner. Also my co-workers again informed me how much they enjoyed the scent... Well I am putting it away for a week. Going back to my signature scent Terre d&#x27;hermes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I smelled when I woke and the couple times at work, I recommend Aventus as a buy. I hope I can enjoy it like I enjoy Original Santal, GIT, MI, Le Labo Bergamote 22, Rose 31, Bond no9 Bleecker Street, and my signature Hermes Terre d&#x27;Hermes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah and the stars went to 4.5 so it&#x27;s a FIVE, hell Aventus IS a 5. Guys get this one even blind buy, it&#x27;s fantastic... for those that need to read it, yeah the women love it. But get it for your enjoyment and wish me luck on Aventus olfactory recovery.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell very masculine love it a must have for your collection lots of complements with this product&lt;br /&gt;Go for it !!!!</li>
            <li> Although I cannot always smell it, others can hours after I&#x27;ve applied.  I love the scent.  Despite all this, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s good enough to justify the price.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be. However it is still a good cologne to have in your collection</li>
            <li> I am a huge scent connoisseur and but I am not typically a Creed lover due to it&#x27;s ridiculous price.&lt;br /&gt;However Creed Aventus is an exception. I got it as a birthday gift and instantly fell in love. It smells very manly with a smoky pineapple note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never gotten so many compliments on any cologne I ever had.</li>
            <li> Sooooo much cheaper than buying at Neiman&#x27;s and it&#x27;s the real thing! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Great service great cologne</li>
            <li> Strong and masculine taste! The bottle was delivered to me on way to work, sealed box but ,  I could sense the perfume already without open it. Long lasting, good for work and those special occasions!Give it a try, the results will come from people asking about it...</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance. It is sophisticated, sporty and unique. I get compliments on it every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> I have been a Creed Aventus user for years and when I saw the discounted rate on Amazon (after weighing that there were more 5star reviews then 1 or 2 star) I thought I would take a chance. Boy, do I regret that now!!! Even though the bottle and atomizer seem authentic, it smells of gas when it is applied (I recall one reviewer mentioning that)!&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short, do yourself a favor and if you are interested in a Creed product, pay the extra $100 and purchase it from a reputable retailer and not some third party vendor on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This cologne is paradise. Nuff said. It far exceeded my expectations. Twenty words yet? There is nothing else I can say at this time</li>
            <li> Every woman that comments on this loves it. It created a frenzy at work when I sprayed it on a male coworker while in the office. Six or seven women rose from their cubicles to discover the provenance of the holy smell. They surrounded him and started cooing, \\&quot;oooh ahhhing\\&quot; and complimenting him. The cocky bastard simply said, \\&quot;it really works well with my skin.\\&quot; :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after Millesime Imperial and was surprised that Aventus gets me even more compliments. Ladies tell me I smell sexy and manly (ages 19 - 46) and even my father (who&#x27;s one of those tough old school Clint Eastwood types) says it&#x27;s the best one he&#x27;s smelled. My mom and sister (age: 24) also love it. My sister said she walked into my mom&#x27;s living room and thought I was in there because the smell was there. In reality, I simply walked past the living room straight to my brother&#x27;s bedroom. I had sprayed the cologne on 10 minutes before I visited my mom&#x27;s place. Wow. My sister then said \\&quot;that is the best one you have\\&quot; I said \\&quot;No, sh... it cost me three hundred dollars\\&quot; LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lasts around 10-12 hours on my skin, and I haven&#x27;t even tried for longevity on clothes. It projects a good four to six feet even after 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gets me more compliments than L&#x27;eau D&#x27;Issey, which was my reigning champ until I bought Creed&#x27;s Millesime Imperial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m too nervous to buy discounted Creeds, so I bought this as well as Millesime Imperial from the creedboutique online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tobacco Vanille Tip: I love Tobacco Vanille but my female friend (age: 25) who worked at L&#x27;Occitane said it smells JUST LIKE Eau de Baux. Nevertheless she loved the Tobacco Vanille on me. Also, the hottest girl at work (age 27 Pakistani) loved it too (she&#x27;s like a 9.5 out of 10 Salma Hayek type, no exaggeration). Check them both out before you buy Tobacco Vanille. I LOVE TOBACCO VANILLE but have never smelled the MUCH cheaper L&#x27;Occitane.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it was fantastic. Anytime I wear it people asked me what perfume/cologne is it. That is why I went for another one when the last bottle was exhausted. Unfortunately, this one is nothing close to what I know of Creed Aventus. You can&#x27;t even percieve anything whilst spraying it. It doesn&#x27;t spray like something in a pressurerized bottle rather it drips like water. It&#x27;s so unfortunate and frustrating that I spent such an amount for this. I would&#x27;nt advise anybody to buy this. You may try a smaller bottle of it which is what I used before.</li>
            <li> Gooodddddd arrived on timeee</li>
            <li> The cologne on first spray smells great.  However, within 30 minutes the smell is gone.  It is not just me.  My girlfriend, friends, relatives can&#x27;t smell it at all.  This was a $200 purchase directly from amazon and I expected the cologne to actually smell like something after half an hour..unfortunately amazon does not allow you to return cologne either...I owned this cologne previously and know it last longer than 30 minutes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure whether it is amazon&#x27;s improper storage of the cologne that affected the smell.  I&#x27;d just like to make people of aware of it though because this is not a cheap cologne.  Buy a sample first and know what it smells like, and how long it lasts before you go ahead and buy online directly from amazon.</li>
            <li> i should have bought this in the 2.50z and the royal oud in the 4.0 oz.i blind bought this based on reviews on the net.i can&#x27;t smell it even after 2hrs.The projection isn&#x27;t something great at all.i am dissapointed i paid about $190 for a cologne that doesn&#x27;t even have a presence when my $70 ysl lanuit is a lady&#x27;s magnet.Some ppl complain about creed because of the price,i am not doing that because i actually love the house of creed and my #1 cologne ever is the creed silver mountain water cologne.i am just dissapointed that this isn&#x27;t anywhere as good as my other creed that includes the silver mountain water,green irish tweed,Royal Oud(i think it is now a tie with silver mountain water).I also have the imperial milliseme,i really do feel that one is just as light now,it used to be great when the bottle was gold color,the new one is just to light for me and i can&#x27;t even smell it after about 30mins.this is more so why i am thinking that just maybe i was infactuated with their perfumes back in late 90&#x27;s /early 2000&#x27;s because their wasn&#x27;t that much cologne with that much effects out there like creed was then.but yet again silver mountain still stands out,out there,so my conclusion is that they might have reduced the potency of their cologne just like christian dior fahreheit is no longer that potent anymore</li>
            <li> The item was new,but it wasn&#x27;t sealed.it is good if you r going to use it,but I think for gift it needed to be sealed</li>
            <li> best++++best and nothing but the best!&lt;br /&gt;best men&#x27;s fragrance in the world and probably to stay best for a while</li>
            <li> Uhm if you are married or don&#x27;t want ugly women after you then this is not for you, no lie never ever had so many women after me because how I smell, it can be scary wearing this stuff, I had women say I smell good before but this stuff makes them aggressive, I seriously had no clue that was possible. Times I was scared. it last long time, not over powering in fact I could barely smell it but ya the women can, no lies. Heard there&#x27;s alot of fakes of this stuff which I can see why. Be safe with it</li>
            <li> I bought this product from pickyourperfume on 4/20/14. Upon opening the package I can say with absolute, 100% certainty that it is a fake product. Please don&#x27;t waste your money buying this product from pickyourpefume. As a preface, my friend has the exact same cologne that he bought at a physical department store so I know what the real product looks, feels, and smells. The real thing smells great, which was why I wanted to get my own bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have listed my evidence below. Please keep in mind that Creed is known for their superior product quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Even just looking at the packaging of the cologne, the material they use to emboss their lettering is inconsistent. For some of the words, the paint is rubbing off and some are even drawn outside the lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Probably the biggest giveaway is the the &amp;#34;CREED&amp;#34; symbol on the actual bottle is colored black, but the paint on the letter E is peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The smell of the actual cologne smells like pure alcohol with a tiny mix of fragrance mixed in. It&#x27;s almost a pungent smell due to the alcohol content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The cap on the bottle is loose. When I opened the packaging, the cap wasn&#x27;t even 100% tightly in place, which is a red flag for an unopened product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The etching on the bottle seems like it&#x27;s photoshopped on. The texture is inconsistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The atomizer itself is wobbly and sprays very little and is very wobbly. Please keep in mind Creed atomizers are know for a heavy, consistent spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I fell for it and bought a fake product. I hope you take my advice and don&#x27;t do the same. I would never do business again with pickyourperfume.</li>
            <li> Ordered from FragranceNet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batch number S042C13ZZ1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Image album: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I got a fake at first because the batch number was S042 which I&#x27;ve never seen before and when I opened the atomizer, the white ring was smaller than what I found online, but turns out this is the newest batch and Creed has been changing the atomizer to the one in the album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smelled very weak at first, but after an hour it smells VERY pleasant and potent. Lots of Apple/pineapple and little bit of smokiness. I have sampled Aventus before purchasing and I used to think the sample smelled amazing. But after smelling the newest bottle, the sample one smells a little too smokey. But I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments while I was wearing the sample. Can&#x27;t wait to try the bottle in public.</li>
            <li> Just read the title. It smells like someone peeled out in a semi over a huge pile of pineapples. It was great at first, but then got too sweet, and eventually gave me a headache. I asked a woman what she thought after getting no complements (i get complements on other colognes) and she said \\&quot;oh... interesting?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to smell like a burned pineapple pizza, have fun.</li>
            <li> best cologne hands down. My girl didnt like it at first, but later she it grew on her, she loves the way I smell now. I think the smell grew on me as well. Now Im like i got to have it :)</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s authentic or counterfeit</li>
            <li> I do notice this cologne being a more sophisticated product .. I have to use three sprays to enjoy..It does smell real good . reminds me of something I owned before..  update . 5-14-16  I love this cologne ..  Has a great smell. Not too long lasting but t&#x3D;does keep a faint smell after 4 hours . Smells great . women love it ..  A sophisticated mature gentleman&#x27;s  cologne. With Class.</li>
            <li> I checked out this fragrance at a department store, and it is quite strong. Not to mention the fact that it is very very long lasting. I&#x27;m talking 12 hours plus on the skin. This stuff projects like crazy and is very loud. I didn&#x27;t get any pineapple/citrus in the top notes. It is probably a little too \\&quot;smoky\\&quot; for me.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, great scent</li>
            <li> I told the saleswoman at the mall that I felt bad for showcasing Aventus with her and buying it online, but I saved $150 by getting it on Amazon.com. She said it was counterfeit, and it probably came from the Middle East. Whether or not it&#x27;s counterfeit, I can&#x27;t tell. I bet nobody else can tell, either. It&#x27;s good stuff. She said it won&#x27;t &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; as long as the real stuff (meaning if I put the counterfeit on its fragrance won&#x27;t last as long as true Creed). I sampled Creed, and then I used this. I really can&#x27;t tell the difference, to the point where I feel my saleswoman might have been mistaken. I still think I could have bought the real thing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and waited anxiously for it to arrive. The first day I recieved it colonge I sprayed a little on my wrist the night before bed. I woke up and could not smell the product anymore. I ask my wife to take a sniff and she could not smell it either. I sprayed a little on the day before work and for the first 3 hours it held up. After that smell was very shallow and had almost completely disappeared. Needless to say for the $$$ it is not worth it.... Oh yeah, the label peeled off the bottle within two days... wow... I work in an office environment and i do not sweat much at all. Therefore i give this product ONE STAR.....</li>
            <li> Everything seems real about the packaging. Even the smell was unique and fantastic (although it did not last long). The give away was the cap. It does not fit the bottle and seems to be cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;I want the real thing for 190 dollars... If you do too, DO NOT buy this product--go to Neiman Marcus or another retailer and be ready to pay a little more money.</li>
            <li> This thing is a beast when it comes longevity and projection, not exaggerating in the slightest. Opens up with pineapple and apple and that alone should make you want to buy it but then it also dries down very well after about an hour. I would recommend this fragrance to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> There are lots of feed back saying that this product is counterfeit. Well, the description inside the box does shows Arabic letters but the smell is perfect. I really don&#x27;t know the difference between the real one and the counterfeit. The box and the bottle look way too original and detailed that I really don&#x27;t think thief will spent so much money creating an exact copy. I also have the Green Irish and is smell great. I will never buy a cologne under $110 unless is Angel Man. There&#x27;s no doubt I will buy this product from Amazon. It looks real to me. I guess one day I&#x27;ll buy straight from the company and I&#x27;ll be updating this message and the one I did for Green Irish Tweed but that will be in a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve ware Aventus Creed this morning at 6:20am (Only 2 spray total on my neck) It&#x27;s 12:51am the following day and I still can smell. Smell real to me. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Do u really want to wear what A lot of foolish people who are willing to pay for this well done but still very expensive - very mass produced smelling cologne will do in 2013?  Because, if u are, welcome to the masses if u think this cologne is going to make u stand out.  theres a good possibility you may be meeting a couple of them at every social gathering in 2013. It&#x27;s the cologne for those who think a low end Audi or bmwer is gonna make you special. So many truly EXCELLENT and unique colognes at this price point. Stop following the masses. You&#x27;ll smell like a snooty one.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was so happy to receive this for his birthday.</li>
            <li> By far the best smelling cologne I own... Very strong even for one squirt.  Yeah it&#x27;s pricey but so worth it!</li>
            <li> I paid for it $ 205&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect deceit from Amazon (I bought directly from Amazon)!&lt;br /&gt;it is made somewhere in the United Arab Emirates, everywhere inside the package Arabic characters - on the passport, on the certificate. stickers Arab ...&lt;br /&gt;perfume were open&lt;br /&gt;I can not tell you my disappointment and anger. it was a gift to my husband for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;I can not return it. now it&#x27;s garbage. thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> I luv this mens cologne, it is so sensual, my man gets compliments every where he goes, people always ask him what is it , where can I get it......its awesome is all I can say. Pricey but worth it....&lt;br /&gt;Merry Christmas to you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again&lt;br /&gt;Corrine</li>
            <li> Fist of all, BEWARE!  There are tons of fakes going around out there.  Please make sure you buy from a reputable vendor.  Neiman Marcus or Creed Boutique are best, but there are other legit online dealers.  Read the sites reviews and be careful. This stuff is expensive, don&#x27;t get ripped off!  When I first smelled this, I sprayed it on a napkin.  It was all smoky and actually seemed to be fading quickly.  I thought I had a fake on my hands.  I came back four hours later and smelled the napkin I had sprayed and I was almost blown away.  It smelled incredible, still smoky but more refined, and very potent.  Smelling the bottle again I got hints of fresh pineapple.  I then knew that this was legit.  Into the evening I kept smelling the napkin and just kept thinking how awesome a fragrance this was.  All the hype over this scent is for real.  I will only be wearing this for special occasions.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good office fragrance because it can be distracting...in a wonderful way.  Just a couple of sprays does it.  This is real man&#x27;s cologne!  Be careful with this one.  Update:  I&#x27;ve been wearing this for a while now, mostly to work and I get compliments every time I wear it.  It lasts on my skin through the entire work day.  One day I was at the store after work and the cashier told me my cologne smelled good.  There are other colognes out there that smell similar to Aventus but none of them perform or smell as awesome.  If you can afford it get it!</li>
            <li> Cologne smells GREAT. I get tons of compliments and the scent lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Authentic Creed at a very good price</li>
