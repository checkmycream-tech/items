            <li>I absolutely love this product I had this product and could not find it anywhere</li>
            <li>but here I&#x27;m glad I got it</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE dust it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...</li>
            <li>Another plus to this is that it absorbs oil so you can go without washing for a longer period, even without adding more of this to your hair.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m always looking for the magical product that will give my hair some lift.  </li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t be able to run a comb through your hair.  </li>
            <li>Was happy to find out its the real thing.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love love.</li>
            <li>Just make sure when you sprinkle into your roots to blend in well</li>
            <li>when wanting it out. :)</li>
            <li>This is my 4th bottle over many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend to any one.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Osis+ DOES WORK, but you have to use it sparingly and make sure you got the correct product.</li>
            <li>, this way Amazon will notice just how many people are calling \\&quot;Shenanigans!\\&quot; on this product and maybe they will either stop carrying it or look more closely into their vendors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The company is nice to deal with and offers a good price for Osis</li>
            <li>This  is awesome for volume and it lasts all day long!!</li>

            <li>I am very pleased with this product, works great on short hair keeping it full.</li>
            <li>Rumors of not being able to order the genuine product scared me</li>
            <li>Good stuff, really adds volume.</li>

            <li>It make your hair easy to tease and blends it well.</li>

            <li>I refuse to get a shorty haircut just because that is what stylists want you to with fine hair.</li>
            <li>I refuse to get a shorty haircut just because that is what stylists want you to with fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is a must have for fine hair.</li>
            <li>IF YOU HAVE FINE HAIR....</li>
            <li>I lightly sprinkled the shaker on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for lifting roots, but a little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li>This one is light control.  </li>
            <li>For my bangs, I FINALLY have them and they look really great.  </li>
            <li>But the look is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Then comb lightly through your hair.  </li>
            <li>Great seller, great price - would definitely recommend the product and will definitely order from this seller again.</li>
            <li>Still playing around with it, but so far so good...</li>
            <li>This is some magic powder right here.</li>
            <li>I can easily go 3 days with my hair looking fab, holds my waves, full of volume..</li>

            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how quick and easy this was.</li>
            <li>u must b careful not to use to much but excellent product for fine hair as it gives it a lot of body.</li>
            <li>LOVE this for my flat fine hair!!</li>
            <li>This is NOT the original product I have used.  </li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I have found it&#x27;s better to put it in my hands first and then use it to texturize my hair..</li>
            <li>The product is awesome for my fine hair, better than most other dry shampoos that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I still back-comb the crown of my hair when I&#x27;m going for more volume, but this product will forever be a favorite for all-day, natural looking volume.</li>
            <li>Incredible product that voluminizes my hair and keeps it looking hot all night long.  </li>
            <li>Bottle is small but you use just a very light dusting of it, so it&#x27;s still a great value.</li>
            <li>Just needs a few sprinkles,  very good product</li>
            <li>Also, it took a good 5 washings to get the stuff out after only applying it a couple times.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.  </li>
            <li>Overall - good</li>
            <li>Reactivate by just combing through the next day and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>It lasts for days, so make sure you shampoo really well</li>
            <li>I will spend more for it but know I am getting the real thing at Ulta.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel like its as full of gunk like the Unite powder.</li>
            <li>hair styling worthy but</li>
            <li>When you what to do something quick.</li>
            <li>This amazing product separates every hair on your head and gives you a nice covered look, so no more shiny scalp showing through.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine, poker straight hair</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, poker straight hair</li>
            <li>--that product wasn&#x27;t a fine powder, it was kinda chunky, and it didn&#x27;t style my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair that lays completely flat to my scalp -- not so attractive on me and my big skull.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your hair full because it&#x27;s very, very sticky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing price and will last me awhile.  </li>
            <li>My hair definitely looks amazing when I use this product.</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>The perfect thing to use when you have but oily and thin hair.</li>
            <li>Real stuff is much tackier and works 1000x better.</li>
            <li>product would be great for costuming where you need your hair to be stiff and</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast too!</li>
            <li>If your hair lays too flat against your head or if it&#x27;s too straight this is a great product that provides a kind of tackiness and lift that will let you loft the hair up a bit and make it easier to style without using any other product.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this powder, as I love all their other products.</li>
            <li>It adds just the amount of &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; right where you want it.</li>
            <li>It took me awhile to get the right product to fix THAT problem...</li>
            <li>Once I started using the clarifying shampoo when I had this in my hair, it came right out.  </li>
            <li>fluffs right up.</li>
            <li>Washes right out</li>
            <li>It gave my hair major static and almost had a damp/moist feel to it.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve found that the method that works best for me to obtain volume at the roots is to sprinkle a tiny amount directly on the specific root areas of your hair and then work it through with your fingers.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and only use it to create volume for up-dos.</li>
            <li>Received it super fast also.</li>
            <li>My stylist first used this on me in the salon, so I ordered some.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product and use it almost daily!</li>
            <li>and it really helps thicken my hair, worth a try.</li>
            <li>This stuff really gives you lift!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>First of all, the bottle is about the length of my thumb.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what is says it dies.</li>
            <li>I think think is a great option for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li>You have to do this in sections, so it takes a tiny bit longer; but I found that it worked much better for me that way.</li>
            <li>I first knew of this product reading about celebrities using OSIS</li>
            <li>I really like this product and would but it again!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this off Amazon</li>
            <li>(P.S. I&#x27;ve tried a different brand before, but found that Osis is Osis :)</li>
            <li>, the second block is at the top flap of the box.</li>
            <li>Okay so it feels gross in your hair-</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>It holds your tease very well and washes right out.</li>
            <li>Much prefer big Sexy hair brand powder</li>
            <li>It adds very little volume but good for oily scalp.</li>
            <li>I had my hopes up with this after reading a lot of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The name Schwarzkopf is very small on the packaging Also, the cap is more rounded on the top edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I live in the the very hot, very humid south</li>
            <li>Instant thickness and makes it so easy to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the stuff for a few years and I love it!</li>
            <li>The next time I can certainly use less to get great resu&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have short, fine hair</li>
            <li>I have short, fine hair - lots</li>
            <li>Great for styling of short hair, and this little bottle lasts forever if you are applying once in the morning when you are styling.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that would give me volume without making my hair look greasy and this works really well.</li>
            <li>The profuct to me just doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much volume as was advitised for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Really does the trick</li>
            <li>HOW MUCH OR HOW LTITLE.  </li>
            <li>I have really long/thick hair</li>
            <li>and it gives me so much volume.</li>
            <li>If you use to much it will make your hair feel tacky.  </li>
            <li>And if you apply too much, this can make your scalp itch, understandably.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews regarding the fakes, but I got the real stuff.</li>
            <li>it feels like i put on too much hair spray.</li>
            <li>I just wish it was easier to brush out, it really sticks to your hair.</li>
            <li>It really gives the hair a funky texture.  </li>
            <li>I have very &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>OSIS really thickens the hair without making it feel gummy.</li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps to thicken hair and makes it manageable.</li>
            <li>I also posted a picture of what the REAL product looks like.</li>
            <li>Just bought the three pack because I keep buying it over again and was spending too much money.</li>
            <li>I did not like the product as too much powdery.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff for the hold and look.</li>
            <li>I have used the product once however, I used to much.  </li>
            <li>It gives body to hair without haveing to tease your hair so much.  </li>
            <li>Have used before and it works great with thin, unteaseable hair.</li>
            <li>You no longer see the powder, but your hair feels REALLY</li>
            <li>This is the real Dust It.  </li>
            <li>This seller has the real Dust It</li>
            <li>i know i will order more in the near future.</li>
            <li>The miracle for flat, fine hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff fixed that problem!!!  </li>
            <li>Its like a more subtle form of hairspray except no clumps and flakes! :)</li>
            <li>1 block covers 2/3 of the clear box from the right side</li>
            <li>I bought this last year and this year as well, and both meet the description given for the original.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so much easier to work with, particularly for any up-dos.</li>
            <li>I dont understand how it works, but add body/height - such a cool product</li>
            <li>I apply directly to my hair, not in my hands first.  </li>
            <li>Just a tiny bit gives me full hair that still moves.</li>
            <li>: Osis+ is in big bold letters running vertically on the bottle.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad the price is essentially the same.</li>
            <li>I have super long hair and fine up top, so I have always had a tough time teasing and giving my hair body and volume.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, will buy again.</li>
            <li>It takes very little to give good body to your hair and holds the curl all day and into the next.</li>
            <li>It is also great because you just mess up your ends a little throughout the day/night and</li>
            <li>There were some negative comments about the seller saying that it the product was a knock off, but what I received was the real deal and highly recommend to all those ladies or gents with fine hair!</li>
            <li>My stylist tells me it&#x27;s thick, but fine (I laugh every time they call my hair \\&quot;thick\\&quot;--</li>
            <li>and Osis+ can get gummy feeling if you use too much and if the humidity is above 90% which is most of the summer/fall down</li>
            <li>and Osis+ can get gummy feeling if you use too much and if the humidity is above 90% which is most of the summer/fall down</li>
            <li>Love it minus the gritty feeling.</li>
            <li>Works great, but leaves hair a little stiff.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Apparently the dealer must have gotten hold of some knockoff, because this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>I have grey hair and it blends right in.  </li>
            <li>But once I did, its a quick sprinkle and fluff</li>
            <li>This product seems to work at first, but then my hair falls flat.</li>
            <li>the left side of the packaging is a large Osis+ in silver running vertically up the the box.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, thin hair, and even with the nastiest stickiest hairsprays, I can&#x27;t get my hair to hold a curl for very long.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>this little bottle will last forever though. :)</li>
            <li>OK, the photo shown on this item changes so its hard to</li>
            <li>I have lots of fine hair and a narrower head, and using this at the roots gives me volume and lift without having to undercomb and use a bunch of hair spray and have it looking stiff.  </li>
            <li>and I put directly on scalp</li>
            <li>I wish I would&#x27;ve known that sooner otherwise I would have bought directly from the site.</li>
            <li>I like my hair to look soft and feel soft...</li>
            <li>but it also has the number \\&quot;23\\&quot; on it as well and that text is pixelated or looks like old dot matrix printing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is definitely not an everyday product.</li>
            <li>Place a very small amount, just a smidgen in the palm of one hand, light rub hands together, and then run your fingers through the thinning area of your DRY clean hair, just like you were &amp;#34;finger combing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and just a little gives me lots of volume!</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t apply too much, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>straight and flat iron it.</li>
            <li>I received this product for the first time as a birthday present last year.</li>
            <li>I have used the beyond the zone powder in the past, and this is similar but somehow better.</li>
            <li>Just a small amount makes a huge difference in allowing you to get the lift that you need.</li>
            <li>It works very well at a reasonsble price and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much though!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a different spray on product and have opened my eyes to try something new.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, but doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, holds strong and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thinning hair and this not only didn&#x27;t help, but even using just a small amount in the front made my hair feel greasy and waxy.</li>
            <li>One other downside is that it can be a bit more difficult than many other styling products to shampoo out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wear hair extensions and this stuff really helps hide it and keep the clips from slipping off.</li>
            <li>so it is natural for me to do this to get out tangles before actually combing and brushing it.  </li>
            <li>Be careful how much you use.</li>
            <li>You do have to be extremely careful to not use too much though.</li>
            <li>You need to be careful with how much you use.</li>
            <li>You can use it for kind of a casual &#x27;bedhead&#x27; look.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair that literally hangs plastered to my head if left to itself to dry, with no product.  </li>
            <li>If you do it more than once or too heavily you will get a flattened heavy greasy</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned at first when buying as some of the reviews stated it might be a knock off.  </li>
            <li>It does make your hair feel dry, but the benefit far out weighs the drawback.</li>
            <li>so my hair is not flat on my head</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather just use dry shampoo and not mess with this product.</li>
            <li>As someone with thin fine hair I need a product that will hold.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thinner hair and highly sensitive skin, so finding products that work, but don&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction can be difficult.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Osis+ DOES WORK, but you have to use it sparingly and make sure you got the correct product.</li>
            <li> , this way Amazon will notice just how many people are calling \\&quot;Shenanigans!\\&quot; on this product and maybe they will either stop carrying it or look more closely into their vendors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> LOVE this for my flat fine hair!!</li>
            <li> This is NOT the original product I have used.  </li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have found it&#x27;s better to put it in my hands first and then use it to texturize my hair..</li>
            <li> The product is awesome for my fine hair, better than most other dry shampoos that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I still back-comb the crown of my hair when I&#x27;m going for more volume, but this product will forever be a favorite for all-day, natural looking volume.</li>
            <li> Incredible product that voluminizes my hair and keeps it looking hot all night long.  </li>
            <li> Bottle is small but you use just a very light dusting of it, so it&#x27;s still a great value.</li>
            <li> Just needs a few sprinkles,  very good product</li>
            <li> Also, it took a good 5 washings to get the stuff out after only applying it a couple times.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.  </li>
            <li> Overall - good</li>
            <li> Reactivate by just combing through the next day and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> It lasts for days, so make sure you shampoo really well</li>
            <li> I will spend more for it but know I am getting the real thing at Ulta.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel like its as full of gunk like the Unite powder.</li>
            <li> hair styling worthy but</li>
            <li> When you what to do something quick.</li>
            <li> This amazing product separates every hair on your head and gives you a nice covered look, so no more shiny scalp showing through.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine, poker straight hair</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, poker straight hair</li>
            <li> --that product wasn&#x27;t a fine powder, it was kinda chunky, and it didn&#x27;t style my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair that lays completely flat to my scalp -- not so attractive on me and my big skull.  </li>
            <li> Keeps your hair full because it&#x27;s very, very sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing price and will last me awhile.  </li>
            <li> My hair definitely looks amazing when I use this product.</li>
            <li> so I think it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> The perfect thing to use when you have but oily and thin hair.</li>
            <li> Real stuff is much tackier and works 1000x better.</li>
            <li> product would be great for costuming where you need your hair to be stiff and</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast too!</li>
            <li> If your hair lays too flat against your head or if it&#x27;s too straight this is a great product that provides a kind of tackiness and lift that will let you loft the hair up a bit and make it easier to style without using any other product.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this powder, as I love all their other products.</li>
            <li> It adds just the amount of &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; right where you want it.</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to get the right product to fix THAT problem...</li>
            <li> Once I started using the clarifying shampoo when I had this in my hair, it came right out.  </li>
            <li> fluffs right up.</li>
            <li> Washes right out</li>
            <li> It gave my hair major static and almost had a damp/moist feel to it.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve found that the method that works best for me to obtain volume at the roots is to sprinkle a tiny amount directly on the specific root areas of your hair and then work it through with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and only use it to create volume for up-dos.</li>
            <li> Received it super fast also.</li>
            <li> My stylist first used this on me in the salon, so I ordered some.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product and use it almost daily!</li>
            <li> and it really helps thicken my hair, worth a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff really gives you lift!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> First of all, the bottle is about the length of my thumb.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what is says it dies.</li>
            <li> I think think is a great option for people with thick hair.</li>
            <li> You have to do this in sections, so it takes a tiny bit longer; but I found that it worked much better for me that way.</li>
            <li> I first knew of this product reading about celebrities using OSIS</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would but it again!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this off Amazon</li>
            <li> (P.S. I&#x27;ve tried a different brand before, but found that Osis is Osis :)</li>
            <li> , the second block is at the top flap of the box.</li>
            <li> Okay so it feels gross in your hair-</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> It holds your tease very well and washes right out.</li>
            <li> Much prefer big Sexy hair brand powder</li>
            <li> It adds very little volume but good for oily scalp.</li>
            <li> I had my hopes up with this after reading a lot of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> The name Schwarzkopf is very small on the packaging Also, the cap is more rounded on the top edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in the the very hot, very humid south</li>
            <li> I live in the the very hot, very humid south</li>
            <li> Instant thickness and makes it so easy to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the stuff for a few years and I love it!</li>
            <li> The next time I can certainly use less to get great resu&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have short, fine hair</li>
            <li> I have short, fine hair - lots</li>
            <li> Great for styling of short hair, and this little bottle lasts forever if you are applying once in the morning when you are styling.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that would give me volume without making my hair look greasy and this works really well.</li>
            <li> The profuct to me just doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much volume as was advitised for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Really does the trick</li>
            <li> HOW MUCH OR HOW LTITLE.  </li>
            <li> I have really long/thick hair</li>
            <li> and it gives me so much volume.</li>
            <li> If you use to much it will make your hair feel tacky.  </li>
            <li> And if you apply too much, this can make your scalp itch, understandably.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews regarding the fakes, but I got the real stuff.</li>
            <li> it feels like i put on too much hair spray.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was easier to brush out, it really sticks to your hair.</li>
            <li> It really gives the hair a funky texture.  </li>
            <li> I have very &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> OSIS really thickens the hair without making it feel gummy.</li>
            <li> Too much</li>
            <li> This stuff really helps to thicken hair and makes it manageable.</li>
            <li> I also posted a picture of what the REAL product looks like.</li>
            <li> Just bought the three pack because I keep buying it over again and was spending too much money.</li>
            <li> I did not like the product as too much powdery.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff for the hold and look.</li>
            <li> I have used the product once however, I used to much.  </li>
            <li> It gives body to hair without haveing to tease your hair so much.  </li>
            <li> Have used before and it works great with thin, unteaseable hair.</li>
            <li> You no longer see the powder, but your hair feels REALLY</li>
            <li> This is the real Dust It.  </li>
            <li> This seller has the real Dust It</li>
            <li> i know i will order more in the near future.</li>
            <li> The miracle for flat, fine hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff fixed that problem!!!  </li>
            <li> Its like a more subtle form of hairspray except no clumps and flakes! :)</li>
            <li> 1 block covers 2/3 of the clear box from the right side</li>
            <li> I bought this last year and this year as well, and both meet the description given for the original.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so much easier to work with, particularly for any up-dos.</li>
            <li> I dont understand how it works, but add body/height - such a cool product</li>
            <li> I apply directly to my hair, not in my hands first.  </li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit gives me full hair that still moves.</li>
            <li> : Osis+ is in big bold letters running vertically on the bottle.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m glad the price is essentially the same.</li>
            <li> I have super long hair and fine up top, so I have always had a tough time teasing and giving my hair body and volume.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, will buy again.</li>
            <li> It takes very little to give good body to your hair and holds the curl all day and into the next.</li>
            <li> It is also great because you just mess up your ends a little throughout the day/night and</li>
            <li> There were some negative comments about the seller saying that it the product was a knock off, but what I received was the real deal and highly recommend to all those ladies or gents with fine hair!</li>
            <li> My stylist tells me it&#x27;s thick, but fine (I laugh every time they call my hair \\&quot;thick\\&quot;--</li>
            <li> and Osis+ can get gummy feeling if you use too much and if the humidity is above 90% which is most of the summer/fall down</li>
            <li> and Osis+ can get gummy feeling if you use too much and if the humidity is above 90% which is most of the summer/fall down</li>
            <li> Love it minus the gritty feeling.</li>
            <li> Works great, but leaves hair a little stiff.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Apparently the dealer must have gotten hold of some knockoff, because this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I have grey hair and it blends right in.  </li>
            <li> But once I did, its a quick sprinkle and fluff</li>
            <li> This product seems to work at first, but then my hair falls flat.</li>
            <li> the left side of the packaging is a large Osis+ in silver running vertically up the the box.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, thin hair, and even with the nastiest stickiest hairsprays, I can&#x27;t get my hair to hold a curl for very long.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> this little bottle will last forever though. :)</li>
            <li> OK, the photo shown on this item changes so its hard to</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine hair and a narrower head, and using this at the roots gives me volume and lift without having to undercomb and use a bunch of hair spray and have it looking stiff.  </li>
            <li> and I put directly on scalp</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve known that sooner otherwise I would have bought directly from the site.</li>
            <li> I like my hair to look soft and feel soft...</li>
            <li> but it also has the number \\&quot;23\\&quot; on it as well and that text is pixelated or looks like old dot matrix printing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is definitely not an everyday product.</li>
            <li> Place a very small amount, just a smidgen in the palm of one hand, light rub hands together, and then run your fingers through the thinning area of your DRY clean hair, just like you were &amp;#34;finger combing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and just a little gives me lots of volume!</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t apply too much, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> straight and flat iron it.</li>
            <li> I received this product for the first time as a birthday present last year.</li>
            <li> I have used the beyond the zone powder in the past, and this is similar but somehow better.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount makes a huge difference in allowing you to get the lift that you need.</li>
            <li> It works very well at a reasonsble price and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different spray on product and have opened my eyes to try something new.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, holds strong and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thinning hair and this not only didn&#x27;t help, but even using just a small amount in the front made my hair feel greasy and waxy.</li>
            <li> One other downside is that it can be a bit more difficult than many other styling products to shampoo out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear hair extensions and this stuff really helps hide it and keep the clips from slipping off.</li>
            <li> so it is natural for me to do this to get out tangles before actually combing and brushing it.  </li>
            <li> Be careful how much you use.</li>
            <li> You do have to be extremely careful to not use too much though.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful with how much you use.</li>
            <li> You can use it for kind of a casual &#x27;bedhead&#x27; look.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair that literally hangs plastered to my head if left to itself to dry, with no product.  </li>
            <li> If you do it more than once or too heavily you will get a flattened heavy greasy</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned at first when buying as some of the reviews stated it might be a knock off.  </li>
            <li> It does make your hair feel dry, but the benefit far out weighs the drawback.</li>
            <li> so my hair is not flat on my head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather just use dry shampoo and not mess with this product.</li>
            <li> As someone with thin fine hair I need a product that will hold.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thinner hair and highly sensitive skin, so finding products that work, but don&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction can be difficult.</li>
            <li> If you want thick roots to give you lift, this is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Get ready for big hair with this little guy!</li>
            <li> The name and side profile icon of Schwarzkopf is on all 6 sides of the packaging and is large and dead center above the red box of text I mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> it works ok, but feels really heavy and a little gummy after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Just sprinkle on roots and rub in and voila long lasting volume.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My scalp is left with a strange residue feeling that i have to shampoo out in the shower.</li>
            <li> but it lays flat.</li>
            <li> Helps plump up your hair when it&#x27;s flat.</li>
            <li> Although bottle is quite small, very little is needed to add volume to fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Only thing-be careful when using as it is opaque white.</li>
            <li> If you have fine, thin hair, this is just the ticket!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African-American and no stylist could help me with my flat hair after I blow dry it</li>
            <li> It is a strange substance and takes some time to get used to using, but it works wonders for oily hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I have used Dust It for a long long time.  </li>
            <li> You can tailor how thick you want your hair by how much you put in.  </li>
            <li> You need to use it very sparingly or add it slowly.</li>
            <li> I use it only occasionally, though, because it reduces the shine of my hair and makes my hair feel a tiny bit sticky and stiff.</li>
            <li> Also, with the product in the root area, if you notice that your hair is losing volume hours later, you can simply dampen your fingers slightly and rework the product that is still there.</li>
            <li> Make sure you compare it if you think you got a fake one!</li>
            <li> So you sprinkle this white powder at the scalp (or roots of your hair) and then use your fingers to rub it back and forth a little.  </li>
            <li> I use to use spray in volume boosters which made my hair feel like straw and this product doesnt dry or damage my hair.</li>
            <li> screw dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dry to</li>
            <li> It feels dry, not oily at all.  </li>
            <li> This product takes a very small amount, whether your hairs thick or fine, you will get lots of volume.</li>
            <li> PUT SOME WHITE POWDER IN YOUR HAIR DARK HEADED PEOPLE.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is old or got moisture in it or what.  </li>
            <li> does  present as flaking scalp after some use, not sure if it is just the product clumping, or my scalp actually reacting to it.</li>
            <li> It came in the proper salon packaging and looks, smells, feels and works just like the one my hair stylist uses, but for nearly half the price.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea what is in this stuff and whether or not it&#x27;s killing me slowly, but my ordinarily flat hair gets a major volume boost with OSiS dust.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a little bit ( dusting ).</li>
            <li> Only need a little bit and it does the job.</li>
            <li> You only need a little of it.</li>
            <li> , it is so easy, I don&#x27;t think you could use it wrong, and it WORKS!  </li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived when expected.  </li>
            <li> For thin hair, not so much.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> like you spent the day on a windy desert.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a product person</li>
            <li> it is too heavy to get the same effect</li>
            <li> Wow- I could not believe how thick my thinning hair looked.</li>
            <li> a little weird- like super dry where you applied it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to ruin my style due to wet gel.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it takes practice to apply.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way and it does make your hair feel</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Remember that a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> AND IF YOUR DARK HEADED IT DULLS YOUR HAIR.  </li>
            <li> for it as you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> The name Osis+ is again small text on the left side of the box.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed, and not too expensive.  </li>
            <li> it works without being overpowering like the other hair powder products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my bangs with a round brush, then sprinkle a bit of this throughout the roots of my bangs, rub it into the roots and lift with my fingers to sit the way I want and finish with hairspray.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned, it does come in a really small bottle, but you only have to use a little bit</li>
            <li> Not worth the $12, try something else</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle but goes a long way.</li>
            <li> track.&lt;br /&gt;The photo of the item in my shopping cart is a photo of the fake one, BUT the photo on this review page is the real one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have a photo comparison on the fake versus real Osis, but I can&#x27;t upload it to this review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the fake v real photo can be seen at Makeup Alley Product reviews [...]</li>

            <li> Insane how good this stuff works.</li>
            <li> but this has it beat hands down.  </li>
            <li> When I leave my hair down, the product makes it too stringy.</li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t like the texture or slightly &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling this gives hair, but I think it&#x27;s a genius product.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give my hair any extra body, lift, fullness and just felt gross like it had a weird feeling powder in it</li>
            <li> I have bought this product previously in a salon or at ulta.  </li>
            <li> I found it on amazon slightly cheaper and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> MUCH LESS $ ON AMAZON THAN AT THE SALON.  </li>
            <li> Arrived less than 24 hrs after order placed..</li>
            <li> It was about half the cost of what I&#x27;ve paid in the salon.</li>
            <li> No matter how much or little I use</li>
            <li> I get my little</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s REALLY little FYI) bottle and sprinkle some of the powder in my hand, then onto my hair.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s clue for how little of this you need.  </li>
            <li> I was a little panicked</li>
            <li> A little dust with a little hair spray is all that&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> A little goes a loong way...</li>
            <li> To get subtle volume, all I need do is sprinkle a small amount of this along the scalp where I desire volume, rub it in and while it doesn&#x27;t give me BIG</li>
            <li> The idea is to make a messy TANGLE and that covers the baldness?</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting too heavy handed, but I can still flip it as needed.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It does get a LITTLE stiff but what do you expect.</li>
            <li> The powder is coming out clumpier than previous bottles I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> This product feels silky to the touch, but once it put in my hair it made it completely stiff and almost abrasive</li>
            <li> Not good, after use it, my hair is very dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried gels, mousses, creams, lotions, sprays and even from one source leave a little shampoo in your hair!  </li>
            <li> this powder, you lift up your hair, sprinkle it at the roots, rub it a little, and voila!</li>
            <li> it does add a little bit of volume to my hair but it leaves it feeling really hard.</li>
            <li> My hair is flat and pretty boring until I put a few sprinkles here and there at the crown.</li>
            <li> This is a really small size, though.</li>
            <li> I found this &amp;#34;osis&amp;#34;, ordered two containers, and anxiously awaited the arrival of my package in the mail.</li>
            <li> : Osis+ is a small text and runs vertical to the bottle.</li>
            <li> and it is past my shoulders for length.</li>
            <li> and it is past my shoulders for length.</li>
            <li> Stiff, sort of dull looking hair at the crown.  </li>
            <li> Just a tiny, tiny bit strategically rubbed into the base of the hairs will give it lift.</li>
            <li> Is not that hard to wash out, as some have said.</li>
            <li> At the this point, any other dry shampoo/matti dying powder would&#x27;ve made my hair look awful and flat.  </li>
            <li> make the mistake of paying a ridiculous amount for this at the hair salon.  </li>
            <li> Not a good feeling.  </li>
            <li> No more greasy bangs that plaster themselves to my forehead, no more flat bangs that look pathetic.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, even though my hair is very thick, it has no volume at the roots.  </li>
            <li> So not happy with this product and didnt so anything to my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thin hair but with this &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and never can get and keep volume in it.</li>
            <li> When I had shorter hair this gave my hair a dramatic boost.  </li>
            <li> So mad about how small the bottle was....</li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is that it is very difficult, almost impossible, to wash out of your hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so sad and thin looking).  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like it real  thick, don&#x27;t put a lot in.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this powder!</li>
            <li> The instructions on the package are vague.</li>
            <li> I was unable to get a comb through my hair without feeling I was breaking the strands.</li>
            <li> I have read the complaints about a fake product here.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, not in this economy.</li>
            <li> Take note that even Makeup Alley used the picture of the fake Osis+ as their product picture.emicals or poisons are in the fakes or it could just be powdered sugar, who knows?</li>
            <li> Take note that even Makeup Alley used the picture of the fake Osis+ as their product picture.</li>
            <li> makes your hair feel weird</li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
            <li> I bought a 3-pack at a lower price from another seller, but I think it was fake</li>
            <li> I guess if you are really desperate, it kinda works.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t set yourself up for disappointment like I did and do not order this product.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m obsessed with it!</li>
            <li> I was like the disappointed kid who received socks from his grandmother.</li>
            <li> This product was all wrong!!</li>
            <li> and I hate hairspray b/c</li>
            <li> (I did that thing where I cut bangs, HATED them because they looked greasy and stringy, grew them out--</li>
            <li> thought I&#x27;d give them another try, cut bangs, HATED them, grew them out-- cycle continues).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> Really annoying what is it a freakin tester?!</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t touch it, it makes your hair feel nasty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wow- I could not believe how thick my thinning hair looked. Use sparingly or hair will feel sticky. This product adds volume and fullness.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I have fine hair and just a little gives me lots of volume!</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that would give me volume without making my hair look greasy and this works really well. It is a strange substance and takes some time to get used to using, but it works wonders for oily hair like mine. As mentioned, it does come in a really small bottle, but you only have to use a little bit so I think it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> My stylist first used this on me in the salon, so I ordered some. IT WORKS!  Really good product that makes teasing/hold easy.  This is a really small size, though.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product and use it almost daily! It&#x27;s kind of like a pliable powder hairspray. Be careful not to use too much though!</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction. Excellent product. As described. Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> great for adding volume</li>
            <li> If you have fine, thin hair, this is just the ticket!  Just a small amount makes a huge difference in allowing you to get the lift that you need.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, you should give this product a try. It takes very little to give good body to your hair and holds the curl all day and into the next.</li>
            <li> This is my second order. I have short, fine hair and it really helps thicken my hair, worth a try. A little goes a long way and it takes practice to apply.</li>
            <li> OSIS dust it powder is awesome. Gives great volume and so easy to use. Just sprinkle on roots and rub in and voila long lasting volume. I use to use spray in volume boosters which made my hair feel like straw and this product doesnt dry or damage my hair. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I guess if you are really desperate, it kinda works.  The idea is to make a messy TANGLE and that covers the baldness?</li>
            <li> Love it on my chin lenght hair. Gives volume and texture!</li>
            <li> Does a good job of adding volume and structure.</li>
            <li> Works as described and gives my fine hair some great lift at the root.  I can go 2-3 days between shampoos if I have to.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle for teasing your hair into place!</li>
            <li> LOVE this for my flat fine hair!! It does howevere give your hair a ummmmm starch feeling maybe.</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair and massage it in, then try to get it to have some volume.  The profuct to me just doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much volume as was advitised for my hair.  No matter how much or little I use it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> uhhhhhhmazing....I&#x27;m so not hair styling worthy but my hair dresser taught me how to use this...a friggen miracle for ponytails and a 3 day hair bender. Just sprinkle it in and comb up it&#x27;s teasing with no effort. In LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> Saw this on a blog.  I have fine hair that won&#x27;t hold a style for more than 10 minutes.  This powder really works great.  Makes it look like my hair actually has some texture.  Love.</li>
            <li> This product is just okay for me. It works fairly well for the first hour or so, but for the rest of the day it makes my roots feel sticky and oily. I do use it because I haven&#x27;t found a better alternative,  but I am looking.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this gives it just the &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; it needs! A little goes a LONG way and it does make your hair feel a little weird- like super dry where you applied it. However, I can deal with the feel because it makes my hair look so much better. There were some negative comments about the seller saying that it the product was a knock off, but what I received was the real deal and highly recommend to all those ladies or gents with fine hair! Really does the trick and I got it way cheaper than my salon was selling it for...</li>
            <li> Great for styling of short hair, and this little bottle lasts forever if you are applying once in the morning when you are styling.&lt;br /&gt;It does  present as flaking scalp after some use, not sure if it is just the product clumping, or my scalp actually reacting to it. Still trying to figure that out.</li>
            <li> Product is ok...maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
            <li> love the stuff always use it</li>
            <li> So mad about how small the bottle was.... Really annoying what is it a freakin tester?! So not happy with this product and didnt so anything to my hair</li>
            <li> Saw it in YouTube on the Pixiwoo channel. Great stuff! Highly recommend it. It works and hair looks awesome. Happy!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair. This product lifts. It works. Best I&#x27;ve ever used. A little goes a long way. Only thing-be careful when using as it is opaque white. Five stars!</li>
            <li> I dont understand how it works, but add body/height - such a cool product</li>
            <li> This stuff really gives you lift! Just don&#x27;t breathe it! Is not that hard to wash out, as some have said. Just don&#x27;t over do it. And just use on roots. Wow!</li>
            <li> Works great for fine hair for a day.  Afterwards you need to wash your hair, one downfall about the product.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> MAKES YOUR HAIR FEEL LIKE DOLL HAIR .  AND I KNOW WHAT I AM DOING.  I HAVE BEEN DOING HAIR FOR 28 YEARS.  JUST DOES&#x27;NT DO IN MY HAIR .  DOES&#x27;NT MATTER HOW MUCH OR HOW LTITLE.  AND IF YOUR DARK HEADED IT DULLS YOUR HAIR.  GO AHEAD PUT SOME WHITE POWDER IN YOUR HAIR DARK HEADED PEOPLE. LOL</li>
            <li> great for wimpy hair like mine  give all the volume i need so my hair is not flat on my head</li>
            <li> Best product by far, its like hair spray in powder form. Except works 100% better. I have really long/thick hair and it gives me so much volume. You only have to use a little bit ( dusting ). If you use to much it will make your hair feel tacky.  If you know what your doing with your hair this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Magic stuff for thicker more voluminous looking hair.</li>
            <li> This one is light control.  I need the heavier control.  And if you apply too much, this can make your scalp itch, understandably.</li>
            <li> My stylist introduced me to this. I read the reviews regarding the fakes, but I got the real stuff. If you have fine hair, this gives tons of texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but not the best texturizing powder I have used and it was more expensive than the others .</li>
            <li> The power basically tethering the root of your hair to make it volume. Make sure you don&#x27;t apply too much, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible! Even for a product junkie like myself.... This is an incredible product and a must have!</li>
            <li> Honestly, the powder did what it said it would do. It put lots of volume in my very fine textured hair... however it also made it feel like I&#x27;d been camping for a week with no shower while sleeping in the dirt.  Not a good feeling.  Stiff, sort of dull looking hair at the crown.  Yes, I did apply it correctly. Had my stylist show me how and everything.  Also, it took a good 5 washings to get the stuff out after only applying it a couple times.</li>
            <li> First of all, the bottle is about the length of my thumb. it does add a little bit of volume to my hair but it leaves it feeling really hard. I put a tiny amount and I can&#x27;t even run my fingers through my hair. it feels like i put on too much hair spray. I am very disappointed with this. Not worth the $12, try something else</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well.  I love it so much.  Day two hair is much more stylish than ever before</li>
            <li> The miracle for flat, fine hair. It adds just the amount of &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34; right where you want it. Love it.</li>
            <li> it works ok, but feels really heavy and a little gummy after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! I have a short pixie cut and I put directly on scalp makes my hair stick up and gives instant volume where I want it!! Definitely will order again</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Beauty It Is, and it was delivered promptly and as described.  It came in the proper salon packaging and looks, smells, feels and works just like the one my hair stylist uses, but for nearly half the price.  I have lots of fine hair and a narrower head, and using this at the roots gives me volume and lift without having to undercomb and use a bunch of hair spray and have it looking stiff.  Some people don&#x27;t like the texture or slightly &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling this gives hair, but I think it&#x27;s a genius product.  My hair is still flexible, and has texture at the roots, and when I want to refresh the volume, I just tousle at the roots with my fingers and the volume and lift is renewed.  Why pay an exorbitant price when you don&#x27;t need to?  Excellent product and customer service!</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. It does the trick and It leaves your hair in place and with volume.</li>
            <li> I have used Dust It for a long long time.  It make your hair easy to tease and blends it well. Remember that a little bit goes a long way.  If you don&#x27;t wash your hair the next day, you do not have to reapply, you cant just touch up your tease.  I just wish it was easier to brush out, it really sticks to your hair.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what is says it dies. I bought it to mattify an overly shiny wig  and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Overall - good</li>
            <li> Insane how good this stuff works. Only need a little bit and it does the job. Highly recommend, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Arrived when expected.  It was what I had hoped for.  My wife was happy with the purchase, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> The powder is coming out clumpier than previous bottles I have used in the past.  Not sure if it is old or got moisture in it or what.  Still able to use it the product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product I had this product and could not find it anywhere but here I&#x27;m glad I got it the only thing I did not like is that Amazon took points from my Citibank account and used my points instead of my money. I wish I would&#x27;ve known that sooner otherwise I would have bought directly from the site. Happy with the product though ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> This stuff works ok.  It really gives the hair a funky texture.  I like my hair to look soft and feel soft... and this doesn&#x27;t leave it that way.  But it does what it says, plumps up the roots, and gives you volume.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, but it&#x27;s a trade off for the greasiest hair you&#x27;ll ever have. I would say it&#x27;s the equivalent of not washing your hair for 9 days. You only need a teeny tiny bit but I would suggest dusting it on just before you head out for the evening.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!!</li>
            <li> Not good, after use it, my hair is very dry.</li>
            <li> I did not find that this did a thing for my hair.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different spray on product and have opened my eyes to try something new. Thank goodness I did!! I LOVE dust it. I actually apply it over my crown to give my hair body without having to tease at all! I get the beachy look and body that I&#x27;ve been dreaming of and now I&#x27;m never giving it up! There definitely is a &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; to your hair after applied and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting too heavy handed, but I can still flip it as needed.</li>
            <li> Very good product and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I received this product for the first time as a birthday present last year. Everything about it was wonderful! I didn&#x27;t even have to use hairspray to tease my hair, and being from Texas big hair is muy importante. I found myself running out of this gift from God and went out a search to find this beloved product. I found this &amp;#34;osis&amp;#34;, ordered two containers, and anxiously awaited the arrival of my package in the mail. It was like Christmas, until I opened the package. I was like the disappointed kid who received socks from his grandmother. This product was all wrong!! It gave my hair major static and almost had a damp/moist feel to it. Don&#x27;t set yourself up for disappointment like I did and do not order this product.</li>
            <li> My brother in law swears by this stuff and saw him using it and his hair look great. I get my little (it&#x27;s REALLY little FYI) bottle and sprinkle some of the powder in my hand, then onto my hair. My hair is on the thinner side and it made my hair all wiry looking. I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to stay put. I think think is a great option for people with thick hair. For thin hair, not so much.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...I use it instead of gel!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  My friend who does hair told me about it and I&#x27;m so happy she did! It</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this powder by my former hair stylist.  I have very &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; hair, it has no texture because I dont color it or use a lot of product.  Therefore, even though my hair is very thick, it has no volume at the roots.  This stuff fixed that problem!!!  The only downside to this product is that it is very difficult, almost impossible, to wash out of your hair.  It took me awhile to get the right product to fix THAT problem...I found that Neutrogena Clarifying Shampoo works the best.  When I would wash my hair, my shampoo would not lather at the roots where I had put this powder.  My hair was coming out looking very greasy and heavy after my shampoos.  Once I started using the clarifying shampoo when I had this in my hair, it came right out.  Another plus to this is that it absorbs oil so you can go without washing for a longer period, even without adding more of this to your hair.  It helps to hold a style as well.  It&#x27;s just an overall miracle powder!!!</li>
            <li> Nothing gives my hair such instant volume and separation as this OSiS Dust It Mattifying Powder. It&#x27;s great for those special times when you want a lot of lift in your hair. I use it only occasionally, though, because it reduces the shine of my hair and makes my hair feel a tiny bit sticky and stiff. One other downside is that it can be a bit more difficult than many other styling products to shampoo out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply it, you can put a tiny bit (smaller than dime size) onto your fingers, rub them together, and then rub them through your hair. However, I&#x27;ve found that the method that works best for me to obtain volume at the roots is to sprinkle a tiny amount directly on the specific root areas of your hair and then work it through with your fingers. You have to do this in sections, so it takes a tiny bit longer; but I found that it worked much better for me that way. Also, with the product in the root area, if you notice that your hair is losing volume hours later, you can simply dampen your fingers slightly and rework the product that is still there. Instant lift.</li>
            <li> I first knew of this product reading about celebrities using OSIS and I decided to try it.  I have been using Got2B but this has it beat hands down.  OSIS really thickens the hair without making it feel gummy. And another plus is that it stays in your hair. No need to reapply the next day unless you wash your hair.  It&#x27;s a small bottle but goes a long way. I apply directly to my hair, not in my hands first.  You can tailor how thick you want your hair by how much you put in.  If you don&#x27;t like it real  thick, don&#x27;t put a lot in.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair that literally hangs plastered to my head if left to itself to dry, with no product.  My stylist tells me it&#x27;s thick, but fine (I laugh every time they call my hair \\&quot;thick\\&quot;-- it&#x27;s so sad and thin looking).  I&#x27;ve been using a combination of gel, hairspray and sometimes hair glues/pomades to get my hair to look the way some of my friends&#x27; hair looks without any effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, those products never gave me the volume I wanted without a bit of back-combing at the crown and I could never ever have bangs that looked good (I did that thing where I cut bangs, HATED them because they looked greasy and stringy, grew them out-- thought I&#x27;d give them another try, cut bangs, HATED them, grew them out-- cycle continues).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product changed all of that.  To get subtle volume, all I need do is sprinkle a small amount of this along the scalp where I desire volume, rub it in and while it doesn&#x27;t give me BIG hair-- it gives me a nice lift and also keeps my roots from getting oily.  For my bangs, I FINALLY have them and they look really great.  I blow dry my bangs with a round brush, then sprinkle a bit of this throughout the roots of my bangs, rub it into the roots and lift with my fingers to sit the way I want and finish with hairspray.  No more greasy bangs that plaster themselves to my forehead, no more flat bangs that look pathetic.  I still back-comb the crown of my hair when I&#x27;m going for more volume, but this product will forever be a favorite for all-day, natural looking volume.</li>
            <li> Good stuff- great volume through the day</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all.  It made my hair sticky.  It felt like cotton candy.  It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It works very well at a reasonsble price and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> feels alittle funny before you get used to it - works good - don&#x27;t use too much....</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a magazine while waiting of all things for my hair to be cut yet shorter so that I could again have some body to my hair.  I have super fine hair that lays completely flat to my scalp -- not so attractive on me and my big skull.  So I&#x27;m always looking for the magical product that will give my hair some lift.  I&#x27;ve tried gels, mousses, creams, lotions, sprays and even from one source leave a little shampoo in your hair!  Nothing has worked as well as this.  The bottle is tiny.  I think the smallest photo you&#x27;d see on the website is bigger than actual size.  That&#x27;s clue for how little of this you need.  Too much and you won&#x27;t be able to run a comb through your hair.  Just a tiny, tiny bit strategically rubbed into the base of the hairs will give it lift.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like. Expect to reapply and restyle in 2-4 hours. As with any mattifying powder, expect it to leave your hair looking and feeling like you spent the day on a windy desert.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would but it again! The company is nice to deal with and offers a good price for Osis</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and loved the results. My hair is flat and pretty boring until I put a few sprinkles here and there at the crown. Instant thickness and makes it so easy to do. It beefs up the texture without changing the color even though its s powder. I also use Lanza hair taffy but after trying this I like it much better! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> YUK!  I have fine, thinning hair and this not only didn&#x27;t help, but even using just a small amount in the front made my hair feel greasy and waxy.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned at first when buying as some of the reviews stated it might be a knock off.  Was happy to find out its the real thing. This stuff really helps to thicken hair and makes it manageable. You only need a little of it.</li>
            <li> seems to thicken my sons hair quite a bit. keeps the styled shape and feels thicker without a sticky residue</li>
            <li> Puts the volume in your hair, use sparingly.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for lift!</li>
            <li> This did not work for me, didn&#x27;t do what it claims. It didn&#x27;t give my hair any extra body, lift, fullness and just felt gross like it had a weird feeling powder in it that I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash out. I tried all different amounts of the product and it was not beneficial in any way.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all.  It made my hair gummy.  For the rest of the day I could not run my hands through my hair because it felt tangled.  It&#x27;s also not that easy to shampoo out. I used it that one time and then threw it out.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This  is awesome for volume and it lasts all day long!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted and it came so fast and at a great price.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this powder! I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine. In order to get my hair closer to Jesus, I dust my roots and it gives the perfect amount of &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; I need.</li>
            <li> So awesome for getting that teased look without causing damage to your hair. Does give your hair a hair spray feeling texture but so great for a night out.</li>
            <li> best product ever for someone with fine hair</li>
            <li> Great product. Strong hold without the stickiness. A tiny bit goes a long way. Reactivate by just combing through the next day and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product which I&#x27;ve used for years. For thinner, flat or fine hair, it creates incredible volume. It makes my hair so much easier to work with, particularly for any up-dos. I love this powder!</li>
            <li> Great product! A little goes a long way, holds strong and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is some magic powder right here. It. The perfect thing to use when you have but oily and thin hair. It&#x27;s been 5 days since I washed my hair and it still looks as awesome as it did the first day!! At the this point, any other dry shampoo/matti dying powder would&#x27;ve made my hair look awful and flat.  And it&#x27;s AMAZING at volumizing my hair. I wear hair extensions and this stuff really helps hide it and keep the clips from slipping off. I also posted a picture of what the REAL product looks like. Make sure you compare it if you think you got a fake one!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, really adds volume.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product previously in a salon or at ulta.  I found it on amazon slightly cheaper and decided to give it a try.  This is NOT the original product I have used.  It left my hair sticky and greasy.  I threw it in the trash...</li>
            <li> The product is awesome for my fine hair, better than most other dry shampoos that I&#x27;ve used.  Don&#x27;t use too much!</li>
            <li> luv it and use it all the time.  u must b careful not to use to much but excellent product for fine hair as it gives it a lot of body.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Allows me to style my hair with body and texture.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for lifting roots, but a little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> AMAZING. screw dry shampoos. This. is. the. only. thing. you. need. If you want thick roots to give you lift, this is worth the money. Just sprinkle, ruffle and go. Lasts all day. You can also add it to the ends of your hair, (esp if you have curls) to thicken it up. Love love. Just bought the three pack because I keep buying it over again and was spending too much money.</li>
            <li> This product should be used with care. The instructions on the package are vague. I suggest a u-tube tutorial before using. I lightly sprinkled the shaker on my fine hair. It immediately felt like the strands had been glued together. I was unable to get a comb through my hair without feeling I was breaking the strands. I was a little panicked but it did was out well. The rest is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel sticky and like you can&#x27;t do anything with it.</li>
            <li> I did not like the product as too much powdery.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Adds extra body where you need it!</li>
            <li> My stylist had used this product on me.  I am very pleased with this product, works great on short hair keeping it full.</li>
            <li> USE THIS EVERY DAY.  MUCH LESS $ ON AMAZON THAN AT THE SALON.  THE VOLUME YOU GET IS EXCELLENT AND WASHS OUT EASILY WITH NO RESIDUE.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It gives lift and texture to my fine hair. If it starts to fall a bit I can rub the roots a bit and restore the lift. It is the best product I have tried for lift at the roots!</li>
            <li> My daughter is an all star cheerleader and this is the best matifying powder I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Arrived less than 24 hrs after order placed.. Great product</li>
            <li> Great product. Great service</li>
            <li> Perfect pick me up for hair trying to go flat.</li>
            <li> If your hair lays too flat against your head or if it&#x27;s too straight this is a great product that provides a kind of tackiness and lift that will let you loft the hair up a bit and make it easier to style without using any other product. You can use it for kind of a casual &#x27;bedhead&#x27; look. Really nice and works all day. Ruffle your hair to &#x27;refresh&#x27; it.  Bottle is small but you use just a very light dusting of it, so it&#x27;s still a great value.</li>
            <li> Rumors of not being able to order the genuine product scared me but i ordered anyway. It&#x27;s the real deal! Great product, gives lots of volume that lasts until you shampoo it out.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for six years. It&#x27;s my go to product for extra texture and oomph. Just make sure when you sprinkle into your roots to blend in well or else you&#x27;ll left with white dust. It lasts for days, so make sure you shampoo really well when wanting it out. :)</li>
            <li> It adds very little volume but good for oily scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the stuff for a few years and I love it! I have fine, thinner hair and highly sensitive skin, so finding products that work, but don&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction can be difficult. I use this powder to add volume and some hold and then use a volumizing spray to set my style. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this off Amazon and I was not disappointed. It was about half the cost of what I&#x27;ve paid in the salon. The packaging was intact and didn&#x27;t cause any concern. Love this stuff! (P.S. I&#x27;ve tried a different brand before, but found that Osis is Osis :)</li>
            <li> makes my hair do something, I have baby fine hair</li>
            <li> You definitely only need the tiniest bit.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Adds body to my hair.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I had my hopes up with this after reading a lot of positive reviews. This product seems to work at first, but then my hair falls flat. My scalp is left with a strange residue feeling that i have to shampoo out in the shower. I&#x27;d rather just use dry shampoo and not mess with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! If you want some oomph in your hair that will stay all day this is it folks. This is my 4th bottle over many years.&lt;br /&gt;Go for it as you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff for the hold and look. Just don&#x27;t touch it, it makes your hair feel nasty. So if you want to be romantic and get a head caress think twice on using this. But the look is fabulous.</li>
            <li> my favorite product for texture!!</li>
            <li> When you what to do something quick. Dust your hair.</li>
            <li> This is amazing it keeps it&#x27;s hold and it&#x27;s dry to I don&#x27;t have to ruin my style due to wet gel.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Shipping was super fast too!</li>
            <li> Still playing around with it, but so far so good...</li>
            <li> This amazing product separates every hair on your head and gives you a nice covered look, so no more shiny scalp showing through.  Do it only ONCE just after you wash and dry.&lt;br /&gt; My hairdresser introduced me to it,  and showed me how to apply. Place a very small amount, just a smidgen in the palm of one hand, light rub hands together, and then run your fingers through the thinning area of your DRY clean hair, just like you were &amp;#34;finger combing&amp;#34; it.&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly curly hair so it is natural for me to do this to get out tangles before actually combing and brushing it.  Then comb lightly through your hair.  Once it is applied, it will last until the next washing. If you do it more than once or too heavily you will get a flattened heavy greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is also very dry fine hair, and this works wonderfully. Medium auburn hair and shows not at all. I have read the complaints about a fake product here.  Apparently the dealer must have gotten hold of some knockoff, because this is the real thing. I bought this last year and this year as well, and both meet the description given for the original.</li>
            <li> Works great, but leaves hair a little stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thin hair but with this &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; I lðŸ‘€k like I&#x27;ve got tons of hair. Just scrape fingers thru hair with the dust in it and it plumps/fluffs right up.</li>
            <li> This works, but cover all the holes but one with tape and brush it through with a bristle brush...takes some practice!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about this and I got it to try. It works great. I love it and would recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> Love this. Produces great texture and volume.</li>
            <li> OK, the photo shown on this item changes so its hard to track.&lt;br /&gt;The photo of the item in my shopping cart is a photo of the fake one, BUT the photo on this review page is the real one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like rolling the dice and taking your chances. Sorry, not in this economy. I will spend more for it but know I am getting the real thing at Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a photo comparison on the fake versus real Osis, but I can&#x27;t upload it to this review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to explain them.&lt;br /&gt;FAKE: Osis+ is a small text and runs vertical to the bottle. The text description of the product also runs vertical on the bottle. The number 1 is on the bottle but it also has the number \\&quot;23\\&quot; on it as well and that text is pixelated or looks like old dot matrix printing. The packaging (box) has photos of a blonde, short haired girl and a darker, short haired man. The name Osis+ is again small text on the left side of the box. The Dot Matrix 23 is on all 6 sides on the box. The name Schwarzkopf is very small on the packaging Also, the cap is more rounded on the top edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REAL: Osis+ is in big bold letters running vertically on the bottle. The product description does not. It runs horizontally to the bottle. There is a number \\&quot;1\\&quot; but it is next to the product description and the number&#x27;s font is in outline.&lt;br /&gt;There are no 23&#x27;s anywhere on it. The packaging has no pictures but has 2 red blocks with the white/gray/silver description of the product from the bottle printed on them. 1 block covers 2/3 of the clear box from the right side, the second block is at the top flap of the box. The name and side profile icon of Schwarzkopf is on all 6 sides of the packaging and is large and dead center above the red box of text I mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;On the left side of the packaging is a large Osis+ in silver running vertically up the the box. mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Osis+ DOES WORK, but you have to use it sparingly and make sure you got the correct product. Who knows what kind of chemicals or poisons are in the fakes or it could just be powdered sugar, who knows? I have baby fine, poker straight hair and it is past my shoulders for length. I refuse to get a shorty haircut just because that is what stylists want you to with fine hair. Bull. Osis+ gives me lift at the roots which is what I need and if I put some curl in the ends, I keep them there with Aussie Freeze Spray. I live in the the very hot, very humid south and Osis+ can get gummy feeling if you use too much and if the humidity is above 90% which is most of the summer/fall down here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly is, if you get it, DO NOT JUST THROW IT AWAY!! Contact Amazon and get your money back, this way Amazon will notice just how many people are calling \\&quot;Shenanigans!\\&quot; on this product and maybe they will either stop carrying it or look more closely into their vendors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you.&lt;br /&gt;PS the fake v real photo can be seen at Makeup Alley Product reviews [...]&lt;br /&gt;The photo, at the time of this posting, was photo #3. Take note that even Makeup Alley used the picture of the fake Osis+ as their product picture.emicals or poisons are in the fakes or it could just be powdered sugar, who knows?

            <li> I have used the product once however, I used to much.  The next time I can certainly use less to get great resu&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carolyn A. Stout</li>
            <li> At my last salon appointment, the stylist used this product so I found it on Amazon and ordered it.  I love it, it is so easy, I don&#x27;t think you could use it wrong, and it WORKS!  Great seller, great price - would definitely recommend the product and will definitely order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this powder, as I love all their other products. This product feels silky to the touch, but once it put in my hair it made it completely stiff and almost abrasive feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would be great for costuming where you need your hair to be stiff and not move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely not an everyday product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before in Europe, and was determine to find it here in the U.S is perfect for short hair I was already a fan. i&#x27;m glad the price is essentially the same.</li>
            <li> Great for that added volume! I have super long hair and fine up top, so I have always had a tough time teasing and giving my hair body and volume. I couldn&#x27;t believe how quick and easy this was. This is a must!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and this is a re-order.  It gives body to hair without haveing to tease your hair so much.  I have grey hair and it blends right in.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> Incredible product that voluminizes my hair and keeps it looking hot all night long.  It&#x27;s an amazing price and will last me awhile.  Only downside is having to wash it out of my hair as I don&#x27;t like to sleep with product in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African-American and no stylist could help me with my flat hair after I blow dry it straight and flat iron it. This product solves the volume problem I&#x27;ve had for years!!! Just a tiny bit gives me full hair that still moves. My daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li> Although bottle is quite small, very little is needed to add volume to fine hair.  I have very fine hair and this is an excellent product to add volume that lasts all day.  This is a must have for fine hair.</li>
            <li> love this. I have short, fine hair - lots is it but it lays flat. With the dust it gives a lot of volume without greasiness.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed, and not too expensive.  I have Asian hair and as soon as you wash it, fros out like a bowl. This is awesome and I shower more- girlfriend is happy lol&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I used my styling wand and then sprinkled this on my curls afterwards.  Held my curls and made my hair seem thinking.  Just amazing!!!  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> Love it minus the gritty feeling. Have used before and it works great with thin, unteaseable hair. Washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Okay so it feels gross in your hair- but all teasing powder does. The most important thing is this stuff works! It holds your tease very well and washes right out.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and never can get and keep volume in it. This product rocks. I use it every day. And it delivers volume.  Be careful how much you use. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I actually purchased this item before. I then bought two of these for my girlfriends and they loved it too. Helps plump up your hair when it&#x27;s flat. It does get a LITTLE stiff but what do you expect. Its like a more subtle form of hairspray except no clumps and flakes! :)</li>
            <li> The best hair powder I have found! It holds and you can still style manage your hair it works without being overpowering like the other hair powder products I&#x27;ve tried. Try this one first you&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
            <li> makes your hair feel weird</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Received it super fast also. I was using Unite powder, but my hairdresser recently used this on my hair... and now I&#x27;m obsessed with it! So much better than Unite. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel like its as full of gunk like the Unite powder. I can easily go 3 days with my hair looking fab, holds my waves, full of volume.. and that&#x27;s with going to the gym! Love love love!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> Did not like. Made my hair staticky and sticky. Much prefer big Sexy hair brand powder</li>
            <li> great product, im glad i ordered this item. i know i will order more in the near future. woot woot</li>
            <li> Very good product and seller.</li>
            <li> THIS IS &amp;#34;QUITE&amp;#34; EXCELLENT....IF YOU HAVE FINE HAIR....JUST A TOUCH HERE &amp; THERE...SUDDENTLY, YOU HAVE A FULLER HAIR....COOL!!!!</li>
            <li> Best dust it powder!!</li>
            <li> Gives great body to my fine hair, I love it!!</li>
            <li> As someone with thin fine hair I need a product that will hold. Dust It does just that. It does make your hair feel dry, but the benefit far out weighs the drawback.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I&#x27;m not much of a product person and I hate hairspray b/c it&#x27;s so sticky and the buildup in the bathroom gets aweful. My hairdresser introduced this to me and I have been hooked ever since. I use this as a volumizer around my crown and get the lift without the use of aerosols.</li>
            <li> Great price! great product!</li>
            <li> This product takes a very small amount, whether your hairs thick or fine, you will get lots of volume. Do not over use, if you do, you won&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Never have been able to fix my hair and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot if time, but this makes it so easy! A little dust with a little hair spray is all that&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> makes hair feel thicker and fulller</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It gives my hair a bit of lift to make it look fuller.  You do have to be extremely careful to not use too much though.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It makes my thin/fine hair look great.  You need to use it very sparingly or add it slowly.</li>
            <li> Love it!... But it inches my scalp a lil</li>
            <li> Great hair product. Good price..have fine hair but give my hair some fullness and allows me to style it and it stays</li>
            <li> Using this product helps me get the same look as when I leave the salon.  It took some experimentation to get the correct amount for the desired effect. But once I did, its a quick sprinkle and fluff and I&#x27;m out the door.</li>
            <li> I have never seen any product like this before.  It is a powder that dissolves when you rub it.  So you sprinkle this white powder at the scalp (or roots of your hair) and then use your fingers to rub it back and forth a little.  You no longer see the powder, but your hair feels REALLY different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have fine, straight, thin hair, and even with the nastiest stickiest hairsprays, I can&#x27;t get my hair to hold a curl for very long.&lt;br /&gt;With this powder, you lift up your hair, sprinkle it at the roots, rub it a little, and voila! Your hair now feels a bit like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;matted,&amp;#34; but in a good way. It feels dry, not oily at all.  It sort of holds the hair together to help give it lift.  It is amazing stuff! No powdery residue!  Washes right out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the mistake of paying a ridiculous amount for this at the hair salon.  Get it on line and save!</li>
            <li> Fake. Real stuff is much tackier and works 1000x better. Avoid this seller.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair full because it&#x27;s very, very sticky. You need to be careful with how much you use. I have very fine hair and only use it to create volume for up-dos. When I leave my hair down, the product makes it too stringy.</li>
            <li> Love it!! My hair definitely looks amazing when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Adds instant texture and volume. Just needs a few sprinkles,  very good product</li>
            <li> I have no idea what is in this stuff and whether or not it&#x27;s killing me slowly, but my ordinarily flat hair gets a major volume boost with OSiS dust. It doesn&#x27;t wash out easily with shampoo but seems to be more soluble in conditioner. It&#x27;s pixie dust for your roots stand on end.</li>
            <li> Get ready for big hair with this little guy!</li>
            <li> This is the real Dust It.  I bought a 3-pack at a lower price from another seller, but I think it was fake--that product wasn&#x27;t a fine powder, it was kinda chunky, and it didn&#x27;t style my hair very well. This seller has the real Dust It and I learned my lesson.  Definitely recommend this seller!  Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Whoo! A little goes a loong way... I have used the beyond the zone powder in the past, and this is similar but somehow better. I have found it&#x27;s better to put it in my hands first and then use it to texturize my hair.. this little bottle will last forever though. :)</li>
            <li> When I had shorter hair this gave my hair a dramatic boost.  It is also great because you just mess up your ends a little throughout the day/night and it&#x27;s like you just applied it.  Now that my hair is longer it is too heavy to get the same effect but it&#x27;s great for giving your roots some oomph while styling an updo!</li>
