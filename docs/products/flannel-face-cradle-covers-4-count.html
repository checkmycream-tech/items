            <li>Great price too!</li>
            <li>I am in massage school and they are perfect for using with clients at clinic.</li>
            <li>I plan on replacing the Velcro when needed, because these are nice covers!!</li>
            <li>but these are real nice.</li>
            <li>and they have held up great</li>
            <li>, they fit my cover, I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li>The material was nice</li>
            <li>It fits perfect and its very soft.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of the close fitting cover however there is a seam along the inside that</li>
            <li>Some fit perfect while others scrunch the headrest too much.  </li>
            <li>They fit perfectly on my face cradle and are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>but these covers have a piece of cloth with Velcro ends that keeps the headrest cover in place the Velcro pieces are made very cheap.</li>
            <li>: Thickness, softness&lt;br /&gt;Con: very cheap Velcro</li>
            <li>i love them and my clients also love how soft they are and they fit perfect.</li>
            <li>will order more soon</li>
            <li>The strap is an interesting feature .</li>
            <li>I have bought MANY that don&#x27;t fit well!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found anything I like better though.</li>
            <li>These face rest covers are very soft, great quality, they wash well</li>
            <li>These fit ok over the face rest on my massage table, but I do not have a padded fleece cover underneath.</li>
            <li>They wash easily too.</li>
            <li>Fit nicely, able to use the Velcro to secure them</li>
            <li>Just as a previous reviewer perfectly clarified - these are NOT 95%</li>
            <li>These fit the face cradles and wash without shrinking.</li>
            <li>all that said, if you still find them desirable, they are cheap... and they are serviceable otherwise.</li>
            <li>i appreciate the ease of use and fit</li>
            <li>They have probably lasted at least 25 washings and most of them are still perfect.</li>
            <li>Since I was all my linens in hot water, and this causes more shrinkage, I have to stretch these manually each washing.  </li>
            <li>When I washed these the lint trap barely had any lint in it from them, so that is a good thing as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will have to go with my original idea and get Jersey Cotton pillow cases and/or sheets and cut/sew the patterns myself.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft!</li>
            <li>Cost effective, soft and very well fitting on face rest.  </li>
            <li>The package came quickly.</li>
            <li>Why more people aren&#x27;t mentioning this huge drawback to this product makes me suspicious of the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; reviews, especially the reviewers who say they are &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; masseuses.</li>
            <li>Good quality and comfortable, but I really don&#x27;t like the Velcro strap in the center.  </li>
            <li>The right price, but I would not buy again.</li>
            <li>These are very soft, however the Velcro is pretty cheap on them.</li>
            <li>These fit very well and are soft.</li>
            <li>These covers are crappy material and WAY too small, definitely don&#x27;t fit with fleece pad on face rest and doesn&#x27;t even fit without it!</li>
            <li>Sounds like a great idea, but hard to put on, and no more effective than the ones I have without the Velcro.</li>
            <li>These are nice, but should be a little bit wider for thicker memory foam face rests.</li>
            <li>My clients really like them.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really tell from the description or pictures online</li>
            <li>2 stars for [very soft].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They seem to be made very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>If at all possible I would recommend these kind of headrest covers, just without the extra piece of cloth and Velcro.&lt;br /&gt;Pro</li>
            <li>I ordered these for my massage table for my office, as a massage therapist I need very soft but very durable headrest covers.</li>
            <li>I love the headrest covers due to their softness and thickness, however the Velcro is sure to finally &#x27;give out&#x27; in the near future.</li>
            <li>Also had a learning curve to put them on the headrest, didn&#x27;t quite fit as expected.</li>
            <li>It has an extra piece sewn into the material right at the forehead area - to attach a velcro tab to hold it on the face cradle.  </li>
            <li>The product fits my face very well - not loose and doesn&#x27;t move.  </li>
            <li>I like that it has a Velcro strap because it helps make it fit tight and this means it will not leave a crease on your clients face.</li>
            <li>The first time I washed them the Velcro was already fairly loose.</li>
            <li>it barely fits over my headrest without any padding on it!  </li>
            <li>The flannel is of OK quality not great.  </li>
            <li>I have a thick headrest, so these don&#x27;t fit as well as I would like.</li>
            <li>The sides are too short, the velcro barely reaches the opposite side, and the cut is such that there are always creases in the fabric that hit the client&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again.</li>

            <li> I have taken to washing with warm water - not hot or cold - and they maintained their shape through several washings so far.</li>
            <li> Also these headrest covers are pretty snug on my headrest as well, it makes it rather hard to get the wrinkles out.</li>
            <li> However the real issue is that the size is small.  </li>
            <li> As long as you are careful sticking the Velcro back together when you throw in the washer</li>

            <li> They are a stark white, I expected the bone color pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not consistent in size.</li>
            <li> Too Small for regular face rest..</li>
            <li> They are a thick fleece that has a velcro attachment in the middle.</li>
            <li> The Velcro is starting to fail on my covers, but I have had them for a long time and wash them often.</li>
            <li> These do not fit my head cradle correctly, and it&#x27;s not oversized.  </li>
            <li> Probably would do well with a small headrest.</li>
            <li> when my clients are laying down it hits there eye lids and becomes uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad they don&#x27;t show it in the product pics; I feel like I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These fit very well and are soft.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of the close fitting cover however there is a seam along the inside that when my clients are laying down it hits there eye lids and becomes uncomfortable. So I have been placing a facial tissue in the middle to cover up the seam. Will not be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> These fit the face cradles and wash without shrinking. I have taken to washing with warm water - not hot or cold - and they maintained their shape through several washings so far.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was almost regretting my purchase but these are real nice. I do about 25 sessions a week and they have held up great would buy again!</li>
            <li> These face rest covers are very soft, great quality, they wash well, they fit my cover, I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> These covers are crappy material and WAY too small, definitely don&#x27;t fit with fleece pad on face rest and doesn&#x27;t even fit without it! Horrible.</li>
            <li> These are nice, but should be a little bit wider for thicker memory foam face rests.</li>
            <li> These do not fit my head cradle correctly, and it&#x27;s not oversized.  The sides are too short, the velcro barely reaches the opposite side, and the cut is such that there are always creases in the fabric that hit the client&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> The flannel is of OK quality not great.  However the real issue is that the size is small.  it barely fits over my headrest without any padding on it!  the velcro is taxed to keep attached.  Since I was all my linens in hot water, and this causes more shrinkage, I have to stretch these manually each washing.  This and the fact that I cannot use them with my fleece pads, limits their usefulness.  Also the are not the color pictured.  They are a stark white, I expected the bone color pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said, if you still find them desirable, they are cheap... and they are serviceable otherwise.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t order enough of these! i love them and my clients also love how soft they are and they fit perfect. will order more soon</li>
            <li> Not consistent in size. Some fit perfect while others scrunch the headrest too much.  The strap is an interesting feature .</li>
            <li> Work great!  Wash well.  Nice and soft!</li>
            <li> It fits perfect and its very soft. I like that it has a Velcro strap because it helps make it fit tight and this means it will not leave a crease on your clients face. As long as you are careful sticking the Velcro back together when you throw in the washer they should last you a while. Great price too!</li>
            <li> The package came quickly. The product fits my face very well - not loose and doesn&#x27;t move.  My clients really like them.</li>
            <li> These covers are very disappointing; unusable because of a very pronounced, raised seam right where the customer lays their face, at around eye or eyebrow level!  The seam leaves deep marks on the users face.  It&#x27;s too bad they don&#x27;t show it in the product pics; I feel like I wasted my money.  Why more people aren&#x27;t mentioning this huge drawback to this product makes me suspicious of the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; reviews, especially the reviewers who say they are &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; masseuses.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my massage table for my office, as a massage therapist I need very soft but very durable headrest covers. These are very soft, however the Velcro is pretty cheap on them. You can&#x27;t really tell from the description or pictures online but these covers have a piece of cloth with Velcro ends that keeps the headrest cover in place the Velcro pieces are made very cheap. I love the headrest covers due to their softness and thickness, however the Velcro is sure to finally &#x27;give out&#x27; in the near future. The first time I washed them the Velcro was already fairly loose. Also these headrest covers are pretty snug on my headrest as well, it makes it rather hard to get the wrinkles out. When I washed these the lint trap barely had any lint in it from them, so that is a good thing as well.  If at all possible I would recommend these kind of headrest covers, just without the extra piece of cloth and Velcro.&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Thickness, softness&lt;br /&gt;Con: very cheap Velcro</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly on my face cradle and are nice and soft. I would recommend them. They wash easily too.</li>
            <li> Just as a previous reviewer perfectly clarified - these are NOT 95% pre-shrunk cotton - they are 100% Polyester.  I too purchased these because of cost friendliness and the advertised material.  Very disappointed.  2 stars for [very soft].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to go with my original idea and get Jersey Cotton pillow cases and/or sheets and cut/sew the patterns myself.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t what they look like. They are a thick fleece that has a velcro attachment in the middle. I have a thick headrest, so these don&#x27;t fit as well as I would like. Probably would do well with a small headrest.</li>
            <li> Good quality and comfortable, but I really don&#x27;t like the Velcro strap in the center.  Sounds like a great idea, but hard to put on, and no more effective than the ones I have without the Velcro.</li>
            <li> Cost effective, soft and very well fitting on face rest.  Will definitely purchase again when needed.  i appreciate the ease of use and fit</li>
            <li> I received these products and they have been working well.  They seem to be made very sturdy.  I&#x27;m still trying to get used to the velcro that helps hold it on the face rest.</li>
            <li> Lots of lint comes off when laundering.  Also had a learning curve to put them on the headrest, didn&#x27;t quite fit as expected.</li>
            <li> The material was nice but I didn&#x27;t like the velcrow on the covers. The covers came in a prompt manner.</li>
            <li> Too Small for regular face rest..don.t like it.</li>
            <li> I like these face rest covers. The Velcro is starting to fail on my covers, but I have had them for a long time and wash them often. They have probably lasted at least 25 washings and most of them are still perfect. A couple are starting to not stick. I plan on replacing the Velcro when needed, because these are nice covers!! I have bought MANY that don&#x27;t fit well!</li>
            <li> It has an extra piece sewn into the material right at the forehead area - to attach a velcro tab to hold it on the face cradle.  This was not shown in the picture.  It slips, I dislike washing them as the velcro sticks to everything.  The right price, but I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> These fit ok over the face rest on my massage table, but I do not have a padded fleece cover underneath. With anything underneath, there is no way these would stretch around. I am in massage school and they are perfect for using with clients at clinic.</li>
            <li> Fit nicely, able to use the Velcro to secure them but they could be just a tad bigger (hence 4 starts instead of 5). Haven&#x27;t found anything I like better though.</li>
