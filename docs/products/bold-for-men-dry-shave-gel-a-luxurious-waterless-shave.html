            <li>This shave gel is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great...</li>
            <li>To my surprise, it still worked great.</li>
            <li>Great close shave without the razor burn.</li>
            <li>this work great really good.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products but this is the best!</li>
            <li>I just part fill up a bucket with warm water for rinsing off my triple blade razor and can shave my legs with this technique while sitting on the edge of my bed!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving habits are one of those things that most of us just don&#x27;t change without a very good reason.</li>
            <li>This product is very good and love the way my skin feels after the shave.</li>
            <li>good to use with electric shaver for shaving head.  </li>
            <li>and I was good to go.</li>
            <li>Yes it has a manly smell, but that can be ignored with a good dousing of good skin cream.  </li>
            <li>so I have the ability to see what I&#x27;m removing, or precisely shaping to perfect my look.</li>
            <li>It prevents razor burn and makes the shave nearly as good as with creams or gels.</li>
            <li>I used Bold and was incredibly impressed with the product.  </li>
            <li>This product was demonstrably better and greatly reduced the pull/drag and</li>
            <li>Great product - SMOOTH shave!  </li>
            <li>The best shave I have ever experienced by far.</li>
            <li>I find this to be the best solution for quality, but it&#x27;s time consuming and a pain because I have to spend a lot of time bent over the sink trying to re-heat my bear with hot water.</li>
            <li>I love the  way it performs and smells !  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>, it feels clean and has as good scent, so try it!</li>
            <li>Amazing shave gel.</li>
            <li>what an amazing shave.</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF IS AMAZING FOR GIRLS</li>
            <li>Although the smell was nice, there was almost no lubrication.  </li>
            <li>but it does do a nice job</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect viscosity and it lubricates really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best thing about this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t foam much at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using my own</li>
            <li>Everyone I have recommended this to has walked away loving it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use one of the Norelco shavers that dispenses its own lotion but the lotion got discontinued.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, perfumey scent, but it is rather strong.  </li>
            <li>Great for traveling if you don&#x27;t wanna carry a baggage full of shaving gear since it basically does it all.  </li>
            <li>Bold worked great, and I took it on my trip.  </li>
            <li>You just apply onto the shaving area, wait 30 seconds, and the shave is effortless, as well as leaving a nice, clean smell and good feel of a close shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it had lots of great reviews and man they were right on.</li>
            <li>Probably works great for true &amp;#34;dry shave&amp;#34; conditions where no water is available (camping, etc)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but this feels even better.</li>
            <li>Okay, one shave product can do it all</li>
            <li>This is better than advertised.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Being able to see the results (can&#x27;t wear glasses in the shower...) means its faster, closer and cleaner, as in you don&#x27;t miss spots on your chin etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow the instructions, make sure you let it sit for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>no nicks, cuts or razor-burn and my skin has never looked  better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through many phases of shaving approaches.</li>
            <li>The razor slips and I&#x27;m spending more time than I&#x27;d like trying to rid my fingers of the gel after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>Need I say more.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I will tell you that I did not like the scent</li>
            <li>The best I could do was apply it outside the shower while waiting for the water to heat up, then jump in and start shaving immediately.</li>
            <li>After doing quite a bit of online reading, I found that many people are using shaving cream with these electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>Many of these findings are subjective (like smell).  </li>
            <li>6 min. 16 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5</li>
            <li>Eshu lubricated my face better and felt like it was more soothing after shaving.  </li>
            <li>It provided better lubrication, but was also foamier.  </li>
            <li>The odor was better than the lower rated gels but still wasn&#x27;t something desirable.  </li>
            <li>Tolerable would be a better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nivea for men was the second best gel I tried.  </li>
            <li>It has many positives.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my favorite of the shaving gels I tried.  </li>
            <li>I love the glide.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels after the shave.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I get a better shave with the shaving cream I buy at the supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I would get way too many ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>comfy :)</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Guys</li>
            <li>I tried many alternative lotions but none were even close to working.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product.  </li>
            <li>The product works, but not any better than Lectric Shave.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I ordered this in winter, and it froze in transit, pushed out the flip top, and leaked all over the plastic bag it was shipped in.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>For the price, I can do much better with a can of Nivea foaming shave gel.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, stick with shaving cream or Edge, my favorite gel.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve lost count of how many blades you can get...and the change from cans of foam after playing with a brush and then going to some pretty good gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold</li>
            <li>great combination that I use every day now and can highly recommmend.</li>
            <li>and I must say that I&#x27;m very impressed by the dry shave gel performance.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay, not offensive or overly strong.</li>
            <li>Wow, it is a great shave.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower mostly and it works much better than Bold.</li>
            <li>I think I like it even better than the original Norelco lotion.</li>
            <li>This Dry Shave Gel is amazing!!</li>
            <li>AN EASY WAY TO SHAVE ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>You could easily see your skin and hair stubble.  </li>
            <li>I have a wet/dry razor, so it makes cleaning easy.  </li>
            <li>It was an easy glide</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think this is good enough as an aftershave by itself, so I would recommend the Clubman Pinaud with it.  </li>
            <li>This product is pretty amazing, I have to say.</li>
            <li>Bold For Men Dry Shave Gel is the best shaving product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell super strong either, which I&#x27;m glad of</li>
            <li>I ordered more Bold.</li>
            <li>or if it had to have one, that it was more mild.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, leaves your skiln feeling smooth and comfortable with no irritation.</li>
            <li>My shave went from very smooth and clean with the first batch to a lot more cuts.</li>
            <li>Bold&#x27;s cheaper competitor BodyVerde waterless shave isn&#x27;t as good on your face, but it comes in a handy, QUIET pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>Provides a close, comfortable shave to face and head with an electric razor {Panasonic}.</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin smooth after shaving.</li>
            <li>In fact, others on my team liked it so much that I was worried at times it might disappear.  </li>
            <li>The end result is incredibly smooth skin and zero irritation.</li>
            <li>Fragrance Free:  </li>
            <li>After the shave i couldnt believe how close the shave was and how smooth my face was.</li>
            <li>I would suggest trying it for a week and see how smooth your face will be.</li>
            <li>It might work for you if you have a light beard.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>Not the smooth and protected feel I was looking for.</li>
            <li>a couple of times after the razor got clogged but at the end my face felt clean and smooth and did not burn at all.</li>
            <li>Once I tried BOLD I was hooked and amazed at how easily the razor blade slid on my face.  </li>
            <li>Not only was I impressed by Bold&#x27;s performance, I really like the way it smells too.</li>
            <li>Buy two bottles and give one to the woman in your life, tell them I recommend it for a super fast shave!! :)</li>
            <li>This is absolutely my new favorite product!  </li>
            <li>I have had Bold For Men for couple weeks now, and I can only say great things about it.</li>
            <li>No more nicks and cuts  and best of all</li>
            <li>Cancer originally caused me to go with the shaved head look.</li>
            <li>to Shave:  5 min. 21 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  3 out of 5</li>
            <li>Dog Original Shave Gel:  </li>
            <li>sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br</li>
            <li>ED RICH</li>
            <li>The $$ savings in blades goes a long way to offset the added cost of this great product.</li>
            <li>and i gotta say super smooth and no redness or irritation or ingrown hairs at all</li>
            <li>/&gt;While shaving I find that I have to frequently clean the razor.</li>
            <li>This meant it took longer to shave and longer to clean my razor afterwards.  </li>
            <li>a clean shave require fewer passes and</li>
            <li>After applying it on my face I could definitely feel it work as it had a nice refreshing effect.</li>
            <li>Super smooth</li>
            <li>It smells better, however it for the sensitive skin on my neck it causes way too many cuts (and dare I say, tears) with my Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li>I decided to get this gel bexause it will allow me to see my hair and continue shaving as well as moisturize AND disinfect and clean my skin.</li>
            <li>If Bold ever fixes their packaging, I&#x27;ll gladly pay the higher price... but not now.</li>
            <li>Also, this is a so called natural and cruelty free product and great for people who&#x27;s conscious about that stuff.</li>
            <li>I love products that you can count on and really deliver.</li>
            <li>thanks looking forward to more of these lil bottles</li>
            <li>Shave Cool Mint.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I just love my wetshaving routine too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for a travel case, where you can use it in an airport or taxi before your big meeting.</li>
            <li>Left my face smooth, free of hair, and, most importantly, free of irritation.</li>
            <li>WILL MOST LIKELY PURCHASE MORE ...</li>
            <li>Whereas now  with Bold&#x27;s dryshave, I even started shaving against the grain...and  guess what...</li>
            <li>You can also find it at any drug store and its a fraction of the price of Bold.  </li>
            <li>Bold just did not work for me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never come across a product that works as well as Bold.</li>
            <li>Again the Eshu was faster to shave with than the Bold for Men or the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using bold for men</li>
            <li>BOLD FOR MEN:  </li>
            <li>I have a friend who swears by Bold.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit I didn&#x27;t like the way Bold For Men Felt on my face and how slippery it was during shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a Bold invention.</li>
            <li>I used to use it only to shave my beard area, but recently I started shaving my head, and it is awesome for that.  </li>
            <li>Bold is truly transparent</li>
            <li>It is probably one of the most cost effective due to this.  </li>
            <li>The gel makes my shave easy and clean, and it keeps my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>its great for getting your lines straight, you can see what you are doing and that makes shaving time I/2 as long.</li>
            <li>The Alphagel left it feeling more smooth and cool.  </li>
            <li>The second time I used it, I fell in love!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing that you will notice is that you don&#x27;t need to reapply the gel when shaving in different directions in the same place which makes it all the more easy and effective to use.  </li>
            <li>I obtained a very close shave that was surprisingly smooth, given that there was no foam, to which I am accustomed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second tube of this amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well and is quite comfortable, with two caveats:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>All in all, this is an amazing product, and I would recommend it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind some potentially cancer causing chemicals getting rubbed into their face.</li>
            <li>you will reap the benefits of enjoying that baby soft skin.</li>
            <li>- the shaver moved much more smoothly over my skin (giving me a closer shave, especially in the \\&quot;concave\\&quot; areas of my neck), and the product also acted as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If I wanted to sport a bare face, a goatee, rock some burns, or maintain a full beard, you would have thought I was Picasso!!</li>
            <li>First tried Bold for Men after receiving a sample.</li>
            <li>I found that Bold for Men enhances the performance of the otherwise excellent Norelco Sensotouch 3D razor (tha can be used for both dry and wet shaving).</li>
            <li>I doubted it, but was willing to prove it out, so I borrowed his Bold and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>I was right.</li>
            <li>With Bold Dry Shave Gel, I get a very smooth, easy glide and a very close shave.</li>
            <li>The product being watered down as it is cannot be recommended for a good shave.</li>
            <li>Works very well have to add water while shaving sometimes to the neck area as the gel dries up a bit quick</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth having on hand for those times when I need a quick shave and don&#x27;t have time for the shower that normally accompanies my routine.</li>
            <li>Although I had read other reviews before ordering this product, I was still surprised by the comfort that I experienced using it.</li>
            <li>Bold for Men is soothing and invigorating and at the same time very gentle on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The bonus of using this as a dry shave just makes this product amazing in my opinion, far superior to anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I ended up ordering some of the shave cream from Harry&#x27;s shave club, and it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>to Shave:  4 min. 58 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  5 out of 5</li>
            <li>(Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face</li>
            <li>After I was done shaving and I washed the gel off of my face, I found it made my face feel really hot.  </li>
            <li>(Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  </li>
            <li>(Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  </li>

            <li>(Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face</li>
            <li>It also leaves you with a refreshing feeling after the shave especially if you reapply after your shave.</li>
            <li>I got this for my father on his birthday and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>I have to admit when I first started using the product</li>
            <li>This time around the product was much more watery then my last purchase.</li>
            <li>Unless you rinse your multiblade razor with hot water, this stuff will clog it... so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting any further bottles from Amazon for sure</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>Bold For Men is alcohol based, and seems kind of like a few of my after-shave gels.</li>
            <li>For Men deserves a place in that parade of great new ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took a little more time to clean my razor afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Bull Dog had about as much foam as I would be willing to put up with and still use with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I was unsure how much to use.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do as good of a job as it did in the past as a result.</li>
            <li>My face felt only mildly irritated after each shave (barely noticeable) and my skin was in much better condition by the end of the week.  </li>
            <li>The Dry Shave Gel is more than 7 times the cost (per oz.)</li>
            <li>This almost defeats the point of shaving in the shower since part of the idea is to warm up your face with the hot water for a few minutes</li>
            <li>Certainly no better than a good, much cheaper pre-shave oil.</li>
            <li>Since this stuff is alcohol based, it seems like it largely evaporates before I&#x27;m done shaving.</li>
            <li>I have tried several shaving products in the past but this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>i guess if you only wanted to use it dry shaving, it may be a good product.  </li>
            <li>As others say, this stuff is a real breakthrough it terms of being easy on your face and  definitely nourishes your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been fine for over a day - no bumps, acne, extra sensitivity, nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this product being offered to me in my email inbox after I signed up for a new &#x27;boutique-type&#x27; website as a new member, the offer I got was that a full regular bottle cost me $2 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>If they stop cutting it as much then it could be excellent like it used to be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells good AND smooth with the shave, you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li>Product really works..</li>
            <li>I used to use a glycerin based shaving cream with a badger hair brush, but now those two items are collecting dust thanks to this.  </li>
            <li>A surprise was finding how much cleaner my razors were after washing with soap and water.</li>
            <li>; that smells to high heaven!  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want as much foam with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>It was much thicker than any of the lower rated gels I tested.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to shave with it.  </li>
            <li>It really shaves without water.</li>
            <li>Now, not so much.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Washing my face beforehand and applying it to my wet face, it was okay.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to shave as much</li>
            <li>#3 - straight razor shave.</li>
            <li>This is the one I was worried about, but it left my face smooth and undisturbed, to my amazement.</li>
            <li>Very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first half of the shave goes ok, but find myself re-applying after that and even then feeling like I should re-heat my beard in the sink.</li>
            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  3 out 5</li>
            <li>The cool part was that becuase it is a clear gel and doesn&#x27;t have any foam, I could clearly see what areas needed to be shaved and didn&#x27;t have to go over anything twice as you would with a foam gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a water-only shaver for a long time now, but recently decided to try to be nice to my face</li>
            <li>For my super thick facial hair, I have to use a good amount of this product or my safety razor will tug on the hairs.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped with shaving; especially if you want a quick shave before you head</li>
            <li>And since my Grandfather was a Barber (old school) I&#x27;ve always been interested in the art and science of shaving.</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad shave, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not another shaving cream, its a whole new way to shave.</li>
            <li>More so than with previous approaches.</li>
            <li>have never used anything but shaving cream or shaving soap will now only use bold shave gel.</li>
            <li>&amp; is only slightly better overall, hence my 3 star rating.</li>
            <li>I just recently saw an ad on amazon.com about Bold For Men and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It does protect my face decently with my safety razor.</li>
            <li>I recently received Bold as a gift and gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what&#x27;s next from BOLD.</li>
            <li>Product has shown positive results so far when used as a preshave application.</li>
            <li>I typically shave in the shower and keep my other shaving cream in there, but I was looking for a dry gel to keep handy for days that I just wanted to get a quick smooth shave without having to shower.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have introduced 3 of my friends to Bold, and I will definitely be gifting it out this holiday season to a few more of my friends.</li>
            <li>The shave itself was just a little bit better.</li>
            <li>I tried and really like Neutrogena Shave Cream for Sensitive Skin.  </li>
            <li>and I do not like to change my normal regimen.</li>
            <li>Normally, it takes me 4 passes to get as close a shave as I got in just two with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My skin was more irritated by the end of a week of usage; I had three nicks on the last day (only 1 for the Alphagel); and it left my face feeling really rawafter shaving.  </li>
            <li>After Use  3 out of 5  (felt raw but pretty smooth and 1 nick)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  5th</li>
            <li>Received bold dry shave less than a week ago, works very well gives me a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use Gillette Fusion Proglide gel, which is one of, if not the most expensive of the nationally available brands.</li>
            <li>I got it for one reason and one reason only, and that is that I&#x27;m training to be a barber, and when I go to my state board test, I have to give my model a straight razor shave without any real preparation of his beard.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin when it comes to shaving.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is really good for what it is, a waterless and a less mess shave.  </li>
            <li>It takes longer, but it&#x27;s simple and I can keep my beard soft with the hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the last step I actually rinsed and dried my face first then applied some more as an aftershave.</li>
            <li>After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  </li>
            <li>After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  2rd</li>
            <li>After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  1st</li>
            <li>One of the few things I liked about the Alphagel was that it left my face feeling cool instead of raw like the Eshu.  </li>
            <li>Using a new blade (and yes, I&#x27;ve tried several of those as well) - testing against what is my main problem area (sides of my head).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The results for me, were clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s clear, so you can see where your shaving&lt;</li>
            <li>it was a clear five star rating.</li>
            <li>his skin is so sensitive and he always gets ingrowns.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Alphagel Sensitive Skin:  </li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t think enough to lubricate very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nivea for Men, Sensitive Shaving Gel: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIL9HZE/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW....</li>
            <li>and WOW</li>
            <li>and my skin is really sensitive.</li>
            <li>Forget the old fashioned aerosol foam cans, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>I have been trying too many products for a while for my thick hair and irritable skin.</li>
            <li>Cute idea, but even after showering it does nothing to soften my thick morning beard.</li>
            <li>I tested all 5, being careful to follow the manufacturers directions, properly prepping the area, keeping the razor clean, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You may have different results if you use a different shaver or if your skin is more or less sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Bold help me cut my shaving time in half.</li>
            <li>I have ranked them starting with the worst, Bold for Men and finished with the best, Kiss My Face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold</li>
            <li>I will try it a few times again, but following directions, it didn&#x27;t achieve the promised comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to extend the life of my razor by 2-3 X as long, especially when I clean and dry it after the shave.  </li>
            <li>BOLD works fairly well at getting your face ready to be scraped by that nasty razor.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;ll give it a try because I have a serious pain condition and shaving my legs hurts a lot especially now in Summer in Colorado, I have to do it more often....</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it even works well with cheap disposable razors so downgrade your razor if you must to justify the price of this stuff.</li>
            <li>While described as fragrance free, there was a very slight plastic smell that I could only smell if I stuck it right up to my nose and sniffed heavily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly clear, which is allows you to see what you&#x27;re doing, unlike traditional foam.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I&#x27;ve completely flipped my opinion on like this.</li>
            <li>YOUR LOOKING FOR A SHAVE WITH NO DRAG...</li>
            <li>I shave with an old fashioned safety razor, and shaving in the shower has always been the only way that I can shave without razor burn and bleeding.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did a fine job but didn&#x27;t offer any more protection from cutting than any other gel or cream.</li>
            <li>I run it under hot water, upside down and tap the razor.</li>
            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  2 out 5</li>
            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  1 out 5</li>
            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  </li>
            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5</li>
            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5</li>
            <li>If you are old enough to remember shaving with a double edged \\&quot;safety razor\\</li>
            <li>dog represented a major step up from the last shave gel (the Eshu).  </li>
            <li>Not completely sure its worth the money unless your using it to trim a beard line or side burns.  </li>
            <li>You only need a small amount for it to work; it is thick enough to protect my skin well (meaning my face felt good after a shave instead of raw); and I got a reasonably close shave from it.  </li>
            <li>The only negative thing I have to say about BOLD is this...\\&quot;Darn</li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling cool like the Alphagel, it was the least irritating and my facefelt better after shaving than with any other product.  </li>
            <li>This was both good and bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> this work great really good.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products but this is the best!</li>
            <li> I just part fill up a bucket with warm water for rinsing off my triple blade razor and can shave my legs with this technique while sitting on the edge of my bed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving habits are one of those things that most of us just don&#x27;t change without a very good reason.</li>
            <li> This product is very good and love the way my skin feels after the shave.</li>
            <li> good to use with electric shaver for shaving head.  </li>
            <li> and I was good to go.</li>
            <li> Yes it has a manly smell, but that can be ignored with a good dousing of good skin cream.  </li>
            <li> so I have the ability to see what I&#x27;m removing, or precisely shaping to perfect my look.</li>
            <li> It prevents razor burn and makes the shave nearly as good as with creams or gels.</li>
            <li> I used Bold and was incredibly impressed with the product.  </li>
            <li> This product was demonstrably better and greatly reduced the pull/drag and</li>
            <li> Great product - SMOOTH shave!  </li>
            <li> The best shave I have ever experienced by far.</li>
            <li> I find this to be the best solution for quality, but it&#x27;s time consuming and a pain because I have to spend a lot of time bent over the sink trying to re-heat my bear with hot water.</li>
            <li> I love the  way it performs and smells !  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> , it feels clean and has as good scent, so try it!</li>
            <li> Amazing shave gel.</li>
            <li> what an amazing shave.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING FOR GIRLS</li>
            <li> Although the smell was nice, there was almost no lubrication.  </li>
            <li> but it does do a nice job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect viscosity and it lubricates really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best thing about this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t foam much at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using my own</li>
            <li> Everyone I have recommended this to has walked away loving it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use one of the Norelco shavers that dispenses its own lotion but the lotion got discontinued.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, perfumey scent, but it is rather strong.  </li>
            <li> Great for traveling if you don&#x27;t wanna carry a baggage full of shaving gear since it basically does it all.  </li>
            <li> Bold worked great, and I took it on my trip.  </li>
            <li> You just apply onto the shaving area, wait 30 seconds, and the shave is effortless, as well as leaving a nice, clean smell and good feel of a close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it had lots of great reviews and man they were right on.</li>
            <li> Probably works great for true &amp;#34;dry shave&amp;#34; conditions where no water is available (camping, etc)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but this feels even better.</li>
            <li> Okay, one shave product can do it all</li>
            <li> This is better than advertised.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Being able to see the results (can&#x27;t wear glasses in the shower...) means its faster, closer and cleaner, as in you don&#x27;t miss spots on your chin etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Follow the instructions, make sure you let it sit for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> no nicks, cuts or razor-burn and my skin has never looked  better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through many phases of shaving approaches.</li>
            <li> The razor slips and I&#x27;m spending more time than I&#x27;d like trying to rid my fingers of the gel after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love that.</li>
            <li> Need I say more.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I will tell you that I did not like the scent</li>
            <li> The best I could do was apply it outside the shower while waiting for the water to heat up, then jump in and start shaving immediately.</li>
            <li> After doing quite a bit of online reading, I found that many people are using shaving cream with these electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> Many of these findings are subjective (like smell).  </li>
            <li> 6 min. 16 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5</li>
            <li> Eshu lubricated my face better and felt like it was more soothing after shaving.  </li>
            <li> It provided better lubrication, but was also foamier.  </li>
            <li> The odor was better than the lower rated gels but still wasn&#x27;t something desirable.  </li>
            <li> Tolerable would be a better</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nivea for men was the second best gel I tried.  </li>
            <li> It has many positives.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my favorite of the shaving gels I tried.  </li>
            <li> I love the glide.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after the shave.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I get a better shave with the shaving cream I buy at the supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I would get way too many ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> comfy :)</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Guys</li>
            <li> I tried many alternative lotions but none were even close to working.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product.  </li>
            <li> The product works, but not any better than Lectric Shave.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in winter, and it froze in transit, pushed out the flip top, and leaked all over the plastic bag it was shipped in.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> For the price, I can do much better with a can of Nivea foaming shave gel.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, stick with shaving cream or Edge, my favorite gel.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve lost count of how many blades you can get...and the change from cans of foam after playing with a brush and then going to some pretty good gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold</li>
            <li> great combination that I use every day now and can highly recommmend.</li>
            <li> and I must say that I&#x27;m very impressed by the dry shave gel performance.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay, not offensive or overly strong.</li>
            <li> Wow, it is a great shave.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower mostly and it works much better than Bold.</li>
            <li> I think I like it even better than the original Norelco lotion.</li>
            <li> This Dry Shave Gel is amazing!!</li>
            <li> AN EASY WAY TO SHAVE ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> You could easily see your skin and hair stubble.  </li>
            <li> I have a wet/dry razor, so it makes cleaning easy.  </li>
            <li> It was an easy glide</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think this is good enough as an aftershave by itself, so I would recommend the Clubman Pinaud with it.  </li>
            <li> This product is pretty amazing, I have to say.</li>
            <li> Bold For Men Dry Shave Gel is the best shaving product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell super strong either, which I&#x27;m glad of</li>
            <li> I ordered more Bold.</li>
            <li> or if it had to have one, that it was more mild.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, leaves your skiln feeling smooth and comfortable with no irritation.</li>
            <li> My shave went from very smooth and clean with the first batch to a lot more cuts.</li>
            <li> Bold&#x27;s cheaper competitor BodyVerde waterless shave isn&#x27;t as good on your face, but it comes in a handy, QUIET pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> Provides a close, comfortable shave to face and head with an electric razor {Panasonic}.</li>
            <li> It keeps your skin smooth after shaving.</li>
            <li> In fact, others on my team liked it so much that I was worried at times it might disappear.  </li>
            <li> The end result is incredibly smooth skin and zero irritation.</li>
            <li> Fragrance Free:  </li>
            <li> After the shave i couldnt believe how close the shave was and how smooth my face was.</li>
            <li> I would suggest trying it for a week and see how smooth your face will be.</li>
            <li> It might work for you if you have a light beard.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> Not the smooth and protected feel I was looking for.</li>
            <li> a couple of times after the razor got clogged but at the end my face felt clean and smooth and did not burn at all.</li>
            <li> Once I tried BOLD I was hooked and amazed at how easily the razor blade slid on my face.  </li>
            <li> Not only was I impressed by Bold&#x27;s performance, I really like the way it smells too.</li>
            <li> Buy two bottles and give one to the woman in your life, tell them I recommend it for a super fast shave!! :)</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my new favorite product!  </li>
            <li> I have had Bold For Men for couple weeks now, and I can only say great things about it.</li>
            <li> No more nicks and cuts  and best of all</li>
            <li> Cancer originally caused me to go with the shaved head look.</li>
            <li> to Shave:  5 min. 21 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  3 out of 5</li>
            <li> Dog Original Shave Gel:  </li>
            <li> sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br</li>
            <li> ED RICH</li>
            <li> The $$ savings in blades goes a long way to offset the added cost of this great product.</li>
            <li> and i gotta say super smooth and no redness or irritation or ingrown hairs at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;While shaving I find that I have to frequently clean the razor.</li>
            <li> This meant it took longer to shave and longer to clean my razor afterwards.  </li>
            <li> a clean shave require fewer passes and</li>
            <li> After applying it on my face I could definitely feel it work as it had a nice refreshing effect.</li>
            <li> Super smooth</li>
            <li> It smells better, however it for the sensitive skin on my neck it causes way too many cuts (and dare I say, tears) with my Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> I decided to get this gel bexause it will allow me to see my hair and continue shaving as well as moisturize AND disinfect and clean my skin.</li>
            <li> If Bold ever fixes their packaging, I&#x27;ll gladly pay the higher price... but not now.</li>
            <li> Also, this is a so called natural and cruelty free product and great for people who&#x27;s conscious about that stuff.</li>
            <li> I love products that you can count on and really deliver.</li>
            <li> thanks looking forward to more of these lil bottles</li>
            <li> Shave Cool Mint.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I just love my wetshaving routine too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for a travel case, where you can use it in an airport or taxi before your big meeting.</li>
            <li> Left my face smooth, free of hair, and, most importantly, free of irritation.</li>
            <li> WILL MOST LIKELY PURCHASE MORE ...</li>
            <li> Whereas now  with Bold&#x27;s dryshave, I even started shaving against the grain...and  guess what...</li>
            <li> You can also find it at any drug store and its a fraction of the price of Bold.  </li>
            <li> Bold just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never come across a product that works as well as Bold.</li>
            <li> Again the Eshu was faster to shave with than the Bold for Men or the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using bold for men</li>
            <li> BOLD FOR MEN:  </li>
            <li> I have a friend who swears by Bold.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I didn&#x27;t like the way Bold For Men Felt on my face and how slippery it was during shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a Bold invention.</li>
            <li> I used to use it only to shave my beard area, but recently I started shaving my head, and it is awesome for that.  </li>
            <li> Bold is truly transparent</li>
            <li> It is probably one of the most cost effective due to this.  </li>
            <li> The gel makes my shave easy and clean, and it keeps my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> its great for getting your lines straight, you can see what you are doing and that makes shaving time I/2 as long.</li>
            <li> The Alphagel left it feeling more smooth and cool.  </li>
            <li> The second time I used it, I fell in love!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing that you will notice is that you don&#x27;t need to reapply the gel when shaving in different directions in the same place which makes it all the more easy and effective to use.  </li>
            <li> I obtained a very close shave that was surprisingly smooth, given that there was no foam, to which I am accustomed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second tube of this amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well and is quite comfortable, with two caveats:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> All in all, this is an amazing product, and I would recommend it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind some potentially cancer causing chemicals getting rubbed into their face.</li>
            <li> you will reap the benefits of enjoying that baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> - the shaver moved much more smoothly over my skin (giving me a closer shave, especially in the \\&quot;concave\\&quot; areas of my neck), and the product also acted as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If I wanted to sport a bare face, a goatee, rock some burns, or maintain a full beard, you would have thought I was Picasso!!</li>
            <li> First tried Bold for Men after receiving a sample.</li>
            <li> I found that Bold for Men enhances the performance of the otherwise excellent Norelco Sensotouch 3D razor (tha can be used for both dry and wet shaving).</li>
            <li> I doubted it, but was willing to prove it out, so I borrowed his Bold and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I was right.</li>
            <li> With Bold Dry Shave Gel, I get a very smooth, easy glide and a very close shave.</li>
            <li> The product being watered down as it is cannot be recommended for a good shave.</li>
            <li> Works very well have to add water while shaving sometimes to the neck area as the gel dries up a bit quick</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth having on hand for those times when I need a quick shave and don&#x27;t have time for the shower that normally accompanies my routine.</li>
            <li> Although I had read other reviews before ordering this product, I was still surprised by the comfort that I experienced using it.</li>
            <li> Bold for Men is soothing and invigorating and at the same time very gentle on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The bonus of using this as a dry shave just makes this product amazing in my opinion, far superior to anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I ended up ordering some of the shave cream from Harry&#x27;s shave club, and it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> to Shave:  4 min. 58 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  5 out of 5</li>
            <li> (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face</li>
            <li> After I was done shaving and I washed the gel off of my face, I found it made my face feel really hot.  </li>
            <li> (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  </li>
            <li> (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  </li>

            <li> (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face</li>
            <li> It also leaves you with a refreshing feeling after the shave especially if you reapply after your shave.</li>
            <li> I got this for my father on his birthday and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I have to admit when I first started using the product</li>
            <li> This time around the product was much more watery then my last purchase.</li>
            <li> Unless you rinse your multiblade razor with hot water, this stuff will clog it... so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be getting any further bottles from Amazon for sure</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> Bold For Men is alcohol based, and seems kind of like a few of my after-shave gels.</li>
            <li> For Men deserves a place in that parade of great new ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a little more time to clean my razor afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Bull Dog had about as much foam as I would be willing to put up with and still use with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I was unsure how much to use.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do as good of a job as it did in the past as a result.</li>
            <li> My face felt only mildly irritated after each shave (barely noticeable) and my skin was in much better condition by the end of the week.  </li>
            <li> The Dry Shave Gel is more than 7 times the cost (per oz.)</li>
            <li> This almost defeats the point of shaving in the shower since part of the idea is to warm up your face with the hot water for a few minutes</li>
            <li> Certainly no better than a good, much cheaper pre-shave oil.</li>
            <li> Since this stuff is alcohol based, it seems like it largely evaporates before I&#x27;m done shaving.</li>
            <li> I have tried several shaving products in the past but this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> i guess if you only wanted to use it dry shaving, it may be a good product.  </li>
            <li> As others say, this stuff is a real breakthrough it terms of being easy on your face and  definitely nourishes your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fine for over a day - no bumps, acne, extra sensitivity, nothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this product being offered to me in my email inbox after I signed up for a new &#x27;boutique-type&#x27; website as a new member, the offer I got was that a full regular bottle cost me $2 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> If they stop cutting it as much then it could be excellent like it used to be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells good AND smooth with the shave, you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Product really works..</li>
            <li> I used to use a glycerin based shaving cream with a badger hair brush, but now those two items are collecting dust thanks to this.  </li>
            <li> A surprise was finding how much cleaner my razors were after washing with soap and water.</li>
            <li> ; that smells to high heaven!  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want as much foam with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> It was much thicker than any of the lower rated gels I tested.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to shave with it.  </li>
            <li> It really shaves without water.</li>
            <li> Now, not so much.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Washing my face beforehand and applying it to my wet face, it was okay.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to shave as much</li>
            <li> #3 - straight razor shave.</li>
            <li> This is the one I was worried about, but it left my face smooth and undisturbed, to my amazement.</li>
            <li> Very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first half of the shave goes ok, but find myself re-applying after that and even then feeling like I should re-heat my beard in the sink.</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  3 out 5</li>
            <li> The cool part was that becuase it is a clear gel and doesn&#x27;t have any foam, I could clearly see what areas needed to be shaved and didn&#x27;t have to go over anything twice as you would with a foam gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a water-only shaver for a long time now, but recently decided to try to be nice to my face</li>
            <li> For my super thick facial hair, I have to use a good amount of this product or my safety razor will tug on the hairs.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped with shaving; especially if you want a quick shave before you head</li>
            <li> And since my Grandfather was a Barber (old school) I&#x27;ve always been interested in the art and science of shaving.</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad shave, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not another shaving cream, its a whole new way to shave.</li>
            <li> More so than with previous approaches.</li>
            <li> have never used anything but shaving cream or shaving soap will now only use bold shave gel.</li>
            <li> &amp; is only slightly better overall, hence my 3 star rating.</li>
            <li> I just recently saw an ad on amazon.com about Bold For Men and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It does protect my face decently with my safety razor.</li>
            <li> I recently received Bold as a gift and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what&#x27;s next from BOLD.</li>
            <li> Product has shown positive results so far when used as a preshave application.</li>
            <li> I typically shave in the shower and keep my other shaving cream in there, but I was looking for a dry gel to keep handy for days that I just wanted to get a quick smooth shave without having to shower.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have introduced 3 of my friends to Bold, and I will definitely be gifting it out this holiday season to a few more of my friends.</li>
            <li> The shave itself was just a little bit better.</li>
            <li> I tried and really like Neutrogena Shave Cream for Sensitive Skin.  </li>
            <li> and I do not like to change my normal regimen.</li>
            <li> Normally, it takes me 4 passes to get as close a shave as I got in just two with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My skin was more irritated by the end of a week of usage; I had three nicks on the last day (only 1 for the Alphagel); and it left my face feeling really rawafter shaving.  </li>
            <li> After Use  3 out of 5  (felt raw but pretty smooth and 1 nick)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  5th</li>
            <li> Received bold dry shave less than a week ago, works very well gives me a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use Gillette Fusion Proglide gel, which is one of, if not the most expensive of the nationally available brands.</li>
            <li> I got it for one reason and one reason only, and that is that I&#x27;m training to be a barber, and when I go to my state board test, I have to give my model a straight razor shave without any real preparation of his beard.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin when it comes to shaving.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is really good for what it is, a waterless and a less mess shave.  </li>
            <li> It takes longer, but it&#x27;s simple and I can keep my beard soft with the hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the last step I actually rinsed and dried my face first then applied some more as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  </li>
            <li> After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  2rd</li>
            <li> After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  1st</li>
            <li> One of the few things I liked about the Alphagel was that it left my face feeling cool instead of raw like the Eshu.  </li>
            <li> Using a new blade (and yes, I&#x27;ve tried several of those as well) - testing against what is my main problem area (sides of my head).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The results for me, were clear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s clear, so you can see where your shaving&lt;</li>
            <li> it was a clear five star rating.</li>
            <li> his skin is so sensitive and he always gets ingrowns.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Alphagel Sensitive Skin:  </li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t think enough to lubricate very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nivea for Men, Sensitive Shaving Gel: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIL9HZE/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW....</li>
            <li> and WOW</li>
            <li> and my skin is really sensitive.</li>
            <li> Forget the old fashioned aerosol foam cans, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I have been trying too many products for a while for my thick hair and irritable skin.</li>
            <li> Cute idea, but even after showering it does nothing to soften my thick morning beard.</li>
            <li> I tested all 5, being careful to follow the manufacturers directions, properly prepping the area, keeping the razor clean, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You may have different results if you use a different shaver or if your skin is more or less sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Bold help me cut my shaving time in half.</li>
            <li> I have ranked them starting with the worst, Bold for Men and finished with the best, Kiss My Face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold</li>
            <li> I will try it a few times again, but following directions, it didn&#x27;t achieve the promised comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to extend the life of my razor by 2-3 X as long, especially when I clean and dry it after the shave.  </li>
            <li> BOLD works fairly well at getting your face ready to be scraped by that nasty razor.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;ll give it a try because I have a serious pain condition and shaving my legs hurts a lot especially now in Summer in Colorado, I have to do it more often....</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it even works well with cheap disposable razors so downgrade your razor if you must to justify the price of this stuff.</li>
            <li> While described as fragrance free, there was a very slight plastic smell that I could only smell if I stuck it right up to my nose and sniffed heavily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly clear, which is allows you to see what you&#x27;re doing, unlike traditional foam.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I&#x27;ve completely flipped my opinion on like this.</li>
            <li> YOUR LOOKING FOR A SHAVE WITH NO DRAG...</li>
            <li> I shave with an old fashioned safety razor, and shaving in the shower has always been the only way that I can shave without razor burn and bleeding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did a fine job but didn&#x27;t offer any more protection from cutting than any other gel or cream.</li>
            <li> I run it under hot water, upside down and tap the razor.</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  2 out 5</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  1 out 5</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  </li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5</li>
            <li> If you are old enough to remember shaving with a double edged \\&quot;safety razor\\</li>
            <li> dog represented a major step up from the last shave gel (the Eshu).  </li>
            <li> Not completely sure its worth the money unless your using it to trim a beard line or side burns.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount for it to work; it is thick enough to protect my skin well (meaning my face felt good after a shave instead of raw); and I got a reasonably close shave from it.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about BOLD is this...\\&quot;Darn</li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling cool like the Alphagel, it was the least irritating and my facefelt better after shaving than with any other product.  </li>
            <li> This was both good and bad.  </li>
            <li> Because of the deployment and having to go to training enviroment prior to it, that usually involves only being allowed to shower in the evening and shaving with nothing but a sink in a public restroom with no prep or shower other than hot sink water</li>
            <li> While this smelled a little better than the Alphagel, I thought this gel produced worse results.  </li>
            <li> Nicks and other irritation was a major problem too.</li>
            <li> Also, the 4+ ounces in here are not going to last very long.  </li>
            <li> The absence of foam also made it very easy to follow the edge of my mustache, which is very difficult to do using shave foam or foaming gel products.</li>
            <li> I eventually gave up and went back to a dry electric shave.</li>
            <li> The thing I also like is that its a dry shave, no water necessary.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big believer in the wet shave process and use a double edged razor -- it truly works without having to wet your skin.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had known it existed long ago.</li>
            <li> I spent some time researching which shaving creams and gels to try and settled on the following.  </li>
            <li> One bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I decided I need to switch back to something that gets the job done with no real</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried 5 different cremes/gels recently trying to cut down (pun intended) on the incidence of razor</li>
            <li> To me, it smelt of dry cat food and hand cream.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> and it made my face so dry</li>
            <li> The instructions say to apply this to dry skin, wait 30 seconds, and then shave.</li>
            <li> shaving gel is described as a dry shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I would ever dry shave.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get any results as promised just using this on dry skin.</li>
            <li> #1 - a dry shave (using product as directed) with my Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use this with my electric shaver for dry shaving, but it is too sticky and the shaver drags along.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted, the price is high - but in this case at least, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> He has a very heavy, thick beard, and I&#x27;ve been worried about destroying his face using such an implement without the very necessary multiple hot towels (we only get one), pre-shave oil rub down, etc.</li>
            <li> So I did some research and decided to get Bold for men in the hopes that it will make it easier for him to use and less irritating.  </li>
            <li> SMELLS A LITTLE FUNNY, BUT, SEEMS TO BE ALOT LESS MESSY THAN &#x27;WET SHAVING&#x27;</li>
            <li> My thick coarse beard and sensitive skin was put through the ringer with other products I had been using, and I needed some TLC.</li>
            <li> This is probably why it lubricated my face so well and left it feeling less irritation.  </li>
            <li> My face felt slightly irritated afterwards, and it seemed like I had to use a lot of the gel on subsequent uses to eliminate the irritation.  </li>
            <li> This was a disappointment in terms of getting a smooth dry shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First the bad - there is no seal under the flip top.  </li>
            <li> min. 30 sec.</li>
            <li> For some people it works, for some not really.</li>
            <li> , I just rubbed in what was left on my legs and then added some moisturiser when it had dried</li>
            <li> I have to shave so often, my skin often feels irritated and rough.</li>
            <li> Im in the military and soon going on a deployment.</li>
            <li> Im a wet shaver that uses the merkur 34c  </li>
            <li> Never used this type of product for a waterless shave, having always wet my face and used shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Use judiciously, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But not good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , other shaving creams would show all these kinda stuff about 5 minutes after shaving but</li>
            <li> Injectable, then the current disposable heads and the parade of improvements</li>
            <li> Need to try another brand, but due to the cost will wait until this is used up.</li>
            <li> Close than the other.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of trouble getting it to shave closely, which is why it took so long to shave with</li>
            <li> If you have never shaved with this before I have to warn you, it will feel weird at first.</li>
            <li> The first time I saw and heard of it, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I tried conventional shaving cream and cream in a tube but never got as close of a shave as I would like.</li>
            <li> This works well and has cut the amount I use in half.</li>
            <li> I shave every weekday and use slightly overly the recommended amount.  </li>
            <li> This product has cut my shaving time in half</li>
            <li> As previous reviewers have mentioned, there are some unsavory ingredients used in this product, which is why I dropped a star.</li>
            <li> My first attempt was pre-shower - just cold - and I didn&#x27;t like that at all.</li>
            <li> I had always dreaded using shaving cream since I tend to be in a hurry in the morning and because of the mess it creates.</li>
            <li> I wanted this product to be fantastic, but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was also a little faster shaving with this than the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Ordering another tube in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Dead</li>
            <li> There are a few negatives however.  </li>
            <li> It went away after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> After hating it for a few months I tried again and found this.</li>
            <li> - I will break out in jsut a few hours if exposed to something my skin doesn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> I got the closest shave in the  half the time  !</li>
            <li> For the past few years I&#x27;ve used shaving gel in the shower with a Mach razor (can&#x27;t imagine changing the razor).</li>
            <li> (To keep the peace, I usually unscrew the cap instead, which is kinda messy.)  </li>
            <li> After Use  2 out of 5  (raw, 2 nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  4th</li>
            <li> I did notice that by the end of the week my face was feeling raw</li>
            <li> I have been using this product exclusively for over 5 years, occasionally in between I used regular shaving gels because I ran out of my supply and would end up with irritated skin and a bad shave.  </li>
            <li> &quot; you can remember the parade of milestones in shaving.</li>
            <li> I usually shave a couple of times a week because I&#x27;m lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too lazy to do that, though,</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> I alternated between the two for the past month.</li>
            <li> The foaminess isn&#x27;t so excessive that I would discourage people from not using it with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> so the past 4 years</li>
            <li> I have now been using this product for the past 9 months.  </li>
            <li> The reason I rate it 4 stars is because it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive for such a small tube.  </li>
            <li> I will use it at my test, then keep it for &amp;#34;emergencies&amp;#34; or just for when I&#x27;m really lazy.</li>
            <li> I hate the traditional shaving-foam-in-a-can stuff and wanted something different.</li>
            <li> It does have an odor that I don&#x27;t care for but it wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as bad as the Alphagel.  </li>
            <li> but then we had kids and they complained about his \\&quot;moostash\\&quot; hurting whenever he kissed them.  </li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t smell like a dingy bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell was the least objectionable of any of the six that I tried.  </li>
            <li> This is my second time buying the product and I am unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Let it soak in for at least thirty seconds though.</li>
            <li> im running late or on pt days or sometimes even&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Was forced to buy three years supply because Amazon&#x27;s enfuriating add on erosion.</li>
            <li> After Use  1 out of 5  (very raw, 3 nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  </li>
            <li> It may have been the thickest of the gels, but wasn&#x27;t so thick to create a problem.  </li>
            <li> $13 for a small tube of shaving gel - seriously!?</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about a Shave Cream that say&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have bad memories of it giving me rashes and such.</li>
            <li> This is not a good thing.  </li>
            <li> (Forgetting that pause is not like forgetting to lock and tension a double edged safety razor - a memory that haunts me to this day BTW) you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower, so this was a little awkward to pull off.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from  razor-burn since I started shaving in my teens and it got worse as my  beard got thicker.</li>
            <li> I had tried to use with water was not impressed to say the least.</li>
            <li> Lubrication was poor during shaving too.  </li>
            <li> i was skeptical about this shave gel</li>
            <li> figured I&#x27;d try this product after randomly spotting it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had a beard for a while this summer to skew my usage, but I&#x27;m going through about 2-3 per year now, so it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I think its a bit too expensive to use in place of shaving cream/gel.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> I would use it myself on a regular basis were it not for the nasty things in it.</li>
            <li> It smells like those pucks you find in dirty highway gas station urinals.  </li>
            <li> The gel can be a bit annoying at times because it&#x27;s so slippery and difficult to get off my hand.</li>
            <li> My wife thought my face didn&#x27;t smell bad afterwards, but when I had her smell the gel from the tube, she said, &amp;#34;Oh my god, that is awful!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> However after I finished shaving, I noticed a burning sensation on my face and everywhere that I shaved looked like I had gotten a bad sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I hate the packaging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I found this shaving gel to have the worst smell of any that I tried.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product really works.. I used it every day and it is great for touch ups.. I love products that you can count on and really deliver.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical about this shave gel but after all the reviews i tried it myself and used it once and i gotta say super smooth and no redness or irritation or ingrown hairs at all, other shaving creams would show all these kinda stuff about 5 minutes after shaving but this work great really good. thanks looking forward to more of these lil bottles</li>
            <li> AN EASY WAY TO SHAVE ... WILL MOST LIKELY PURCHASE MORE ... SMELLS A LITTLE FUNNY, BUT, SEEMS TO BE ALOT LESS MESSY THAN &#x27;WET SHAVING&#x27;</li>
            <li> My husband always complains about shaving b/c his skin is so sensitive and he always gets ingrowns.  I put up with the scruff for his sake but then we had kids and they complained about his \\&quot;moostash\\&quot; hurting whenever he kissed them.  So I did some research and decided to get Bold for men in the hopes that it will make it easier for him to use and less irritating.  Now it&#x27;s the only shaving gel he uses.  It has never made his skin red or irritated, in fact it&#x27;s soothing to his skin.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and it smells divine, which is why I now use it as well!  Ladies get this for your men (and maybe even yourselves) b/c let&#x27;s face it they aren&#x27;t always the best at taking care of their skin and in the end you will reap the benefits of enjoying that baby soft skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m a big believer in the wet shave process and use a double edged razor -- it truly works without having to wet your skin.  I used to use a glycerin based shaving cream with a badger hair brush, but now those two items are collecting dust thanks to this.  Use an alum block if you cut yourself.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about a Shave Cream that say&#x27;s it does it all but I decided to give it a try. I have sensitive skin and I do not like to change my normal regimen. Once I tried BOLD I was hooked and amazed at how easily the razor blade slid on my face.  Since the gel was transparent I could also see where I was shaving but I should note that I had to rinse the razor a couple of times after the razor got clogged but at the end my face felt clean and smooth and did not burn at all. After a week I was convinced that I was getting the best/closest shave I have ever had.  I have been using Zirh gel for years and had similar close shave experiences but this feels even better. For the last step I actually rinsed and dried my face first then applied some more as an aftershave. Okay, one shave product can do it all and I would I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products but this is the best! It is easy to use, leaves your skiln feeling smooth and comfortable with no irritation. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I shave with an electric razor and then finish with a blade. Yes, I&#x27;m picky (and have a course beard). I&#x27;ve tried several lotions (gunks up the razor), oils (dunno, kinda slimy), and gels. This works well and doesn&#x27;t cause undo cleaning sessions, it feels clean and has as good scent, so try it!</li>
            <li> This is better than advertised.  It is a truly wonderful product.</li>
            <li> $13 for a small tube of shaving gel - seriously!? That&#x27;s what I thought until I actually tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried 5 different cremes/gels recently trying to cut down (pun intended) on the incidence of razor burn (I shave my entire head). After a while, I had quite the collection sitting on my bathroom counter, so I decided to have a &#x27;shave-off&#x27;. Using a new blade (and yes, I&#x27;ve tried several of those as well) - testing against what is my main problem area (sides of my head). Over two weeks I tested all 5, being careful to follow the manufacturers directions, properly prepping the area, keeping the razor clean, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results for me, were clear. This product was demonstrably better and greatly reduced the pull/drag and subsequently the amount of razor burn/irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, the price is high - but in this case at least, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Provides a close, comfortable shave to face and head with an electric razor {Panasonic}. A surprise was finding how much cleaner my razors were after washing with soap and water. Use judiciously, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Although the smell was nice, there was almost no lubrication.  My reference comparisons are Spelck creme, Gilette ProFusion, and AlphaShave...</li>
            <li> I have had Bold For Men for couple weeks now, and I can only say great things about it. It&#x27;s transparent and smells great. It keeps your skin smooth after shaving. I love it.</li>
            <li> as described.  good to use with electric shaver for shaving head.  wait min. 30 sec. after applying before shaving.  will buy again.</li>
            <li> It works but I didn&#x27;t like the smell.  To me, it smelt of dry cat food and hand cream.</li>
            <li> Received bold dry shave less than a week ago, works very well gives me a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;I have never used anything but shaving cream or shaving soap will now only use bold shave gel.</li>
            <li> I tried this gel before a trip to Africa where I knew that I wouldn&#x27;t have access to water at times.  I had tried Kiehl&#x27;s, and i found its performance lacking.  Bold worked great, and I took it on my trip.  In fact, others on my team liked it so much that I was worried at times it might disappear.  It is my shaving gel of choice now.</li>
            <li> First tried Bold for Men after receiving a sample. Since I travel a lot the thought was it might be an alternate to trying to carry shaving cream/gel on the plane. Prior to BFM I&#x27;d been shaving in the shower for the last 25+ years.  But I have to admit that I was not prepared for how well it worked. Being able to see the results (can&#x27;t wear glasses in the shower...) means its faster, closer and cleaner, as in you don&#x27;t miss spots on your chin etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving habits are one of those things that most of us just don&#x27;t change without a very good reason. And since my Grandfather was a Barber (old school) I&#x27;ve always been interested in the art and science of shaving. If you are old enough to remember shaving with a double edged \\&quot;safety razor\\&quot; you can remember the parade of milestones in shaving. Injectable, then the current disposable heads and the parade of improvements - I&#x27;ve lost count of how many blades you can get...and the change from cans of foam after playing with a brush and then going to some pretty good gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold For Men deserves a place in that parade of great new ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions, make sure you let it sit for 30 seconds. (Forgetting that pause is not like forgetting to lock and tension a double edged safety razor - a memory that haunts me to this day BTW) you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, perfect.</li>
            <li> The best shave I have ever experienced by far. No more nicks and cuts  and best of all I no longer get razor-burn. I have suffered from  razor-burn since I started shaving in my teens and it got worse as my  beard got thicker. My neck used to be red and irritated. Whereas now  with Bold&#x27;s dryshave, I even started shaving against the grain...and  guess what...no nicks, cuts or razor-burn and my skin has never looked  better. I cant imagine ever switching back to another shaving  product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to get a non fragrant electric shave and he stated that it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the &amp;#34;Electric Shave lotion&amp;#34; that smells to high heaven!  Why do they have to put fragrance in everything?  Need to try another brand, but due to the cost will wait until this is used up.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I obtained a very close shave that was surprisingly smooth, given that there was no foam, to which I am accustomed. Although I had read other reviews before ordering this product, I was still surprised by the comfort that I experienced using it. No scrape, no razor burn, and no foam to hide the hair I wanted to cut off. The absence of foam also made it very easy to follow the edge of my mustache, which is very difficult to do using shave foam or foaming gel products.</li>
            <li> its great for getting your lines straight, you can see what you are doing and that makes shaving time I/2 as long.</li>
            <li> Works very well have to add water while shaving sometimes to the neck area as the gel dries up a bit quick but it does do a nice job would buy again</li>
            <li> See edit at end for update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through many phases of shaving approaches. For the past few years I&#x27;ve used shaving gel in the shower with a Mach razor (can&#x27;t imagine changing the razor). I don&#x27;t bother with a mirror. It takes longer, but it&#x27;s simple and I can keep my beard soft with the hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the shower phase, I used liquid hand soap at the sink post-shower. I find this to be the best solution for quality, but it&#x27;s time consuming and a pain because I have to spend a lot of time bent over the sink trying to re-heat my bear with hot water. But the soap is perfect. It&#x27;s a perfect viscosity and it lubricates really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I&#x27;d try this product after randomly spotting it on Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now. I usually shave a couple of times a week because I&#x27;m lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot; to me. My first attempt was pre-shower - just cold - and I didn&#x27;t like that at all. My beard was too tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it in the shower, but obviously, that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s marketed for use and I might as well be using gel or even shampoo as a lubricant in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the best way to use it is post-shower. The first half of the shave goes ok, but find myself re-applying after that and even then feeling like I should re-heat my beard in the sink. Too lazy to do that, though, so I just re-apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While shaving I find that I have to frequently clean the razor. More so than with previous approaches. I run it under hot water, upside down and tap the razor. The hair comes out in clumps because of the gel. The gel can be a bit annoying at times because it&#x27;s so slippery and difficult to get off my hand. The razor slips and I&#x27;m spending more time than I&#x27;d like trying to rid my fingers of the gel after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Not sure. I&#x27;ll finish this tube and make the decision. I suspect I&#x27;ll just go back to regular gel in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;I read another review raving about Kiss My Face lotion. Was forced to buy three years supply because Amazon&#x27;s enfuriating add on erosion. I alternated between the two for the past month. I ordered more Bold. Yup, I decided that I do like it. I like the heating aspect of it. I have ZERO irritation with it. I get a close shave. Close than the other. And to me, the icing on the cake: I don&#x27;t have to rinse it off. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. It&#x27;s MEANT to leave on and I love that. I just dab my face and neck clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11/09/15: Ordering another tube in a few minutes. This is the only product that I&#x27;ve completely flipped my opinion on like this. I had a beard for a while this summer to skew my usage, but I&#x27;m going through about 2-3 per year now, so it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
            <li> i guess if you only wanted to use it dry shaving, it may be a good product.  I had tried to use with water was not impressed to say the least.</li>
            <li> I threw it out. Need I say more.  Ok, I will tell you that I did not like the scent and it does nothing to lend a closer shave with my Panasonic Arc 4 cordless shaver. I tried and really like Neutrogena Shave Cream for Sensitive Skin.  You can also find it at any drug store and its a fraction of the price of Bold.  I use it in the shower mostly and it works much better than Bold. Bold just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product to use with an electric razor then keep looking because this isn&#x27;t it.  Followed instructions by applying and waiting 30 seconds and it made my face so dry I couldn&#x27;t pull the electric razor across.  Actually increased the friction rather than reducing it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Wish I had known it existed long ago.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my new favorite product!  I have tried several shaving products in the past but this is by far the best.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bold For Men Dry Shave Gel is the best shaving product I have ever used. Cancer originally caused me to go with the shaved head look. Now in remission, I have chosen to maintain this \\&quot;non-hair\\&quot; style. I tried conventional shaving cream and cream in a tube but never got as close of a shave as I would like. Nicks and other irritation was a major problem too. With Bold Dry Shave Gel, I get a very smooth, easy glide and a very close shave. No burn, no nicks. To save on product, I do a section at a time rather than applying to my entire head. This works well and has cut the amount I use in half. This Dry Shave Gel is amazing!! The proof is in the shave. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband together with electrical shaver. He says it causes him irritation, this gel.For some people it works, for some not really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a water-only shaver for a long time now, but recently decided to try to be nice to my face so I went looking for something to help reduce razor burn. I hate the traditional shaving-foam-in-a-can stuff and wanted something different. This was close to what I needed and I&#x27;ll probably keep it in my travel bag, but it&#x27;s not going to see daily use. Bold For Men is alcohol based, and seems kind of like a few of my after-shave gels. It&#x27;s truly clear, which is allows you to see what you&#x27;re doing, unlike traditional foam. The instructions say to apply this to dry skin, wait 30 seconds, and then shave. I shave in the shower, so this was a little awkward to pull off. The best I could do was apply it outside the shower while waiting for the water to heat up, then jump in and start shaving immediately. This almost defeats the point of shaving in the shower since part of the idea is to warm up your face with the hot water for a few minutes so it&#x27;s easier going. Since this stuff is alcohol based, it seems like it largely evaporates before I&#x27;m done shaving. Probably works great for true &amp;#34;dry shave&amp;#34; conditions where no water is available (camping, etc) but it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. I ended up ordering some of the shave cream from Harry&#x27;s shave club, and it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Product has shown positive results so far when used as a preshave application. I would therefore recomend it ti anyone wanting a smoother cleaner shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second tube of this amazing stuff. I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 30 years and I&#x27;ve never come across a product that works as well as Bold. The end result is incredibly smooth skin and zero irritation. A little goes a long way and it even works well with cheap disposable razors so downgrade your razor if you must to justify the price of this stuff.</li>
            <li> For Christmas I received a Braun Series 7 799CC-AWD shaver.  This electric shaver is designed for use in the shower.  After doing quite a bit of online reading, I found that many people are using shaving cream with these electric shavers.  Please note that using shaving cream with an electric shaver is different than using shaving cream with a blade.  You don&#x27;t want as much foam with an electric shaver.  Some are even oils instead of creams.  I spent some time researching which shaving creams and gels to try and settled on the following.  I tried them all out for several months.  Here are my findings based on shaving with my electric shaver with my skin.  You may have different results if you use a different shaver or if your skin is more or less sensitive.  Many of these findings are subjective (like smell).  I have ranked them starting with the worst, Bold for Men and finished with the best, Kiss My Face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold for Men:  http://www.amazon.com/Bold-For-Men-Dry-Shave/dp/B000OZZH18/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390669335&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;bold+for+men+shave+gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  4 min. 58 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  5 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  2 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  1 out of 5  (very raw, 3 nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  Dead last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving gel is described as a dry shaving gel.  I used it in the shower on my damp face without any water.  I don&#x27;t think this impeded its usage at all.  I selected it to test because of the favorable reviews for using it, including reviewers who used it in the shower.  While this smelled a little better than the Alphagel, I thought this gel produced worse results.  My skin was more irritated by the end of a week of usage; I had three nicks on the last day (only 1 for the Alphagel); and it left my face feeling really rawafter shaving.  After I was done shaving and I washed the gel off of my face, I found it made my face feel really hot.  This is not a good thing.  The Alphagel left it feeling more smooth and cool.  I did like how this gel didn&#x27;t foam at all.  You could easily see your skin and hair stubble.  It was also a little faster shaving with this than the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington Alphagel Sensitive Skin:  http://www.amazon.com/Remington-Shaves-Alphagel-Sensitive-Shave/dp/B005ACNPLO/ref&#x3D;sr_1_15?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390068105&amp;sr&#x3D;8-15&amp;keywords&#x3D;alpha+gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  6 min. 16 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  4 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  1 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  3 out of 5  (felt raw but pretty smooth and 1 nick)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  5th overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found this shaving gel to have the worst smell of any that I tried.  It smells like those pucks you find in dirty highway gas station urinals.  My wife thought my face didn&#x27;t smell bad afterwards, but when I had her smell the gel from the tube, she said, &amp;#34;Oh my god, that is awful!&amp;#34;.  The best thing about this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t foam much at all.  After shaving with it for a week my skin became irritated and started to bleed in a couple of places.  Lubrication was poor during shaving too.  It just wasn&#x27;t think enough to lubricate very well.  I had a lot of trouble getting it to shave closely, which is why it took so long to shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eshu Shave Gel:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SOMEG2/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  5 min. 21 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  3 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  3 out5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  2 out of 5  (raw, 2 nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  4th Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a noticeable improvement between the last shaving gel and this one.  Eshu lubricated my face better and felt like it was more soothing after shaving.  It does have an odor that I don&#x27;t care for but it wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as bad as the Alphagel.  It comes out as an oil but does foam up as you shave with it.  The foaminess isn&#x27;t so excessive that I would discourage people from not using it with an electric razor.  Overall, not a bad shave, but I did notice that by the end of the week my face was feeling raw and I definitely needed a day or two for it to recover before shaving again.  One of the few things I liked about the Alphagel was that it left my face feeling cool instead of raw like the Eshu.  Again the Eshu was faster to shave with than the Bold for Men or the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bull Dog Original Shave Gel:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IX45FQ/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  7 min. 22 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  2 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  3 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  3rd Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bull dog represented a major step up from the last shave gel (the Eshu).  It was much thicker than any of the lower rated gels I tested.  This was both good and bad.  It provided better lubrication, but was also foamier.  This meant it took longer to shave and longer to clean my razor afterwards.  Bull Dog had about as much foam as I would be willing to put up with and still use with an electric razor.  My face felt only mildly irritated after each shave (barely noticeable) and my skin was in much better condition by the end of the week.  No nicks all week.  The odor was better than the lower rated gels but still wasn&#x27;t something desirable.  Tolerable would be a better description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea for Men, Sensitive Shaving Gel: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIL9HZE/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  6 min. 48 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  1 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  2rd Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea for men was the second best gel I tried.  It has many positives.  You only need a small amount for it to work; it is thick enough to protect my skin well (meaning my face felt good after a shave instead of raw); and I got a reasonably close shave from it.  There are a few negatives however.  It had was the foamiest of any of the gels I tried.  It took a little more time to clean my razor afterwards.  It has a pleasant, perfumey scent, but it is rather strong.  I would have preferred that it didn&#x27;t have a scent at all or if it had to have one, that it was more mild.  At least it didn&#x27;t smell like a dingy bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiss My Face Moisture Shave, Fragrance Free:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DU1Q4W/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  4 min. 12 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  5 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  5 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  5 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  5 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  1st Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my favorite of the shaving gels I tried.  While it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling cool like the Alphagel, it was the least irritating and my facefelt better after shaving than with any other product.  It comes out of the tube as a cream consistency.  It may have been the thickest of the gels, but wasn&#x27;t so thick to create a problem.  This is probably why it lubricated my face so well and left it feeling less irritation.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to shave with it.  It is probably one of the most cost effective due to this.  The smell was the least objectionable of any of the six that I tried.  While described as fragrance free, there was a very slight plastic smell that I could only smell if I stuck it right up to my nose and sniffed heavily.  While shaving I didn&#x27;t notice an odor.  This gel also was the fastest to shave with and also gave me the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I had tried all of these for several months I also tried the Kiss My Face Moisture Shave Cool Mint.  It has a mint scent to it.  I didn&#x27;t notice any cooling effect and after shaving and getting dressed, my wife didn&#x27;t notice any mint smell at all.</li>
            <li> I found that Bold for Men enhances the performance of the otherwise excellent Norelco Sensotouch 3D razor (tha can be used for both dry and wet shaving). I had always dreaded using shaving cream since I tend to be in a hurry in the morning and because of the mess it creates. Using bold for men a clean shave require fewer passes and the shave feels even cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;A great combination that I use every day now and can highly recommmend.</li>
            <li> WOW....WHAT A SHAVE....IT IS THE BEST SHAVE I EVER HAD...LET ME REPEAT...ITS THE BEST SHAVE I EVER HAD,,,5 STARS,,,,IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A SHAVE WITH NO DRAG...NO IRRITATION ......NO DISCOMFORT OF ANY SORT.....AND THE FASTEST,SMOOTHEST SHAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE....YOU MUST TRY :BOLD FOR MEN:  ED RICH</li>
            <li> I typically shave in the shower and keep my other shaving cream in there, but I was looking for a dry gel to keep handy for days that I just wanted to get a quick smooth shave without having to shower.  I purchased this product because of all the great reviews and I must say that I&#x27;m very impressed by the dry shave gel performance. It also leaves you with a refreshing feeling after the shave especially if you reapply after your shave.</li>
            <li> Amazing shave gel. I love the glide. I love how my skin feels after the shave. It truly made a difference for me. I am hooked</li>
            <li> This is best shave gel I have ever purchased ! I love the  way it performs and smells !  I got the closest shave in the  half the time  !</li>
            <li> I got this for my father on his birthday and he absolutely loves it! No doubt a great product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who swears by Bold.  He&#x27;s always raving about it.  I use an electric however, and have for years.  He told me that it works with electric shavers as well.  I doubted it, but was willing to prove it out, so I borrowed his Bold and gave it a try.  FANTASTIC!  It makes my shave closer and easier.  I have a wet/dry razor, so it makes cleaning easy.  I&#x27;ve started using my own and I love it.</li>
            <li> I wanted this product to be fantastic, but was disappointed. It did a fine job but didn&#x27;t offer any more protection from cutting than any other gel or cream. The shave itself was just a little bit better. I use Gillette Fusion Proglide gel, which is one of, if not the most expensive of the nationally available brands. The Dry Shave Gel is more than 7 times the cost (per oz.) &amp; is only slightly better overall, hence my 3 star rating.</li>
            <li> Great product that works for me.  Use it every time I shave.</li>
            <li> Used to shave my head, wasn&#x27;t very impressed.  I get a better shave with the shaving cream I buy at the supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clear, so you can see where your shaving&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t agitate your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still though I don&#x27;t think these two things justify buying a $15 bottle of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The shave gel seemed to work well while I was shaving.  However after I finished shaving, I noticed a burning sensation on my face and everywhere that I shaved looked like I had gotten a bad sunburn.  It went away after a few hours.  If you have senstive skin beware.</li>
            <li> I just recently saw an ad on amazon.com about Bold For Men and decided to give it a try. I used to shave with an alectric razor but I would get way too many ingrown hairs so the past 4 years I have switched back to shaving with a razor and gel. I have to admit I didn&#x27;t like the way Bold For Men Felt on my face and how slippery it was during shaving. The cool part was that becuase it is a clear gel and doesn&#x27;t have any foam, I could clearly see what areas needed to be shaved and didn&#x27;t have to go over anything twice as you would with a foam gel. After the shave i couldnt believe how close the shave was and how smooth my face was. If you have never shaved with this before I have to warn you, it will feel weird at first. It&#x27;s not another shaving cream, its a whole new way to shave. Once you see how great the results are you will be hooked. I would suggest trying it for a week and see how smooth your face will be. Best of all, because there is no soap, you will never get any ingrown hairs. It&#x27;s definitely a Bold invention. I have heard rumors that it will be presented in an episode of Shark Tank with Marc Cuban.</li>
            <li> Like the alcohol-free formula.</li>
            <li> Not completely sure its worth the money unless your using it to trim a beard line or side burns.  Otherwise I think its a bit too expensive to use in place of shaving cream/gel.  Doesn&#x27;t provide a closer shave then my Aveeno shave gel and is about 4 times the cost.</li>
            <li> It really shaves without water. I gave extra star for that innovation. But not good for sensitive skin. I got some rashes</li>
            <li> I tried with my electric razor/ trimmer and it clogs.  In fairness, may I shouldn&#x27;t have used with that.  I didn&#x27;t read closely enough.  It does protect my face decently with my safety razor.</li>
            <li> I have to admit when I first started using the product it was a clear five star rating. This is my second time buying the product and I am unhappy with it. This time around the product was much more watery then my last purchase. It didn&#x27;t do as good of a job as it did in the past as a result. My shave went from very smooth and clean with the first batch to a lot more cuts. The product being watered down as it is cannot be recommended for a good shave. If they stop cutting it as much then it could be excellent like it used to be. Now, not so much.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product exclusively for over 5 years, occasionally in between I used regular shaving gels because I ran out of my supply and would end up with irritated skin and a bad shave.  Bold for Men is soothing and invigorating and at the same time very gentle on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The bonus of using this as a dry shave just makes this product amazing in my opinion, far superior to anything else I have tried.  Everyone I have recommended this to has walked away loving it.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that you will notice is that you don&#x27;t need to reapply the gel when shaving in different directions in the same place which makes it all the more easy and effective to use.  One bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it had lots of great reviews and man they were right on. After applying it on my face I could definitely feel it work as it had a nice refreshing effect. I waited 30 seconds as instructed on back of tube and then started shaving and WOW what an amazing shave. It was an easy glide and I felt no after shave pain. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been trying too many products for a while for my thick hair and irritable skin. This product is very good and love the way my skin feels after the shave. It feels great that my search ended here.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this gel in a gift bag. Not knowing anything about the product, I read some of the in some reviews here about how it could be used with an electric shaver. I gave it a try, and found it did two things for me - the shaver moved much more smoothly over my skin (giving me a closer shave, especially in the \\&quot;concave\\&quot; areas of my neck), and the product also acted as a moisturizer. Five stars.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well and is quite comfortable, with two caveats:&lt;br /&gt;- Unless you rinse your multiblade razor with hot water, this stuff will clog it... so not quite waterless.&lt;br /&gt;- I hate the packaging. It comes in a wide tube that sits on its cap; the cap pops open with a loud plastic SNAP, guaranteed to annoy anyone trying to sleep nearby. (To keep the peace, I usually unscrew the cap instead, which is kinda messy.)  Bold&#x27;s cheaper competitor BodyVerde waterless shave isn&#x27;t as good on your face, but it comes in a handy, QUIET pump dispenser. If Bold ever fixes their packaging, I&#x27;ll gladly pay the higher price... but not now.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment in terms of getting a smooth dry shave.  I will try it a few times again, but following directions, it didn&#x27;t achieve the promised comfortable shave.  Sort of pricey too.</li>
            <li> I shave daily and this is the only product I use that will not cause irritation. And trust me I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> I found this product being offered to me in my email inbox after I signed up for a new &#x27;boutique-type&#x27; website as a new member, the offer I got was that a full regular bottle cost me $2 with free shipping. I&#x27;ll be getting any further bottles from Amazon for sure, it&#x27;s my go to website. I thought I&#x27;ll give it a try because I have a serious pain condition and shaving my legs hurts a lot especially now in Summer in Colorado, I have to do it more often.... THIS STUFF IS AMAZING FOR GIRLS TOO! Best part is, no shower, bath, soaking of legs or anything like that needed! It&#x27;s great! I just part fill up a bucket with warm water for rinsing off my triple blade razor and can shave my legs with this technique while sitting on the edge of my bed! comfy :) And you only need to use about a dollar coin sized amount for each leg I have discovered. So I think the one bottle will last me quite a while. It doesn&#x27;t smell super strong either, which I&#x27;m glad of, I didn&#x27;t want to go around smelling like my husband! And no need to rinse off afterward, I just rubbed in what was left on my legs and then added some moisturiser when it had dried and I was good to go. No stinging either and my skin is really sensitive. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Guys... Buy two bottles and give one to the woman in your life, tell them I recommend it for a super fast shave!! :)</li>
            <li> I have now been using this product for the past 9 months.  I shave every weekday and use slightly overly the recommended amount.  The tube lasts me about 4 months at a time.  This stuff really works!  I went back to regular shave gel once and regretted it. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  I&#x27;m about to buy my third tube.</li>
            <li> I use one of the Norelco shavers that dispenses its own lotion but the lotion got discontinued. I tried many alternative lotions but none were even close to working. I eventually gave up and went back to a dry electric shave. After hating it for a few months I tried again and found this. Wow, it is a great shave. I think I like it even better than the original Norelco lotion.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would ever dry shave. This product has cut my shaving time in half and I no longer feel like my face is on fire after a shave.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product.  The result is that you do not need water for it to work...although you do need it to rince the razor.  It does give a great shave...as well as the best.  Recommended</li>
            <li> I used Bold and was incredibly impressed with the product.  I loved the awesome sensation when I put it on and after I finish shaving.  I used to use it only to shave my beard area, but recently I started shaving my head, and it is awesome for that.  The gel makes my shave easy and clean, and it keeps my skin soft and smooth.  The thing I also like is that its a dry shave, no water necessary.  I have introduced 3 of my friends to Bold, and I will definitely be gifting it out this holiday season to a few more of my friends.</li>
            <li> Yes it has a manly smell, but that can be ignored with a good dousing of good skin cream.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin when it comes to shaving. This is the easiest shave I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. You just apply onto the shaving area, wait 30 seconds, and the shave is effortless, as well as leaving a nice, clean smell and good feel of a close shave. I really recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I recently received Bold as a gift and gave it a try. I must admit that I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had such a close shave without any irritation. I use it with my Gillete Fusion ProGlide razor and every morning I am amazed at how effortlessly I can shave.</li>
            <li> This shave gel is great. I have to shave so often, my skin often feels irritated and rough. A friend recommended I try this. After using it, my skin no longer feels like it&#x27;s burning and it feels  a lot smoother. It&#x27;s the best shave gel I&#x27;ve ever used and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Cute idea, but even after showering it does nothing to soften my thick morning beard. It might work for you if you have a light beard.&lt;br /&gt;Plus I have to wash it off my face afterwards or I break out: so the concept blows too.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get any results as promised just using this on dry skin. Washing my face beforehand and applying it to my wet face, it was okay. Certainly no better than a good, much cheaper pre-shave oil. Skip this one.</li>
            <li> This is really good for what it is, a waterless and a less mess shave.  Great for traveling if you don&#x27;t wanna carry a baggage full of shaving gear since it basically does it all.  For my super thick facial hair, I have to use a good amount of this product or my safety razor will tug on the hairs.  You can actually go through 3 passes without reapplying.  The reason I rate it 4 stars is because it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive for such a small tube.  I honestly don&#x27;t think this is good enough as an aftershave by itself, so I would recommend the Clubman Pinaud with it.  Also, this is a so called natural and cruelty free product and great for people who&#x27;s conscious about that stuff.</li>
            <li> Never before have I not been irritated on my face by A shave, one reason I keep a beard is so I don&#x27;t have to shave as much but this might change my mind... It&#x27;s great... Super smooth and I&#x27;ve even used it on week-old stubble. Let it soak in for at least thirty seconds though.</li>
            <li> The product works, but not any better than Lectric Shave. It smells better, however it for the sensitive skin on my neck it causes way too many cuts (and dare I say, tears) with my Panasonic razor. Lectric Shave doesn&#x27;t have this side effect at all.</li>
            <li> The first time I saw and heard of it, I was skeptical. The first time I tried it, I was unsure how much to use. The second time I used it, I fell in love! I knew at that moment that I would never use anything else to shave again. A match made in heaven, and thank God. My thick coarse beard and sensitive skin was put through the ringer with other products I had been using, and I needed some TLC. Bold help me cut my shaving time in half. If I wanted to sport a bare face, a goatee, rock some burns, or maintain a full beard, you would have thought I was Picasso!! Bold is truly transparent so I have the ability to see what I&#x27;m removing, or precisely shaping to perfect my look. Not only was I impressed by Bold&#x27;s performance, I really like the way it smells too. The only negative thing I have to say about BOLD is this...\\&quot;Darn, I wish I would have created it\\&quot;!! A shaving evolution!! I can&#x27;t wait to see what&#x27;s next from BOLD.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It works well with my Panasonic ES-LF51-A</li>
            <li> Something in the produce stings my face when I put it on.  Not the smooth and protected feel I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This changes everything! I love this stuff. It has really helped with shaving; especially if you want a quick shave before you head out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good AND smooth with the shave, you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty amazing, I have to say. I got it for one reason and one reason only, and that is that I&#x27;m training to be a barber, and when I go to my state board test, I have to give my model a straight razor shave without any real preparation of his beard. He has a very heavy, thick beard, and I&#x27;ve been worried about destroying his face using such an implement without the very necessary multiple hot towels (we only get one), pre-shave oil rub down, etc. So when I read the reviews for this item, I thought that I may have found my product. I was right. I performed three tests on myself: #1 - a dry shave (using product as directed) with my Mach 3. Three passes, worked like a charm. #2 - safety razor shave. Two passes. To my surprise, it still worked great. Left my face smooth, free of hair, and, most importantly, free of irritation. #3 - straight razor shave. This is the one I was worried about, but it left my face smooth and undisturbed, to my amazement. I did two passes (as with the safety razor, with then across the grain), and I was impressed. As previous reviewers have mentioned, there are some unsavory ingredients used in this product, which is why I dropped a star. I would use it myself on a regular basis were it not for the nasty things in it. Plus, I just love my wetshaving routine too much. I will use it at my test, then keep it for &amp;#34;emergencies&amp;#34; or just for when I&#x27;m really lazy. All in all, this is an amazing product, and I would recommend it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind some potentially cancer causing chemicals getting rubbed into their face.</li>
            <li> It works.  Well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the bad - there is no seal under the flip top.  I ordered this in winter, and it froze in transit, pushed out the flip top, and leaked all over the plastic bag it was shipped in.  The box the plastic bag was in was not affected. Also, the 4+ ounces in here are not going to last very long.  Shaving soap is cheaper per use by a factor of ten.  For those two reasons, I had to take a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I cleaned it up, I tried it.  I shave with an old fashioned safety razor, and shaving in the shower has always been the only way that I can shave without razor burn and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this stuff on my face, waited 30 seconds like they said, and did my fist pass.  Worked like a champ.  I put some on again, waited another 30 seconds, and did a second pass in another direction - and I was done.  Normally, it takes me 4 passes to get as close a shave as I got in just two with this stuff.  I am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin - I will break out in jsut a few hours if exposed to something my skin doesn&#x27;t like.  I&#x27;ve been fine for over a day - no bumps, acne, extra sensitivity, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have no idea how this will work for shaving your head - I am not balding yet, so I&#x27;m not going to shave my head just to find out, but man, if it works as well as it does on the face, this is some neat stuff.&lt;br /&gt;This will not be my daily shave gel, but I will probably use it once a week.  This is definitely worth having on hand for those times when I need a quick shave and don&#x27;t have time for the shower that normally accompanies my routine.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use this with my electric shaver for dry shaving, but it is too sticky and the shaver drags along.  I prefer Shiseido Uno over this.  I did try it with my three blade razor and it worked okay. My face felt slightly irritated afterwards, and it seemed like I had to use a lot of the gel on subsequent uses to eliminate the irritation.  For the price, I can do much better with a can of Nivea foaming shave gel.</li>
            <li> Im in the military and soon going on a deployment. Im a wet shaver that uses the merkur 34c  DE razor. Because of the deployment and having to go to training enviroment prior to it, that usually involves only being allowed to shower in the evening and shaving with nothing but a sink in a public restroom with no prep or shower other than hot sink water I decided I need to switch back to something that gets the job done with no real prep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I only use my electric shaver on days im running late or on pt days or sometimes even&lt;br /&gt;Just the last day of work cycle. I decided im going to switch to it exclusively. I have bad memories of it giving me rashes and such. But I wanted to stick it out and see if it changes. I decided to get this gel bexause it will allow me to see my hair and continue shaving as well as moisturize AND disinfect and clean my skin. And let me just says it works! Very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im very happy with my shaver again. I use the panasonic arc 5. Another plus is there is no cleanup since water is not used. Ultimately I reccomend this for electric shaver users.</li>
            <li> Never used this type of product for a waterless shave, having always wet my face and used shaving cream. BOLD works fairly well at getting your face ready to be scraped by that nasty razor. It prevents razor burn and makes the shave nearly as good as with creams or gels. The smell is okay, not offensive or overly strong. It&#x27;s good for a travel case, where you can use it in an airport or taxi before your big meeting. Otherwise, stick with shaving cream or Edge, my favorite gel.</li>
            <li> Great close shave without the razor burn.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used.  Forget the old fashioned aerosol foam cans, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Great product - SMOOTH shave!  As others say, this stuff is a real breakthrough it terms of being easy on your face and  definitely nourishes your skin.  I&#x27;ve found it to extend the life of my razor by 2-3 X as long, especially when I clean and dry it after the shave.  The $$ savings in blades goes a long way to offset the added cost of this great product.</li>
