            <li>They were as advertised and we are happy with them.</li>

            <li>Appears to be good quality, I hope it will stand the test of time.</li>
            <li>I would like to add to be fair, that the mat is good quiality</li>

            <li>Worth the money, excellent buy.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the quality nice support for standing.  </li>
            <li>Cushy worth every penny</li>
            <li>nice gel cushion.</li>
            <li>great buy ,fast shipping, and still in good shape after months of use.</li>
            <li>It is great and certainly is worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>and I received them with bright blue \\&quot;Best Salon\\&quot; painted on the top of them.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I bought this last year, it is work perfectly, like I am working on clouds, love the caution...</li>
            <li>its a matte shine so hair does tend to stay on it but just brush it more often.</li>
            <li>However, this time I purchased two more</li>
            <li>Goes perfectly with salon decor and provides comfort to legs &amp; feet when I have those long days at work.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way under that mat easily.</li>
            <li>They are easy to move and clean when needed.</li>
            <li>The May wasn&#x27;t comfortable to stand on</li>
            <li>It fits well around the chair and is comfortable.</li>
            <li>shipped very fast and will get more.</li>
            <li>Feels great at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li>Great large soft mat.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet had a full day of work with this item</li>
            <li>Just received this mat today and it is far more cushy than my previous mat.</li>
            <li>We have a very nice up scale salon and we do not want another business&#x27;s name, printed in bright blue, on our mats that were supposed to be all black.</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s pretty comfortable as well.</li>
            <li>So soft yet supportive.</li>
            <li>I have seen many other mats go for a lot more than this one.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the rubber design detail, it looks like a bad cut and glue job to me, but hey he has to love it not me.</li>
            <li>its very soft and comfortable to stand on.</li>
            <li>My feet, legs &amp; back have never felt better.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a cheap mat, try this, if not spend a little more to get a higher quality mat.</li>
            <li>This mat is very nice and thick.</li>
            <li>but I will say so far it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I was happy with first purchase but not happy now.</li>
            <li>It is a real bargain for any stylist.</li>
            <li>thanks you</li>
            <li>First day, she had a very busy day and came home saying the mat \\&quot;saved the day\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Other than that I would highly reccomend:)</li>
            <li>Only thing is it says best salon in dark blue on the side, but for the price and quality it&#x27;s not that big of an issue</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I expect these mats to fatigue after a couple years under full-time stylists in high heels, but this is unacceptable.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick for maximum comfort.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that the edges do not stay down and hair gets underneath very easily and is a hassle.</li>
            <li>I open up my first barber shop</li>
            <li>So far it is holding up well.</li>
            <li>His feet and back had been sore by standing so much and it, according, to him, has helped a lot</li>
            <li>Professional opinion, salon owner.</li>
            <li>Gave on to an old barber, all of his pain is gone.</li>
            <li>Six months later, with a VERY part-time stylist, this mat looks like it came out of a wood chipper.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised on the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>She has done nothing but praise the mat and the fact that her legs, feet, knees, etc are not tired at all after a long day at the salon.</li>
            <li>Really helpful for back and feet on long busy days!  </li>
            <li>This mats marks easily and is a too thick.</li>
            <li>The only problem so far is that they lift up around the edges and let hair in.</li>
            <li>1 has developed a puncture and none lay flat on the floor.</li>
            <li>The listing no long says that.</li>
            <li>The only odd thing is the large print logo on the corner fir the company, but all in all that is no big deal</li>

            <li> Of your looking for value, you&#x27;ve got it here. But if your looking for quality I&#x27;d think twice. The May wasn&#x27;t comfortable to stand on and I felt was not professional looking. But it is a great value if it&#x27;s what your looking for.</li>

            <li> Best ever salon mat my feet thanks you</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality nice support for standing.  Jill Lehr</li>
            <li> I bought 8 of these 10 months ago. 1 has developed a puncture and none lay flat on the floor. We trip on them and hair gets caught under them. However, they are very comfortable! I note that people have the same &amp;#34;not laying flat on the floor&amp;#34; problem with the 1/2&amp;#34; mats. too. When I bought them, the listing said they were puncture proof and had a 5 year limited warranty. The listing no long says that. Best Salon (the manufacturer) will not support sales on Amazon. If you go to their web site, you get a 2 year warranty but it will not cover the lifting problem. In fact, they won&#x27;t admit that their mats have the problem. Less than a year and I need to replace these mats already.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a hair stylist who said it is wonderful! His feet and back had been sore by standing so much and it, according, to him, has helped a lot</li>
            <li> It feels great under my feet, even with my heels on! I just wish they made it in an inch thickness!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet had a full day of work with this item but I will say so far it&#x27;s not bad. My only problem is that the edges do not stay down and hair gets underneath very easily and is a hassle.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this mat. He&#x27;s a barber and he says he loves it. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the rubber design detail, it looks like a bad cut and glue job to me, but hey he has to love it not me. He says it&#x27;s pretty comfortable as well.</li>
            <li> This mat is amazing! So soft yet supportive. My feet, legs &amp; back have never felt better. Some of the girls I work with have spent between $120 &amp; $160 for a mat &amp; they want mine (for the comfort &amp; price)! Thank you best salon. You forever have my business!</li>
            <li> These mats are thick and very comfy.  The only problem so far is that they lift up around the edges and let hair in.</li>
            <li> Excellent mat. Removed all my discomforts back, feet.  Worth the money, excellent buy. Professional opinion, salon owner. Gave on to an old barber, all of his pain is gone.</li>
            <li> It fits well around the chair and is comfortable. I have seen many other mats go for a lot more than this one.</li>
            <li> Great buy just what I needed. I open up my first barber shop so I was shopping on a budget hit a great product at a great price. Well shop again for my next purchase</li>
            <li> I bought 8 of these over a year ago for our salon. They were as advertised and we are happy with them. However, this time I purchased two more and I received them with bright blue \\&quot;Best Salon\\&quot; painted on the top of them. We have a very nice up scale salon and we do not want another business&#x27;s name, printed in bright blue, on our mats that were supposed to be all black. I have partially covered them  with a sharpie which now looks ghetto. I do not have time to send them back. Like I said, I was happy with first purchase but not happy now. Unless this company fixes this, I will not be buying from them again. I would like to add to be fair, that the mat is good quiality and I would purchase again if ALL BLACK.</li>
            <li> Six months later, with a VERY part-time stylist, this mat looks like it came out of a wood chipper. I expect these mats to fatigue after a couple years under full-time stylists in high heels, but this is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> everything is excellent and delivered on time</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised on the quality of this product. Only thing is it says best salon in dark blue on the side, but for the price and quality it&#x27;s not that big of an issue</li>
            <li> I rated it 4 stars because the cushion on this mat is awesome. I could definitely tell the difference in this mat verses other mats I stood on. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
