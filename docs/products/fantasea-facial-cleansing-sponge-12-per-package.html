            <li>love these sponges I&#x27;ve used them for years to wash my face  </li>
            <li>They are more then a 5 star to me</li>
            <li>my children love them.</li>
            <li>She said these would do a better job at removing dirt versus using my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>more.</li>
            <li>like that there are so many in the pack because you don&#x27;t want to keep these sponges for too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The package is not the same as pictured, but the product is great!</li>
            <li>I love them :)</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive and effective way to go!</li>
            <li>These sponges are good quality and an excellent buy, highly recommend for facial use.</li>
            <li>These are nice, gentle sponges for facial cleansing and a great price for a dozen!</li>
            <li>and they tear easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken me some time to find sponges that I really like, and I&#x27;m glad I found these!</li>
            <li>They have the consistency of cheap dish sponge...</li>
            <li>Great sponges for facial cleaning.</li>
            <li>Make a mistake of buying cheap ones and threw them out.</li>
            <li>Great to use for facial cleansing.  </li>

            <li>Take product off smoothly.</li>
            <li>They clean well.</li>
            <li>Use these to both clean &amp; to apply oil to my face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li>She was right!</li>
            <li>Good for two uses on the same face</li>
            <li>these are great for face washing like in a spa, just wet them and then wipe off product, rinse and repeat!</li>
            <li>I like this sponges because they form lather with my skin cleaning gel quite nicely and they are smooth enough to use to remove the eye makeup without problem.</li>
            <li>Normally I would be able to reuse pads like these</li>
            <li>Dipping in warm water several times and wiping over my skin until clean.</li>
            <li>These are made of some kind of a foam mixed with rubber material.</li>
            <li>but i would not recommend these for personal clients or on my own skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a great little sponge for travel or just to sit by your sink to grab and wash your face with -- and just the right size.</li>
            <li>I use the sponges with my cleaner until there is no trace of dirt, and my skin is left so clean and smooth!</li>
            <li>The price was right , for a package of 12, and I will continue to order them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin and leaves the skin clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>These feel exactly like kitchen sponges.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I thought they&#x27;d have a bit more roughness for facial exfoliation use (like some i&#x27;d have before), but they don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Cleans as well as higher brands.</li>
            <li>When my face is bare of makeup I use a sponge with my cleanser for the exfoliation I need, and I have found nothing to work better than a natural sponge.  </li>
            <li>Received timely + reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliation is thorough and gentle, and when a sponge has worn out its use I toss it and grab another.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and just the right size.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty soft though on the skin if you want some gentle exfoliation while cleaning your face.</li>
            <li>These come highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>I really like these sponges, but I am not convinced these are the natural ones...feels a bit rubbery.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s color is vomit green.  :)</li>
            <li>but I still recommend changing out to a new one often.</li>
            <li>Will not suggest this items, unless seller changes the new packing.  </li>
            <li>They dry out quickly which avoids germs</li>
            <li>very soft to the face.</li>
            <li>These are just what I was looking for - and are exactly like the ones given to me after receiving a facial.  </li>
            <li>These sponges are better for my face than a wash cloth or other facial sponges I&#x27;ve bought from Target, Walmart, and Ulta.</li>
            <li>Same exact texture.</li>
            <li>This particular sponge is larger and a little softer than most out there.</li>
            <li>The sponges are very soft and not harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li>She uses them everyday and says they&#x27;re fine</li>
            <li>Soft but not too soft.</li>
            <li>In this case, it really doesn&#x27;t matter the quality of the sponge itself because it&#x27;s for facial used, not for cleaning kitchen.</li>
            <li>I use it whenever i do my at home facials and it works like a dream and is so soft when hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given these to my young sons for their use as well.</li>
            <li>Not too rough, just enough texture to clean well.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and was looking for.</li>
            <li>Shrinks when dry and rehydrates to original size when wet</li>
            <li>and they last a long time The price is great even if they were expensive</li>
            <li>The sponges work fine, but I&#x27;m giving 3 stars because the sponge shrinks very small.</li>
            <li>these are ok, but basically are just little round sponges.  </li>
            <li>Ok not as thick as I expected</li>
            <li>I like these sponges because they are thin and easy to use in the crevasses of my face and ears.  </li>
            <li>when wet, are very soft.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I like these sponges because they are thin and easy to use in the crevasses of my face and ears.  </li>
            <li> when wet, are very soft.  </li>
            <li> When I open the box along with a few items, the plastic bag was broken, and few of the sponges came outside from its original cheap plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> the only con is that it is smaller than expected.  </li>
            <li> I love these sponges for removing cold cream and washing my face.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Like any sponge, dont use too long...</li>
            <li> They also rinse &amp; dry well.</li>
            <li> The package is open, sponges are 9 count and they look like they were previously used.</li>
            <li> It increases back to size when water is applied, I found that odd because I never had a sponge do that before.</li>
            <li> Would like it little bigger for cleaning face.  </li>
            <li> These little sponges are part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> They were just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Since, they come in a package of 12, I could keep one at the shower and other by my sink and replace them when needed.</li>
            <li> Used with facial wash, I even use them over my delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> These are not great facial cleansing sponges!  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> They work well but are a little too small.</li>
            <li> if you need these for a small business, these work well.</li>
            <li> I keep mine moist and in a small container in the refrigerator to avoid bacteria growth.</li>
            <li> I use these in lieu of an exfoliant because my facial skin is absurdly tender.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small sponge, but I use it to wash my face.</li>
            <li> I usually wash them with my laundry in a delicates bag then reuse them.</li>

            <li> It was for my wife, fits the requirement and she was so happy.  Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
            <li> These feel exactly like kitchen sponges. If you&#x27;re expecting something else, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34;sponges are horrid!  The have a fishy smell and the entire order was moist and sticky!  These are not great facial cleansing sponges!  They have the consistency of cheap dish sponge...nothing you should ever use on your face.</li>
            <li> What a great deal. Love these sponges for facials. And a good price too. We will be reordering for sure!</li>
            <li> as described, great deal</li>
            <li> Have been getting sponges at CVS for years and you&#x27;d get 2 for what I paid for 12 of these so an excellent bargain.  Good quality also</li>
            <li> This is a great little sponge for travel or just to sit by your sink to grab and wash your face with -- and just the right size. There are 12 in the pack so I gave them to friends as well. They dry out quickly which avoids germs but I still recommend changing out to a new one often.</li>
            <li> I love these for washing my face in the shower. At first I didn&#x27;t like how they are bigger than the ones I&#x27;ve gotten in the past, but I like the bigger size.  Good quality product.</li>
            <li> very small and thin.  Won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. Timely arrival and good value,</li>
            <li> i like it.gud product</li>
            <li> They were just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Second purchase and will continue to buy</li>
            <li> These sponges are think, soft and feel great on the skin! Used with facial wash, I even use them over my delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> Awesome, you can find something like this in the hop to buy it. I&#x27;&#x27;m veryhappy with this purchase, I recomend to all for nice fascial cleaning</li>
            <li> I always bought them at a drug store but they don&#x27;t have them any more.I said let me try amazon ,which I should of known what ever I want  no matter what it is amazon has it .I love these sponges I&#x27;ve used them for years to wash my face  and they last a long time The price is great even if they were expensive I would still buy them..They are more then a 5 star to me</li>
            <li> very soft to the face. my children love them. they only been using the sponge for two days. i see a difference.</li>
            <li> The best feature is the texture.  Not too rough, just enough texture to clean well.  Would like it little bigger for cleaning face.  Durable, doesn&#x27;t fall apart after several use like dish-washing sponges.</li>
            <li> These little sponges are part of my daily routine. I wash my face and take my time to cleanse well, then I sue two of these to rinse my face well. Dipping in warm water several times and wiping over my skin until clean. This was the best Price I have seen and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These sponges are great and priced well also.  I use them when performing facials.  They are soft and just the right size.</li>
            <li> Yep...they are good products for the price.</li>
            <li> Great sponges for facial cleaning.Make a mistake of buying cheap ones and threw them out. These come highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> The packages look much bigger then they actually are, but I got what I paid for. I hope they hold up after I wash them in the machine.</li>
            <li> I really like these sponges, but I am not convinced these are the natural ones...feels a bit rubbery.  Still, of the price I a, happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these now to wash my face with an organic liquid, that&#x27;s color is vomit green.  :)&lt;br /&gt;The face wash was staining my good washcloths, so I moved on to this product.  Besides washing up, I  use them to wash off any face mask I might try.  This works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is nice, and they work just great and are very easy to use.  I can recommend.</li>
            <li> good products and pricing</li>
            <li> I just received my order. The package is open, sponges are 9 count and they look like they were previously used. Complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Great to use for facial cleansing.  The sponges are very soft and not harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a local beauty supply company that sells this at such a low price as I can get on line, so if you need these for a small business, these work well.</li>
            <li> these are great for face washing like in a spa, just wet them and then wipe off product, rinse and repeat!</li>
            <li> What can you say about a facial sponge?  These are nice, gentle sponges for facial cleansing and a great price for a dozen!</li>
            <li> Great quality sponges!  It&#x27;s taken me some time to find sponges that I really like, and I&#x27;m glad I found these!</li>
            <li> These pads are very small and the quality is not great. Normally I would be able to reuse pads like these however I have only gotten one use out of each of these pads and that use did not even cleanse my face the way I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Ok not as thick as I expected and they tear easily</li>
            <li> I bought these sponges per the recommendation of an esthetician. She said these would do a better job at removing dirt versus using my Clarisonic. She was right! I use the sponges with my cleaner until there is no trace of dirt, and my skin is left so clean and smooth! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Soft but not too soft. They clean well. I keep mine moist and in a small container in the refrigerator to avoid bacteria growth. Use these to both clean &amp; to apply oil to my face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> Great product.  These are just what I was looking for - and are exactly like the ones given to me after receiving a facial.  Received timely + reasonably priced.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> these are ok, but basically are just little round sponges.  I thought they&#x27;d have a bit more roughness for facial exfoliation use (like some i&#x27;d have before), but they don&#x27;t.  when wet, are very soft.  If that&#x27;s what you want, then get them.  Like any sponge, dont use too long... they get groddy after awhile!</li>
            <li> Great price for the product. It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin and leaves the skin clean and fresh! love them!</li>
            <li> Great cleansing sponge. Shrinks when dry and rehydrates to original size when wet</li>
            <li> Great sponges, work better than the ones at our salon.</li>
            <li> They work well but are a little too small.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a a lady who did my facial</li>
            <li> These sponges look like the ones that are made of cellulose, but they are not. These are made of some kind of a foam mixed with rubber material. I hated rubber-like feeling on my face when used this sponge. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Good for two uses on the same face</li>
            <li> I like this sponges because they form lather with my skin cleaning gel quite nicely and they are smooth enough to use to remove the eye makeup without problem. They also rinse &amp; dry well. Since, they come in a package of 12, I could keep one at the shower and other by my sink and replace them when needed. I didn&#x27;t rate them as 5 because I was hoping to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; more. However, I don&#x27;t have any pimples or blackheads since I start using them.</li>
            <li> the sponges work for now, as i only need them for school. but i would not recommend these for personal clients or on my own skin.</li>
            <li> These sponges are used by spas that I have visited in Asia so I had to order them for my use at home.  They are perfect so I will place another order when these wear out.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> I use these in lieu of an exfoliant because my facial skin is absurdly tender. They feel good and do a fine job without crumbling apart. I recommend them to anyone with tender skin.</li>
            <li> ...ever again!  I like these sponges because they are thin and easy to use in the crevasses of my face and ears.  ALSO, it saves me from having to purchase exfoliating cleansers along with my regular cleanser.  When my face is bare of makeup I use a sponge with my cleanser for the exfoliation I need, and I have found nothing to work better than a natural sponge.  The exfoliation is thorough and gentle, and when a sponge has worn out its use I toss it and grab another.  Very inexpensive and effective way to go!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small sponge, but I use it to wash my face. So it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there are so many in the pack because you don&#x27;t want to keep these sponges for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal.</li>
            <li> This particular sponge is larger and a little softer than most out there. The price was right , for a package of 12, and I will continue to order them. NOT TO BE PASSED UP.</li>
            <li> The sponges work fine, but I&#x27;m giving 3 stars because the sponge shrinks very small. It increases back to size when water is applied, I found that odd because I never had a sponge do that before.</li>
            <li> The packing is different from what it&#x27;s advertised.  The plastic is different style.  When I open the box along with a few items, the plastic bag was broken, and few of the sponges came outside from its original cheap plastic bag.  Will not suggest this items, unless seller changes the new packing.  In this case, it really doesn&#x27;t matter the quality of the sponge itself because it&#x27;s for facial used, not for cleaning kitchen.</li>
            <li> These sponges are good quality and an excellent buy, highly recommend for facial use.</li>
            <li> Awesome sponges.. great price</li>
            <li> great stuff! I use it whenever i do my at home facials and it works like a dream and is so soft when hydrated.</li>
            <li> The wife loves these and they are hard to find. This 12 pack is a great deal. If you are in the need of these it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> These are great face sponges.  I use them daily.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.  Cleans as well as higher brands.</li>
            <li> The package is not the same as pictured, but the product is great! I love these sponges for removing cold cream and washing my face. They are soft and gentle on my skin. These sponges are better for my face than a wash cloth or other facial sponges I&#x27;ve bought from Target, Walmart, and Ulta. They are a great product for a reasonable price!  The size makes them convenient to hold, and great for travel. I usually wash them with my laundry in a delicates bag then reuse them.</li>
            <li> I use these to wash my face and remove make up. they save my wash cloths from turning brown from tinted moisturizer and mascara. Compared to buying 2 pack from sally&#x27;s beauty or drugstore this is a great value buy.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find them at the supermarket. I love them :)</li>
            <li> My mother bought these sponges because they seemed similar to ones that she got from her esthetician. She uses them everyday and says they&#x27;re fine but they feel a bit cheaper than what she would prefer. They&#x27;re pretty soft though on the skin if you want some gentle exfoliation while cleaning your face.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack a of three from Sephora and I really liked them. I bought a lot because it was a good deal and I like them for my face.</li>
            <li> Best sponges out there!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and was looking for. Size was same (maybe even just a touch larger) than what was used on me when I got a facial. Same exact texture. I&#x27;ve given these to my young sons for their use as well. Gentle but effective exfoliation. Great product.</li>
            <li> I like it..the only con is that it is smaller than expected.  The quality is good, was what I used before.</li>
            <li> Nice texture! I use this sponge for removing various face masks. Take product off smoothly. Does not tear skin. A skin are must have!</li>
