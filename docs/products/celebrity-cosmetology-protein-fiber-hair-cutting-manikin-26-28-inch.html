            <li>When it arived i was so happy.</li>
            <li>we use this to display hair pieces and it looks great</li>

            <li>For the price, a very nice product.</li>
            <li>This head is amazing!</li>
            <li>Its OK but not the best as the hair is synthetic and cant be use to practice all techniques.</li>
            <li>Really nice!</li>
            <li>My daughter was thrilled with this!</li>
            <li>This doll is good</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still good</li>
            <li>It has been a good tool for her</li>
            <li>If you do then it will have permanently damaged hair that crunches and does not look good.</li>
            <li>It looks really good and functional.</li>
            <li>This was a good beginners head.  </li>
            <li>this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Lots of good use.  </li>
            <li>Nothing but good to say about this.</li>
            <li>She was delighted with the price and quality of this manikin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It was exactly as advertised, the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>My wife bought this and all my girls love Celebrity Lexi!  </li>
            <li>My daughter is thoroughly enjoying it!</li>
            <li>We got it for our grandkids to style the hair, and they LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love this head!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this manikin!  </li>
            <li>This was a great gift for her, and a good value, it was shipped quickly and no problems at all.  </li>
            <li>This was a great purchase and quick shipping!</li>
            <li>This doll head is amazing for braiding, and styling.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the one being tugged and pulled on for her glamorous hairdos and the styles she creates with this are amazing.</li>
            <li>the cheap price lol.</li>
            <li>I purchased this thinking it would be great for advanced education in my salon, but the hair is slippery, and in no way can it handle chemicals or heat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like working with dolls hair.</li>
            <li>But it still braids nicely and works for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li>They practice on the manikin, then fix their own hair in the styles.</li>
            <li>My daughter saved and bought this for her job that requires her to practice all kind of braids.  </li>
            <li>She liked the way it handled.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok ... but hide your good shears ...</li>
            <li>and when it came in the mail it looked so nice</li>
            <li>She does hair styles on it that she then does on her own hair.</li>
            <li>she didn&#x27;t liked it at all.</li>
            <li>The hair is great and she has so much fun with it!</li>
            <li>hair knots up VERY easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to style.  </li>
            <li>But because it&#x27;s synthetic hair, it gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li>There is just no &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; so it tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li>hair knots very easy</li>
            <li>My 10 year old Daughter got this for Christmas, and for the price it is a great deal!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the hair is really soft and great for braiding!</li>
            <li>It cuts easy, but really I found it best for braids &amp; updo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to fix!</li>
            <li>The hair is so easily tangled!  </li>
            <li>Overall, however, this an awesome product that I am thrilled I found.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed great, but then when I started putting designs on it</li>
            <li>Buy new one, looks very good.</li>
            <li>This is very important to keep the manikin in place.  </li>
            <li>She has beautiful fine long hair and is great for haircuts, coloring, upstyles, braids, curls, etc.</li>
            <li>probably ok if you want to braid it</li>
            <li>Absolutley love Lexi.  </li>
            <li>It also arrived the next day, so I was very impressed by that!!</li>
            <li>Make sure you purchase the clap for the head.</li>
            <li>So much better and cheaper than the toy ones you can buy.  </li>
            <li>If you purchase, make sure you get the stand, it doesn&#x27;t come with one.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed cosmetologist in need of more braiding practice.</li>
            <li>Absolutley love it.</li>
            <li>thats ok because I put a trash can underneath me and it caught all the hair.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Spend the money on a&lt;br /&gt;Different manakin with better hair</li>
            <li>I love how the hair feels and styles.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>you are purchasing for display purposes it would be okay.  </li>
            <li>love this Manikin.</li>
            <li>I purchased the stand on amazon and it works great, however will allow the head to tilt if you are really pulling.</li>
            <li>This product was okay.</li>
            <li>great item fast shipping</li>
            <li>She is satisfied that it will meet her needs.</li>
            <li>I bought Lexi so I could cut a better layer into it before stateboards.</li>
            <li>I shampooed the hair and it did not tangle or knot up like many of my mannequins.</li>
            <li>My daughter is having a grand time with this.</li>
            <li>and she love it</li>
            <li>It is more like playing with Barbie hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure about makeup on this, as it would probably stain.  </li>
            <li>Pleased.</li>
            <li>For the price and for the fun you get out of it, It is a good buy.</li>
            <li>Im sure</li>
            <li>In Fact, It Did More Harm.</li>
            <li>She is in love with it.</li>
            <li>This item was the best price by far and it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>When she arrived to me her hair was sooo long, just like the picture (perfect!).  </li>
            <li>Awesome long hair to practice!</li>
            <li>The make up it also light enough that she is all to happy to practice her makeup application also!</li>
            <li>overall, this is a very good product.</li>
            <li>It was great at first but after a while the hair starts to snag and tangle super easily.</li>
            <li>Would make a great birthday or Christmas gift for the budding cosmetologist.</li>
            <li>i, think the size is just what i expected, its perfect.</li>
            <li>cause other than that your product is great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen that most people that get it for little girls to braid it have been very happy.</li>
            <li>the hair comes out so easily...</li>
            <li>I bought this for practicing updos and braids but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be easy to work with</li>
            <li>Tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Hair falls out easily</li>
            <li>It also tangles easily &amp; nothing helps to get it out.</li>
            <li>The hair does tangle easily but is workable.  </li>
            <li>Hair tangles easy and feels like wax.</li>
            <li>It tangles easily and don&#x27;t stay with hair stiles.</li>
            <li>Was the perfect gift for my 12 yr old daughter who wants to be a hair dresser.</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest that if you are looking for this type of item, try something else.</li>
            <li>I do recommend it for someone  who wants to see if a Hair Dresser Profession is a good fit.</li>
            <li>Love this beautiful long haired manequin head for my grandaughter to practice hairstyles on!!</li>
            <li>Fine display for hair accessories etc..</li>
            <li>Great texture &amp; fun for my 3 granddaughters to create new hairstyles.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!!</li>
            <li>Came securely packaged.</li>
            <li>The hair was beautifully smooth on day one.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic cosmetology manikin.  </li>
            <li>The face of the actual product I received looked great.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mannequin for that purpose only and I am thrilled with the density and length of hair at such a great price!</li>
            <li>purchased this because I enjoy experimenting with hair.</li>
            <li>Fiber hair is for haircutting and with cheap shears.....</li>
            <li>The hair is so silky smooth</li>
            <li>Hair can come out on the brush some, but overall my daughter thinks it is great and loves it.</li>
            <li>so it serves its purpose great buy compared to the one that are 100 and something again i only ordered to practice braids</li>
            <li>Great soft hair not hard to style does pretty good with heat</li>
            <li>The hair on this dolly is very nice its good and thick.  </li>
            <li>So glad I got it at the right time.</li>
            <li>The hair is amazing and the Manikins face is very pretty and soft and easy for her to put makeup on!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is very useful</li>
            <li>She is very interested in becoming a hair stylist.</li>
            <li>It took me four cuts before I could do a very straight blunt cut, so...the cheapest you start the better</li>
            <li>I love the doll looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>Lots of fun!</li>
            <li>I just love it so much!</li>
            <li>This shipped quickly, and very nice hair, but the hair is falling out when brushed.</li>
            <li>I see today that I will be a very good hair stylist, and this profession, as my second profession after nursing will not only fit me, but will bring joy back into my life.</li>
            <li>then I dyed it a bright red with</li>
            <li>Hair was a bit ratty on the bottom 6&amp;#34; but good overall</li>
            <li>I love how the hair feels it&#x27;s very quality</li>
            <li>was FULL OF HAIR.</li>
            <li>even my hair could not tolerate that much:)</li>
            <li>Only thing it was good for was to practice my state board cut on.</li>
            <li>so hair is not human but doll head is still good for practicing braids which is what i bought for</li>
            <li>Love the quality,,feels like real hair,,good price!!would recomend,,</li>
            <li>The hair is also very find and smooth, so will fall out of a style more easily than real hair.</li>
            <li>It tangles pretty easy and we haven&#x27;t done a lot of styling yet.</li>
            <li>if that&#x27;s all you want to do, this will be great for you other than hair falling out.</li>
            <li>Delivered quick.  </li>
            <li>The hair falls out quickly</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this girl :)</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that Lexi can be secured to a table to keep her nice and steady while little hands to all the work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already learned a new braid on Lexi and then was able to do it with my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>This hair isn&#x27;t any good unless all you&#x27;re trying to do is practice styles on DRY hair.</li>
            <li>exactly what i needed!</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like picture!</li>
            <li>It worked great the 1st time, after that is was one matted mess.  </li>
            <li>This would be great for a little girl who likes to play with hair.</li>
            <li>Received in good time and was what I expected.  </li>
            <li>She is having so much fun with it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>Having fun practicing braiding.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>useful</li>
            <li>This Mannequin I Purchased Did Not Become Useful To Me.</li>
            <li>The hair is vey long and it feels soft, but it tangles so easily that it actually isn&#x27;t good for practicing braiding.</li>
            <li>From a cosmetology student point of view: Lexi was of very low quality her hair tangled easily and falls out too easily.</li>
            <li>The hair falls out way too easily and the hair doesn&#x27;t brush back easily</li>
            <li>The hair is a good length for her to practice all her braiding and other hair styles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would lay right once cut.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t comb it out because it will retangle right away.</li>
            <li>I am online right now because I am about to buy ANOTHER head for her to take her state test with.</li>
            <li>the hair is a bit longer that i expected but it is perfect because my daughters hair is really long.</li>
            <li>Just purchase a new pair o scissor to star to cut the hair, comb-wash the hair so it will not tangle, and use some conditioner to smooth the hair to comb and keep it in place during cut.  </li>
            <li>Good cutting manakin, and length is good for working on braids, but you cannot use any styling tools on it.</li>
            <li>Although not human hair, this mannequin was a great tool to demonstrate various braiding techniques.  </li>
            <li>We spent more time untangling the hair than trying to braid it!:</li>
            <li>The long hair is easy to use and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t curl with a curling iron, maybe because its synthetic?</li>
            <li>Doll head came very fast with express shipping</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoing this item!</li>
            <li>I will probably order the human hair version, although it cost quite a bit more.</li>
            <li>This head is great to practice with learning to do long hair styles &amp; different kinds of braids</li>
            <li>It was exactly as the picture showed the manikin would be.</li>
            <li>She also makes a funny conversation piece.</li>
            <li>Instead, she would have been better off to save for the one with real human</li>
            <li>and she has a pretty face</li>
            <li>The mannequin head is pretty.</li>
            <li>I imagined her different  but still an ok mannequin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>She has mastered so many different hairstyles.</li>
            <li>The head looks exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li>It shed at first.</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves this!  </li>
            <li>but I do know a lot about buying stuff off Amazon and that is you need to really read through and consider peoples product reviews!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how ANYONE could give this product anything higher than a 1 star.</li>
            <li>When I first got the product, I combed through it for 5 minutes and my floor, bed, and brush(which</li>
            <li>she is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>She puts make-up on and washes it off, does things with the hair and really loves it!  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for with practicing braiding.</li>
            <li>It does not pick up any hot curls, product and chemical.</li>
            <li>It is, in my opinion, a much better value than the Barbie or Bratz (or other &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; styling heads) and offers much more versatility.  </li>
            <li>Our Grand daughter is only 7 but wants to be a hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>my teenage daughter wanted it because she wants to be able to practice braids, twists and updos, in which she cannot do on herself.  </li>
            <li>Although the braid was pretty good, she took the braid out there were tons of knotts, it was so hard to brush out.</li>
            <li>This also did not last as the hair was easily tangled.  </li>
            <li>The one and ONLY downside is her hair falls out easily, But</li>
            <li>To blow dry it is okay</li>
            <li>It has great long hair and she has spent hours creating hairstyles.</li>
            <li>I love the length of the hair for practicing braids, but do not like that it tangles too easily and hard to comb out.</li>
            <li>It is not true that the hair falls on its own.</li>
            <li>Excellent for work on  French braid  dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li>the only thing is the hair gets tangles to much and hair will come of my comb when I&#x27;m combing her hair lightly</li>
            <li>You can go to real hair when you start to really understand a straight line.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon search, I found Lexi.  </li>
            <li>Hair tangles so much.</li>
            <li>The only things that would have made this better is if the hair was human and it was more blonde.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for practicing cutting, braiding and some styling.  </li>
            <li>Perfect dollhead for cutting hair not for marcels, or shampoo sets.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>All you can really do with this is braid it.</li>
            <li>She spent most of her time trying to brush out the knots.</li>
            <li>You have to be gentle with her as well.</li>
            <li>I received the manikin head very promptly.</li>
            <li>The hair was very synthetic but that didn&#x27;t surprise me because after all that&#x27;s what I paid for.</li>
            <li>and she will scare the absolute s</li>
            <li>You can do so much with her.</li>
            <li>Human hair is also both haircutting and with cheap shears.</li>
            <li>Just like a picture, but tangles too much</li>
            <li>and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>The hair feels VERY synthetic and falls out A LOT.  </li>
            <li>It has silky hair,  a bit thin but great for practicing hairstyles.  </li>
            <li>If you fallow the rules treating her as a real costumer, there will not be hair all over the place.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this doll.</li>
            <li>Anyway I really hope my review helps somebody out.</li>
            <li>Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just really into braiding hair</li>
            <li>it tangled too much.</li>
            <li>it feel to much like plastic hair</li>
            <li>The hair is beautiful and long enough to do a million different styles with.</li>
            <li>My daughter really was wanting real hair and I messed up and got the imitation, but she said it would do ok anyway.</li>
            <li>but she said she really needed one with long hair and that it would be fine.</li>
            <li>This was for a birthday present, my daughter was excited to get this until she got it.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t touch the hair its fine, but when you try to braid or style the hair</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bought Lexi yet, but after reading nearly 50 reviews, I&#x27;ve pretty much made my decision.</li>
            <li>So we already have a cosmetology manikin head from my nice after she finished school, but the hair isn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
            <li>but it depends on how much heat you use and how high also what you put in the hair I started off with just styling it with no chemicals in the mankin head</li>
            <li>The hair feels like real human hair so soft &amp; easy to brush / comb.</li>
            <li>I thought it was cool, but as she started simply brushing its hair, it began to fall out.</li>
            <li>She has such a sweet face.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 11 year old granddaughter for her birthday because she loves to put make up on, and to play with  hair, and says she wants to be a hairdresser when she grows up!  </li>
            <li>Decent quality.</li>
            <li>You cannot color the hair or apply any high heat to it.</li>
            <li>Even a blow dryer on high will fry the hair, and curls have no chance of holding.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;ll be a cosmetologist before she graduates high school.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t read close enough, natural hair manikins cost much more, and for good reason.</li>
            <li>You have to buy the stand with it (it doesn&#x27;t come with it) and the hair can get a little tangled, but use fabric softener and water in a spray bottle and it&#x27;s like detangler for dolls :)</li>
            <li>Also, due to the synthetic properties of the hair, one could transform this mannequin into a really cool Halloween prop!</li>
            <li>Hair is very good for cutting; and also is as described.</li>
            <li>The hair tangles easily, but haven&#x27;t tried a tangle spray yet as other reviews suggested.  </li>
            <li>4) soft hair but again very knotty .</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:33e0c576bc268441d0eeeb7e34f404a1]]It&#x27;s OK, but the hair on the manikin, I received is not light auburn like in this picture.</li>
            <li>The hair feels like actual human hair, and  it does not get tangled easily like I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done blunt cuts, rollers sets, blow dry with low temp, and more...</li>
            <li>My daughter loves her new doll head.  </li>
            <li>She received a new curler for Christmas as well and wanted to try it on her new manikin.</li>
            <li>And this is the product I purchased often to practice new styles and or techniques.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll have to see if that continues or if it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s new.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had just spent the extra $30 and got a better quality head.</li>
            <li>they need to really fix the description instead of describing it as a doll head that is great for hair cutting.</li>
            <li>Keeps my daughter very busy braiding.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I thought it was a great mannequin head for a very long time, and I recommend it over the real haired ones, they don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>i was not able to get some curls in either, i wasnt really able to do anything with it.</li>
            <li>buy practice materials not expensive tools that you only used in humans</li>
            <li>First of all the picture on my account and what we received are different.  </li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughter loves this mannequin!</li>
            <li>Her 17yr old sister even asked her to do her hair for the Winter Ball!</li>
            <li>Although her hair is synthetic she&#x27;s perfect for practicng cutting techniques and updo&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>She frequently mounts the manikin on the computer desk to practice what she is watching or to work out new styles.</li>
            <li>Waste of $ hair falls off while brushing and tangles easily</li>
            <li>This doll head has REALLY long hair, so I&#x27;m sure I can get multiple different cuts out of it.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t even curl it and its just a tangly mess its a waste not evdn good for a child</li>
            <li>and it was quite a bit smaller (like a large doll&#x27;s head).</li>
            <li>She has very thick hair, which is kind of great to practice on because it&#x27;s a little hard</li>
            <li>The only bad thing I can think of is that the hair falls out, but besides that, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I can see her head clearly.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 7 year old who LOVES styling hair and putting on make up.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old wrote that she wanted a styling head on her Christmas list for Santa.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has long straight hair and Lexi does too!  </li>
            <li>Came fast and properly package!</li>
            <li>My daughter bought this for her daughter who is 12 years old.</li>
            <li>I wanted this for curling and you need human hair, I returned this promptly and the seller was very helpful and posted my return asap.  </li>
            <li>It feels very similar to real hair.  </li>
            <li>hair at all, ruined my class completely</li>
            <li>I bought Lexi so my 6 year old daughter would have a quality manikin to practice hair styles on.  </li>
            <li>bought this for my 12 year old to practice braiding hair.</li>
            <li>I think for the price, which is similar to the &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; heads, children will be much happier with this styling head.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my six year old because she wanted a hair combing doll head.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my 11 year old daughter to practice styling hair</li>
            <li>This review is NOT from a professional cosmetologist:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Some reviews I have read complain that the hair is constantly falling out, BUT, all you need to do is be gentle.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 9 year old daughter to style her hair.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 11 yr old granddaughter to practice braiding and she has amazed us with her talent.</li>
            <li>Got this for my 10 yr old granddaughter for her birthday.</li>
            <li>My wife is a professional hairstylist.  </li>
            <li>You should definitely invest in the ones with higher quality /real human hair.</li>
            <li>The hair is thin, but she has been able to practice all the new braiding techniques she wanted and now does them for her friends.</li>
            <li>Next time I would spend a little more and get human hair so that I could color it and also curl it.</li>
            <li>A large headed Barbie doll with long Barbie hair would have worked well !  </li>
            <li>We are going to send it back and buy a new one.</li>
            <li>Remember, practice makes perfect and manikins won&#x27;t yell at you for a bad haircut!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for using this mannequin as an actual study aid for cosmetology, because I purchased it for my 8 year old daughter to play with... and for that I give it five stars!  </li>
            <li>This doll is super super thick (in hair density) synthetic and not fun to cut.</li>
            <li>Hair is almost plastic like and not at all near human like hair as they state in the description and questions answered.</li>
            <li>I bought this doll for my 12 year old girl to practice different hairstyles and braids and it came in with the hair being fuzzy!</li>
            <li>It still makes for good practice with braiding, up-do&#x27;s and cutting.</li>
            <li>It is definitely good for hair cutting practice.</li>
            <li>My kids are scared of this thing, one eye was higher than the other!</li>
            <li>Good for hair cutting only, it will not work for styling with the synthetic hair, too slippery.</li>
            <li>I am very ticked off at myself mainly because I told her the reviews were not very good</li>
            <li>this little roll which is nit pretty at all.</li>
            <li>Hair gets tangled easily and is very hard to undo.</li>
            <li>Great for cutting!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this as a cutting mannequin only, though the length is good with updos but it won&#x27;t curl is all.</li>
            <li>ONLY good for basic cutting classes or braiding</li>
            <li>The hair is super hard to work with</li>
            <li>However, when I washed Lexi her hair changed from straight to half straight, half curly.</li>
            <li>You CANNOT get through half a braid without having to stop because the hair is all tangled, no matter how much you comb through it.</li>
            <li>hair is kinda hard to brush but its over all worth it</li>
    </ol>

            <li> For the price, a very nice product.</li>
            <li> This head is amazing!</li>
            <li> Its OK but not the best as the hair is synthetic and cant be use to practice all techniques.</li>
            <li> Really nice!</li>
            <li> My daughter was thrilled with this!</li>
            <li> This doll is good</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still good</li>
            <li> It has been a good tool for her</li>
            <li> If you do then it will have permanently damaged hair that crunches and does not look good.</li>
            <li> It looks really good and functional.</li>
            <li> This was a good beginners head.  </li>
            <li> this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Lots of good use.  </li>
            <li> Nothing but good to say about this.</li>
            <li> She was delighted with the price and quality of this manikin.  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> It was exactly as advertised, the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> My wife bought this and all my girls love Celebrity Lexi!  </li>
            <li> My daughter is thoroughly enjoying it!</li>
            <li> We got it for our grandkids to style the hair, and they LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I love this head!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this manikin!  </li>
            <li> This was a great gift for her, and a good value, it was shipped quickly and no problems at all.  </li>
            <li> This was a great purchase and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> This doll head is amazing for braiding, and styling.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the one being tugged and pulled on for her glamorous hairdos and the styles she creates with this are amazing.</li>
            <li> the cheap price lol.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it would be great for advanced education in my salon, but the hair is slippery, and in no way can it handle chemicals or heat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like working with dolls hair.</li>
            <li> But it still braids nicely and works for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> They practice on the manikin, then fix their own hair in the styles.</li>
            <li> My daughter saved and bought this for her job that requires her to practice all kind of braids.  </li>
            <li> She liked the way it handled.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok ... but hide your good shears ...</li>
            <li> and when it came in the mail it looked so nice</li>
            <li> She does hair styles on it that she then does on her own hair.</li>
            <li> she didn&#x27;t liked it at all.</li>
            <li> The hair is great and she has so much fun with it!</li>
            <li> hair knots up VERY easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to style.  </li>
            <li> But because it&#x27;s synthetic hair, it gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li> There is just no &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; so it tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li> hair knots very easy</li>
            <li> My 10 year old Daughter got this for Christmas, and for the price it is a great deal!  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, the hair is really soft and great for braiding!</li>
            <li> It cuts easy, but really I found it best for braids &amp; updo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to fix!</li>
            <li> The hair is so easily tangled!  </li>
            <li> Overall, however, this an awesome product that I am thrilled I found.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed great, but then when I started putting designs on it</li>
            <li> Buy new one, looks very good.</li>
            <li> This is very important to keep the manikin in place.  </li>
            <li> She has beautiful fine long hair and is great for haircuts, coloring, upstyles, braids, curls, etc.</li>
            <li> probably ok if you want to braid it</li>
            <li> Absolutley love Lexi.  </li>
            <li> It also arrived the next day, so I was very impressed by that!!</li>
            <li> Make sure you purchase the clap for the head.</li>
            <li> So much better and cheaper than the toy ones you can buy.  </li>
            <li> If you purchase, make sure you get the stand, it doesn&#x27;t come with one.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist in need of more braiding practice.</li>
            <li> Absolutley love it.</li>
            <li> thats ok because I put a trash can underneath me and it caught all the hair.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Spend the money on a&lt;br /&gt;Different manakin with better hair</li>
            <li> I love how the hair feels and styles.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> you are purchasing for display purposes it would be okay.  </li>
            <li> love this Manikin.</li>
            <li> I purchased the stand on amazon and it works great, however will allow the head to tilt if you are really pulling.</li>
            <li> This product was okay.</li>
            <li> great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> She is satisfied that it will meet her needs.</li>
            <li> I bought Lexi so I could cut a better layer into it before stateboards.</li>
            <li> I shampooed the hair and it did not tangle or knot up like many of my mannequins.</li>
            <li> My daughter is having a grand time with this.</li>
            <li> and she love it</li>
            <li> It is more like playing with Barbie hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about makeup on this, as it would probably stain.  </li>
            <li> Pleased.</li>
            <li> For the price and for the fun you get out of it, It is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Im sure</li>
            <li> In Fact, It Did More Harm.</li>
            <li> She is in love with it.</li>
            <li> This item was the best price by far and it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> When she arrived to me her hair was sooo long, just like the picture (perfect!).  </li>
            <li> Awesome long hair to practice!</li>
            <li> The make up it also light enough that she is all to happy to practice her makeup application also!</li>
            <li> overall, this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> It was great at first but after a while the hair starts to snag and tangle super easily.</li>
            <li> Would make a great birthday or Christmas gift for the budding cosmetologist.</li>
            <li> i, think the size is just what i expected, its perfect.</li>
            <li> cause other than that your product is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen that most people that get it for little girls to braid it have been very happy.</li>
            <li> the hair comes out so easily...</li>
            <li> I bought this for practicing updos and braids but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be easy to work with</li>
            <li> Tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Hair falls out easily</li>
            <li> It also tangles easily &amp; nothing helps to get it out.</li>
            <li> The hair does tangle easily but is workable.  </li>
            <li> Hair tangles easy and feels like wax.</li>
            <li> It tangles easily and don&#x27;t stay with hair stiles.</li>
            <li> Was the perfect gift for my 12 yr old daughter who wants to be a hair dresser.</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest that if you are looking for this type of item, try something else.</li>
            <li> I do recommend it for someone  who wants to see if a Hair Dresser Profession is a good fit.</li>
            <li> Love this beautiful long haired manequin head for my grandaughter to practice hairstyles on!!</li>
            <li> Fine display for hair accessories etc..</li>
            <li> Great texture &amp; fun for my 3 granddaughters to create new hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!!</li>
            <li> Came securely packaged.</li>
            <li> The hair was beautifully smooth on day one.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic cosmetology manikin.  </li>
            <li> The face of the actual product I received looked great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mannequin for that purpose only and I am thrilled with the density and length of hair at such a great price!</li>
            <li> purchased this because I enjoy experimenting with hair.</li>
            <li> Fiber hair is for haircutting and with cheap shears.....</li>
            <li> The hair is so silky smooth</li>
            <li> Hair can come out on the brush some, but overall my daughter thinks it is great and loves it.</li>
            <li> so it serves its purpose great buy compared to the one that are 100 and something again i only ordered to practice braids</li>
            <li> Great soft hair not hard to style does pretty good with heat</li>
            <li> The hair on this dolly is very nice its good and thick.  </li>
            <li> So glad I got it at the right time.</li>
            <li> The hair is amazing and the Manikins face is very pretty and soft and easy for her to put makeup on!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is very useful</li>
            <li> She is very interested in becoming a hair stylist.</li>
            <li> It took me four cuts before I could do a very straight blunt cut, so...the cheapest you start the better</li>
            <li> I love the doll looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> Lots of fun!</li>
            <li> I just love it so much!</li>
            <li> This shipped quickly, and very nice hair, but the hair is falling out when brushed.</li>
            <li> I see today that I will be a very good hair stylist, and this profession, as my second profession after nursing will not only fit me, but will bring joy back into my life.</li>
            <li> then I dyed it a bright red with</li>
            <li> Hair was a bit ratty on the bottom 6&amp;#34; but good overall</li>
            <li> I love how the hair feels it&#x27;s very quality</li>
            <li> was FULL OF HAIR.</li>
            <li> even my hair could not tolerate that much:)</li>
            <li> Only thing it was good for was to practice my state board cut on.</li>
            <li> so hair is not human but doll head is still good for practicing braids which is what i bought for</li>
            <li> Love the quality,,feels like real hair,,good price!!would recomend,,</li>
            <li> The hair is also very find and smooth, so will fall out of a style more easily than real hair.</li>
            <li> It tangles pretty easy and we haven&#x27;t done a lot of styling yet.</li>
            <li> if that&#x27;s all you want to do, this will be great for you other than hair falling out.</li>
            <li> Delivered quick.  </li>
            <li> The hair falls out quickly</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this girl :)</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that Lexi can be secured to a table to keep her nice and steady while little hands to all the work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already learned a new braid on Lexi and then was able to do it with my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> This hair isn&#x27;t any good unless all you&#x27;re trying to do is practice styles on DRY hair.</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed!</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like picture!</li>
            <li> It worked great the 1st time, after that is was one matted mess.  </li>
            <li> This would be great for a little girl who likes to play with hair.</li>
            <li> Received in good time and was what I expected.  </li>
            <li> She is having so much fun with it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Having fun practicing braiding.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> useful</li>
            <li> This Mannequin I Purchased Did Not Become Useful To Me.</li>
            <li> The hair is vey long and it feels soft, but it tangles so easily that it actually isn&#x27;t good for practicing braiding.</li>
            <li> From a cosmetology student point of view: Lexi was of very low quality her hair tangled easily and falls out too easily.</li>
            <li> The hair falls out way too easily and the hair doesn&#x27;t brush back easily</li>
            <li> The hair is a good length for her to practice all her braiding and other hair styles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would lay right once cut.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t comb it out because it will retangle right away.</li>
            <li> I am online right now because I am about to buy ANOTHER head for her to take her state test with.</li>
            <li> the hair is a bit longer that i expected but it is perfect because my daughters hair is really long.</li>
            <li> Just purchase a new pair o scissor to star to cut the hair, comb-wash the hair so it will not tangle, and use some conditioner to smooth the hair to comb and keep it in place during cut.  </li>
            <li> Good cutting manakin, and length is good for working on braids, but you cannot use any styling tools on it.</li>
            <li> Although not human hair, this mannequin was a great tool to demonstrate various braiding techniques.  </li>
            <li> We spent more time untangling the hair than trying to braid it!:</li>
            <li> The long hair is easy to use and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t curl with a curling iron, maybe because its synthetic?</li>
            <li> Doll head came very fast with express shipping</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoing this item!</li>
            <li> I will probably order the human hair version, although it cost quite a bit more.</li>
            <li> This head is great to practice with learning to do long hair styles &amp; different kinds of braids</li>
            <li> It was exactly as the picture showed the manikin would be.</li>
            <li> She also makes a funny conversation piece.</li>
            <li> Instead, she would have been better off to save for the one with real human</li>
            <li> and she has a pretty face</li>
            <li> The mannequin head is pretty.</li>
            <li> I imagined her different  but still an ok mannequin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> She has mastered so many different hairstyles.</li>
            <li> The head looks exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li> It shed at first.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this!  </li>
            <li> but I do know a lot about buying stuff off Amazon and that is you need to really read through and consider peoples product reviews!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how ANYONE could give this product anything higher than a 1 star.</li>
            <li> When I first got the product, I combed through it for 5 minutes and my floor, bed, and brush(which</li>
            <li> she is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> She puts make-up on and washes it off, does things with the hair and really loves it!  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for with practicing braiding.</li>
            <li> It does not pick up any hot curls, product and chemical.</li>
            <li> It is, in my opinion, a much better value than the Barbie or Bratz (or other &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; styling heads) and offers much more versatility.  </li>
            <li> Our Grand daughter is only 7 but wants to be a hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> my teenage daughter wanted it because she wants to be able to practice braids, twists and updos, in which she cannot do on herself.  </li>
            <li> Although the braid was pretty good, she took the braid out there were tons of knotts, it was so hard to brush out.</li>
            <li> This also did not last as the hair was easily tangled.  </li>
            <li> The one and ONLY downside is her hair falls out easily, But</li>
            <li> To blow dry it is okay</li>
            <li> It has great long hair and she has spent hours creating hairstyles.</li>
            <li> I love the length of the hair for practicing braids, but do not like that it tangles too easily and hard to comb out.</li>
            <li> It is not true that the hair falls on its own.</li>
            <li> Excellent for work on  French braid  dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li> the only thing is the hair gets tangles to much and hair will come of my comb when I&#x27;m combing her hair lightly</li>
            <li> You can go to real hair when you start to really understand a straight line.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon search, I found Lexi.  </li>
            <li> Hair tangles so much.</li>
            <li> The only things that would have made this better is if the hair was human and it was more blonde.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for practicing cutting, braiding and some styling.  </li>
            <li> Perfect dollhead for cutting hair not for marcels, or shampoo sets.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> All you can really do with this is braid it.</li>
            <li> She spent most of her time trying to brush out the knots.</li>
            <li> You have to be gentle with her as well.</li>
            <li> I received the manikin head very promptly.</li>
            <li> The hair was very synthetic but that didn&#x27;t surprise me because after all that&#x27;s what I paid for.</li>
            <li> and she will scare the absolute s</li>
            <li> You can do so much with her.</li>
            <li> Human hair is also both haircutting and with cheap shears.</li>
            <li> Just like a picture, but tangles too much</li>
            <li> and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> The hair feels VERY synthetic and falls out A LOT.  </li>
            <li> It has silky hair,  a bit thin but great for practicing hairstyles.  </li>
            <li> If you fallow the rules treating her as a real costumer, there will not be hair all over the place.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this doll.</li>
            <li> Anyway I really hope my review helps somebody out.</li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just really into braiding hair</li>
            <li> it tangled too much.</li>
            <li> it feel to much like plastic hair</li>
            <li> The hair is beautiful and long enough to do a million different styles with.</li>
            <li> My daughter really was wanting real hair and I messed up and got the imitation, but she said it would do ok anyway.</li>
            <li> but she said she really needed one with long hair and that it would be fine.</li>
            <li> This was for a birthday present, my daughter was excited to get this until she got it.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t touch the hair its fine, but when you try to braid or style the hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought Lexi yet, but after reading nearly 50 reviews, I&#x27;ve pretty much made my decision.</li>
            <li> So we already have a cosmetology manikin head from my nice after she finished school, but the hair isn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
            <li> but it depends on how much heat you use and how high also what you put in the hair I started off with just styling it with no chemicals in the mankin head</li>
            <li> The hair feels like real human hair so soft &amp; easy to brush / comb.</li>
            <li> I thought it was cool, but as she started simply brushing its hair, it began to fall out.</li>
            <li> She has such a sweet face.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old granddaughter for her birthday because she loves to put make up on, and to play with  hair, and says she wants to be a hairdresser when she grows up!  </li>
            <li> Decent quality.</li>
            <li> You cannot color the hair or apply any high heat to it.</li>
            <li> Even a blow dryer on high will fry the hair, and curls have no chance of holding.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;ll be a cosmetologist before she graduates high school.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t read close enough, natural hair manikins cost much more, and for good reason.</li>
            <li> You have to buy the stand with it (it doesn&#x27;t come with it) and the hair can get a little tangled, but use fabric softener and water in a spray bottle and it&#x27;s like detangler for dolls :)</li>
            <li> Also, due to the synthetic properties of the hair, one could transform this mannequin into a really cool Halloween prop!</li>
            <li> Hair is very good for cutting; and also is as described.</li>
            <li> The hair tangles easily, but haven&#x27;t tried a tangle spray yet as other reviews suggested.  </li>
            <li> 4) soft hair but again very knotty .</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:33e0c576bc268441d0eeeb7e34f404a1]]It&#x27;s OK, but the hair on the manikin, I received is not light auburn like in this picture.</li>
            <li> The hair feels like actual human hair, and  it does not get tangled easily like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done blunt cuts, rollers sets, blow dry with low temp, and more...</li>
            <li> My daughter loves her new doll head.  </li>
            <li> She received a new curler for Christmas as well and wanted to try it on her new manikin.</li>
            <li> And this is the product I purchased often to practice new styles and or techniques.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll have to see if that continues or if it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s new.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had just spent the extra $30 and got a better quality head.</li>
            <li> they need to really fix the description instead of describing it as a doll head that is great for hair cutting.</li>
            <li> Keeps my daughter very busy braiding.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I thought it was a great mannequin head for a very long time, and I recommend it over the real haired ones, they don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> i was not able to get some curls in either, i wasnt really able to do anything with it.</li>
            <li> buy practice materials not expensive tools that you only used in humans</li>
            <li> First of all the picture on my account and what we received are different.  </li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter loves this mannequin!</li>
            <li> Her 17yr old sister even asked her to do her hair for the Winter Ball!</li>
            <li> Although her hair is synthetic she&#x27;s perfect for practicng cutting techniques and updo&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> She frequently mounts the manikin on the computer desk to practice what she is watching or to work out new styles.</li>
            <li> Waste of $ hair falls off while brushing and tangles easily</li>
            <li> This doll head has REALLY long hair, so I&#x27;m sure I can get multiple different cuts out of it.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t even curl it and its just a tangly mess its a waste not evdn good for a child</li>
            <li> and it was quite a bit smaller (like a large doll&#x27;s head).</li>
            <li> She has very thick hair, which is kind of great to practice on because it&#x27;s a little hard</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I can think of is that the hair falls out, but besides that, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and I can see her head clearly.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 7 year old who LOVES styling hair and putting on make up.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old wrote that she wanted a styling head on her Christmas list for Santa.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has long straight hair and Lexi does too!  </li>
            <li> Came fast and properly package!</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this for her daughter who is 12 years old.</li>
            <li> I wanted this for curling and you need human hair, I returned this promptly and the seller was very helpful and posted my return asap.  </li>
            <li> It feels very similar to real hair.  </li>
            <li> hair at all, ruined my class completely</li>
            <li> I bought Lexi so my 6 year old daughter would have a quality manikin to practice hair styles on.  </li>
            <li> bought this for my 12 year old to practice braiding hair.</li>
            <li> I think for the price, which is similar to the &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; heads, children will be much happier with this styling head.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my six year old because she wanted a hair combing doll head.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my 11 year old daughter to practice styling hair</li>
            <li> This review is NOT from a professional cosmetologist:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Some reviews I have read complain that the hair is constantly falling out, BUT, all you need to do is be gentle.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 9 year old daughter to style her hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 11 yr old granddaughter to practice braiding and she has amazed us with her talent.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 10 yr old granddaughter for her birthday.</li>
            <li> My wife is a professional hairstylist.  </li>
            <li> You should definitely invest in the ones with higher quality /real human hair.</li>
            <li> The hair is thin, but she has been able to practice all the new braiding techniques she wanted and now does them for her friends.</li>
            <li> Next time I would spend a little more and get human hair so that I could color it and also curl it.</li>
            <li> A large headed Barbie doll with long Barbie hair would have worked well !  </li>
            <li> We are going to send it back and buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Remember, practice makes perfect and manikins won&#x27;t yell at you for a bad haircut!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for using this mannequin as an actual study aid for cosmetology, because I purchased it for my 8 year old daughter to play with... and for that I give it five stars!  </li>
            <li> This doll is super super thick (in hair density) synthetic and not fun to cut.</li>
            <li> Hair is almost plastic like and not at all near human like hair as they state in the description and questions answered.</li>
            <li> I bought this doll for my 12 year old girl to practice different hairstyles and braids and it came in with the hair being fuzzy!</li>
            <li> It still makes for good practice with braiding, up-do&#x27;s and cutting.</li>
            <li> It is definitely good for hair cutting practice.</li>
            <li> My kids are scared of this thing, one eye was higher than the other!</li>
            <li> Good for hair cutting only, it will not work for styling with the synthetic hair, too slippery.</li>
            <li> I am very ticked off at myself mainly because I told her the reviews were not very good</li>
            <li> this little roll which is nit pretty at all.</li>
            <li> Hair gets tangled easily and is very hard to undo.</li>
            <li> Great for cutting!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this as a cutting mannequin only, though the length is good with updos but it won&#x27;t curl is all.</li>
            <li> ONLY good for basic cutting classes or braiding</li>
            <li> The hair is super hard to work with</li>
            <li> However, when I washed Lexi her hair changed from straight to half straight, half curly.</li>
            <li> You CANNOT get through half a braid without having to stop because the hair is all tangled, no matter how much you comb through it.</li>
            <li> hair is kinda hard to brush but its over all worth it</li>
            <li> She did her first braid on it and it was really hard, this doll is not at all like human hair!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that on our first use, LOTS of hair is falling out.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to practice cutting, hair tangles very easily.</li>
            <li> She is so pretty but has very thin hair and very bald</li>
            <li> i used it for a week straight.. and couldn&#x27;t deal with the excessive hairloss and tangling.</li>
            <li> (And my daughter isn&#x27;t used to working with such long hair, so that might be part of the problem with it</li>
            <li> lexi&#x27;s hair is long, and silky, but it may become tangled if you do not take proper care of it.</li>
            <li> It dulled some very expensive shears that she got and when you go to cut the hairs just kind of bend between the blades but don&#x27;t cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently a cosmetology student that needs more practice on cutting.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the hair tangled very quickly and I had to toss it.</li>
            <li> This came a little later than I expected it to, but not terribly late.</li>
            <li> so im satesfied now if you want to iron and do other things to it then buy the more expensive one since this one will probably melt at the sight of an iron</li>
            <li> Like little old ladies who have that issue.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised by the size of the head.</li>
            <li> The hair wasn&#x27;t very close together and since the hair feels like plastic, it was often hard to work with</li>
            <li> The second you wet the hair</li>
            <li> BUT its extremely long so ull get a lot of practice out of the doll, and its inexpensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit long for braiding so the ends tangle a bit.  </li>
            <li> 3)She has long hair</li>
            <li> The long length of the hair allowed me to practice all of my cuts repeatedly.</li>
            <li> Her hair is so long.  </li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s tangled VERY easily to the point of brushing it is nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> Loose and slippery</li>
            <li> The hair is rather thin, but if it was any thicker it would tangle a ridiculous amount more.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s great for braiding, only hate that after a few braids, ends look frizzed!!</li>
            <li> A much smaller head, less hair to deal with and hands for pretend painting.  </li>
            <li> As soon as i brushed her hair it became a frizzy notted mess</li>
            <li> I figured a doll head with synthetic hair would be fine for cutting.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the hair seems to thin out too quickly.</li>
            <li> My only concern is how little hair she has.</li>
            <li> Most people say its does bad with heat</li>
            <li> For 2011 I could not bear to waste $40 on another barbie or similar styling head.  </li>
            <li> Not real hair at all.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be the size of a wig styling head</li>
            <li> I spent like 20 minutes combing out her hair</li>
            <li> i suggest using a wide toothed comb and detangling spray.</li>
            <li> The product did come as expected.</li>
            <li> She was what I expected.</li>
            <li> This not real hair</li>
            <li> Once I took a wide took comb through it, it frayed and broke.</li>
            <li> Yes, she does shed a bit, but it seems to slow down after the first few brushes and she still has plenty of hair.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t even attempt to cut it because the hair is so flat and heavy</li>
            <li> but the flat iron and curler with fry it (not melt), loads of dead ends.</li>
            <li> The moment the  product was out of the box, the hair started falling out, not just a little but enough to make a mess everywhere</li>
            <li> The only complaint was that she comes with red lips and a little shawdow (beige) color already on her eyes.</li>
            <li> If you are a professional this is NOT a good product.</li>
            <li> useless its sitting in the docs office collecting dust, but it does look pretty.</li>
            <li> due to</li>
            <li> Other posters suggested using Fabric Softener solution to spray on the hair to detangle it.  </li>
            <li> You need to buy a stand separately though, and also what ever you do DO NOT BRUSH THE HAIR ROUGHLY!</li>
            <li> YOU CANNOT CURL THE HAIR BECAUSE IT IS NOT REAL HAIR, DON&#x27;T BE FOOLED BY THE DESCRIPTION!</li>
            <li> this is my 4th manniequin .one had to be thrown out but the other two didn&#x27;t need to be combed out for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> But also other people who got lexi .</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it for braiding and other hairstyles.  </li>
            <li> Those shears were so dang sharp</li>
            <li> but you can not style it in any other way.</li>
            <li> If you use this product for a week, I guarantee there would be no more hair left on it.</li>
            <li> but i do recommend you buy the stand, along with lexi, beacause you may become frustrated because it tip easily without it.</li>
            <li> USEFUL FOR HAIR CUTTING</li>
            <li> This is NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> At least 10 knotts come out every day, and she only does about 5 braids a day.</li>
            <li> Very thin hair and gets very tangly.  </li>
            <li> She has kind of thin hair but not that bad though.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried cutting it, but it seems that it would be good for cutting.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money&lt;br /&gt;Bought for a professional salon cutting class&lt;</li>
            <li> the hours it takes to work out the mess</li>
            <li> I even cut a few inches off to see if would be less tangly,but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little over a week now</li>
            <li> A little bit of paint came off her lips and around her eyes.</li>
            <li> Trust me, it is not worth it!</li>
            <li> the mannequin head was hard to comb the hair is not real</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s really just for cutting (not styling or coloring, etc.).</li>
            <li> The mannequin will be bald before I get a few styles into it.</li>
            <li> I wasted $30 on this product.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> not too much!&lt;br /&gt;concluding, this product is a shit.</li>
            <li> WASTED MONEY</li>
            <li> After playing with it for a few minutes, the hair started falling out.</li>
            <li> You must do this before spending thousands of dollars in something that may not fit your personality.</li>
            <li> What I got was a darker auburn, not light as described and pictured.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not light as described or pictured.</li>
            <li> Such poor quality.</li>
            <li> Hair quality is very low compared to other fake heads.</li>
            <li> , cutting it just ruins the hair completely.</li>
            <li> My daughter was a little disappointed that she couldn&#x27;t use it right away and that we had to wait to order the clamp seperately.  </li>
            <li> A little small</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s my scissors or the synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> i was not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> and i was not able to braid the hair without brushing it because it was so notted</li>
            <li> I thought my daughter was doing something wrong as I was always using detangler on it, but I tried playing with it and the same thing happened.</li>
            <li> it is hard to comb and  braid</li>
            <li> my daughter say, hear is  litle hard.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a hard time styling her hair and braiding it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard to comb because the hair just keeps coming out.</li>
            <li> This mannequin head lasted a very long time, but after a while the hair started to tangle a LOT, and it started to become very frustrating to braid it.</li>
            <li> The hair is a little thin.  </li>
            <li> My scissors isn&#x27;t cutting her hair properly.</li>
            <li> It feels like human hair that is in desperate need of silicones.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers have complained about the hair tangling, but we haven&#x27;t had that problem.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment for my granddaughters 11 birthday.  </li>
            <li> The only thing you can do to it, is practice cutting.</li>
            <li> The hair was too thick, uncombable and it went in the trash.  </li>
            <li> I cringed because I bought her a Barbie one a few years ago and it was useless.  </li>
            <li> Not good hair for cosmetologists.</li>
            <li> They also will not let you return these mannequins since they say for sanitary reason, which is crazy since they are not real hair and cant use them for anything else but braided.</li>
            <li> It is not good if you want to practice how to do haircut</li>
            <li> this was not a good purchase i am stuck with it</li>
            <li> This product is not good at all.</li>
            <li> I did not like this manikin because, after brushing her hair and few times and braiding it, I couldn&#x27;t get the tangles out of the hair which was very frustrating to my daughter.  </li>
            <li> It SUCKS!</li>
            <li> She had priced practice manikins at all of the local beauty suppl stores and was disappointed at the prices.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to work with.</li>
            <li> I feel sorry that she worked hard to save money to purchase this head.  </li>
            <li> This has bad hair quality and the hair gets rough and you have to break it up</li>
            <li> I guess I can get practice for those guests with thin hair.</li>
            <li> Not great hair to learn how to cut on.</li>
            <li> I dreaded buying another barbie-type version that is nothing but frustrating.</li>
            <li> i tried to cut to fix an it got worse</li>
            <li> But not great to practice coloring, bleaching or any chemical use.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE waste of money you cant flat iron curl or even style without it breaking off or burning its horibble</li>
            <li> it wsas very hard to work with because the hair stays tangled, it was extremely difficult to keep it untangled.</li>
            <li> A snarled impossible mess !  </li>
            <li> At least an 10th of the hair has already come out and she hasn&#x27;t even had the doll for a week!!</li>
            <li> Just functionally it is useless</li>
            <li> I was sad to do it.</li>
            <li> So it made it difficult to cut and perm.</li>
            <li> The fake hair/protein fiber was not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> You think I want to be writing about a freaking fake head this morning?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, the hair is complicated</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the hair does not take well to heated styling, but I know the hair was not meant for that.</li>
            <li> It Dulled Out A Pair Of Expensive Shears</li>
            <li> And the hair is very thin also.</li>
            <li> She still has hair after 6 months but it is very thin</li>
            <li> you know it can be difficult to learn cutting -</li>
            <li> This is a terrible manikin, there is absolutely no way to work with it because the hair keeps getting tangled.</li>
            <li> Have had it just a little over a month now and it looks terrible.</li>
            <li> looks crazy.</li>
            <li> i like everything, the price, the shipping and the quality of  the Celebrity Lexi Cosmetology Protein Fiber Hair Cutting Manikin, 26-28 Inch&lt;br /&gt;Burmax</li>
            <li> Maybe just for cutting, but my daughter wanted this to practice braiding.  </li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t even use it to practice hair cutting techniques.</li>
            <li> It (MAY) work to practice cutting, but it doesn&#x27;t hold any type of bend or hold.</li>
            <li> Should not be advertised as a cutting doll for cosmetology students.</li>
            <li> I got this mannequin to practice my cutting for State Board and it is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> DONT BUY THIS ITEM IF YOU INTEND ON DOING ANY CUTTING AND HEATED CURLING/straighting</li>
            <li> This would not work for hair stylists for styling or cutting.</li>
            <li> and it was a horrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a Cosmo student, so I&#x27;m not gonna be cutting it, and I don&#x27;t plan on curling either....</li>
            <li> It makes for difficulty in hair cutting.</li>

            <li> Its like cutting plastic hair on a bad Halloween costume wig.</li>
            <li> The hair was very difficult to work with even when just brushing.</li>
            <li> Impossible to work with.</li>
            <li> I needed to practice some hairstyles and braids, but it was impossible with this thing.</li>
            <li> It was impossible to braid because the hair was so knotty.</li>
            <li> it tangles really bad.</li>
            <li> a knew that was bad, but</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I am seriously disappointed.</li>
            <li> --YOU WILL BE GREATLY DISAPPOINTED.  </li>
            <li> I see now why its supposed to be for cutting it!</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I would have given you 5 stars if your site had prompted me that I needed to order the base clamp seperately with the head.  </li>
            <li> The hair sheds and tangles like CRAZY!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Hair is almost plastic like and not at all near human like hair as they state in the description and questions answered. Hair actually MELTED when applied low heat to it! Get&#x27;s tangled VERY easily to the point of brushing it is nearly impossible. And hair falls out in clumps. The mannequin will be bald before I get a few styles into it. I wasted $30 on this product. I wish I had just spent the extra $30 and got a better quality head. VERY disappointed in this product. Will not be buying again!</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed!</li>
            <li> Great product to work with.  Delivered quick.  Will purchase another for my daughter for 2nd yr cosm.</li>
            <li> It was suppose to be human hair &amp; it when I got it it was synthetic hair👎</li>
            <li> waste of money. probably ok if you want to braid it but thats it, cutting it just ruins the hair completely. looks crazy. they need to really fix the description instead of describing it as a doll head that is great for hair cutting.</li>
            <li> Hair was a bit ratty on the bottom 6&amp;#34; but good overall</li>
            <li> I got this for my 7 year old who LOVES styling hair and putting on make up. She brushes, braids, and puts make up on this mannequin. She loves it. You have to buy the stand with it (it doesn&#x27;t come with it) and the hair can get a little tangled, but use fabric softener and water in a spray bottle and it&#x27;s like detangler for dolls :)</li>
            <li> i like everything, the price, the shipping and the quality of  the Celebrity Lexi Cosmetology Protein Fiber Hair Cutting Manikin, 26-28 Inch&lt;br /&gt;Burmax</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. Recipient happy.  Came securely packaged. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old wrote that she wanted a styling head on her Christmas list for Santa.  I cringed because I bought her a Barbie one a few years ago and it was useless.  The hair was too thick, uncombable and it went in the trash.  I also had bought her the Polly Pocket one.  A much smaller head, less hair to deal with and hands for pretend painting.  This also did not last as the hair was easily tangled.  For 2011 I could not bear to waste $40 on another barbie or similar styling head.  Thanks to Amazon search, I found Lexi.  My daughter has long straight hair and Lexi does too!  I loved the fact that Lexi can be secured to a table to keep her nice and steady while little hands to all the work.  The hair was beautifully smooth on day one.  It&#x27;s been a little over a week now and my daughter does need to use a detangling spray on it to get a good comb, but it&#x27;s still awesome.  I also got her a book of simple hair styles &amp; braids to try.  I&#x27;ve already learned a new braid on Lexi and then was able to do it with my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Absolutley love Lexi.  I figure when she&#x27;s gotten all that she can out of her, I&#x27;ll let my daughter try a couple hair cuts!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping! I love this product! Great for cutting! Awesome long hair to practice! Came fast and properly package! I&#x27;m really enjoing this item!</li>
            <li> Impossible to work with. Hair tangles so much. Tried washing it, conditioning . Nothing helps. Same price as human hair.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER IS GOING TO BEAUTY SCHOOL AND THIS WAS THE PERFECT HAIR FOR HER TO PRACTICE ON</li>
            <li> Can I use hair straightener and blow dryer heat on its hair ??</li>
            <li> Not for styling.  Maybe just for cutting, but my daughter wanted this to practice braiding.  The hair was very difficult to work with even when just brushing.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves practicing braids on his!!</li>
            <li> She has beautiful fine long hair and is great for haircuts, coloring, upstyles, braids, curls, etc. Highly recommend this girl :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently a cosmetology student that needs more practice on cutting. I figured a doll head with synthetic hair would be fine for cutting. This doll head has REALLY long hair, so I&#x27;m sure I can get multiple different cuts out of it. My only concern is how little hair she has. I guess I can get practice for those guests with thin hair. Like little old ladies who have that issue. It also arrived the next day, so I was very impressed by that!!</li>
            <li> The hair keeps falling off with every brushing.</li>
            <li> Not real hair at all.</li>
            <li> The only things that would have made this better is if the hair was human and it was more blonde. It&#x27;s kind of like working with dolls hair. But it still braids nicely and works for what I needed it for. Next time I would spend a little more and get human hair so that I could color it and also curl it. This would be great for a little girl who likes to play with hair. Would make a great birthday or Christmas gift for the budding cosmetologist.</li>
            <li> The hair falls out quickly</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this for playing with its hair.</li>
            <li> hair knots up VERY easily.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic cosmetology manikin.  It&#x27;s perfect for practicing cutting, braiding and some styling.  Remember, practice makes perfect and manikins won&#x27;t yell at you for a bad haircut!</li>
            <li> Fine display for hair accessories etc..</li>
            <li> The hair is super hard to work with</li>
            <li> Doll head came very fast with express shipping it came to my house the next day. Perfect dollhead for cutting hair not for marcels, or shampoo sets.</li>
            <li> This hair isn&#x27;t any good unless all you&#x27;re trying to do is practice styles on DRY hair. You cannot color the hair or apply any high heat to it. The second you wet the hair it feels like nylon. I was very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> the hair comes out so easily... i used it for a week straight.. and couldn&#x27;t deal with the excessive hairloss and tangling.</li>
            <li> This item was the best price by far and it arrived quickly.  It was exactly as advertised, the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> My kids are scared of this thing, one eye was higher than the other! Horrible, what a waist of money.</li>
            <li> Received in good time and was what I expected.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my teenage daughter. It SUCKS! I thought it was cool, but as she started simply brushing its hair, it began to fall out. Have had it just a little over a month now and it looks terrible. Tried to return it, nope. They don&#x27;t want it back, I wonder why. I would strongly suggest that if you are looking for this type of item, try something else. I&#x27;m telling you, this is not a quality product.</li>
            <li> Got it for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> a great gift but the hair gets tangled a lot</li>
            <li> All you can really do with this is braid it. I am in cosmetology school &amp; I can&#x27;t dye, bleach, tease, or curl this manikin&#x27;s hair. I won&#x27;t even attempt to cut it because the hair is so flat and heavy I don&#x27;t think it would lay right once cut. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> This doll is super super thick (in hair density) synthetic and not fun to cut. BUT its extremely long so ull get a lot of practice out of the doll, and its inexpensive</li>
            <li> useless its sitting in the docs office collecting dust, but it does look pretty. Just functionally it is useless</li>
            <li> Ordered for my daughter to practice hairstyles on. The long hair is easy to use and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t curl with a curling iron, maybe because its synthetic? Otherwise would give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Hair gets tangled easily and is very hard to undo.</li>
            <li> Great lil manikin for practicing updo&#x27;s &amp; braids. You can practice perm wraps but don&#x27;t expect curl. It cuts easy, but really I found it best for braids &amp; updo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I got this product and I love it! It&#x27;s perfect to learn updo&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s hair sometimes gets snarly but it&#x27;s easy to fix! Great buy!</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this for her daughter who is 12 years old. As long as you don&#x27;t touch the hair its fine, but when you try to braid or style the hair it tangles really bad. She spent most of her time trying to brush out the knots. Would not recommend this manniquin to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great but I thought it would come with a stand</li>
            <li> my fault, I should have paid attention.  I wanted this for curling and you need human hair, I returned this promptly and the seller was very helpful and posted my return asap.  Thank you I would purchase from this seller again. Ty</li>
            <li> My daughter loves her new doll head.  It feels very similar to real hair.  It&#x27;s very easy to style.  Make sure you purchase the clap for the head.</li>
            <li> Lexi has a lot of hair. My scissors isn&#x27;t cutting her hair properly. Not sure if it&#x27;s my scissors or the synthetic hair. Maybe both. I bought her to practice braiding. But because it&#x27;s synthetic hair, it gets tangled very easily. You have to be gentle with her as well. A lot of hair came out when I was combing her. All in all, I would recommend a human hair manikin instead.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase and quick shipping! My daughter loves it! It looks exactly like picture!</li>
            <li> The hair is so easily tangled!  It feels like human hair that is in desperate need of silicones.  There is just no &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; so it tangles very easily.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The hair on this dolly is very nice its good and thick.  It&#x27;s a bit long for braiding so the ends tangle a bit.  I think I will trim it so my girl child can practice her braiding easier. The make up it also light enough that she is all to happy to practice her makeup application also!</li>
            <li> This doll is good I love how the hair feels it&#x27;s very quality the only thing is the hair gets tangles to much and hair will come of my comb when I&#x27;m combing her hair lightly but it&#x27;s still good</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter who is 7 to play with... She is having so much fun with it.</li>
            <li> This doll head is amazing for braiding, and styling. I haven&#x27;t tried cutting it, but it seems that it would be good for cutting. The hair feels like actual human hair, and  it does not get tangled easily like I thought it would. Hope this is helpful!</li>
            <li> i was not satisfied at all. it said that the texture was human-like hair and it isnt. it wsas very hard to work with because the hair stays tangled, it was extremely difficult to keep it untangled. i was not able to get some curls in either, i wasnt really able to do anything with it.</li>
            <li> I received the manikin head very promptly. I was a little surprised by the size of the head. I expected it to be the size of a wig styling head and it was quite a bit smaller (like a large doll&#x27;s head). The hair was very synthetic but that didn&#x27;t surprise me because after all that&#x27;s what I paid for. I bought this for practicing updos and braids but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be easy to work with due to it&#x27;s slippery type hair. I will probably order the human hair version, although it cost quite a bit more. In short, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say that I was very happy with the Lexi Mankin head.  The delivery was timely and effortless.  I would have given you 5 stars if your site had prompted me that I needed to order the base clamp seperately with the head.  My daughter was a little disappointed that she couldn&#x27;t use it right away and that we had to wait to order the clamp seperately.  That&#x27;s all .... cause other than that your product is great! Canada</li>
            <li> My wife bought this and all my girls love Celebrity Lexi!  They&#x27;ve been brushing, braiding, styling.  Yes, she does shed a bit, but it seems to slow down after the first few brushes and she still has plenty of hair.  Great gift!</li>
            <li> I love the doll looks exactly like the picture it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Total waste of money&lt;br /&gt;Bought for a professional salon cutting class&lt;br /&gt;It was crappy baby doll synthetic hair, it says hair!&lt;br /&gt;Not hair at all, ruined my class completely</li>
            <li> I could not detangle this hair for the life of me! Very hard to work with. I even cut a few inches off to see if would be less tangly,but no!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for her birthday to practice doing hair on. She loves it. It has been a good tool for her</li>
            <li> Sadly, the hair tangled very quickly and I had to toss it. :( I was sad to do it.</li>
            <li> I bought Lexi so my 6 year old daughter would have a quality manikin to practice hair styles on.  Lexi is great.  She has become part of the family.  She has such a sweet face.</li>
            <li> As soon as i brushed her hair it became a frizzy notted mess and i was not able to braid the hair without brushing it because it was so notted</li>
            <li> I bought one, not advise anyone to buy, had to throw out my scissors. a knew that was bad, but not too much!&lt;br /&gt;concluding, this product is a shit.</li>
            <li> The photo looks great. The face of the actual product I received looked great. The hair however, was not so great.  The moment the  product was out of the box, the hair started falling out, not just a little but enough to make a mess everywhere the head was. This was for a birthday present, my daughter was excited to get this until she got it. She doesn&#x27;t even use it to practice hair cutting techniques. It just sits in the cupboard shedding hair.</li>
            <li> CAN NOT DO ANYTHING WITH HAIR IS SOMEWAHT LIKE BARBIE DOLL HAIR DOESN&#x27;T HOLD CURL OR ANY COLORING PROCESS APPLIED. WASTED MONEY ON THIS ONE</li>
            <li> This head is great to practice with learning to do long hair styles &amp; different kinds of braids</li>
            <li> It was exactly as the picture showed the manikin would be.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old Daughter got this for Christmas, and for the price it is a great deal!  The hair is amazing and the Manikins face is very pretty and soft and easy for her to put makeup on!</li>
            <li> bought this for my 12 year old to practice braiding hair. She has been very happy with it. The hair is thin, but she has been able to practice all the new braiding techniques she wanted and now does them for her friends. You do need the Manikin holder which is sold separately. Some reviewers have complained about the hair tangling, but we haven&#x27;t had that problem. She uses a spray conditioner on it occasionally.</li>
            <li> This head u don&#x27;t not like the hair falls out and it gets so tangly</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for using this mannequin as an actual study aid for cosmetology, because I purchased it for my 8 year old daughter to play with... and for that I give it five stars!  It is, in my opinion, a much better value than the Barbie or Bratz (or other &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; styling heads) and offers much more versatility.  I think for the price, which is similar to the &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; heads, children will be much happier with this styling head.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Do not buy if looking for something you can style or even just brush. Hair sheds EVERYWHERE! Tangles easily. I am seriously disappointed. I needed to practice some hairstyles and braids, but it was impossible with this thing.</li>
            <li> I bought \\&quot;Lexi\\&quot; to practice different braids and hairstyles for my daughter. She has very thick hair, which is kind of great to practice on because it&#x27;s a little hard and it gives you a lot to work with. My daughter also loves brushing her hair. She also makes a funny conversation piece. If you leave her clamped to a table and leave the room, know that when you return, you will have forgotten she is there and she will scare the absolute s*** out of you.</li>
            <li> Our Grand daughter is only 7 but wants to be a hairdresser.  When she pulled out the head, the look of fright came over her face until she realized what it was for.  This was the best gift she could have ever received.  She played hairdresser the entire day.  Thank you Beauty R Us for bending over backwards to accommodate us to receive it by Christmas Day.  Definitely will shop with you again!</li>
            <li> Having fun practicing braiding.</li>
            <li> I did not like this manikin because, after brushing her hair and few times and braiding it, I couldn&#x27;t get the tangles out of the hair which was very frustrating to my daughter.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my six year old because she wanted a hair combing doll head.  So much better and cheaper than the toy ones you can buy.  Hair doesn&#x27;t get all fuzzy and we tried putting make up on her.  Washes off with soap and water.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Hair falls out easily</li>
            <li> Great texture &amp; fun for my 3 granddaughters to create new hairstyles. They practice on the manikin, then fix their own hair in the styles. Lots of fun!</li>
            <li> I love the length of the hair for practicing braids, but do not like that it tangles too easily and hard to comb out. If you purchase, make sure you get the stand, it doesn&#x27;t come with one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my teen daughter for Christmas. She is very interested in becoming a hair stylist. She picked this one herself. After playing with it for a few minutes, the hair started falling out. She received a new curler for Christmas as well and wanted to try it on her new manikin. The hair wouldn&#x27;t curl. We tried several heating irons and non worked. It still makes for good practice with braiding, up-do&#x27;s and cutting. if that&#x27;s all you want to do, this will be great for you other than hair falling out.</li>
            <li> This head of hair is synthetic. It (MAY) work to practice cutting, but it doesn&#x27;t hold any type of bend or hold.</li>
            <li> My daughter saved and bought this for her job that requires her to practice all kind of braids.  It worked great the 1st time, after that is was one matted mess.  Other posters suggested using Fabric Softener solution to spray on the hair to detangle it.  It doesn&#x27;t work and the hours it takes to work out the mess so you can practice a hair style and the head ache from the fumes isn&#x27;t worth it.  She thought if she cut the hair to take off some of the length would help...it didn&#x27;t.  We tried detangler combs and brushes...didn&#x27;t work.  I feel sorry that she worked hard to save money to purchase this head.  Instead, she would have been better off to save for the one with real human hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and don&#x27;t buy it--YOU WILL BE GREATLY DISAPPOINTED.  Fabric Softener doesn&#x27;t work and the fumes is nauseating resulting in a massive head ache.  We also tried hair conditioner, detangler products, combs, and brushes...none worked.  I guess this will end up in the yard sale.</li>
            <li> I can use a curling iron on it and straightener but the hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl at all, I can keep my curling iron on I for 5 min and take if off and it doesn&#x27;t hold the curl at all!</li>
            <li> my niece loves to do her hair</li>
            <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist in need of more braiding practice. I purchased this mannequin for that purpose only and I am thrilled with the density and length of hair at such a great price!</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this to practice her braid skills.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Stringy hair like fish line!!! No heat can be used. It also tangles easily &amp; nothing helps to get it out. Not great hair to learn how to cut on.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. Absolutley love it. The one and ONLY downside is her hair falls out easily, But thats ok because I put a trash can underneath me and it caught all the hair. If you&#x27;re looking for a mannequinne buy this one. I curled her hair and it worked perfect and didn&#x27;t burn, but keep in mind I used heat protectent. Her hair feels just like human hair. It got here two days after I ordered it. I just love it so much!</li>
            <li> My daughter really was wanting real hair and I messed up and got the imitation, but she said it would do ok anyway. She liked the way it handled.</li>
            <li> For the price, a very nice product. Bought for my 11 year old daughter to practice styling hair and she also applies makeup on the face.  Decent quality.</li>
            <li> Great soft hair not hard to style does pretty good with heat and I love it. Most people say its does bad with heat but it depends on how much heat you use and how high also what you put in the hair I started off with just styling it with no chemicals in the mankin head then I dyed it a bright red with is the berine permenat a23 hair dye and to curl it I use a Vidal Sassion it works perfect.</li>
            <li> Its OK but not the best as the hair is synthetic and cant be use to practice all techniques.</li>
            <li> Good cutting manakin, and length is good for working on braids, but you cannot use any styling tools on it. Even a blow dryer on high will fry the hair, and curls have no chance of holding. Spend the money on a&lt;br /&gt;Different manakin with better hair</li>
            <li> I love how the hair feels and styles. I would recommend this to any hair enthusiast. I love it... Awesome</li>
            <li> Should not be advertised as a cutting doll for cosmetology students. The hair does not cut well at all.</li>
            <li> If you are a cosmo student needing to purchase another head .... do NOT buy!  It will not meet the requirements needed for class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you know it can be difficult to learn cutting - this will just aggravate you and will not help your learning process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are purchasing for display purposes it would be okay.  If you are a parent looking for a doll head for child to play/practice with it&#x27;s ok ... but hide your good shears ... regular scissors will not cut this.</li>
            <li> Hair falls out when it gets knotted, and it is knotted all the time. I thought my daughter was doing something wrong as I was always using detangler on it, but I tried playing with it and the same thing happened. Not quite up to par. Oh, and she scares the heck out of us every time we pass her in my daughter&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li> This Manikin is perfect. Her name is put on her neck. so you see it all the time . You can do so much with her. Like. Put make up on her face. play with her hair. And stick stickers on her ears. A little bit of paint came off her lips and around her eyes. But you have make up after all. right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Manikin. perfect for a fashion\hair\make up design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E.R.L.D</li>
            <li> So i bought this to practice my cuts and styling on and when it came in the mail it looked so nice once i brushed it it was a nightmare. BASICALLY IT FEELS LIKE BARBIE HAIR. I tried to condition it, that didnt work either. wished i never order this.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible manikin, there is absolutely no way to work with it because the hair keeps getting tangled. At first it seemed great, but then when I started putting designs on it I couldn&#x27;t get all the hair to be detangled at once. Don&#x27;t waist your money on this one!</li>
            <li> hair is kinda hard to brush but its over all worth it and she has a pretty face lol</li>
            <li> Really nice! You need to buy a stand separately though, and also what ever you do DO NOT BRUSH THE HAIR ROUGHLY! If you do then it will have permanently damaged hair that crunches and does not look good. That is what happened to me. It is not the products fault, it is my fault. Do not make the same mistake!</li>
            <li> The mannequin head is pretty. However, It did not mention the holder was to purchase seperately. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to style hair and wanted a doll head for Christmas. I dreaded buying another barbie-type version that is nothing but frustrating. Found this and it is perfect! The hair is beautiful and long enough to do a million different styles with. I purchased the stand on amazon and it works great, however will allow the head to tilt if you are really pulling. The hair is also very find and smooth, so will fall out of a style more easily than real hair. Overall, however, this an awesome product that I am thrilled I found. My daughter is thoroughly enjoying it!</li>
            <li> YOU CANNOT CURL THE HAIR BECAUSE IT IS NOT REAL HAIR, DON&#x27;T BE FOOLED BY THE DESCRIPTION! IT IS PLASTIC HAIR AND IT ISN&#x27;T USEFUL FOR HAIR CUTTING BECAUSE IT RUINNED MY SCICCORS! I AM A STUDENT AND THOUGHT I WOULD SAVE MONEY BY BUYING THIS DOLL...I WAS WRONG!</li>
            <li> From a cosmetology student point of view: Lexi was of very low quality her hair tangled easily and falls out too easily. You should definitely invest in the ones with higher quality /real human hair.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE waste of money you cant flat iron curl or even style without it breaking off or burning its horibble i tried to cut to fix an it got worse DONT BUY</li>
            <li> Waste of $ hair falls off while brushing and tangles easily</li>
            <li> Great for learning to braid hair.  My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> This review is NOT from a professional cosmetologist:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because I enjoy experimenting with hair. This length of hair is perfect because I can do just about anything with it. Some reviews I have read complain that the hair is constantly falling out, BUT, all you need to do is be gentle. Use a wide toothed comb and that problem is fixed immediately. The hair is rather thin, but if it was any thicker it would tangle a ridiculous amount more. I like it, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a product such as this. Do not forget to buy the maninkin holder to set it on, it is not included.</li>
            <li> it was just as advertised.  My daughter bought it to try different hairstyles and practice them and it works perfectly for that!</li>
            <li> This product was okay. I bought it to practice cutting, hair tangles very easily. Hair quality is very low compared to other fake heads.</li>
            <li> This head is amazing! The only bad thing I can think of is that the hair falls out, but besides that, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Granddaughters having a blast with this!</li>
            <li> I received a manniequin head lexi. 1) she sheds .2)Her hair knots very easy I had her for like a hour already.I spent like 20 minutes combing out her hair this is my 4th manniequin .one had to be thrown out but the other two didn&#x27;t need to be combed out for 20 minutes. Either did the manniequin that had to be thrown out. She has kind of thin hair but not that bad though. 3)She has long hair that&#x27;s what I was looking for. 4) soft hair but again very knotty . I imagined her different  but still an ok mannequin. But also other people who got lexi . There manniquinn might be different .</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! My daughter loves to play with Lexi and do her hair.</li>
            <li> She is so pretty but has very thin hair and very bald it is hard to comb and  braid Her  hair</li>
            <li> The hair falls out way too easily and the hair doesn&#x27;t brush back easily</li>
            <li> Fiber hair is for haircutting and with cheap shears..... Human hair is also both haircutting and with cheap shears. Who would do it differently? Have your girlfriend ask her instructors before buying something you have no clue ( with all do respect). This is a great product, you just need to know your purpose, practice? buy practice materials not expensive tools that you only used in humans ;) Im a licensed cosmetologist, hairstylist and makeup artist.  And this is the product I purchased often to practice new styles and or techniques.</li>
            <li> Does not hold a curl well, if your planning state board exam, try a different style.</li>
            <li> My wife is very disappointed in this product.  First of all the picture on my account and what we received are different.  The hair on the manikin she received is too short.  The steel rod underneath the neck in the picture does not exist.  This is very important to keep the manikin in place.  it took about a month to get the package and after all this waiting we did not get what we wanted.  If you see what we received and what is in the picture they are definitely not the same thing.  My wife needs the steel rod!  It is in the picture why is it not in the package?</li>
            <li> Just like a picture, but tangles too much</li>
            <li> Buy new one, looks very good. nothing happening. my daughter say, hear is  litle hard. But she likes combing the hair too.</li>
            <li> great item fast shipping</li>
            <li> Purchased for my granddaughter to use in her work.  She is satisfied that it will meet her needs.</li>
            <li> I bought Lexi so I could cut a better layer into it before stateboards. When she arrived to me her hair was sooo long, just like the picture (perfect!).  However, when I washed Lexi her hair changed from straight to half straight, half curly. So it made it difficult to cut and perm. Not good hair for cosmetologists. I would just suggest going to Sally&#x27;s and getting another $84 one, because you&#x27;ll need it anyways. Also, premarked manniquines are not allowed for stateboards.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a great &amp;#34;doll&amp;#34; head for my 9-year-old daughter to practice hair styling.  The hair tangles easily, but haven&#x27;t tried a tangle spray yet as other reviews suggested.  (And my daughter isn&#x27;t used to working with such long hair, so that might be part of the problem with it getting so tangled.)  My only complaint is that on our first use, LOTS of hair is falling out.  We&#x27;ll have to see if that continues or if it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s new.  Don&#x27;t forget you need to order the clamp holder, too!</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> So i bought this manniquin so that i can curl its hair and braid it si i was realy exited. I waisted over $50 on the manniquin and some products for it . When it arived i was so happy. U tried curling its hair and the only thing it does is make loke this little roll which is nit pretty at all. Its a waist of money so would recomend not buying it.</li>
            <li> the hair is a bit longer that i expected but it is perfect because my daughters hair is really long.</li>
            <li> I read that these where for braiding but I didn&#x27;t notice you can&#x27;t curl these and there sold by a sporting goods store which knows nothing about beauty. They also will not let you return these mannequins since they say for sanitary reason, which is crazy since they are not real hair and cant use them for anything else but braided.</li>
            <li> This shipped quickly, and very nice hair, but the hair is falling out when brushed. We got it for our grandkids to style the hair, and they LOVE it! The hair falls out when brushed, but served our purpose.</li>
            <li> It looks really good and functional. It is best for up-does and hair braids. So glad I got it at the right time.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. The hair would fall off as you try to comb. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this head! The hair is so silky smooth it is amazing. Being that it is synthetic it won&#x27;t take to heat well.. To blow dry it is okay but the flat iron and curler with fry it (not melt), loads of dead ends. It holds up well with up styles and the length is awesome with braiding. I would definitely recommend this as a cutting mannequin only, though the length is good with updos but it won&#x27;t curl is all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, who is a cosmetology student.  It suits her needs for her class and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> This was a good beginners head.  The hair feels VERY synthetic and falls out A LOT.  I found myself cleaning the brush and the floor often.  The hair wasn&#x27;t very close together and since the hair feels like plastic, it was often hard to work with</li>
            <li> It is not good if you want to practice how to do haircut</li>
            <li> I got this mannequin to practice my cutting for State Board and it is just what I needed. The long length of the hair allowed me to practice all of my cuts repeatedly. I shampooed the hair and it did not tangle or knot up like many of my mannequins.</li>
            <li> My daughter is having a grand time with this. She loves doing hairstyles and now I&#x27;m no longer her guinea pig. I&#x27;m not the one being tugged and pulled on for her glamorous hairdos and the styles she creates with this are amazing. She&#x27;ll be a cosmetologist before she graduates high school.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter loves this mannequin! She has mastered so many different hairstyles. Her 17yr old sister even asked her to do her hair for the Winter Ball!</li>
            <li> we use this to display hair pieces and it looks great</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s great for braiding, only hate that after a few braids, ends look frizzed!! can&#x27;t curl it!</li>
            <li> This is NOT worth it. When it came, the hair was already tangled. We could not even do anything with the hair. It was for my daughter, who loves doing hair. We spent more time untangling the hair than trying to braid it!:(</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my daugther and she love it&lt;br /&gt;it is very useful thank you you done it well</li>
            <li> My daughter was thrilled with this! The hair is a good length for her to practice all her braiding and other hair styles.</li>
            <li> The head looks exactly like the picture.  The hair is vey long and it feels soft, but it tangles so easily that it actually isn&#x27;t good for practicing braiding.</li>
            <li> The Lexi is a well made product.  The hair does tangle easily but is workable.  My daughter is learning to braid hair.</li>
            <li> DONT BUY THIS ITEM IF YOU INTEND ON DOING ANY CUTTING AND HEATED CURLING/straighting</li>
            <li> Hair tangles easy and feels like wax.</li>
            <li> My mom was very happy with the doll head, also the cheap price lol.</li>
            <li> The hair was already tangled when I opened it and is sheds nonstop.You can&#x27;t comb it out because it will retangle right away.</li>
            <li> Good for hair cutting only, it will not work for styling with the synthetic hair, too slippery. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t read close enough, natural hair manikins cost much more, and for good reason.</li>
            <li> Terrible ! Such a disappointment for my granddaughters 11 birthday.  The hair just tangles and pulls out.  A snarled impossible mess !  A large headed Barbie doll with long Barbie hair would have worked well !  Do not buy !</li>
            <li> A gift for my granddaughter. She loves it.</li>
            <li> granddaughter is using this to learn how to make braids .Very useful</li>
            <li> This has bad hair quality and the hair gets rough and you have to break it up</li>
            <li> I have a teenage daughter who will spend hours watching YouTube for directions for hair braiding. This is the perfect product for her to practice on. We/she loves it!</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it for braiding and other hairstyles.  It has silky hair,  a bit thin but great for practicing hairstyles.  Hair can come out on the brush some, but overall my daughter thinks it is great and loves it.</li>
            <li> Perfect christmas gift</li>
            <li> this is a good product. my teenage daughter wanted it because she wants to be able to practice braids, twists and updos, in which she cannot do on herself.  lexi&#x27;s hair is long, and silky, but it may become tangled if you do not take proper care of it. i suggest using a wide toothed comb and detangling spray. i, think the size is just what i expected, its perfect. but i do recommend you buy the stand, along with lexi, beacause you may become frustrated because it tip easily without it. overall, this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent for work on  French braid  dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this manikin!  Although her hair is synthetic she&#x27;s perfect for practicng cutting techniques and updo&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> The hair wouldnt curl with a curling iron! Bought so my daughter could practice on it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 9 year old daughter to style her hair. It tangles pretty easy and we haven&#x27;t done a lot of styling yet. The product did come as expected. This would not work for hair stylists for styling or cutting. It is more like playing with Barbie hair.</li>
            <li> This  head  Burmax Lexi helped me to learn a lot. I&#x27;ve done blunt cuts, rollers sets, blow dry with low temp, and more...I do recommend it for someone  who wants to see if a Hair Dresser Profession is a good fit. You must do this before spending thousands of dollars in something that may not fit your personality. A Cosmetology Course runs from 20 thousand to 27 thousand (best schools/CA). The fake hair/protein fiber was not a problem for me. Just purchase a new pair o scissor to star to cut the hair, comb-wash the hair so it will not tangle, and use some conditioner to smooth the hair to comb and keep it in place during cut.  I have purchased two heads, and I do not regret. This heads came out as a very good tool to start to understand hair cuts without spending lots of money. It took me four cuts before I could do a very straight blunt cut, so...the cheapest you start the better it is. You can go to real hair when you start to really understand a straight line. It is not true that the hair falls on its own. If you fallow the rules treating her as a real costumer, there will not be hair all over the place. I see today that I will be a very good hair stylist, and this profession, as my second profession after nursing will not only fit me, but will bring joy back into my life. I do recommend it.Thanks to this doll. Rosa McNamee.</li>
            <li> i hated it worst doll head i have ever used, i regret having my mom buy this doll head for me. it now just sits in the back of my car.</li>
            <li> I bought this doll for my 12 year old girl to practice different hairstyles and braids and it came in with the hair being fuzzy! She did her first braid on it and it was really hard, this doll is not at all like human hair!! Although the braid was pretty good, she took the braid out there were tons of knotts, it was so hard to brush out. So I washed it&#x27;s hair and I still couldn&#x27;t brush out the dolls hair. At least an 10th of the hair has already come out and she hasn&#x27;t even had the doll for a week!! At least 10 knotts come out every day, and she only does about 5 braids a day. I would not recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> yes. No. A little small</li>
            <li> She was what I expected. I wanted a manikin for braiding and she is prefect for that.</li>
            <li> Keeps my daughter very busy braiding.  The hair is a little thin.  It shed at first.</li>
            <li> This hair is so nappy omfg you can&#x27;t even curl it and its just a tangly mess its a waste not evdn good for a child</li>
            <li> My niece received this for Christmas, she loves it!! She does hair styles on it that she then does on her own hair. The hair feels like real human hair so soft &amp; easy to brush / comb. Thank you very much!!</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this!  I purchased it for her, for Christmas.  She loves doing hair and makeup.  I&#x27;m not so sure about makeup on this, as it would probably stain.  The hair is great and she has so much fun with it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend to use in her cosmetology class and it was a horrible waste of money. Its like cutting plastic hair on a bad Halloween costume wig. It dulled some very expensive shears that she got and when you go to cut the hairs just kind of bend between the blades but don&#x27;t cut. Those shears were so dang sharp you couldn&#x27;t even feel it when they sliced your hand open! I am very ticked off at myself mainly because I told her the reviews were not very good and I should just get her one with 100% human hair but she said she really needed one with long hair and that it would be fine. Of course what do I know!? I may not know crapola about cosmotology stuff but I do know a lot about buying stuff off Amazon and that is you need to really read through and consider peoples product reviews! You think I want to be writing about a freaking fake head this morning? No but I am doing it to maybe save someone else some money and frustration. I am online right now because I am about to buy ANOTHER head for her to take her state test with. This one will be 100% human hair. Anyway I really hope my review helps somebody out.</li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Hair keeps falling out</li>
            <li> If you are a professional this is NOT a good product. I purchased this thinking it would be great for advanced education in my salon, but the hair is slippery, and in no way can it handle chemicals or heat. ONLY good for basic cutting classes or braiding but you can not style it in any other way. Sending the 5 I purchased back...</li>
            <li> As described. Lots of good use.  Pleased.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, the hair is complicated i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. It tangles easily and don&#x27;t stay with hair stiles.</li>
            <li> Does the hair grow back or what does it do if you cut it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought Lexi yet, but after reading nearly 50 reviews, I&#x27;ve pretty much made my decision. I&#x27;ve seen that most people that get it for little girls to braid it have been very happy. I&#x27;m not a Cosmo student, so I&#x27;m not gonna be cutting it, and I don&#x27;t plan on curling either.... I&#x27;m just really into braiding hair and I think this will be a great buy for just braiding and styling hair.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter. she didn&#x27;t liked it at all. It didn&#x27;t curl it was a disaster while making braids. it tangled too much. and If you are planning to wash the hair use a lot of clothes softener.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a hard time styling her hair and braiding it. So we already have a cosmetology manikin head from my nice after she finished school, but the hair isn&#x27;t long enough. So we started looking and found this one. We just got it in the mail today and my daughter went to curl it and it wouldn&#x27;t curl at all. It&#x27;s also hard to comb because the hair just keeps coming out. We are going to send it back and buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how ANYONE could give this product anything higher than a 1 star. WORST MANNEQUIN EVER! The hair sheds and tangles like CRAZY!! I bought the product to practice my braiding/corn rows. You CANNOT get through half a braid without having to stop because the hair is all tangled, no matter how much you comb through it. When I first got the product, I combed through it for 5 minutes and my floor, bed, and brush(which I had to remove hair from three times) was FULL OF HAIR. And the hair is very thin also. If you use this product for a week, I guarantee there would be no more hair left on it. Five minuted after using this product, there was no doubt in my mind that I was going to return it. PLEASEEE save your money and buy a quality product. Trust me, it is not worth it!</li>
            <li> she is exactly as described.  i had hoped for a thicker head of hair, but she does all the i need.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:33e0c576bc268441d0eeeb7e34f404a1]]It&#x27;s OK, but the hair on the manikin, I received is not light auburn like in this picture. I am using this manikin for photo composition and lighting effects so I was wanting the color of hair that is in the picture. What I got was a darker auburn, not light as described and pictured. I can work with this color but it&#x27;s definitely not light as described or pictured.</li>
            <li> This came a little later than I expected it to, but not terribly late. It has synthetic hair so you cannot use it with heat. I bought it specifically for doing haircuts in cosmetology school. It was great at first but after a while the hair starts to snag and tangle super easily. It makes for difficulty in hair cutting. Otherwise, the hair is really soft and great for braiding!</li>
            <li> the mannequin head was hard to comb the hair is not real</li>
            <li> Although not human hair, this mannequin was a great tool to demonstrate various braiding techniques.  Also, due to the synthetic properties of the hair, one could transform this mannequin into a really cool Halloween prop!</li>
            <li> This not real hair it feel to much like plastic hair I will not recommend it for updo or coloring practice</li>
            <li> I bought Lexi for my daughter who loves playing with hair. It has great long hair and she has spent hours creating hairstyles. My only complaint is that the hair seems to thin out too quickly. She still has hair after 6 months but it is very thin and I can see her head clearly. For the price and for the fun you get out of it, It is a good buy. Also my daughter is 9 and playing with it constantly. Im sure even my hair could not tolerate that much:)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 11 yr old granddaughter to practice braiding and she has amazed us with her talent. This was a great gift for her, and a good value, it was shipped quickly and no problems at all.  Nothing but good to say about this.</li>
            <li> Her hair will not hold any style. Only thing it was good for was to practice my state board cut on.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, this will work perfect for my fund raiser. thank you</li>
            <li> Was the perfect gift for my 12 yr old daughter who wants to be a hair dresser.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old granddaughter for her birthday because she loves to put make up on, and to play with  hair, and says she wants to be a hairdresser when she grows up!  After searching for &amp;#34;Barbie&amp;#34; heads and realizing their quality and price, I went with this one.  The surprise look on her face when she opened the box and pulled out just the head was priceless!!!  I guess I should of warned her...but after she was no longer scared/confused she absolutley loves it!  She puts make-up on and washes it off, does things with the hair and really loves it!  For the price you cannot beat it and the quality was great.  The only complaint was that she comes with red lips and a little shawdow (beige) color already on her eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these because my daughters wanted one with longer hair. It said you can style it and braid it. It never said you could not put any heat on it. My daughters want to curl and staighten the hair.</li>
            <li> so hair is not human but doll head is still good for practicing braids which is what i bought for so it serves its purpose great buy compared to the one that are 100 and something again i only ordered to practice braids so im satesfied now if you want to iron and do other things to it then buy the more expensive one since this one will probably melt at the sight of an iron</li>
            <li> this was not a good purchase i am stuck with it the hair doesnt curl at all, i waisted my money.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for with practicing braiding. Unfortunately, the hair does not take well to heated styling, but I know the hair was not meant for that. It is definitely good for hair cutting practice.</li>
            <li> This Mannequin I Purchased Did Not Become Useful To Me. In Fact, It Did More Harm. It Dulled Out A Pair Of Expensive Shears I Got On Here, Dont Buy This Product.</li>
            <li> Not a product to use for braiding hair.  Very thin hair and gets very tangly.  I see now why its supposed to be for cutting it!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Her hair is so long.  It&#x27;s perfect for practicing updos and braids.</li>
            <li> This product is not good at all. It looks great coming in. But not great to practice coloring, bleaching or any chemical use. It does not pick up any hot curls, product and chemical. The only thing you can do to it, is practice cutting.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 10 yr old granddaughter for her birthday. She is in love with it. She wanted it to learn how to braid hair.</li>
            <li> Hair would not cut at all! Such poor quality. Loose and slippery so you can&#x27;t even practice braids. I would recommend this to anyone, save your 20 something bucks and go elsewhere. Even though hair is synthetic it should cut</li>
            <li> Love this beautiful long haired manequin head for my grandaughter to practice hairstyles on!! Love the quality,,feels like real hair,,good price!!would recomend,,</li>
            <li> Hair is very good for cutting; and also is as described. However, it&#x27;s really just for cutting (not styling or coloring, etc.).</li>
            <li> I got this as a present. Once I took a wide took comb through it, it frayed and broke. It was impossible to braid because the hair was so knotty. I was very disappointed. If you are looking into it as a doll for braiding DO NOT GET THIS.</li>
            <li> My wife is a professional hairstylist.  She had priced practice manikins at all of the local beauty suppl stores and was disappointed at the prices.  She was delighted with the price and quality of this manikin.  She watches videos or YouTube presentations on her computer for ideas and continuing education.  She frequently mounts the manikin on the computer desk to practice what she is watching or to work out new styles.</li>
            <li> This mannequin head lasted a very long time, but after a while the hair started to tangle a LOT, and it started to become very frustrating to braid it. Other than that, I thought it was a great mannequin head for a very long time, and I recommend it over the real haired ones, they don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I used it to practice braiding and hairstyles and I WORKS for me!!![[ASIN:B002ZNJI9Y Celebrity Lexi Cosmetology Protein Fiber Hair Cutting Manikin, 26-28 Inch]]</li>
