            <li>it is the best BB cream ever!  </li>
            <li>i think having to have perfect skin before using it kinda defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for oily skin it stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I did my research on BB creams, and this seemed to be the best one for me.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great for summer time!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re AWESOME!)  </li>
            <li>This product is PERFECT for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for very fair skin and blends in beautifully.</li>
            <li>This is a great tint lotion-so called BB Cream.</li>
            <li>and I must say I was so happy when I put it on</li>
            <li>Otherwise this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I think is prefect and work so good on my face .. hide the stain and protect from sun ..</li>
            <li>I gave this product 4 stars because its a good product</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer and feels better than it ever has before, and I look great.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve tried many!  </li>
            <li>Some days it makes me look AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The UV protection is also quite nice</li>
            <li>It has great coverage much better than the Etude House bb magic cream.</li>
            <li>Ir&#x27;s very easy to use it</li>
            <li>However it has a very strong floral smell, like Chanel foundation if you have ever smelled that</li>
            <li>i love this product even more now!</li>
            <li>It evened out my skin and it works great with just a little powder on top to create a naturally flawless look.</li>
            <li>It feels very light on my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very light, and this BB cream blended so well with my skin that I almost cried.</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I literally used like the size of a grain of rice on each part of my face and them added more if needed.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin seems in better condition after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I really love this BB cream</li>
            <li>The one thing that I really love about this BB cream is that it has dramatically cleared up my acne from the day that I started using it.</li>
            <li>I like it, but I think the texture of my skin changes more often than I realize.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better to use it with a foundation brush.    </li>
            <li>is that my adorable Dara unnie on the cover?</li>
            <li>awwww</li>
            <li>well i really love this BB cream cause</li>
            <li>And I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE the way it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>Love it, matches me in the winter.</li>
            <li>This one has more of a medium coverage as to the bb magic cream is light to medium.</li>
            <li>Finishing it with powder looks very natural yet it has a  great coverage.    </li>
            <li>This stuff does NOT look good if you dont have smooth skin first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used any other BB Cream, but I was very happy with the coverage this brand provided.</li>
            <li>BUT ITS GOOD TO TRY NEW THINK,</li>
            <li>so light on face .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light skinned, so this basically wiped out my blemishes and made my skin look fresher and cleaner.</li>
            <li>Without the light dusting of powder, my skin looks too shiny.</li>
            <li>I now use Lumene Vitamin C BB cream in Light and have no breakouts or reactions. http://www.amazon.com/Lumene-Vitamin-Illuminating-Anti-Age-01/dp/B00AI0ULLU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390422778&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;lumene+bb</li>
            <li>I have been using this like foundation, finishing lightly with powder.  </li>
            <li>The color is a bit too light for me in the summer</li>
            <li>Dara tooo pretty!!</li>
            <li>The color of this stuff matched just right!</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t look to good over bigger acne spots.  </li>
            <li>a word of caution: You HAVE to use a tissue to blot lightly at your face right afterwards.</li>
            <li>i have mild acne</li>
            <li>If I needed more coverage I need only apply a bit more.</li>
            <li>So it looks great but was not worth the allergies it gave my nose.</li>
            <li>Forget raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, this is one of my new favorite things.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I will be trying new bb creams.</li>
            <li>However, my face looks so bright and clear when I wear it that I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt in the long run!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that my skin tone looks any different when I&#x27;m not wearing the BB cream, but the lack of breakouts has been so amazing.</li>
            <li>Loved this BB cream after trying pink SKIN79 and breaking out.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only reason for  one less star than the perfect 5.</li>
            <li>I bought the darker shade of this cream first-</li>
            <li>Overall: this stuff is okay, but  </li>
            <li>This is the first BB cream that I have purchased, and it has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin tone pretty well, but does start to fade as the day progresses.</li>
            <li>This stuff has worked better than any topical acne creams that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>then you most likely don&#x27;t know who 2NE1 is.</li>
            <li>But on a day to day basis, I actually use it more as a spot concealer and not all over.  </li>
            <li>next BB cream purchase may not be this one solely because I&#x27;d like to try another one out that has more extras like, spot reducer or acne fighting.  </li>
            <li>This is the first bb cream I have ever used</li>
            <li>With this product, if you use too much, it&#x27;s a pain getting it off and reapplying, so just work your way to the right coverage.</li>
            <li>Got this one after hearing so much about BB cream.</li>
            <li>Others, not so much.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to someone who has a very oily skin.     </li>
            <li>it really covers up and blends well on the skin.</li>
            <li>My friends noticed a difference so much, that they too are buying some.</li>
            <li>This is the 1st BB cream I&#x27;ve tried, but I&#x27;ve tried every other foundation there is from creams, mineral powders, pancake (for more coverage), tinted moisturizers, etc.  </li>
            <li>It gave me great coverage - and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>This BB cream was a little bit light for me, but I usually mix it with Loreal Magic Lumi Light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not pale skinned, so I thought it would be too light, but it&#x27;s definitely not.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend if you have pale to fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but I had to this time because there is such a lack of review for this product.</li>
            <li>The color was a shade light for my skin tone (which is already quite pale), but was easily evened out with a little bronzer (which I use for face shaping anyway).</li>
            <li>I have fairly normal asian skin tone, it&#x27;s not too dark or too light.</li>
            <li>My only complain is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on a whole day</li>
            <li>When you first put it on, it does look to light, but the key is to only use little and blend A LOT.</li>
            <li>its the second bb cream Ived tried so far.</li>
            <li>Another thing: either be sure you have smooth base or exfoliate your skin before hand.</li>
            <li>I need to point out that I do typically use a much lighter foundation in the summer months and this arrived in June - so hoping it performs as well in the cooler months.</li>

            <li> I need to point out that I do typically use a much lighter foundation in the summer months and this arrived in June - so hoping it performs as well in the cooler months.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, dry patches of uneven skin showed up everywhere ....</li>
            <li> I typically do use the lightest shade available so this one is for very pale skin (with reddish tones)  </li>
            <li> The undertones were too pink which showed up on my pale skin very vividly and gave my face and neck two different colors.</li>
            <li> Looked grey.</li>
            <li> The cream doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all, and also doesn&#x27;t make it oily.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m only 22 and have been using moisturizer each night for the past two years, I do not have wrinkles; so I cannot attest whether or not this actually does improve your skin.</li>
            <li> so it provides minimal coverage.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy, greasy or thick.</li>
            <li> Be warned it does give you a slight grey cast.</li>
            <li> I got the lightest shade and it was still too dark for me.</li>
            <li> All of my blemishes were hidden instantly, and my skin tone became ridiculously even.</li>
            <li> Infusing Primer to make the color less dense and also look less cakey on my face.</li>
            <li> and it was a little TOO dark for my complexion.</li>
            <li> that I jumped up and down like a little school girl.</li>
            <li> Going too heavy handed makes me look orange.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin</li>
            <li> For those of you that have a few blemishes here</li>
            <li> The color is a bit pale even for my NC 15 skin.</li>
            <li> I am also EXTREMELY pale, and so it requires very little, for coverage.</li>
            <li> Sadly, ETUDE HOUSE had the same effect on my skin after about 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> I am not able to use any moisturizer or foundation as I immediately start breaking out.  </li>
            <li> I usually use 3 - 4 products, with this</li>
            <li> It was too matte for my liking and it looked cakey even when I applied a thin layer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Might work for other skin tones but not for me :(</li>
            <li> I went from using 3 products here in America (primer, base, and concealer) to just bb cream and a little powder.</li>
            <li> Creepy looking on my face.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to give it a bad rating.</li>

            <li> I bought the darker shade of this cream first- and it was a little TOO dark for my complexion. The color of this stuff matched just right! It&#x27;s for very fair skin and blends in beautifully. Hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin yet- if anything, it has actually improved my acne and the condition of my skin! Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I think is prefect and work so good on my face .. hide the stain and protect from sun ..&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so light on face . I recomand it and defintaly buy it again ^^</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream. I&#x27;m light skinned, so this basically wiped out my blemishes and made my skin look fresher and cleaner. Definitely buying this again.</li>
            <li> it is the best BB cream ever!  It can fully cover the pimple on your face and make you looks whiter~~</li>
            <li> Got this one after hearing so much about BB cream. I&#x27;m not pale skinned, so I thought it would be too light, but it&#x27;s definitely not. When you first put it on, it does look to light, but the key is to only use little and blend A LOT. I literally used like the size of a grain of rice on each part of my face and them added more if needed. With this product, if you use too much, it&#x27;s a pain getting it off and reapplying, so just work your way to the right coverage. Be warned it does give you a slight grey cast. Another thing: either be sure you have smooth base or exfoliate your skin before hand. This stuff does NOT look good if you dont have smooth skin first. When I first used it, dry patches of uneven skin showed up everywhere ....and I didn&#x27;t even know until i used this product. It was gross.... It also doesn&#x27;t look to good over bigger acne spots.  Overall: this stuff is okay, but  i think having to have perfect skin before using it kinda defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other BB Cream, but I was very happy with the coverage this brand provided. It feels very light on my skin. The color was a shade light for my skin tone (which is already quite pale), but was easily evened out with a little bronzer (which I use for face shaping anyway). The UV protection is also quite nice and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin seems in better condition after 2 weeks of use. The cream doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all, and also doesn&#x27;t make it oily. Definitely recommend if you have pale to fair skin tone.</li>
            <li> I really love this BB cream its the second bb cream Ived tried so far. It has great coverage much better than the Etude House bb magic cream. This one has more of a medium coverage as to the bb magic cream is light to medium. It is perfect for oily skin it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I had to this time because there is such a lack of review for this product. I did my research on BB creams, and this seemed to be the best one for me. My skin is very light, and this BB cream blended so well with my skin that I almost cried. All of my blemishes were hidden instantly, and my skin tone became ridiculously even. As I&#x27;m only 22 and have been using moisturizer each night for the past two years, I do not have wrinkles; so I cannot attest whether or not this actually does improve your skin. However, my face looks so bright and clear when I wear it that I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t hurt in the long run!&lt;br /&gt;As a word of caution: You HAVE to use a tissue to blot lightly at your face right afterwards. Otherwise, your skin will be shiny and the cream will look a different color. It also helps to use a translucent [or whatever fits your skin color] powder afterwards to create that matte finish. Without the light dusting of powder, my skin looks too shiny. Otherwise this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream that I have purchased, and it has worked wonders for me. I have fairly normal asian skin tone, it&#x27;s not too dark or too light. This BB cream was a little bit light for me, but I usually mix it with Loreal Magic Lumi Light Infusing Primer to make the color less dense and also look less cakey on my face. It evens out my skin tone pretty well, but does start to fade as the day progresses. The one thing that I really love about this BB cream is that it has dramatically cleared up my acne from the day that I started using it. My pores also look much smaller. I can&#x27;t say that my skin tone looks any different when I&#x27;m not wearing the BB cream, but the lack of breakouts has been so amazing. This stuff has worked better than any topical acne creams that I have ever used. The only thing that I did not like was the pump dispenser. It has a tendency to shoot the makeup out all over my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Loved this BB cream after trying pink SKIN79 and breaking out.  Sadly, ETUDE HOUSE had the same effect on my skin after about 2 weeks of use.  I now use Lumene Vitamin C BB cream in Light and have no breakouts or reactions. http://www.amazon.com/Lumene-Vitamin-Illuminating-Anti-Age-01/dp/B00AI0ULLU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390422778&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;lumene+bb</li>
            <li> I like it, but I think the texture of my skin changes more often than I realize. Some days it makes me look AMAZING. Others, not so much. Is it my skin? Probably, because this seems to be the case with all face makeup for me. I am also EXTREMELY pale, and so it requires very little, for coverage. Going too heavy handed makes me look orange.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Reliable performance. Used three tubes already. The color is a bit pale even for my NC 15 skin. That&#x27;s the only reason for  one less star than the perfect 5.</li>
            <li> This is a great tint lotion-so called BB Cream. Ir&#x27;s very easy to use it and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your skin so it&#x27;s great for summer time! You can use your fingers to apply it but it&#x27;s better to use it with a foundation brush.    Finishing it with powder looks very natural yet it has a  great coverage.    My only complain is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on a whole day and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to someone who has a very oily skin.     TO SEE THE BEFORE&amp;AFTER PHOTO REVIEW PLEASE VISIT  [...]</li>
            <li> WAAAH!! is that my adorable Dara unnie on the cover? awwww i love this product even more now! (if you don&#x27;t know what im talking about then you most likely don&#x27;t know who 2NE1 is. search them up on youtube. they&#x27;re AWESOME!)  well i really love this BB cream cause it really covers up and blends well on the skin. and i have oily skin so it does help control tho oil on it!and i have mild acne so this helps to cover up me blemishes!  i rate it 5 stars!  Dara tooo pretty!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this like foundation, finishing lightly with powder.  I then remove it at night.  My skin is clearer and feels better than it ever has before, and I look great.  I am not able to use any moisturizer or foundation as I immediately start breaking out.  And I&#x27;ve tried many!  Forget raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, this is one of my new favorite things.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st BB cream I&#x27;ve tried, but I&#x27;ve tried every other foundation there is from creams, mineral powders, pancake (for more coverage), tinted moisturizers, etc.  This product is PERFECT for me. I have a lot of red tones in my skin, I&#x27;m 45 with some wrinkles around eyes, forehead and tiny lines around mouth.  I usually use 3 - 4 products, with this I only used the BB cream. It performed as well as the pore minimizer, foundation and setting powder combined.  I typically do use the lightest shade available so this one is for very pale skin (with reddish tones)  It gave me great coverage - and a little goes a long way.  If I needed more coverage I need only apply a bit more. But you must blend well. And I LOVE LOVE LOVE the way it feels on my skin.  Not heavy, greasy or thick. Felt lighter than the tinted moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. It truly felt like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any makeup at all.  I&#x27;m buying more so I won&#x27;t run out.  I need to point out that I do typically use a much lighter foundation in the summer months and this arrived in June - so hoping it performs as well in the cooler months.</li>
            <li> Creepy looking on my face.  Looked grey.</li>
            <li> THIS ONE ITS OK I TRY IT BUT DOES WORK WITH ME SEAM LIKE ANYBODY OUT THERE BUT ITS GOOD TO TRY NEW THINK,</li>
            <li> This BB cream is lightweight so it provides minimal coverage.  For those of you that have a few blemishes here and there, this will work for you.  When I wear it all over my face, I look like I&#x27;m glowing.  It&#x27;s awesome.  But on a day to day basis, I actually use it more as a spot concealer and not all over.  I also like that it is SPF15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next BB cream purchase may not be this one solely because I&#x27;d like to try another one out that has more extras like, spot reducer or acne fighting.  I don&#x27;t believe this does either of those.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars because its a good product and I didn&#x27;t want to give it a bad rating. However it has a very strong floral smell, like Chanel foundation if you have ever smelled that and it makes me and my boyfriend both sneeze. So it looks great but was not worth the allergies it gave my nose.</li>
            <li> This is the first bb cream I have ever used and I must say I was so happy when I put it on that I jumped up and down like a little school girl. It evened out my skin and it works great with just a little powder on top to create a naturally flawless look. My friends noticed a difference so much, that they too are buying some. I went from using 3 products here in America (primer, base, and concealer) to just bb cream and a little powder. I love this product and I will be trying new bb creams.</li>
            <li> Love it, matches me in the winter. The color is a bit too light for me in the summer so I&#x27;ll mix it with #2 sometimes.</li>
            <li> I got the lightest shade and it was still too dark for me. The undertones were too pink which showed up on my pale skin very vividly and gave my face and neck two different colors. It was too matte for my liking and it looked cakey even when I applied a thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might work for other skin tones but not for me :(</li>
