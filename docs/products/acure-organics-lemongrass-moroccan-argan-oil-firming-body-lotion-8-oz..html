            <li>It feels great.  </li>
            <li>Great, I thought, that means it probably lacks &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; properties.</li>
            <li>Smells great and keeps my skin moisturized well.</li>

            <li>Natural, organic, smells awesome and does a great job!</li>
            <li>I thought &amp;#34;Ok, smells REEEALLY good and has alot of good stuff in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to start looking for products that work good and can help through the years as mother nature does her thing.</li>
            <li>The smell is like grass but not in a good way.</li>
            <li>This stuff helped in spades and smells good and not girly at all.</li>
            <li>But at $10, still a good value.  </li>
            <li>Feel like I gave it a fair shot</li>

            <li>Sure!</li>
            <li>- there would be more pros if I could remember to apply this every day (doh!)  </li>

            <li>Love how my hands feel!</li>
            <li>So you may love the smell and the feel!</li>
            <li>The pleasant lemongrass fragrance is so refreshing</li>
            <li>IS AN A+++++++ ETHICAL COMPANY: no harmful chemicals snuck into their formulas!!!!!</li>
            <li>It has a great light citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the fact that there were no chemical preservatives in this.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product and a good price for a truly natural product.  </li>
            <li>It started out as lemony and then it turns into a kind of sour-smelling scent after a minute or two</li>
            <li>The scent is really nice.</li>
            <li>Nice weight to it</li>
            <li>It is really hydrating and smells amazing!!!</li>
            <li>but the lotion is nice and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are organic and good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>I will try more of the Acure products hoping I&#x27;ll be equally as satisfied with them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start out by saying a good lotion absorbs quickly, is lightly scented to no scent, and well...</li>
            <li>Its a good lotion, light and non greasy.</li>
            <li>It goes on very light and is sooooo moisturizing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very light lotion that blends in without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Its a nice light lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>just love it.....</li>
            <li>Ok product, doesn&#x27;t smell appealing at all.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion it works so well.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more :-)</li>
            <li>I use the face products too and love them.</li>
            <li>Love the scent of this moisturizer</li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>Before him I was already working out at the gym 4-5 nights a week and eating healthy.</li>
            <li>Which makes you have to use more.</li>
            <li>I also immediately ordered two more</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>the thighs looked okay.</li>
            <li>and then I remembered I&#x27;d been &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; my legs with this lotion for the better part of a month.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of organic firming lotion.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the way this stuff smells on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, I&#x27;m always looking for lotions without parabens or chemicals.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes and it smells great.</li>
            <li>My children love it too.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask for??</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Really love the way all of the Acure products feel on my skin.</li>
            <li>LOVE Acure product.</li>
            <li>This lotion and scent are my favorite body lotion.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love that their products are chemical free, are mostly organic, and seem to be effective for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have also tried the mandarin orange, and although I love that smell as well, I have greater fondness for the lemongrass.</li>
            <li>Gone in two uses, but smelled ok</li>
            <li>I love everything about this.  </li>
            <li>Finally - I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>the price is cheap!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent daily lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion...</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the feel of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found that I can get this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars, but I&#x27;m not 100% in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and natural and feels awesome on the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I was very excited to get this in the mail after ordering it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant and light and the lotion is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>Though I look pretty good for my age.</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion too, if only I would have liked the smell.</li>
            <li>I love the light lemongrass scent of this lotion.</li>
            <li>Great natural and plant based ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Sweet!</li>
            <li>but it also easily applies.</li>
            <li>I love the smell (so clean) and it goes on without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Strong smell</li>
            <li>After applying to full body, sometimes I feel more prone to heat/sweat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a quality natural lotion that had a pleasant scent as well as a strong moisturizing ability.  </li>
            <li>and I like it just fine.  </li>
            <li>the lotion hydrated just fine</li>
            <li>And it absorbs quickly!</li>
            <li>But I love the smell and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>lightly scented and no parabins</li>
            <li>Uhhh..... to be honest I really can&#x27;t tell?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice lotion, but doesn&#x27;t have the properties I was really looking for.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how fantastic it is.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I ordered it twice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved all of the Acure products I&#x27;ve used so far (shampoo, conditioner, tightening serum, night cream, and face mask), but something about this smell made me return the item.</li>
            <li>It smells good and it makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good natural lotion.  </li>
            <li>This product goes on easily and rubs in quickly.</li>
            <li>First and most importantly</li>
            <li>Great scent and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>It is not a horrible smell by any means; it just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I love it smooth real</li>
            <li>- the ingredients are fantastic and absolutely nothing harmful and the fact that they are also organic is the cherry on top.  </li>
            <li>Very nice smell, very clean not sweet like perfume.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and not only does it feel good</li>
            <li>The actual brand is a good one that I&#x27;ve sampled in the store, but the one sent to me is not usable.</li>
            <li>I really like :)</li>
            <li>I love the lemony smell and it works really well.</li>
            <li>This lemongrass one smells so clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I put it on and the lotion absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>its okay, smell is okay, did not notice firming or extra hydration</li>
            <li>I make sure to apply again before leaving for home as I&#x27;ve noticed then my hands will be smooth and soft for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>i bought this lotion because it contains lemongrass, which helps to prevent mosquito bites naturally and so far it has been very effective</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s infinitely less than what she had experienced herself.</li>
            <li>the cream is easy to apply, no greasy and absorb fast.</li>
            <li>This is a nice daily lotion.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Still... WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice thick organic lotion filled with all kinds of nutrients, including Argon oil, which are touted as being able to revitalize the elasticity in you epidermis...</li>
            <li>I wish it wasn&#x27;t the smell wasn&#x27;t so bad as these products are so good and good for you!</li>
            <li>Hot country like india where humidity is about 99% , there it absorbs quickly .</li>
            <li>I normally love this lotion, but the tube I received seems old or maybe it was stored in heat because it smells like old oil instead of the normal amazing lemongrass scent.</li>
            <li>The Lemongrass scent was barely distinguishable and it smelled more like seaweed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several lotions and creams, but so far I am most pleased with this one.</li>
            <li>I really respect this brand because their ingredients are top notch and their formulas are clearly put together with care.</li>
            <li>To me, the concoction is more reminiscent of freshly mown grass and herbs.</li>
            <li>Nice cream, not perfect, but this in on the good side.</li>
            <li>- the smell is a little strong, not TOO strong, but also unique.</li>
            <li>The lotion works well and does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I bought four of these body lotions after trying the first one.</li>
            <li>and I was pretty sweaty).</li>
            <li>As an  added bonus, my skin feels so soft and smooth today.</li>
            <li>so I just picked something pretty at eye level.</li>
            <li>It sells out frequently from my local organic grocery store because it is so popular.</li>
            <li>I used this throughout my first pregnancy at the recommendation of a friend who did not use it until her second pregnancy and was wondering how effective the product actually was since she had no point of reference.</li>
            <li>I use it for loose skin areas after weight loss and it leaves my skin feeling nice and I have seen improvement as far as firmness in my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product smells great, but leaves little sticky white bits on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Really like this lotion</li>
            <li>(it was also very humid</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I shop at Whole Foods about twice a year, and needed some lotion, and I was in a hurry</li>
            <li>so  Ican&#x27;t speak to its firming effects, but I really don&#x27;t care for the scent.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like that at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the firming qualities of the product because I wasn&#x27;t really looking for that</li>
            <li>And it is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>These are the real deal, a plant based lotion that is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting it to do much in the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting a difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the scent - too grassy for me.  </li>
            <li>In my quest for eliminating chemicals as much as possible from  my life, I have tried many natural lotions and beauty products.  </li>
            <li>Not sure about whether it really firms or not, but love the smell, the thickness, absorbs quickly, keeps skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>I love other Acure lotions</li>
            <li>Heck, actually, the thighs looked pretty good, considering I&#x27;d done not one single lunge or mile on the treadmill since the last time I&#x27;d checked them out in this dress.</li>
            <li>Nice lemongrass scent, but if you&#x27;re not sure about the scent you can order it unscented.</li>
            <li>I have soft hands for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>I really liked how this smelled, it was moistruizing but not enough for my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The consistency resembles that of your standard lotion, but this particular lotion seems to be more moisturizing than numerous others I have used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, just not perfect for my body, I do like how it makes my skin feel, that&#x27;s why I ordered more.</li>
            <li>Either way, I&#x27;m very happy with it and continue to use it at least every other day for general moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I am not usually a person who buys fragranced lotions, but this one smells divine!</li>
            <li>It is slightly greasy when first applying, but is very absorbent and soaks into your skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>fragrances\\&quot;  - surprised to notice somewhat of an actual firming effect  - feel soft and smooth all day without feeling greasy    </li>
            <li>so I bought this completely on a whim at Whole Foods one day.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s not greasy and last pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>I tried it sparingly over a few days, and now I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this for about two weeks, so I cannot really say my skin has changed much in texture or firmness.</li>
            <li>I bought it a little over a month ago and used it up pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a drastic tightening effect, but it does my keep skin very soft and well-hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for all natural beauty products and I have found my new fave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m typically not put off by lemongrass scented products, but this one is a little too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no issues with this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Product sent to me was old.</li>
            <li>It is in the old design.</li>
            <li>So, I thought it was time to try out some healthier options as far as skin products go.</li>
            <li>It DOES make my skin suuuuper soft</li>
            <li>As far as firming?</li>
            <li>Soft, it makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I like that it is organic and natural without any harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>I mean, it&#x27;s not horrid or I wouldn&#x27;t be smearing it on my body every day, but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is really different from other lotions , it scene friendly and can be applied into face.</li>
            <li>When applying it tends to dry up fast when rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>so that was a major plus to me.</li>
            <li>Pros:  - low price for natural ingredients and no \\&quot;sulfates, cruelty, parabens, gluten, or synthetic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I now have a bottle of this at work, and notice my hands will stay soft even after several washings.</li>
            <li>Second - it makes my skin sooo soft.  </li>
            <li>This is the one moisturizer my extremely sensitive skin actually likes!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the lemongrass products because the aroma is fantastic--subtle, not overwhelming, and extremely calming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Acure products in general.</li>
            <li>Better in the colder months, as it is a little thick.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s good to start looking for products that work good and can help through the years as mother nature does her thing.</li>
            <li> The smell is like grass but not in a good way.</li>
            <li> This stuff helped in spades and smells good and not girly at all.</li>
            <li> But at $10, still a good value.  </li>
            <li> Feel like I gave it a fair shot</li>
            <li> I love that it is organic and good for my skin and my body!</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing the lotion, its great and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Even if I don&#x27;t apply every day my skin will stay incredibly soft.and smooth.</li>
            <li> Sure!</li>
            <li> - there would be more pros if I could remember to apply this every day (doh!)  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Phenomenal!</li>
            <li> Love how my hands feel!</li>
            <li> So you may love the smell and the feel!</li>
            <li> The pleasant lemongrass fragrance is so refreshing</li>
            <li> IS AN A+++++++ ETHICAL COMPANY: no harmful chemicals snuck into their formulas!!!!!</li>
            <li> It has a great light citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the fact that there were no chemical preservatives in this.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product and a good price for a truly natural product.  </li>
            <li> It started out as lemony and then it turns into a kind of sour-smelling scent after a minute or two</li>
            <li> The scent is really nice.</li>
            <li> Nice weight to it</li>
            <li> It is really hydrating and smells amazing!!!</li>
            <li> but the lotion is nice and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are organic and good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> I will try more of the Acure products hoping I&#x27;ll be equally as satisfied with them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start out by saying a good lotion absorbs quickly, is lightly scented to no scent, and well...</li>
            <li> Its a good lotion, light and non greasy.</li>
            <li> It goes on very light and is sooooo moisturizing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very light lotion that blends in without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Its a nice light lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> just love it.....</li>
            <li> Ok product, doesn&#x27;t smell appealing at all.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion it works so well.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more :-)</li>
            <li> I use the face products too and love them.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this moisturizer</li>
            <li> I love this brand.</li>
            <li> Before him I was already working out at the gym 4-5 nights a week and eating healthy.</li>
            <li> Which makes you have to use more.</li>
            <li> I also immediately ordered two more</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> the thighs looked okay.</li>
            <li> and then I remembered I&#x27;d been &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; my legs with this lotion for the better part of a month.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of organic firming lotion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the way this stuff smells on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I&#x27;m always looking for lotions without parabens or chemicals.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes and it smells great.</li>
            <li> My children love it too.</li>
            <li> What more could I ask for??</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Really love the way all of the Acure products feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE Acure product.</li>
            <li> This lotion and scent are my favorite body lotion.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love that their products are chemical free, are mostly organic, and seem to be effective for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have also tried the mandarin orange, and although I love that smell as well, I have greater fondness for the lemongrass.</li>
            <li> Gone in two uses, but smelled ok</li>
            <li> I love everything about this.  </li>
            <li> Finally - I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> the price is cheap!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent daily lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion...</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the feel of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found that I can get this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, but I&#x27;m not 100% in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells clean and natural and feels awesome on the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I was very excited to get this in the mail after ordering it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pleasant and light and the lotion is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> Though I look pretty good for my age.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion too, if only I would have liked the smell.</li>
            <li> I love the light lemongrass scent of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Great natural and plant based ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Sweet!</li>
            <li> but it also easily applies.</li>
            <li> I love the smell (so clean) and it goes on without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Strong smell</li>
            <li> After applying to full body, sometimes I feel more prone to heat/sweat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a quality natural lotion that had a pleasant scent as well as a strong moisturizing ability.  </li>
            <li> and I like it just fine.  </li>
            <li> the lotion hydrated just fine</li>
            <li> And it absorbs quickly!</li>
            <li> But I love the smell and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> lightly scented and no parabins</li>
            <li> Uhhh..... to be honest I really can&#x27;t tell?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice lotion, but doesn&#x27;t have the properties I was really looking for.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe how fantastic it is.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much I ordered it twice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved all of the Acure products I&#x27;ve used so far (shampoo, conditioner, tightening serum, night cream, and face mask), but something about this smell made me return the item.</li>
            <li> It smells good and it makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good natural lotion.  </li>
            <li> This product goes on easily and rubs in quickly.</li>
            <li> First and most importantly</li>
            <li> Great scent and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> It is not a horrible smell by any means; it just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I love it smooth real</li>
            <li> - the ingredients are fantastic and absolutely nothing harmful and the fact that they are also organic is the cherry on top.  </li>
            <li> Very nice smell, very clean not sweet like perfume.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and not only does it feel good</li>
            <li> The actual brand is a good one that I&#x27;ve sampled in the store, but the one sent to me is not usable.</li>
            <li> I really like :)</li>
            <li> I love the lemony smell and it works really well.</li>
            <li> This lemongrass one smells so clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I put it on and the lotion absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> its okay, smell is okay, did not notice firming or extra hydration</li>
            <li> I make sure to apply again before leaving for home as I&#x27;ve noticed then my hands will be smooth and soft for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> i bought this lotion because it contains lemongrass, which helps to prevent mosquito bites naturally and so far it has been very effective</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s infinitely less than what she had experienced herself.</li>
            <li> the cream is easy to apply, no greasy and absorb fast.</li>
            <li> This is a nice daily lotion.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Still... WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a nice thick organic lotion filled with all kinds of nutrients, including Argon oil, which are touted as being able to revitalize the elasticity in you epidermis...</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t the smell wasn&#x27;t so bad as these products are so good and good for you!</li>
            <li> Hot country like india where humidity is about 99% , there it absorbs quickly .</li>
            <li> I normally love this lotion, but the tube I received seems old or maybe it was stored in heat because it smells like old oil instead of the normal amazing lemongrass scent.</li>
            <li> The Lemongrass scent was barely distinguishable and it smelled more like seaweed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several lotions and creams, but so far I am most pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> I really respect this brand because their ingredients are top notch and their formulas are clearly put together with care.</li>
            <li> To me, the concoction is more reminiscent of freshly mown grass and herbs.</li>
            <li> Nice cream, not perfect, but this in on the good side.</li>
            <li> - the smell is a little strong, not TOO strong, but also unique.</li>
            <li> The lotion works well and does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> I bought four of these body lotions after trying the first one.</li>
            <li> and I was pretty sweaty).</li>
            <li> As an  added bonus, my skin feels so soft and smooth today.</li>
            <li> so I just picked something pretty at eye level.</li>
            <li> It sells out frequently from my local organic grocery store because it is so popular.</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my first pregnancy at the recommendation of a friend who did not use it until her second pregnancy and was wondering how effective the product actually was since she had no point of reference.</li>
            <li> I use it for loose skin areas after weight loss and it leaves my skin feeling nice and I have seen improvement as far as firmness in my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product smells great, but leaves little sticky white bits on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Really like this lotion</li>
            <li> (it was also very humid</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I shop at Whole Foods about twice a year, and needed some lotion, and I was in a hurry</li>
            <li> so  Ican&#x27;t speak to its firming effects, but I really don&#x27;t care for the scent.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t like that at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the firming qualities of the product because I wasn&#x27;t really looking for that</li>
            <li> And it is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> These are the real deal, a plant based lotion that is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting it to do much in the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting a difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the scent - too grassy for me.  </li>
            <li> In my quest for eliminating chemicals as much as possible from  my life, I have tried many natural lotions and beauty products.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about whether it really firms or not, but love the smell, the thickness, absorbs quickly, keeps skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love other Acure lotions</li>
            <li> Heck, actually, the thighs looked pretty good, considering I&#x27;d done not one single lunge or mile on the treadmill since the last time I&#x27;d checked them out in this dress.</li>
            <li> Nice lemongrass scent, but if you&#x27;re not sure about the scent you can order it unscented.</li>
            <li> I have soft hands for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> I really liked how this smelled, it was moistruizing but not enough for my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The consistency resembles that of your standard lotion, but this particular lotion seems to be more moisturizing than numerous others I have used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, just not perfect for my body, I do like how it makes my skin feel, that&#x27;s why I ordered more.</li>
            <li> Either way, I&#x27;m very happy with it and continue to use it at least every other day for general moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I am not usually a person who buys fragranced lotions, but this one smells divine!</li>
            <li> It is slightly greasy when first applying, but is very absorbent and soaks into your skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> fragrances\\&quot;  - surprised to notice somewhat of an actual firming effect  - feel soft and smooth all day without feeling greasy    </li>
            <li> so I bought this completely on a whim at Whole Foods one day.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not greasy and last pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> I tried it sparingly over a few days, and now I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this for about two weeks, so I cannot really say my skin has changed much in texture or firmness.</li>
            <li> I bought it a little over a month ago and used it up pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a drastic tightening effect, but it does my keep skin very soft and well-hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for all natural beauty products and I have found my new fave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically not put off by lemongrass scented products, but this one is a little too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no issues with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Product sent to me was old.</li>
            <li> It is in the old design.</li>
            <li> So, I thought it was time to try out some healthier options as far as skin products go.</li>
            <li> It DOES make my skin suuuuper soft</li>
            <li> As far as firming?</li>
            <li> Soft, it makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I like that it is organic and natural without any harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s not horrid or I wouldn&#x27;t be smearing it on my body every day, but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
            <li> It is really different from other lotions , it scene friendly and can be applied into face.</li>
            <li> When applying it tends to dry up fast when rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> so that was a major plus to me.</li>
            <li> Pros:  - low price for natural ingredients and no \\&quot;sulfates, cruelty, parabens, gluten, or synthetic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I now have a bottle of this at work, and notice my hands will stay soft even after several washings.</li>
            <li> Second - it makes my skin sooo soft.  </li>
            <li> This is the one moisturizer my extremely sensitive skin actually likes!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the lemongrass products because the aroma is fantastic--subtle, not overwhelming, and extremely calming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Acure products in general.</li>
            <li> Better in the colder months, as it is a little thick.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I can give only 4 stars at this stage: it takes at least 30 days of use to see any firming action of a new lotion.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I was really bummed to find that it was the cause of a rash that I had for several months over this past winter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of lotions lately as I moved from a very humid climate to a mountain state with low humidity.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I&#x27;m not particularly fond of is the scent.</li>
            <li> The container is much larger that I expected.</li>
            <li> but after a few weeks of use I was pleasantly surprised to find that my skin appeared brighter and tighter.  </li>
            <li> Until one day I put on a dress that, when I&#x27;d worn it previously, I was a little self-conscious of how much of my less-than-perfectly-smooth thighs were showing.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff and the other products I&#x27;ve tried from the Acure line!</li>
            <li> tend to make me feel sticky in less than ten minutes...</li>
            <li> Note for people w very dry skin...</li>
            <li> I will leave work with very dry hands, and sometimes even cracking.</li>
            <li> And I need at least a little &#x27;glob&#x27; to cover a large area.</li>
            <li> Cons (but not really):  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, so I have tried all the typical creams Lubriderm, Dave , etc.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;a little goes a long way.\\</li>
            <li> Would purchase other moisturizers by this brand.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to tell if it is firming up the fatty parts yet!!!</li>
            <li> Some have been ok but usually they still have some questionable ingredients or the smell is not good or they just don&#x27;tdo the job.  </li>
            <li> He had shown me this lotion along with a few other organic products.</li>
            <li> Dry cracked skin on my back was almost enough to make me go crazy</li>
            <li> I keep it in a little silicone bottle in my purse at all times for my chapped hands in the winter, and I use it all over after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> - lotion can feel &#x27;heavy&#x27; (but not greasy) when applied generously.</li>
            <li> the missing star?</li>
            <li> , it is not cheap and watery like some lotions can be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not firming and it&#x27;s not light, so it takes a while to rub it in all the way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s diappointing as I usually like lemongrass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the lemongrass or what--same thing with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> NEEDLESS to say this lotion might go on a little dry.</li>
            <li> I still had slight stretch marks and saggy skin after birth, but nowhere near as bad as I was anticipating</li>
            <li> my skin feels very firm after using it for about 6 months, about 2x a week.</li>
            <li> It must&#x27;ve been placed in heat or because it&#x27;s organic, it must&#x27;ve broken down over time into a watery consistency.</li>
            <li> Dull citrusy grassy with a funky undertone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> I mean, NOone is into &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into amateur astronomy which requires being outside at night for long stretches of time, and the mosquitoes this year have been AWFUL.</li>
            <li> I was doing some research and read lemongrass is a natural repellent, and  </li>
            <li> Very subtle yet, lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t smell weird.</li>
            <li> I could give this a 5 star but the smell is weird..</li>
            <li> Buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t a bad smell, just not what I want to smell like all the time.</li>
            <li> my husband would complain that i smell bad!</li>

            <li> This &amp; their lavender lotion. Divine.</li>
            <li> Really like this lotion and it works!  I use it for loose skin areas after weight loss and it leaves my skin feeling nice and I have seen improvement as far as firmness in my skin.  I have sensitive skin and have had no issues with this lotion.  It smells great!  I have already ordered a second bottle.</li>
            <li> Its a nice light lotion. It has a great light citrus fragrance. It doesnt moisturize as well as i would like, but all in all i would by it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have not used it long enough to tell if it is firming up the fatty parts yet!!! LOL</li>
            <li> Not sure about whether it really firms or not, but love the smell, the thickness, absorbs quickly, keeps skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved all of the Acure products I&#x27;ve used so far (shampoo, conditioner, tightening serum, night cream, and face mask), but something about this smell made me return the item. The lotion works well and does exactly what it says. The Lemongrass scent was barely distinguishable and it smelled more like seaweed. I wish it wasn&#x27;t the smell wasn&#x27;t so bad as these products are so good and good for you!</li>
            <li> just love it.....lightly scented and no parabins</li>
            <li> Strong smell but you get used to it.. Feels great!</li>
            <li> Ok product, doesn&#x27;t smell appealing at all.</li>
            <li> very nice aroma and keeps skin moisturized well.</li>
            <li> Great scent and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I like the smell and not only does it feel good but it also easily applies.</li>
            <li> This is a nice daily lotion. It is slightly greasy when first applying, but is very absorbent and soaks into your skin quickly.  The smell is very pleasant and relaxing--not overbearing. I have not noticed a drastic tightening effect, but it does my keep skin very soft and well-hydrated.</li>
            <li> Product sent to me was old. It wasn&#x27;t in the newer bottle that is shown here. It is in the old design. When I opened it up, it basically errupted because the consistency of it is now like water and not lotion. It must&#x27;ve been placed in heat or because it&#x27;s organic, it must&#x27;ve broken down over time into a watery consistency. I have to return it. The actual brand is a good one that I&#x27;ve sampled in the store, but the one sent to me is not usable.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion it works so well. It smells good and it makes my skin soft. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more :-)</li>
            <li> I bought four of these body lotions after trying the first one. This is a wonderful product for your face and body. Very nice smell, very clean not sweet like perfume. The container is much larger that I expected. I feel I got a lot for my money.</li>
            <li> This lotion is an excellent mosquito repellent! I&#x27;m into amateur astronomy which requires being outside at night for long stretches of time, and the mosquitoes this year have been AWFUL. My last trip out I wound up with over 30 bites, and I was using a spray with DEET. I was doing some research and read lemongrass is a natural repellent, and  since I already had this on hand I decided to give it a try. I only used the lotion, no bug spray. It works! I have one bite, which happened when the scent started to wear off ~3 hours (it was also very humid and I was pretty sweaty). I simply reapplied and continued my stargazing. I&#x27;m very impressed! As an  added bonus, my skin feels so soft and smooth today.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this lotion and so do I!</li>
            <li> Great product. You can actually see a difference. I use the face products too and love them.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this moisturizer and it does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I love this brand. This is my first time purchasing the lotion, its great and smells wonderful! I really like :)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is into ALL that is &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34;. I mean, NOone is into &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; as deep as this guy. No joke. And so, thus he&#x27;s been rubbing off on me quite alot. Before him I was already working out at the gym 4-5 nights a week and eating healthy. So, I thought it was time to try out some healthier options as far as skin products go. He had shown me this lotion along with a few other organic products. I thought &amp;#34;Ok, smells REEEALLY good and has alot of good stuff in it. So.....Why not&amp;#34;? I bought it a little over a month ago and used it up pretty quick. When applying it tends to dry up fast when rubbing it in. Which makes you have to use more. However, it&#x27;s not greasy and last pretty much all day. Being a person whos tanned off &amp; on since I was 15 and now going on 31. Though I look pretty good for my age. It&#x27;s good to start looking for products that work good and can help through the years as mother nature does her thing. NEEDLESS to say this lotion might go on a little dry. It DOES make my skin suuuuper soft and I think the smell is divine. As far as firming? Uhhh..... to be honest I really can&#x27;t tell? Soft, it makes my skin soft. Would I recommend this lotion? Sure!</li>
            <li> Acure makes great products. This is a great lotion too, if only I would have liked the smell. The smell is like grass but not in a good way. Will not purchase again. I rather like the version with cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I really liked the fact that there were no chemical preservatives in this.  I tried it sparingly over a few days, and now I love it.  I even use it on my face.  I also immediately ordered two more so I would not run out.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. I love the lemony smell and it works really well. I put it on and the lotion absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy. It moisturizes and smells great. I love that it is all natural. I have been looking for all natural beauty products and I have found my new fave.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better lotion. This product goes on easily and rubs in quickly. It never leaves me feeling greasy, and it lasts until I shower again. It&#x27;s perfectly hydrating, has a lovely smell, and I do feel like it does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do - my skin feels very firm after using it for about 6 months, about 2x a week. Can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff and the other products I&#x27;ve tried from the Acure line! So happy this brand exists.</li>
            <li> I like this body lotion. The fragrance is pleasant and light and the lotion is easily absorbed into the skin. I like that it is organic and natural without any harmful ingredients. The only reason I can give only 4 stars at this stage: it takes at least 30 days of use to see any firming action of a new lotion. I have only used this for about two weeks, so I cannot really say my skin has changed much in texture or firmness.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It feels great.  I mix it with the cocoa butter lotion to lessen the lemon smell a bit and it&#x27;s perfect.  I keep some at the office too.</li>
            <li> i bought this lotion because it contains lemongrass, which helps to prevent mosquito bites naturally and so far it has been very effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start out by saying a good lotion absorbs quickly, is lightly scented to no scent, and well... moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of lotions lately as I moved from a very humid climate to a mountain state with low humidity. This is the only lotion that has helped me keep sane. Dry cracked skin on my back was almost enough to make me go crazy haha. This stuff helped in spades and smells good and not girly at all. I&#x27;m a guy so that was a major plus to me. I&#x27;d be floored if you bought this and didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Great value and works good too!</li>
            <li> Pros:  - low price for natural ingredients and no \\&quot;sulfates, cruelty, parabens, gluten, or synthetic fragrances\\&quot;  - surprised to notice somewhat of an actual firming effect  - feel soft and smooth all day without feeling greasy    Cons (but not really):  - there would be more pros if I could remember to apply this every day (doh!)  - the smell is a little strong, not TOO strong, but also unique. If you&#x27;re picky about scents or you&#x27;re not in the mood for it, this lotion might not be your thing. I&#x27;m a guy and I like it just fine.  - this is not one of those lotions where I feel \\&quot;a little goes a long way.\\&quot; That may just be me. It&#x27;s thick. And I need at least a little &#x27;glob&#x27; to cover a large area. If this were $20 that would lower my rating. But at $10, still a good value.  - lotion can feel &#x27;heavy&#x27; (but not greasy) when applied generously. After applying to full body, sometimes I feel more prone to heat/sweat.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! I love that it is organic and good for my skin and my body! I even use it is facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Mmmmm.... so I bought this completely on a whim at Whole Foods one day. I shop at Whole Foods about twice a year, and needed some lotion, and I was in a hurry so I just picked something pretty at eye level. Only when I got it home did I see that it is meant to have &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; properties. Great, I thought, that means it probably lacks &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; properties. It might even sting. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the lotion hydrated just fine and I got used to using it and forgot about the firming part. Until one day I put on a dress that, when I&#x27;d worn it previously, I was a little self-conscious of how much of my less-than-perfectly-smooth thighs were showing. Only this time... the thighs looked okay. Heck, actually, the thighs looked pretty good, considering I&#x27;d done not one single lunge or mile on the treadmill since the last time I&#x27;d checked them out in this dress. What the - ... and then I remembered I&#x27;d been &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; my legs with this lotion for the better part of a month. Sweet! Buying another bottle post haste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the missing star? I don&#x27;t like the smell. I mean, it&#x27;s not horrid or I wouldn&#x27;t be smearing it on my body every day, but it&#x27;s not my favorite. Dull citrusy grassy with a funky undertone. Still... WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and a good price for a truly natural product.  Better in the colder months, as it is a little thick.  Nice lemongrass scent, but if you&#x27;re not sure about the scent you can order it unscented.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells great and keeps my skin moisturized well.</li>
            <li> Feels great. I would purchase again. Note for people w very dry skin... It doesn&#x27;t have enough moisturizing for me, I put moisturizer over his product.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of organic firming lotion. I have been looking for something like this for awhile and I was very excited to get this in the mail after ordering it. It goes on very light and is sooooo moisturizing. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far so  Ican&#x27;t speak to its firming effects, but I really don&#x27;t care for the scent. It started out as lemony and then it turns into a kind of sour-smelling scent after a minute or two and I really don&#x27;t like that at all. I might just spray body spray over it before it dries so I don&#x27;t smell weird.</li>
            <li> The scent is really nice. Nice weight to it and you don&#x27;t need a lot to do the job.</li>
            <li> I love other Acure lotions but I have to say this one did not impress me. I don&#x27;t know about the firming qualities of the product because I wasn&#x27;t really looking for that, I just wanted to try out the fragrance. It&#x27;s the fragrance that spoils it for me. It&#x27;s diappointing as I usually like lemongrass.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the way this stuff smells on my skin. Very subtle yet, lasts for hours. That&#x27;s why I was really bummed to find that it was the cause of a rash that I had for several months over this past winter. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the lemongrass or what--same thing with the conditioner. Had to throw it all out.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I&#x27;m always looking for lotions without parabens or chemicals. This lemongrass one smells so clean and fresh.  Not only that, it is not cheap and watery like some lotions can be. It really moisturizes and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  Smells clean and natural and feels awesome on the skin.  My children love it too.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, so I have tried all the typical creams Lubriderm, Dave , etc. I could no believe this cream after aplying a cuple of times!!! the cream is easy to apply, no greasy and absorb fast. Even if I don&#x27;t apply every day my skin will stay incredibly soft.and smooth.</li>
            <li> Its a good lotion, light and non greasy. I could give this a 5 star but the smell is weird.. Kinda herbal like smell.. Everytime i apply this my husband would complain that i smell bad! Lol</li>
            <li> Natural, organic, smells awesome and does a great job! And it absorbs quickly! What more could I ask for??</li>
            <li> Love this product! I love the smell (so clean) and it goes on without a greasy feeling. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I use it on my arms and have noticed a big difference in moisture and firmness. It lasts all day and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> I love the light lemongrass scent of this lotion. And it is very hydrating. It sells out frequently from my local organic grocery store because it is so popular.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the scent, meh...</li>
            <li> It is really different from other lotions , it scene friendly and can be applied into face. Hot country like india where humidity is about 99% , there it absorbs quickly . It&#x27;s a truly balanced organic.</li>
            <li> I normally love this lotion, but the tube I received seems old or maybe it was stored in heat because it smells like old oil instead of the normal amazing lemongrass scent. Which is disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped in a timely manor though.</li>
            <li> Really love the way all of the Acure products feel on my skin. I used this throughout my first pregnancy at the recommendation of a friend who did not use it until her second pregnancy and was wondering how effective the product actually was since she had no point of reference. I still had slight stretch marks and saggy skin after birth, but nowhere near as bad as I was anticipating and it&#x27;s infinitely less than what she had experienced herself. Either way, I&#x27;m very happy with it and continue to use it at least every other day for general moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, but leaves little sticky white bits on your skin.  I would not recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I really liked how this smelled, it was moistruizing but not enough for my very dry skin.  Didn&#x27;t see any firming from it even after using three tubes.  Feel like I gave it a fair shot but it just wasn&#x27;t moistruizing enough to do the trick.</li>
            <li> LOVE Acure product. This lotion and scent are my favorite body lotion. Softens so well and I think it improves my skin.</li>
            <li> I really respect this brand because their ingredients are top notch and their formulas are clearly put together with care. I absolutely love the lemongrass products because the aroma is fantastic--subtle, not overwhelming, and extremely calming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very light lotion that blends in without leaving a greasy feeling. I keep it in a little silicone bottle in my purse at all times for my chapped hands in the winter, and I use it all over after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACURE IS AN A+++++++ ETHICAL COMPANY: no harmful chemicals snuck into their formulas!!!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;ll admit I am an Acure addict, I wish they made everything like deodarent,toothpaste etc. however since they don&#x27;t yet I will continue to buy what they do. These are the real deal, a plant based lotion that is very hydrating. It smells incredible. Buy it you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s no Avalon Organic&#x27;s....it&#x27;s a nice lotion, but doesn&#x27;t have the properties I was really looking for. It&#x27;s not firming and it&#x27;s not light, so it takes a while to rub it in all the way.  It&#x27;s heavier, which I don&#x27;t like, especially in summer when if I sweat the lotions like this tend to make me feel sticky in less than ten minutes...I won&#x27;t be going back...</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance. Unsurpassed moisturizing. I ordered a second tube so I&#x27;d have one at home and one at work!</li>
            <li> its okay, smell is okay, did not notice firming or extra hydration</li>
            <li> As a product it works well. But I can&#x27;t get past the smell. To me, it smells like how you smell after sitting around a campfire. Which isn&#x27;t a bad smell, just not what I want to smell like all the time.</li>
            <li> As a nurse, I am washing my hands constantly. I will leave work with very dry hands, and sometimes even cracking. I&#x27;ve tried several lotions and creams, but so far I am most pleased with this one. I am a big fan of Acure products in general. I love that their products are chemical free, are mostly organic, and seem to be effective for my skin. This product is no exception. I now have a bottle of this at work, and notice my hands will stay soft even after several washings. I make sure to apply again before leaving for home as I&#x27;ve noticed then my hands will be smooth and soft for the rest of the day. Oh, and the smell is amazing!! I have also tried the mandarin orange, and although I love that smell as well, I have greater fondness for the lemongrass.</li>
            <li> Gone in two uses, but smelled ok</li>
            <li> I love it smooth real nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D. Thomas</li>
            <li> I love everything about this.  I have been looking for a good natural lotion.  I bought this in my local health food store and I can&#x27;t believe how fantastic it is.  First and most importantly - the ingredients are fantastic and absolutely nothing harmful and the fact that they are also organic is the cherry on top.  Second - it makes my skin sooo soft.  Finally - I love the smell.  In my quest for eliminating chemicals as much as possible from  my life, I have tried many natural lotions and beauty products.  Some have been ok but usually they still have some questionable ingredients or the smell is not good or they just don&#x27;tdo the job.  My search is finally over and I hope Acure never stops making this.</li>
            <li> Great natural and plant based ingredients.  It is really hydrating and smells amazing!!! I really wasn&#x27;t expecting it to do much in the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; department but after a few weeks of use I was pleasantly surprised to find that my skin appeared brighter and tighter.  I wish I would have taken pictures but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting a difference. I only bought it for the hydrating effects. :)</li>
            <li> I have only been using this about two week and can&#x27;t say whether if firms or not as it takes a month for any product to show results.  But I love the smell and it absorbs quickly.  I am not usually a person who buys fragranced lotions, but this one smells divine!</li>
            <li> Phenomenal! Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and the price is cheap! I have bought 5 of them already and given as gifts as well as having one at each of my homes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the scent - too grassy for me.  Provides excellent moisture.  Would purchase other moisturizers by this brand.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent daily lotion. The consistency resembles that of your standard lotion, but this particular lotion seems to be more moisturizing than numerous others I have used. The ingredient list is also quite impressive! The only thing that I&#x27;m not particularly fond of is the scent. I&#x27;m typically not put off by lemongrass scented products, but this one is a little too strong for my liking. To me, the concoction is more reminiscent of freshly mown grass and herbs. It is not a horrible smell by any means; it just wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting. With that being said, the smell itself in no way affects the performance of the lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion...it is a little pricey but it&#x27;s a nice thick organic lotion filled with all kinds of nutrients, including Argon oil, which are touted as being able to revitalize the elasticity in you epidermis...we&#x27;ll see on that one, but hope springs eternal.</li>
            <li> The scent is alright but the lotion is nice and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love how my hands feel!</li>
            <li> Nice cream, not perfect, but this in on the good side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a quality natural lotion that had a pleasant scent as well as a strong moisturizing ability.  This lotion provides both.  The pleasant lemongrass fragrance is so refreshing and my skin feels amazing.  I will try more of the Acure products hoping I&#x27;ll be equally as satisfied with them!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion. I love that the ingredients are organic and good for your skin.  I love the smell and the feel of it.  It hydrates well. I&#x27;m glad I found that I can get this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I ordered it twice. I would give it 5 stars, but I&#x27;m not 100% in love with the smell. It&#x27;s ok, just not perfect for my body, I do like how it makes my skin feel, that&#x27;s why I ordered more. So you may love the smell and the feel!</li>
            <li> This is the one moisturizer my extremely sensitive skin actually likes! I have soft hands for the first time in years. Thank you, Acure!</li>
