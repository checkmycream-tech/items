            <li> Not too strong, not too weak.</li>
            <li> I thought the parfume large in fact small portion.</li>
            <li> The bottle is to too small, but I really like it</li>
            <li> A waste of money smell like old women perfume</li>
            <li> The scent lasts as long as it takes to dry.</li>
            <li> You would have to catch the scent while wet to know if you like it.</li>
            <li> This is the cutest little bottle.  </li>
            <li> This is a little bottle</li>

            <li> Now I didn&#x27;t grasp how small this was until it came in the mail.</li>
            <li> I used a small leftover piece of wrapping paper to wrap it!</li>
            <li> The bottle is very small, 2.5&amp;#34; or so tall, with .13oz.  </li>
            <li> Wish it were a bit less expensive!</li>
            <li> Nobody is going to complain about the sickening smell of perfume with this one.</li>

            <li> I bought this as a sample for my wife to try it out and she love it.</li>
            <li> Not for the price of $10. I will not be ordering any additional perfume at that price.</li>
            <li> OMG yes yes yes!!! I will always say yes to this fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> I thought the parfume large in fact small portion. A bit dissapointed with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I t is ok, but its not as strong as I  would have like it to be</li>
            <li> This is the cutest little bottle.  The scent is very sophisticated and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about this one.</li>
            <li> It is smells like Viva la Juicy. Anyways i liked it. But Versace Bright Cristal is still best!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! I see people complaining about the size, yes it is small, but it is better to do it this way, because what if you sont like the smell? I love it, so now i own a large bottle!  smell lasts most of the day, small re apply in mid afternoon ans you&#x27;re good!</li>
            <li> Great smell but really small bottle</li>

            <li> I was totally satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> I Love it, I will buy some more.</li>
            <li> Made 3 attempts on contacting the seller.  Received PIYO Baby Nail Scissors instead of the Versace Woman by Versace.  After 3 attempts the order has not been corrected.  My wife can use the perfume and not the baby scissors.  We are both senior citizens and have no desire to have anymore rug rats.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delightful and light.  Nobody is going to complain about the sickening smell of perfume with this one.</li>
            <li> You would have to catch the scent while wet to know if you like it. The scent lasts as long as it takes to dry. Go to a dept. store to try. These sm. trial bottles are not the same prod. I would nvr buy another one.</li>
            <li> Light and lovely fragrance. I love the size you can have high end perfume for little money and allowing you to try many different fragrances for the price of one.</li>
            <li> The bottle is to too small, but I really like it</li>

            <li> Smell unbelievably but the $10.00 I think that was a rip off but I like it.</li>
            <li> I receive so many compliments whenever I wear this. Will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> This scent is deliciously incredible!!</li>
            <li> Just arrived today.  It smells so good.  I feel like a rich woman.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Nice smell but not my fac</li>
            <li> Loved this scent back in the day and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. This is a little bottle but I&#x27;ll buy a bigger one when I get some more money</li>
            <li> very nice perfume.  The bottle is very small, 2.5&amp;#34; or so tall, with .13oz.  Good for trying a scent you&#x27;ve not had before, without investing a lot of money. light floral with hints of musk.  My husband likes it, I guess that is the important thing :)</li>
            <li> Came on time.  Smells good.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for her.  It is low priced because it is teeny tiny.  But what do you want for $6.99, right?  I couldn&#x27;t find it at Macys.  I guess it is a discontinued item.</li>
            <li> If your taking a chance on this perfume, you will be inlove. Perfect for a young mature women with class. I wear to work, and perfect for impressing. Goes well with every setting. Not too strong, not too weak. If you are the perfect medium type of gal, this is the one. I also Recomend Gucci bright crystal aswell.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume. He bought this scent when we were dating. We are soon to get married and I had to have it for the wedding day.</li>
            <li> it was early than i expected. enjoy thanks</li>
            <li> 7 dollars for a .16oz bottle. Now I didn&#x27;t grasp how small this was until it came in the mail. I used a small leftover piece of wrapping paper to wrap it! It fits in your hand pretty much! The box was pristine, I didn&#x27;t open it in fear I&#x27;d rip it or something. This product was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered it on Nov 23rd and it came in the mail within a week or so. I have found another website that offers better prices for perfumes though.</li>
            <li> I love to have the same perfume that I use on a daily basis in my travel bag.  Great product.</li>
            <li> A waste of money smell like old women perfume</li>
            <li> Smells very nice, but too small</li>
