            <li>This set are soooo gorgeous</li>
            <li>if you want a knockoff of the opi color paints without committing to full size bottles, this is awesome.</li>
            <li>The mini pack was also the perfect choice because I got four color variations at cheaper price than it would of have been to purchase each color full size.</li>
            <li>Although have used Opi products happily for years, this one isn&#x27;t one of their better ones</li>

            <li>The outcome is a nice pastel mani.</li>
            <li>the colors are pastel and look so nice</li>
            <li>I use these to change the shades of polishes as well as to create my own &amp;#34;jelly&amp;#34; looks without paying for a jelly polish.  </li>
            <li>They apply very nicely, and they&#x27;re perfect for summer time when you just want a sheer amount of color.</li>
            <li>Super fun and great price!</li>
            <li>This set is a great way to try the colors before buying a large bottle.</li>
            <li>Really cute poslishes</li>
            <li>These mini sizes were perfect for me, because I got to try all the sheer tint colors for the price of one.</li>
            <li>I think is ok</li>
            <li>Love, love, love these tints.  </li>
            <li>you can use more than one coat to intensify the tint.</li>
            <li>so glad I found these</li>
            <li>All four OPI tints are so cute and so versatile.</li>
            <li>so I was glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I enjoy these!</li>
            <li>Love how you can layer for lighter or darker shades of color.</li>
            <li>Be sure to watch some videos online to know how to do it.</li>
            <li>Plus, you can also create beautiful shades by layering the deferent colors for new shades.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t do a whole lot, color wise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to any lacquerista who is looking for an easy way to expand their nail polish options.</li>
            <li>As for the polish itself, like most topcoats, it dries quickly, which can make it tricky to work with because of</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re layerable so you can choose how deep you want the tint, and they work great for pastel nail art.</li>
            <li>Thanks opi!!!</li>
            <li>I own both, no regrets on either, though I prefer the Sally Hansen line a litttle bit more.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, shiny and looks very pretty!</li>
            <li>Also, because these are more an artistic/accent polish, a smaller brush would have been nice anyway.</li>
            <li>and I will be purchasing the full size versions.</li>
            <li>so I think it was worth</li>
            <li>OPI has been one of my most favorite and trusted brands, and these colored topcoats were a nice fresh twist on the plain clear one.</li>
            <li>Peels off right after applied.  </li>
            <li>Did it&#x27;s job, I&#x27;m very pleased with all of these polishes but the pink.</li>
            <li>Love these tints...a softer but refined look and a lasting manicure.</li>
            <li>The 2nd coat added more depth to the color.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>The colors are gorgeous, and the possibilities for design endless, so it still deserves a high rating.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable and the colors are so pretty.</li>
            <li>Nice little bottles of polish.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>Love the purple and pink.  </li>
            <li>if you miss a spot, you can&#x27;t move the polish around to even it out because it dries so quick, and you easily wind up with uneven tinting.</li>
            <li>These were a bit more expensive than most OPI mini sets, but the sheer jelly formula is unique</li>
            <li>And here I am, about to buy another set because I use them far too much, still!</li>
            <li>As described, this product leaves a lovely little tint on your nails.  </li>
            <li>you know if you want to buy the normal size</li>
            <li>Really fun to do different styles of manicures with these tinted topcoats.</li>
            <li>I threw them away because it wasn&#x27;t worth shipping back.</li>
            <li>Gave it a new look.</li>
            <li>I like them very much but only like to use them for nail art, not as a stand alone color.</li>
            <li>with their problems, I am in love with this line and it&#x27;s hard to resist using them waaaay too often.</li>
            <li>The brushes are full size but the bottles are mini, which makes it difficult to get them back in the bottle easily.</li>
            <li>Even used alone they make a pretty tint on your nails (especially the pink polish).</li>
            <li>Nice colors, a little thick it has to be applied fast in order it don&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li>The small bottles go pretty quickly, since the amount you apply is thicker than average polish.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>These are very sheet tints and add a little bit of color on the natural nail.  </li>

            <li> These are very sheet tints and add a little bit of color on the natural nail.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, there are two major sheer jelly lines - this line from OPI, which released in March 2014... and Sally Hansen&#x27;s Palm Beach Jellies, a limited release in the summer of 2014.</li>
            <li> The pink was super thick and gloopy, and the brush was distressed and distorted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the violet color so far, and put it over a dark sparkly charcoal gray.  </li>
            <li> They are thick (thicker depending on which of the four shades you use), and over time, the bottles get stringy faster than most other jelly polishes, so it can be difficult but the formula is mostly self-leveling which makes them very forgiving with streaks and the unfortunate stringy bits.</li>
            <li> Can be used over each other for a cellophane effect or over nail polish that you want to personalize and get a specific color.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this particular mini-kit in stores</li>
            <li> I have a pink glitter polish that I put the violet color over.</li>
            <li> I will be buying the pink separately.</li>
            <li> I have also used the pink (2 coats) over a base coat and it gave my nails a healthy pink glow.</li>
            <li> Once I use the other colors I may also buy them, as it gives a lot of versatility to a manicure.</li>
            <li> You can apply them over a white base or a coloured base (or even bare nails) with great results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to experiment these colors with more base colors.</li>
            <li> (The SH Palm Beaches have the same self-leveling formula but are slightly less thick)</li>
            <li> It changes the color ever so slightly.  </li>
            <li> It changed the color from charcoal to slight purple.  </li>
            <li> However, I find the price a little steep for the size (and thus the 4 stars).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize they were small sample bottles.  </li>
            <li> Sticky, hard to apply, doesn&#x27;t work well for nail art projects.</li>
            <li> Tried to use them very thick and goopy.</li>
            <li> in white base</li>
            <li> I like OPI but was not impressed by the colors or quality.</li>
            <li> HATE them.</li>

            <li> Love these! I made the prettiest watercolor design.</li>
            <li> Meh. Peels off right after applied.  Arrived on time.  Would use seller again.  Although have used Opi products happily for years, this one isn&#x27;t one of their better ones</li>
            <li> Did it&#x27;s job, I&#x27;m very pleased with all of these polishes but the pink. The pink was super thick and gloopy, and the brush was distressed and distorted. Thankfully I already had that one from a birchbox sample.</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, I guess maybe I just don&#x27;t see the point in them. They don&#x27;t do a whole lot, color wise.</li>
            <li> Really cute poslishes</li>
            <li> Wonderful for using with nail stamping, to add a bit of colour to flowers or do a stained glass effect.</li>

            <li> These are too watery and are not up to OPI standard I feel.HATE them.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, a little thick it has to be applied fast in order it don&#x27;t dry. The outcome is a nice pastel mani.</li>

            <li> This set are soooo gorgeous the colors are pastel and look so nice&lt;br /&gt;special in white base BUT they are soooo TINY I think is ok because&lt;br /&gt;let you know if you want to buy the normal size</li>
            <li> Tried to use them very thick and goopy. Going to put polish thinner hoping that will help and try again.</li>

            <li> Nice little bottles of polish. Really fun to do different styles of manicures with these tinted topcoats.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! they remind me of the wet and wild polishes of the 80&#x27;s. you can use more than one coat to intensify the tint. so glad I found these and I will be purchasing the full size versions.</li>
            <li> Peels off within a day.  I threw them away because it wasn&#x27;t worth shipping back.</li>

            <li> The best!!! Thanks opi!!!</li>
            <li> Fast service. Love the purple and pink.  Can wear the orange soon for Halloween\!</li>
            <li> I like these as they allow you to put some color on your nail design after you have already stamped, etc. Be sure to watch some videos online to know how to do it. However, I find the price a little steep for the size (and thus the 4 stars). Afterwords, I found out how to do a DIY version of these and it gives the same results.</li>
