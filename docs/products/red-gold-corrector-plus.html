            <li>I love this stuff and what most people need to understand is that it works the best in you hair dye, only add it to shampoo to prevent brassiness afterwards.</li>
            <li>does a better job</li>
            <li>It came out ok</li>
            <li>Great to help with getting the gold and red tones.</li>

            <li>a darker red hers more lighter than mine</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My natural color is a cool tone, somewhere between dark blond and light brown.</li>
            <li>Brought out a lot of orange to a more a blonde look, but still has orangeish tinge in the back of my hair.</li>
            <li>My significant other has stopped using this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am thinking that the red gold corrector worked a little better but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try both.</li>
            <li>but mine was dark brown with dark red hightlights and more light red at the roots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that after a few more washes the red with wash out or fade like it has for others.</li>
            <li>Also when it comes out so easy when i open the packet half spilled away.  </li>
            <li>But the end result was a true dark blond, without the yellow tones or greenish cast.</li>
            <li>I added it to light blond and didn&#x27;t have a hint of the usual brassy or red tones.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always gone a couple of shades lighter or darker, but now I want to get back to my natural color.</li>
            <li>last night I added 1 packet of unred to about 2 ounces of my conditioner for color treated hair after I shampooed hair so my hair was pretty wet when i applied.</li>
            <li>It looks less red and less brassy and more ashy.</li>
            <li>So, on a whim I added this to my usual brand of hair color (in a neutral, dark blond), and at first I was a little nervous because it turned the product a bright pink!</li>
            <li>I was in Sally&#x27;s the other day and was recommend to use this with a conditioning or shampoo treatment to see if it would pull out the unwanted red and brass still in my hair after using ash blonde and cool blonde hair colors for a few months.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get my hair back to a medium blonde for about five months now, but it&#x27;s been stuck in a perpetual state of dark strawberry blonde.</li>
            <li> and I put it on my DRY hair with just a touch of water to get it smoothed through.</li>
            <li> Purchased at the price listed because it made sense for it to be a box like the picture since they run for $1 at the store but turned out to be a single package.</li>
            <li> It is a single use packet</li>
            <li> The liquid in this packet is such a dark purple dye.</li>
            <li> I never needed to use the the other half of the packet, the orange tinge slowly washed compltely out after first use of this product.</li>
            <li> I have extra light blonde hair, and off of a whim, decided to dye it dark brown because I was sick of it.</li>
            <li> Although my hair was still wet when I went to bed</li>
            <li> it starts to turn red after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> when bleaching my hair, i always get 3 small ardell red gold corrector plus to add to it.</li>
            <li> Bought this and mixed half packet with small amount of thick conditioner and left in hair for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for ages, but for the past few years my hair just hasn&#x27;t reacting the same when I color it.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Seriously this is ONE tiny square pouch.</li>
            <li> the size (125oz) and the price not fit for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because we have hard water, or my hair has changed since having kids, but it&#x27;s become impossible to get my color right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this always happens.  </li>
            <li> Dyed my hair 4 days ago along with my daughters hair which was a dirty blonde.</li>
            <li> I thought would be a box of 4 at least for price.  </li>
            <li> Dyed my dark dirty blond hair lighter with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I was not happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Sorry, I forgot to.</li>
            <li> Silly me...</li>

            <li> when bleaching my hair, i always get 3 small ardell red gold corrector plus to add to it. it makes my hair a wonderful blond. and never leaves my hair reddish or orange. it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Dyed my dark dirty blond hair lighter with [[ASIN:B001EXL5S8 L&#x27;Oreal Superior Preference Dream Blonde Hair Color, 9A Light Ash Blonde]] and it turned darn orange that never got better with repeated washes. Bought this and mixed half packet with small amount of thick conditioner and left in hair for 15 minutes. Brought out a lot of orange to a more a blonde look, but still has orangeish tinge in the back of my hair. Will repeat again with rest of packet in a week or so, leave in longer, and update results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Sorry, I forgot to. I never needed to use the the other half of the packet, the orange tinge slowly washed compltely out after first use of this product. Bought time to dye my hair again, will remember this product just in case I have another orange result. Directions say to add TO the bottle of dye before dyeing, but I&#x27;d be scared to. The liquid in this packet is such a dark purple dye.</li>
            <li> Purchased at the price listed because it made sense for it to be a box like the picture since they run for $1 at the store but turned out to be a single package. Silly me...</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works.  Use it all and give it am extra 5 or 10 minutes. I added it to light blond and didn&#x27;t have a hint of the usual brassy or red tones.  Recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for ages, but for the past few years my hair just hasn&#x27;t reacting the same when I color it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because we have hard water, or my hair has changed since having kids, but it&#x27;s become impossible to get my color right. My natural color is a cool tone, somewhere between dark blond and light brown. I&#x27;ve always gone a couple of shades lighter or darker, but now I want to get back to my natural color. The problem is, if I use a neutral tone, it results in unflattering yellow tones... but if I use a cool or ash tone, my hair takes on a greenish cast. So, on a whim I added this to my usual brand of hair color (in a neutral, dark blond), and at first I was a little nervous because it turned the product a bright pink! But the end result was a true dark blond, without the yellow tones or greenish cast.</li>
            <li> I used Loreal Dark Golden Brown which I&#x27;ve went dark before but not with Loreal. First off buy a better brand. Nice and Easy has worked better for me in the past. Dyed my hair 4 days ago along with my daughters hair which was a dirty blonde. Both of us had the same problem it went a darker red hers more lighter than mine but mine was dark brown with dark red hightlights and more light red at the roots. I was not happy. I did a lot of research yesterday with the Ardell Unred and Ardell Red Gold Correcter Plus trying to see the difference and maybe what it would do for me. I said why not and went to the local Sallys Beauty Supply and bought both products. (You can&#x27;t get the .25 bottle of unred at Sallys just the packets).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So last night I added 1 packet of unred to about 2 ounces of my conditioner for color treated hair after I shampooed hair so my hair was pretty wet when i applied. I let it set 30 minutes and then rinsed it out. Although my hair was still wet when I went to bed it didn&#x27;t look much different. This morning I woke up and decided to try the Ardell Red Gold Correcter Plus. I used a 3 minute deep conditioner (3oz or so) with about 30 drops of the correcter and I put it on my DRY hair with just a touch of water to get it smoothed through. I let it set 30 minutes, rinsed it out, dryed it and straightened it. AND I CAN tell a difference. It looks less red and less brassy and more ashy. I think if your using this stuff (either one) as a correcter instead of adding it to your dye then it will take some time and more than one treatment. I am thinking that the red gold corrector worked a little better but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try both.</li>
            <li> Great to help with getting the gold and red tones. I use this to mix with my lightener and developer but coloring my hair blonde.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and what most people need to understand is that it works the best in you hair dye, only add it to shampoo to prevent brassiness afterwards. Also, buy it at Sally&#x27;s, the packets are a dollar and you can get a bottle for five dollars that I have used three times already and I still have plenty left. This stuff makes my hair wonderful, I&#x27;ve been fighting brass forever and this makes it a beautiful ash color.</li>
            <li> Did not get the red out!</li>
            <li> Temporary purple hair dye, that&#x27;s all it is. My significant other has stopped using this stuff. She didn&#x27;t even finish the one oz. bottle.</li>
            <li> I was disappoint with this product, it did not work for me. If you have longer hair you would need to by 10 of those. Also when it comes out so easy when i open the packet half spilled away.  Keep with Shimmer Lights does a better job</li>
            <li> I have extra light blonde hair, and off of a whim, decided to dye it dark brown because I was sick of it. I&#x27;ve been trying to get my hair back to a medium blonde for about five months now, but it&#x27;s been stuck in a perpetual state of dark strawberry blonde. I was in Sally&#x27;s the other day and was recommend to use this with a conditioning or shampoo treatment to see if it would pull out the unwanted red and brass still in my hair after using ash blonde and cool blonde hair colors for a few months. I used two of these packets in a conditioning treatment that I left on my head for an hour. The only difference is that the highlifts I had done about two months ago are finally visible, but I still have tons of red tone in my hair. I&#x27;m hoping that after a few more washes the red with wash out or fade like it has for others. Will update if this happens but I&#x27;m not holding my breath since my hair is pretty difficult to color in the first place</li>
            <li> I would like to return. I already have this product from a local beauty supply dealer. Thanks</li>
            <li> I time use. It did not keep all BRASS out of hair.  Still had to use another product.  Seriously this is ONE tiny square pouch. I thought would be a box of 4 at least for price.  But it&#x27;s ONE!!!</li>
            <li> I paid about $5.98 for .125oz this product, including shipping.  This is not worth the money.  It is a single use packet and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference afterwards.  I have light brown hair that I dye a darker brown color.  No matter whether it is a warm color or cool color, the outcome is always the same...it starts to turn red after a few weeks.  I&#x27;m not sure why this always happens.  I bought this product to try to take the red it - like the product promises.  It did not do this.  There was no difference after use of this packet.  Maybe i need to use for multiple shampoos, but I&#x27;ll find something more cost effective.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product i ever used</li>
            <li> the size (125oz) and the price not fit for me.</li>
            <li> I thought it worked.  But, only for 1 day.  I had to redye. It came out ok</li>
