    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Absolutly the best electric toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The rechargeable Oral-B ProfessionalCare 7000 series toothbrushes are the best value when it comes to electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>An excellent choice.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very impressed.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is awesome.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Almost.....because nothing is perfect.  </li>
            <li>This really is an excellent brush.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:&lt;br /&gt;Consumer Reports has ranked Oral-B as being the best electronic tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>The results: the dentist said I have perfect teeth and gums today!</li>
            <li>It would be perfect.</li>
            <li>With the price of dental care, this brush is a very good investment.</li>
            <li>I like the oral b line, had very good luck with them.  </li>
            <li>My guess is that I&#x27;ll get a good review from my dentist also!</li>
            <li>I think it is a great product.</li>
            <li>- my hygenist was commenting on how my gums looked great and that I had NO plaque (except a teensy bit on one tooth).</li>
            <li>I had an Interplaque electric toothbrush, which was great.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this model.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is a great buy!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;BR&gt;1.</li>
            <li>great for taking care of the gums.</li>
            <li>great buy, and i am now a believer of electronic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush:</li>
            <li>And it feels great.</li>
            <li>But for now my brush is working great.  </li>
            <li>Not any more!!</li>
            <li>Ergonomic design, the relief after brushing, the timer and the autostop feature in case of overpressure on your gums are all very nice.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing brush!</li>
            <li>Is this particular model the best or even the best value?  </li>
            <li>if the set price averages out to about $5 a head, that&#x27;s a good value.)</li>
            <li>This is a good toothbrush and you won&#x27;t have to buy replacements for the 6-10 months.  </li>
            <li>I had no idea that it was so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for 9 months now and it&#x27;s been wicked good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say this though, no simple/manual toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned does as good of a job</li>
            <li>It feels like a quality product and is a good balance of price and features.  </li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>The timer function is good, and saves time because you don&#x27;t need to over brush.  </li>
            <li>it a five because my husband is delighted with it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sonicare is a good brush.  </li>
            <li>I just never felt I was getting a good brush.    </li>
            <li>There were so many good reviews when I bought it that I thought it must be great.  </li>
            <li>love this works great.</li>
            <li>I still own this device and it is still running good.</li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this one doesn&#x27;t have that two minute timer built in, I know when to stop brushing my teeth!  </li>
            <li>I had my first dentist appointment since using the brush about a week ago and it was the best appointment of my life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now, and it still holds it charge, and the magic doesn&#x27;t stop! &lt;</li>
            <li>First off, I must say this is the best electronic brush I have used to date.</li>
            <li>This is one of those purchases -- like my iPod, my electric do-it-yourself hair clipper, and my subscription to NetFlix -- that have made my life a lot more pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Technologically an amazing device .      </li>
            <li>Also a nice feature for me since I tend to short-change my brushing time.</li>
            <li>for over 2 yrs now and loving it since day one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery:  1 star (it seems every deluxe toothbrush out there</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just having that handy 30-second timer that keeps me brushing for 2 mins or whether it&#x27;s the 40,000+ pulses or what,</li>
            <li>I used to own a brush from another manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>If you have a full family you&#x27;re shopping for, this is a great starter set.</li>
            <li>Your teeth will feel marvelous, your smile will be brighter, and your gums tremendously more healthy.</li>
            <li>This cleans great, and its true...</li>
            <li>Believe me, you don&#x27;t want to be able to see it from your bedroom if it&#x27;s charging at night - it makes for a kind of strobe-light effect.</li>
            <li>and so far thinks its wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper and more effective.  </li>
            <li>This light is so bright that it keeps me up at night.  </li>
            <li>It is so bright like there is a light saber in our bathroom.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a fairly nice looking unit and the brush storage is discreet but easy to access.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, nice looking and has a timing feature so that you can brush your teeth for the suggested 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I used another brand of power toothbrush before purchasing the 7850 model and I am really pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with this.  </li>
            <li>The dentist hygienist reccomended this, and I love the feel of my teeth afterwards, you know that its getting those tarter areas, etc.  </li>
            <li>more to say.</li>
            <li>but this kind of feels like the cheap $10 electric toothbrush you can buy at your drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I was sure she enjoyed using the drill on my tender gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>The spinning brush doesn&#x27;t do a better job either.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare costs more and is better.</li>
            <li>but I want to see if there is something better.  </li>
            <li>If you have any gum problems, or just like the feeling of teeth that have been thoroughly cleaned, you&#x27;re going to love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The built-in timer (one signal every 30 seconds for each quarter of your mouth, then another to tell you you&#x27;ve finished two minutes) helps you to make sure you brush your teeth sufficiently.  </li>
            <li>The power toothbrush works just as advertised, excellent and the extra cleaning brushes makes for an even better deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than satisfied with this product and will purchase another once this one dies.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I slacked off and didn&#x27;t floss _at all_ since I got the Oral B toothbrush...  </li>
            <li>and so I can tell you that having straighter teeth is definately more convenient while brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Yay flossing:)</li>
            <li>It just works better.....</li>
            <li>I LOVE this one.  </li>
            <li>With the four-part storage chamber for the brush heads, it has plenty of room to store for more than one user.</li>
            <li>and I love brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a compulsive brusher who routinely spends 3 or more minutes brushing 2 -3 times per day.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I now love &#x27;em.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found it...</li>
            <li>According to Braun, brushing for two minutes takes off about 25% more plaque than brushing for one minute, and I don&#x27;t doubt it.  </li>
            <li>, it is that you&#x27;ll have to make sure you brush over a sink as the power brush combined with toothpaste creates some foam.  </li>
            <li>If you are like me, then you have just returned from the dentist and have vowed to take better care of your teeth.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just more convenient and most of us are probably brushing incorrectly anyway.</li>
            <li>I use to focus more on brushing my teeth, but with this toothbrush it helps take care of the gum line too.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>but i assume that faster is better (?)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Improves staining:  3 stars (indifferent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clothing intact:  3 stars (dribble factor, always have to keep chin up and keep a kleenex at the ready)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  5 stars (most places charge $100.</li>
            <li>I used to have a Braun and was able to replace the battery by having one built at Batteries</li>
            <li>I used to have a Braun and was able to replace the battery by having one built at Batteries</li>
            <li>I like knowing I&#x27;m taking much better care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>The item arrived in a timely manner, in an undamaged box, and I am pleased with this order from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>It feels great when I brush and my teeth look much cleaner after using it.  </li>
            <li>I got this on recommendation from my dentist and boy am I so pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>At my age, you worry more about gums care than cavities.  </li>
            <li>However, my more practical husband does like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sold on this brush even if it does require more effort on my part.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife, used it once and haven&#x27;t been able to stop since.</li>
            <li>I have had it over a year and love it.</li>
            <li>The brush will not overcharge, unlike many rechargeable electronics, which allows you to keep it fully charged all the times without worrying about killing your battery life.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B, however, rests on top of a rod.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure about one thing.</li>
            <li>could have been better?</li>
            <li>My dentist told me my teeth had never looked better.  </li>
            <li>have also came to the conclusion that oral B toothbrushes even clean your teeth better as well!  </li>
            <li>Honestly, the best $80 I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li>This mode in particular is great and you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li>We love this new power toothbrush because it does a great job cleaning the teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a month now and have not noticed a change in my coloring, but my teeth do feel very clean and polished, in any case.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty bright...</li>
            <li>The brush itself cleaned effectively and quickly.</li>
            <li>The timer is most convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It just feels like it might break more easily.  </li>
            <li>For the most part I always use the medium setting on the toothbrush and that is comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the 7850DLX for about a week now, and so far I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>(Ideally, you want to use the softest brush possible to help avoid damaging your tooth enamel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re teeth will feel great, and your gums will surely be more healthy if you use this properly.</li>
            <li>But most importantly, you LOOK FORWARD to using this brush because it is A TOOTH MASSAGER.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great brush head for pediatric (and adult) mouths.</li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviews, I find that this toothbrush is excellent -- with one significant flaw.  </li>
            <li>If things like that bother you easily at night, then you will have to close the bathroom door if the bathroom opens into themaster bedroom.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product after reading so many great reviews.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this brush in Feb. and began noticing a difference very quickly after I began using it.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight, well-balanced, and easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>easy to use.&lt;BR&gt;4.</li>
            <li>not as satisfied when trying to clean my tongue and below the tongue.</li>
            <li>Oral-B/Braun guarantees that you will be satisfied with the results of this brush, and if you&#x27;re not - even after 2 years of use - they will give you a full refund.</li>
            <li>Reviews say the Oral-B toothbrush is comfortable and easy to use, although some testers complain that it&#x27;s a bit noisy.</li>
            <li>However, I found that sonicare with its large brush head was best for people with big mouth.</li>
            <li>But the specific brush is really great.</li>
            <li>The blinking light doesn&#x27;t bother me though, mine stays in the kitchen.  </li>
            <li>My teath feel so smooth after brushing with it</li>
            <li>What a wise investment for one of your most important personal hygiene needs.</li>
            <li>More important, on my last visit to the dentist, after having used the brush for around a month, I was praised for how good my teeth and gums looked.  </li>
            <li>LED light -</li>
            <li>It is ergonomically sound.</li>
            <li>And that is important considering that the battery cannot be replaced.&lt;BR&gt;5.</li>
            <li>, you can get a great deal on it in different ways.  </li>
            <li>For example, you can get the Braun 7526 refurbished razor with this brush ($50), and activate the $50 rebate, so you can get the razor for free.</li>
            <li>The LED light that blinks when the toothbrush is on the charger.  </li>
            <li>Ordering was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>My first electric toothbrush and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I believe even if you had slightly less perfect teeth the benefits of using the Oral B toothbrushes are still better than using just normal toothbrushes...</li>
            <li>The bright blue charging light blinks on and off all the time the unit is charging.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a two-minute timer (but no auto-shut-off) with 30-second beep to signal you to clean another area.</li>
            <li>Talk about getting your teeth really clean and gums treated well simultaneously.</li>
            <li>Great replacement for my old one that I paid almost twice as much for.</li>
            <li>The extra brusheads that come with the package are extremely useful, and might I add it makes the purchase a great value.  </li>
            <li>Almost dentist clean.</li>
            <li>Cleaning power - this can clean anything.</li>
            <li>and what there is you see and can immediately clean</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re considering an electronic brush over the old fashion kind, do it.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a regular brush and a neat tapered brush for between the teeth, which is almost as good as flossing.</li>
            <li>what he&#x27;ll say when I have my next appointment, but I expect that he will have good things to say.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I really like to \\&quot;blue\\&quot; indicator charging light!</li>
            <li>It really makes your gums feel much better.</li>
            <li>make the most of your brushing minutes each day and save yourself a lot of problems down the road and keep that smile dazzling.</li>
            <li>As I expected, this new Braun toothbrush is wonderful.</li>
            <li>The reason why i believe this is an important feature is because at 40,000 rpm&#x27;s you don&#x27;t know exactly how much pressure is ok to use with the Oral B.</li>
            <li>fresh and so clean clean\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>which cues you to an adequate amount of time to brush your teeth per quadrant.</li>
            <li>I tried one of the FlexiSoft Brushheads, but quickly switched to a separately purchased Oral B Power Polisher head EB 18-3 (3 pack).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You are better off sticking with a normal toothbrush or trying another brand.  </li>
            <li>The various brushes are great - didn&#x27;t think I would use more than 1 or 2, but after trying all four, I see their individual benefit.  </li>
            <li>Cleans in between teeth better than a normal toothbrush, but should not be considered a substitute to flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Instead of making the light blink on and off when it&#x27;s charging, they should have made it so a light stays on steadily, and shuts off when it&#x27;s charged.  </li>
            <li>just be sure to clean that area out frequently as you do not want to keep use a toothbrush that has a bunch of bacteria on it.&lt;BR&gt;2.</li>
            <li>and I love my new one.</li>
            <li>I suspect almost any electric toothbrush is pretty good, if you use it regularly for a couple of minutes each night.  </li>
            <li>The small head is the perfect size to get all your teeth and not take up too much space in your mouth.</li>
            <li>So the new toothbrush has been a good thing as far as that goes - I just have to hold it against my teeth</li>
            <li>The plaque really came off, and my teeth felt smooth to the tongue.</li>
            <li>Not so sure I would have spent such a great deal of money for a TOOTHBRUSH.  </li>
            <li>It cleans very well and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Ever bit worth the price</li>
            <li>The expected \\&quot;useful life\\&quot; of the \\&quot;product\\&quot; is not hinted at in the manual, except that the warranty is good for 24 months.  </li>
            <li>In fact many times I have to go over my teeth with a normal toothbrush if I have just eaten, or I have to rinse first.      </li>
            <li>So far it is much much better.  </li>
            <li>even after flossing many times a week, for weeks in a row, my gums would still be ultra sensitive.</li>
            <li>I also have my own personal dentist now.</li>
            <li>This thing is so powerful it feels like a dental scaler.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel fresh.  </li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;d give this a handicapped total of 4 stars since I believe that some of my ratings would apply to any brand/type of deluxe toothbrush out</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;d give this a handicapped total of 4 stars since I believe that some of my ratings would apply to any brand/type of deluxe toothbrush out there.</li>
            <li>and it has so much more power than our old brush.</li>
            <li>It is powerful.</li>
            <li>It is OK for every six months, but not everyday.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s right where I want to rest my thumb.</li>
            <li>, I must admit that this brush really gets your teeth CLEAN.</li>
            <li>If you need this as a reminder or want a \\&quot;night light\\&quot; (you certainly won&#x27;t knock it over in the middle of the night if you have it sitting on the counter), the blue light is great</li>
            <li>The major improvement is the better battery charger.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit louder than the older model, probably because it&#x27;s got an additional motion, and the blue charging light is bright enough for a night light.</li>
            <li>If you have gum disease, it is a definite sure solution to a quick healing.</li>
            <li>It has a charging light that&#x27;s bright enough to double as a nightlight.</li>
            <li>They do a good job of getting your teeth clean with very little effort.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is far better than my original electric toothbrush by far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is completely sealed, and rinses off easily.  </li>
            <li>But in just a few days use I can safely say that the Oral-B is better.  </li>
            <li>I very much like the compact size and will attach this to the wall rather than stand it on the surface.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve needed a new power toothbrush since my old one broke a couple months ago and knew I wanted another oral B. Loved my old one</li>
            <li>I found the high speed too fast for my liking, but the slower speed is fine.</li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly, and I particularly like the design of the stand, since it holds all the brushes I use.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush I have ever used, so I don&#x27;t have any others to compare it to...</li>
            <li>My teeth are smoother, and brush head is smaller, and it just works better.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I had overbought</li>
            <li>because didn&#x27;t think I needed the 30 second reminder to change areas, but find that is one of the top features as it takes the guesswork out of wondering if you are spending enough/even time  across all teeth.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used Oral-B</li>
            <li>I wrote a review of it in that section, so if you are interested, take a look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product will last over 7 years in most cases.</li>
            <li>but if I used this brush consistently, I&#x27;d bet they&#x27;d never have any plaque to chip - even in the bottom</li>
            <li>none of them thrilling me, I went ahead and splurged on this one.</li>
            <li>So I was surprised at how much I enjoy this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Last time I went was 2.5 years ago just because I couldn&#x27;t bear the thought of more drilling and scraping.  </li>
            <li>The first one I owned lasted almost 10 years.  </li>
            <li>At first use the large brush was too big, however after swapping to the small brush this toothbrush is awesome!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not mad about the fact that part of this brush&#x27;s barrel stays lit, like a purple night light, to show that it&#x27;s fully charged (and that it blinks on and off to show that it&#x27;s charging) -- not necessary!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually kind of looking forward to my next dentist visit, just to see if the new toothbrush really has made a difference.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll find you will be brushing with much less force, but getting much more clean.</li>
            <li>My old Braun toothbrush, type 4804, was maybe 30 years old or more</li>
            <li>While brushing, it works best to progress slowly from tooth to tooth without trying to brush back and forth or in circles.  </li>
            <li>I chose this one because of all the positive feedback and will add mine to those.  </li>
            <li>Several heads come with this set and in my opinion, the Extra Soft Brushheads would be good for polishing fine jewelry perhaps; the bristles are so very soft.  </li>
            <li>The back teeth and the gumline seemed to be missed more but the main surfaces feel smoother.  </li>
            <li>What I expect out of an electric toothbrush is to be able to clean with slight pressure and without having to brush like a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a few more for my friends!</li>
            <li>I am really wondering if people who work for the company&#x27;s of Oral B and Sonicare don&#x27;t write these reviews.      </li>
            <li>My teeth have been feeling very sparkly.</li>
            <li>model spins and pulses in and out at some ridiculously fast speed</li>
            <li>For the price it was more than I expected.</li>
            <li>I do remember a reviewer mentioning the flasing blue light.  </li>
            <li>and I am amazed at how much cleaner my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>Not to mention how much healthier my gums feel.  </li>
            <li>My teeth also appear to be much whiter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the much cheaper, AA battery-powered version of this Braun power brush for a year or two, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>, it vibrates instead, which is very unobtrusive and works well.</li>
            <li>The heads are fairly reasonably priced given what they are, and seem well-designed and sturdy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(i dont really care for this feature).&lt;BR&gt;8.</li>
            <li>i really dont know how much a factor</li>
            <li>(again, i dont know how much it helps having an oscillating feature).&lt;BR&gt;5.</li>
            <li>just keep in mind that you do not want to use too much pressure while brushing.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable and i do not foresee any issues with reliability.</li>
            <li>I bought two of these to give as Christmas gifts and the recipients raved so much I had to buy one for myself.  </li>
            <li>unless your cuddling with a charging unit at night, the blue light will not bother you.</li>
            <li>it makes a modern nightlight for the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Remember to brush your gums as much as your teeth...</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to spend as much money and time at the dentist.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads, while still more than a regular tooth brush, are far cheaper than Sonicare&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>the end of the product&#x27;s useful life\\&quot;, and says \\&quot;Opening the handle will destroy the appliance and invalidate the guarantee\\&quot;, and \\&quot;You will not be able to place new batteries in the handle.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>My teeth have only felt this clean after a dentist visit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to spend a whole lot of time on my teeth, and I am paying for it now, as I get older.</li>
            <li>The smaller head of the Oral-B is far more effective at getting at hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>If the high setting is too much for you, mashing the button will take you to a lower speed.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Amazon is selling this product at the right price, I paid exactly the same thing at a department store.</li>
            <li>The shape and grip of this brush make brushing easy, and it can get to far back teeth quite well.&lt;BR&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Higher end options offer more extras but you might not care, lower end modes have cheaper batteries and don&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why the interplaque is not more widely popular.</li>
            <li>It looks nice and has a small footprint on your countertop - if that means anything to you.&lt;BR&gt;4.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a much better toothbrush than the typical $20 unit you may get on sale.</li>
            <li>It flashes when it&#x27;s charging and is steady when charged.</li>
            <li>It definitely does better than regular brushing</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended that I purchase an electric toothbrush since I am getting older</li>
            <li>Especially with the rise in use of whitening toothpastes that have more granules and such, you can do damage to the outer layer of the teeth.</li>
            <li>I love the 30 second warning for each quadrant and the space provided to hold extra toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li>Regular tooth brushes just was not providing what I needed no matter how many times I brushed.  </li>
            <li>It never brushed well: the heads wore out waaaaaaaay too quickly.  </li>
            <li>but it keeps going after 2 minutes - you have to shut it off), pressure sensitive, adjustable speeds, many attachments (basically - all of them), easy wall attachment option included with screws, and a long battery life BUT a one inch tall portion of tooth brush base/handle flashes blue when charging and stays blue when charged.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend this particular model because of</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting a power toothbrush if you don&#x27;t already have one.</li>
            <li>There are two settings for the toothbrush: high and medium setting(and</li>
            <li>of the things that bothered me about the Sonicare was the high price of replacement heads and, at times, difficulty in finding a replacement head at all.  </li>
            <li>However I would recommend if you had a little more money to look for Sonicare products</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s just that little bit better</li>
            <li>and I like the little signal it gives after each 30-second interval, with a more extended signal after two minutes.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace an old Oral-b that now seems really underpowered compared to this.</li>
            <li>This was the thing I liked the least.  </li>
            <li>so you end up having to use it almost like a normal toothbrush just to get the stuff off your teeth like after a meal.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I would say it is worth it</li>
            <li>you will never have a problem with plaque again with normal usage of an Oral B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I used to hate going to the dentist, this was the first time in ages that I haven&#x27;t had a cavity, and both my hygenist and dentist commented on my \\&quot;great brushing\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>The brush is definitely worth the price and because it is smaller, I prefer it over the Sonicare Elite.</li>
            <li>I just bought this toothbrush a few days ago and I am already sure that I am going to keep it.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll never want to brush with a normal toothbrush again.</li>
            <li>The brush is powerful enough to whiten \\&quot;naturally\\&quot;, and abrasive toothpastes may damage your teeth.</li>
            <li>After just a few days use it seems to me that it is indeed better at cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems that other researchers have confirmed that conclusion.  </li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t brush anywhere near long enough, and the timer does make it</li>
            <li>I then bought the new version of the interplaque, made by Conair, for about $20.</li>
            <li>AND though I&#x27;m a long-time \\&quot;brusher in the shower\\&quot; and a \\&quot;wander around the house with a tooth brush in my mouth\\&quot; and a \\&quot;chewer of tooth brushes\\&quot; &amp; a \\&quot;new toothbrush</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speed options:  3 stars (would like it to be at slow speed to start, paste goes flying off fast otherwise)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be a good idea to get a child used to this as young as possible because it cleans so well in a short time, especially with the choice of different size heads.  </li>
            <li>that you had to floss first on a regular basis before this would happen???  </li>
            <li>The floss didn&#x27;t even hurt my gums like floss normally would if had been using a soft bristle toothbrush 100% of the time.  </li>
            <li>There are two speeds, fast and slow, so it ok for people with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s teeth are looking much less yellow, and he says his gums feel better also.</li>
            <li>Out of the box, it actually took my Oral B Professional Care 7850 DLX a total of 19 hours and a few more minutes to be fully charged for the first time</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m certain it can&#x27;t take off tarter (only your dentist can do that), I *am* certain that no plaque remains after using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;The timer, which I thought was just a gimmick, actually works well.  </li>
            <li>tried some generic toothbrush heads to save on cost, but the bristles were much harder than those of the genuine Oral-B brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got this one and the old Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I like the 4 brush holder and the power and brushing action of this model.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a low setting as I might prefer on really sleepy mornings</li>
            <li>Sometimes I would occastionally prefer to use a soft bristle toothbrush if I didn&#x27;t feel like having a motor toothbrush pulsating in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>you are in your early 20&#x27;s, you are at risk for acquiring gum disease.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this toothbrush for anyone that really cares about their teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>My old brush had a mini head like this Braun does</li>
            <li>I had been using a 10 year old model and decided to get this one.  </li>
            <li>I brush by going over the whole set of teeth several times</li>
            <li>I could tell the difference in a week, in two I was really surprised, by the end of three weeks, even my dentist was surprised.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I will only use the 7500 series with the pulse and high brush rate!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just being negative. :)</li>
            <li>Whitens naturally - over time.</li>
            <li>You can buy another Braun/Oral-B product and use the rebate Amazon offers (either $30 or $50 depending on the offer).</li>
            <li>I prefer this type of electic brush over the inexpensive, battery operated ones you can purchase or the old manual way of brushing.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush for my 2 young daughters.  </li>
            <li>Nobody mentioned the fact that it is so loud you feel like you are at the dentist(sounds like the drill), and that when used on high speed your brain actually shakes in you head?  </li>
            <li>I spent a lot of time researching the various competing brands and models and ended up choosing this one, but whether I could have gotten just as good a brush for less money is entirely possible.  </li>
            <li>found myself not really paying attention to the timing of the 30 second vibration since I probably use it for two full cycles.</li>
            <li>first I was disappointed that the Oral-B toothbrush&#x27;s head didn&#x27;t spin/vibrate as fast as my previous SoniCare, but I quickly found that it had much better reach inside my mouth, and could really clean every little crevice, nook, and cranny around my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>The literature indicates the blue bristles on the brush will wear off and tell me when to buy new ....</li>
            <li>On Ebay, you can get the same unit in brand new condition for around $40 including shipping.</li>
            <li>I really think they can produce this item in a different color, like all yellow and sell it as a grout cleaner.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been brushing for the full two minutes instead of my usual 20 seconds or so</li>
            <li>I think this is a very small price to pay for a product which will absolutely give you that fresh from the Dental Hygientist cleaning feeling.</li>
            <li>All in all, the products works well to keep my teeth clean though the extra bells and whistles are a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I could never go back to my old electric toothbrush (Sonicare).</li>
            <li>My old one only beeped after 2 minutes which is sufficient.</li>
            <li>It operates quietly and charges completely overnight .  </li>
            <li>After 2 years, the battery is not holding charge well anymore and the charge indicator LED lights only dimly.  </li>
            <li>This is just a part of a complete program to ward off gum disease, but it&#x27;s a critical one.</li>
            <li>It simply does not work as well as the old interplaque.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to my next dental visit to see if it has made a difference as far as my dentist is concerned.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased this toothbrush to replace my old Sonicare brush</li>
            <li>Plus, the small, round head on the Oral-B brush is so much easier to reach my back teeth, (much better than the oversized head of the Sonicare brush).</li>
            <li>No regrets at all.  </li>
            <li>Feels like a professional cleaning daily!</li>
            <li>in getting replacement heads: 4 stars (most brick and mortar places have tons of the extra soft heads, and usually some flexisoft heads, harder to find the Polishing heads, not to mention cheaper here on Amazon.com</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the &#x27;hygenic&#x27; storage compartment is a little plastic hole in the top of the charging unit covered by a flimsy plastic cover, which might let dust settle down into the compartment.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re considering this brush against other brushes, you really get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>only only clear</li>
            <li>Oral B on the other hand had round smaller head that was easy to use on the my molars.</li>
            <li>(the manual states that it takes at least 16 hours for a full charge, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and powerful, just like the ones dentists use.  </li>
            <li>If they are recommending this, at the risk of having less work to do, and promote dental health, I would certainly listen to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Cons: not as clean feeling as old Sonicare, battery life is worse, head life is shorter, no quadpacer&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that the heads don&#x27;t wear down as fast as they say.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pretty quiet too, perhaps quieter than my little AA-powered brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always felt like it makes all of human-kind less capable of survival by needing a machine to brush teeth...</li>
            <li>Just like having a professional dental cleaning every single time I use it.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve really felt that I&#x27;m cleaning behind my back molars, which is something my dental hygienist mentions every visit.</li>
            <li>also like the fact that the brushes on all the Brauns are the same (except for the power cross-action brush), which lets you change from one to the other without buying new brush heads.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>

            <li> This is an amazing brush!</li>
            <li> Is this particular model the best or even the best value?  </li>
            <li> if the set price averages out to about $5 a head, that&#x27;s a good value.)</li>
            <li> This is a good toothbrush and you won&#x27;t have to buy replacements for the 6-10 months.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea that it was so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for 9 months now and it&#x27;s been wicked good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say this though, no simple/manual toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned does as good of a job</li>
            <li> It feels like a quality product and is a good balance of price and features.  </li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> The timer function is good, and saves time because you don&#x27;t need to over brush.  </li>
            <li> it a five because my husband is delighted with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sonicare is a good brush.  </li>

            <li> There were so many good reviews when I bought it that I thought it must be great.  </li>
            <li> love this works great.</li>
            <li> I still own this device and it is still running good.</li>
            <li> but I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this one doesn&#x27;t have that two minute timer built in, I know when to stop brushing my teeth!  </li>
            <li> I had my first dentist appointment since using the brush about a week ago and it was the best appointment of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now, and it still holds it charge, and the magic doesn&#x27;t stop! &lt;</li>
            <li> First off, I must say this is the best electronic brush I have used to date.</li>
            <li> This is one of those purchases -- like my iPod, my electric do-it-yourself hair clipper, and my subscription to NetFlix -- that have made my life a lot more pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Technologically an amazing device .      </li>
            <li> Also a nice feature for me since I tend to short-change my brushing time.</li>
            <li> for over 2 yrs now and loving it since day one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery:  1 star (it seems every deluxe toothbrush out there</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just having that handy 30-second timer that keeps me brushing for 2 mins or whether it&#x27;s the 40,000+ pulses or what,</li>
            <li> I used to own a brush from another manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> If you have a full family you&#x27;re shopping for, this is a great starter set.</li>
            <li> Your teeth will feel marvelous, your smile will be brighter, and your gums tremendously more healthy.</li>
            <li> This cleans great, and its true...</li>
            <li> Believe me, you don&#x27;t want to be able to see it from your bedroom if it&#x27;s charging at night - it makes for a kind of strobe-light effect.</li>
            <li> and so far thinks its wonderful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper and more effective.  </li>
            <li> This light is so bright that it keeps me up at night.  </li>
            <li> It is so bright like there is a light saber in our bathroom.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a fairly nice looking unit and the brush storage is discreet but easy to access.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, nice looking and has a timing feature so that you can brush your teeth for the suggested 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I used another brand of power toothbrush before purchasing the 7850 model and I am really pleased with this one.  </li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with this.  </li>
            <li> The dentist hygienist reccomended this, and I love the feel of my teeth afterwards, you know that its getting those tarter areas, etc.  </li>
            <li> more to say.</li>
            <li> but this kind of feels like the cheap $10 electric toothbrush you can buy at your drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I was sure she enjoyed using the drill on my tender gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> The spinning brush doesn&#x27;t do a better job either.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare costs more and is better.</li>
            <li> but I want to see if there is something better.  </li>
            <li> If you have any gum problems, or just like the feeling of teeth that have been thoroughly cleaned, you&#x27;re going to love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The built-in timer (one signal every 30 seconds for each quarter of your mouth, then another to tell you you&#x27;ve finished two minutes) helps you to make sure you brush your teeth sufficiently.  </li>
            <li> The power toothbrush works just as advertised, excellent and the extra cleaning brushes makes for an even better deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than satisfied with this product and will purchase another once this one dies.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I slacked off and didn&#x27;t floss _at all_ since I got the Oral B toothbrush...  </li>
            <li> and so I can tell you that having straighter teeth is definately more convenient while brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Yay flossing:)</li>
            <li> It just works better.....</li>
            <li> I LOVE this one.  </li>
            <li> With the four-part storage chamber for the brush heads, it has plenty of room to store for more than one user.</li>
            <li> and I love brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a compulsive brusher who routinely spends 3 or more minutes brushing 2 -3 times per day.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I now love &#x27;em.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found it...</li>
            <li> According to Braun, brushing for two minutes takes off about 25% more plaque than brushing for one minute, and I don&#x27;t doubt it.  </li>
            <li> , it is that you&#x27;ll have to make sure you brush over a sink as the power brush combined with toothpaste creates some foam.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me, then you have just returned from the dentist and have vowed to take better care of your teeth.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just more convenient and most of us are probably brushing incorrectly anyway.</li>
            <li> I use to focus more on brushing my teeth, but with this toothbrush it helps take care of the gum line too.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> but i assume that faster is better (?)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Improves staining:  3 stars (indifferent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clothing intact:  3 stars (dribble factor, always have to keep chin up and keep a kleenex at the ready)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  5 stars (most places charge $100.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Braun and was able to replace the battery by having one built at Batteries</li>
            <li> I used to have a Braun and was able to replace the battery by having one built at Batteries</li>
            <li> I like knowing I&#x27;m taking much better care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> The item arrived in a timely manner, in an undamaged box, and I am pleased with this order from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> It feels great when I brush and my teeth look much cleaner after using it.  </li>
            <li> I got this on recommendation from my dentist and boy am I so pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> At my age, you worry more about gums care than cavities.  </li>
            <li> However, my more practical husband does like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on this brush even if it does require more effort on my part.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, used it once and haven&#x27;t been able to stop since.</li>
            <li> I have had it over a year and love it.</li>
            <li> The brush will not overcharge, unlike many rechargeable electronics, which allows you to keep it fully charged all the times without worrying about killing your battery life.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B, however, rests on top of a rod.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure about one thing.</li>
            <li> could have been better?</li>
            <li> My dentist told me my teeth had never looked better.  </li>
            <li> have also came to the conclusion that oral B toothbrushes even clean your teeth better as well!  </li>
            <li> Honestly, the best $80 I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li> This mode in particular is great and you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> We love this new power toothbrush because it does a great job cleaning the teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a month now and have not noticed a change in my coloring, but my teeth do feel very clean and polished, in any case.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty bright...</li>
            <li> The brush itself cleaned effectively and quickly.</li>
            <li> The timer is most convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It just feels like it might break more easily.  </li>
            <li> For the most part I always use the medium setting on the toothbrush and that is comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 7850DLX for about a week now, and so far I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li> (Ideally, you want to use the softest brush possible to help avoid damaging your tooth enamel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re teeth will feel great, and your gums will surely be more healthy if you use this properly.</li>
            <li> But most importantly, you LOOK FORWARD to using this brush because it is A TOOTH MASSAGER.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush head for pediatric (and adult) mouths.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviews, I find that this toothbrush is excellent -- with one significant flaw.  </li>
            <li> If things like that bother you easily at night, then you will have to close the bathroom door if the bathroom opens into themaster bedroom.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product after reading so many great reviews.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this brush in Feb. and began noticing a difference very quickly after I began using it.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight, well-balanced, and easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li> easy to use.&lt;BR&gt;4.</li>
            <li> not as satisfied when trying to clean my tongue and below the tongue.</li>
            <li> Oral-B/Braun guarantees that you will be satisfied with the results of this brush, and if you&#x27;re not - even after 2 years of use - they will give you a full refund.</li>
            <li> Reviews say the Oral-B toothbrush is comfortable and easy to use, although some testers complain that it&#x27;s a bit noisy.</li>
            <li> However, I found that sonicare with its large brush head was best for people with big mouth.</li>
            <li> But the specific brush is really great.</li>
            <li> The blinking light doesn&#x27;t bother me though, mine stays in the kitchen.  </li>
            <li> My teath feel so smooth after brushing with it</li>
            <li> What a wise investment for one of your most important personal hygiene needs.</li>
            <li> More important, on my last visit to the dentist, after having used the brush for around a month, I was praised for how good my teeth and gums looked.  </li>
            <li> LED light -</li>
            <li> It is ergonomically sound.</li>
            <li> And that is important considering that the battery cannot be replaced.&lt;BR&gt;5.</li>
            <li> , you can get a great deal on it in different ways.  </li>
            <li> For example, you can get the Braun 7526 refurbished razor with this brush ($50), and activate the $50 rebate, so you can get the razor for free.</li>
            <li> The LED light that blinks when the toothbrush is on the charger.  </li>
            <li> Ordering was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I believe even if you had slightly less perfect teeth the benefits of using the Oral B toothbrushes are still better than using just normal toothbrushes...</li>
            <li> The bright blue charging light blinks on and off all the time the unit is charging.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a two-minute timer (but no auto-shut-off) with 30-second beep to signal you to clean another area.</li>
            <li> Talk about getting your teeth really clean and gums treated well simultaneously.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for my old one that I paid almost twice as much for.</li>
            <li> The extra brusheads that come with the package are extremely useful, and might I add it makes the purchase a great value.  </li>
            <li> Almost dentist clean.</li>
            <li> Cleaning power - this can clean anything.</li>
            <li> and what there is you see and can immediately clean</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re considering an electronic brush over the old fashion kind, do it.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a regular brush and a neat tapered brush for between the teeth, which is almost as good as flossing.</li>
            <li> what he&#x27;ll say when I have my next appointment, but I expect that he will have good things to say.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I really like to \\&quot;blue\\&quot; indicator charging light!</li>
            <li> It really makes your gums feel much better.</li>
            <li> make the most of your brushing minutes each day and save yourself a lot of problems down the road and keep that smile dazzling.</li>
            <li> As I expected, this new Braun toothbrush is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The reason why i believe this is an important feature is because at 40,000 rpm&#x27;s you don&#x27;t know exactly how much pressure is ok to use with the Oral B.</li>
            <li> fresh and so clean clean\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> which cues you to an adequate amount of time to brush your teeth per quadrant.</li>
            <li> I tried one of the FlexiSoft Brushheads, but quickly switched to a separately purchased Oral B Power Polisher head EB 18-3 (3 pack).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You are better off sticking with a normal toothbrush or trying another brand.  </li>
            <li> The various brushes are great - didn&#x27;t think I would use more than 1 or 2, but after trying all four, I see their individual benefit.  </li>
            <li> Cleans in between teeth better than a normal toothbrush, but should not be considered a substitute to flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Instead of making the light blink on and off when it&#x27;s charging, they should have made it so a light stays on steadily, and shuts off when it&#x27;s charged.  </li>
            <li> just be sure to clean that area out frequently as you do not want to keep use a toothbrush that has a bunch of bacteria on it.&lt;BR&gt;2.</li>
            <li> and I love my new one.</li>
            <li> I suspect almost any electric toothbrush is pretty good, if you use it regularly for a couple of minutes each night.  </li>
            <li> The small head is the perfect size to get all your teeth and not take up too much space in your mouth.</li>
            <li> So the new toothbrush has been a good thing as far as that goes - I just have to hold it against my teeth</li>
            <li> The plaque really came off, and my teeth felt smooth to the tongue.</li>
            <li> Not so sure I would have spent such a great deal of money for a TOOTHBRUSH.  </li>
            <li> It cleans very well and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Ever bit worth the price</li>
            <li> The expected \\&quot;useful life\\&quot; of the \\&quot;product\\&quot; is not hinted at in the manual, except that the warranty is good for 24 months.  </li>
            <li> In fact many times I have to go over my teeth with a normal toothbrush if I have just eaten, or I have to rinse first.      </li>
            <li> So far it is much much better.  </li>
            <li> even after flossing many times a week, for weeks in a row, my gums would still be ultra sensitive.</li>
            <li> I also have my own personal dentist now.</li>
            <li> This thing is so powerful it feels like a dental scaler.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel fresh.  </li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;d give this a handicapped total of 4 stars since I believe that some of my ratings would apply to any brand/type of deluxe toothbrush out</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;d give this a handicapped total of 4 stars since I believe that some of my ratings would apply to any brand/type of deluxe toothbrush out there.</li>
            <li> and it has so much more power than our old brush.</li>
            <li> It is powerful.</li>
            <li> It is OK for every six months, but not everyday.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s right where I want to rest my thumb.</li>
            <li> , I must admit that this brush really gets your teeth CLEAN.</li>
            <li> If you need this as a reminder or want a \\&quot;night light\\&quot; (you certainly won&#x27;t knock it over in the middle of the night if you have it sitting on the counter), the blue light is great</li>
            <li> The major improvement is the better battery charger.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit louder than the older model, probably because it&#x27;s got an additional motion, and the blue charging light is bright enough for a night light.</li>
            <li> If you have gum disease, it is a definite sure solution to a quick healing.</li>
            <li> It has a charging light that&#x27;s bright enough to double as a nightlight.</li>
            <li> They do a good job of getting your teeth clean with very little effort.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is far better than my original electric toothbrush by far.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is completely sealed, and rinses off easily.  </li>
            <li> But in just a few days use I can safely say that the Oral-B is better.  </li>
            <li> I very much like the compact size and will attach this to the wall rather than stand it on the surface.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve needed a new power toothbrush since my old one broke a couple months ago and knew I wanted another oral B. Loved my old one</li>
            <li> I found the high speed too fast for my liking, but the slower speed is fine.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly, and I particularly like the design of the stand, since it holds all the brushes I use.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I have ever used, so I don&#x27;t have any others to compare it to...</li>
            <li> My teeth are smoother, and brush head is smaller, and it just works better.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I had overbought</li>
            <li> because didn&#x27;t think I needed the 30 second reminder to change areas, but find that is one of the top features as it takes the guesswork out of wondering if you are spending enough/even time  across all teeth.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used Oral-B</li>
            <li> I wrote a review of it in that section, so if you are interested, take a look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product will last over 7 years in most cases.</li>
            <li> but if I used this brush consistently, I&#x27;d bet they&#x27;d never have any plaque to chip - even in the bottom</li>
            <li> none of them thrilling me, I went ahead and splurged on this one.</li>
            <li> So I was surprised at how much I enjoy this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Last time I went was 2.5 years ago just because I couldn&#x27;t bear the thought of more drilling and scraping.  </li>
            <li> The first one I owned lasted almost 10 years.  </li>
            <li> At first use the large brush was too big, however after swapping to the small brush this toothbrush is awesome!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not mad about the fact that part of this brush&#x27;s barrel stays lit, like a purple night light, to show that it&#x27;s fully charged (and that it blinks on and off to show that it&#x27;s charging) -- not necessary!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually kind of looking forward to my next dentist visit, just to see if the new toothbrush really has made a difference.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll find you will be brushing with much less force, but getting much more clean.</li>
            <li> My old Braun toothbrush, type 4804, was maybe 30 years old or more</li>
            <li> While brushing, it works best to progress slowly from tooth to tooth without trying to brush back and forth or in circles.  </li>
            <li> I chose this one because of all the positive feedback and will add mine to those.  </li>
            <li> Several heads come with this set and in my opinion, the Extra Soft Brushheads would be good for polishing fine jewelry perhaps; the bristles are so very soft.  </li>
            <li> The back teeth and the gumline seemed to be missed more but the main surfaces feel smoother.  </li>
            <li> What I expect out of an electric toothbrush is to be able to clean with slight pressure and without having to brush like a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a few more for my friends!</li>
            <li> I am really wondering if people who work for the company&#x27;s of Oral B and Sonicare don&#x27;t write these reviews.      </li>
            <li> My teeth have been feeling very sparkly.</li>
            <li> model spins and pulses in and out at some ridiculously fast speed</li>
            <li> For the price it was more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I do remember a reviewer mentioning the flasing blue light.  </li>
            <li> and I am amazed at how much cleaner my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> Not to mention how much healthier my gums feel.  </li>
            <li> My teeth also appear to be much whiter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the much cheaper, AA battery-powered version of this Braun power brush for a year or two, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> , it vibrates instead, which is very unobtrusive and works well.</li>
            <li> The heads are fairly reasonably priced given what they are, and seem well-designed and sturdy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (i dont really care for this feature).&lt;BR&gt;8.</li>
            <li> i really dont know how much a factor</li>
            <li> (again, i dont know how much it helps having an oscillating feature).&lt;BR&gt;5.</li>
            <li> just keep in mind that you do not want to use too much pressure while brushing.</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable and i do not foresee any issues with reliability.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these to give as Christmas gifts and the recipients raved so much I had to buy one for myself.  </li>
            <li> unless your cuddling with a charging unit at night, the blue light will not bother you.</li>
            <li> it makes a modern nightlight for the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Remember to brush your gums as much as your teeth...</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to spend as much money and time at the dentist.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads, while still more than a regular tooth brush, are far cheaper than Sonicare&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> the end of the product&#x27;s useful life\\&quot;, and says \\&quot;Opening the handle will destroy the appliance and invalidate the guarantee\\&quot;, and \\&quot;You will not be able to place new batteries in the handle.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> My teeth have only felt this clean after a dentist visit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to spend a whole lot of time on my teeth, and I am paying for it now, as I get older.</li>
            <li> The smaller head of the Oral-B is far more effective at getting at hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> If the high setting is too much for you, mashing the button will take you to a lower speed.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Amazon is selling this product at the right price, I paid exactly the same thing at a department store.</li>
            <li> The shape and grip of this brush make brushing easy, and it can get to far back teeth quite well.&lt;BR&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Higher end options offer more extras but you might not care, lower end modes have cheaper batteries and don&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the interplaque is not more widely popular.</li>
            <li> It looks nice and has a small footprint on your countertop - if that means anything to you.&lt;BR&gt;4.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a much better toothbrush than the typical $20 unit you may get on sale.</li>
            <li> It flashes when it&#x27;s charging and is steady when charged.</li>
            <li> It definitely does better than regular brushing</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I purchase an electric toothbrush since I am getting older</li>
            <li> Especially with the rise in use of whitening toothpastes that have more granules and such, you can do damage to the outer layer of the teeth.</li>
            <li> I love the 30 second warning for each quadrant and the space provided to hold extra toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> Regular tooth brushes just was not providing what I needed no matter how many times I brushed.  </li>
            <li> It never brushed well: the heads wore out waaaaaaaay too quickly.  </li>
            <li> but it keeps going after 2 minutes - you have to shut it off), pressure sensitive, adjustable speeds, many attachments (basically - all of them), easy wall attachment option included with screws, and a long battery life BUT a one inch tall portion of tooth brush base/handle flashes blue when charging and stays blue when charged.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend this particular model because of</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting a power toothbrush if you don&#x27;t already have one.</li>
            <li> There are two settings for the toothbrush: high and medium setting(and</li>
            <li> of the things that bothered me about the Sonicare was the high price of replacement heads and, at times, difficulty in finding a replacement head at all.  </li>
            <li> However I would recommend if you had a little more money to look for Sonicare products</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s just that little bit better</li>
            <li> and I like the little signal it gives after each 30-second interval, with a more extended signal after two minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace an old Oral-b that now seems really underpowered compared to this.</li>
            <li> This was the thing I liked the least.  </li>
            <li> so you end up having to use it almost like a normal toothbrush just to get the stuff off your teeth like after a meal.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I would say it is worth it</li>
            <li> you will never have a problem with plaque again with normal usage of an Oral B toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I used to hate going to the dentist, this was the first time in ages that I haven&#x27;t had a cavity, and both my hygenist and dentist commented on my \\&quot;great brushing\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> The brush is definitely worth the price and because it is smaller, I prefer it over the Sonicare Elite.</li>
            <li> I just bought this toothbrush a few days ago and I am already sure that I am going to keep it.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll never want to brush with a normal toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> The brush is powerful enough to whiten \\&quot;naturally\\&quot;, and abrasive toothpastes may damage your teeth.</li>
            <li> After just a few days use it seems to me that it is indeed better at cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems that other researchers have confirmed that conclusion.  </li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t brush anywhere near long enough, and the timer does make it</li>
            <li> I then bought the new version of the interplaque, made by Conair, for about $20.</li>
            <li> AND though I&#x27;m a long-time \\&quot;brusher in the shower\\&quot; and a \\&quot;wander around the house with a tooth brush in my mouth\\&quot; and a \\&quot;chewer of tooth brushes\\&quot; &amp; a \\&quot;new toothbrush</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speed options:  3 stars (would like it to be at slow speed to start, paste goes flying off fast otherwise)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be a good idea to get a child used to this as young as possible because it cleans so well in a short time, especially with the choice of different size heads.  </li>
            <li> that you had to floss first on a regular basis before this would happen???  </li>
            <li> The floss didn&#x27;t even hurt my gums like floss normally would if had been using a soft bristle toothbrush 100% of the time.  </li>
            <li> There are two speeds, fast and slow, so it ok for people with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s teeth are looking much less yellow, and he says his gums feel better also.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, it actually took my Oral B Professional Care 7850 DLX a total of 19 hours and a few more minutes to be fully charged for the first time</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m certain it can&#x27;t take off tarter (only your dentist can do that), I *am* certain that no plaque remains after using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;The timer, which I thought was just a gimmick, actually works well.  </li>
            <li> tried some generic toothbrush heads to save on cost, but the bristles were much harder than those of the genuine Oral-B brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got this one and the old Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I like the 4 brush holder and the power and brushing action of this model.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a low setting as I might prefer on really sleepy mornings</li>
            <li> Sometimes I would occastionally prefer to use a soft bristle toothbrush if I didn&#x27;t feel like having a motor toothbrush pulsating in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> you are in your early 20&#x27;s, you are at risk for acquiring gum disease.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this toothbrush for anyone that really cares about their teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> My old brush had a mini head like this Braun does</li>
            <li> I had been using a 10 year old model and decided to get this one.  </li>
            <li> I brush by going over the whole set of teeth several times</li>
            <li> I could tell the difference in a week, in two I was really surprised, by the end of three weeks, even my dentist was surprised.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I will only use the 7500 series with the pulse and high brush rate!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just being negative. :)</li>
            <li> Whitens naturally - over time.</li>
            <li> You can buy another Braun/Oral-B product and use the rebate Amazon offers (either $30 or $50 depending on the offer).</li>
            <li> I prefer this type of electic brush over the inexpensive, battery operated ones you can purchase or the old manual way of brushing.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush for my 2 young daughters.  </li>
            <li> Nobody mentioned the fact that it is so loud you feel like you are at the dentist(sounds like the drill), and that when used on high speed your brain actually shakes in you head?  </li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching the various competing brands and models and ended up choosing this one, but whether I could have gotten just as good a brush for less money is entirely possible.  </li>
            <li> found myself not really paying attention to the timing of the 30 second vibration since I probably use it for two full cycles.</li>
            <li> first I was disappointed that the Oral-B toothbrush&#x27;s head didn&#x27;t spin/vibrate as fast as my previous SoniCare, but I quickly found that it had much better reach inside my mouth, and could really clean every little crevice, nook, and cranny around my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> The literature indicates the blue bristles on the brush will wear off and tell me when to buy new ....</li>
            <li> On Ebay, you can get the same unit in brand new condition for around $40 including shipping.</li>
            <li> I really think they can produce this item in a different color, like all yellow and sell it as a grout cleaner.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been brushing for the full two minutes instead of my usual 20 seconds or so</li>
            <li> I think this is a very small price to pay for a product which will absolutely give you that fresh from the Dental Hygientist cleaning feeling.</li>
            <li> All in all, the products works well to keep my teeth clean though the extra bells and whistles are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I could never go back to my old electric toothbrush (Sonicare).</li>
            <li> My old one only beeped after 2 minutes which is sufficient.</li>
            <li> It operates quietly and charges completely overnight .  </li>
            <li> After 2 years, the battery is not holding charge well anymore and the charge indicator LED lights only dimly.  </li>
            <li> This is just a part of a complete program to ward off gum disease, but it&#x27;s a critical one.</li>
            <li> It simply does not work as well as the old interplaque.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to my next dental visit to see if it has made a difference as far as my dentist is concerned.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased this toothbrush to replace my old Sonicare brush</li>
            <li> Plus, the small, round head on the Oral-B brush is so much easier to reach my back teeth, (much better than the oversized head of the Sonicare brush).</li>
            <li> No regrets at all.  </li>
            <li> Feels like a professional cleaning daily!</li>
            <li> in getting replacement heads: 4 stars (most brick and mortar places have tons of the extra soft heads, and usually some flexisoft heads, harder to find the Polishing heads, not to mention cheaper here on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the &#x27;hygenic&#x27; storage compartment is a little plastic hole in the top of the charging unit covered by a flimsy plastic cover, which might let dust settle down into the compartment.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re considering this brush against other brushes, you really get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> only only clear</li>
            <li> Oral B on the other hand had round smaller head that was easy to use on the my molars.</li>
            <li> (the manual states that it takes at least 16 hours for a full charge, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and powerful, just like the ones dentists use.  </li>
            <li> If they are recommending this, at the risk of having less work to do, and promote dental health, I would certainly listen to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Cons: not as clean feeling as old Sonicare, battery life is worse, head life is shorter, no quadpacer&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that the heads don&#x27;t wear down as fast as they say.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pretty quiet too, perhaps quieter than my little AA-powered brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always felt like it makes all of human-kind less capable of survival by needing a machine to brush teeth...</li>
            <li> Just like having a professional dental cleaning every single time I use it.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve really felt that I&#x27;m cleaning behind my back molars, which is something my dental hygienist mentions every visit.</li>
            <li> also like the fact that the brushes on all the Brauns are the same (except for the power cross-action brush), which lets you change from one to the other without buying new brush heads.  </li>
            <li> But the main problem is that my teeth are not smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> Not loud enough to be annoying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Sonicare toothbrush above gets slightly better ease-of-use scores, but the 7000 series is less expensive for essentially the same features.</li>
            <li> It does not clean nearly well enough</li>
            <li> I can brush for 2 - 2 &amp; half minutes now and my teeth are clearly cleaner than when flailing away with the hand brush.  </li>
            <li> I bought this Braun/Oral-B Professional Care power toothbrush to replace my previous Philips SoniCare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The cost of the brush itself, depending on where you purchase it, is also far less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Operation:&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> The only trouble I find is with the power button being right where I would usually rest my thumb--</li>
            <li> I guess some people will consider this unit and the accompanying brush heads expensive, but you should put it in prospective...over timeyou will need less cleaning/scraping/drilling/surgery at the dentist/oral surgeon, and will have better overall oral health.</li>
            <li> At least with the sonicare, if you are using too much pressure, it shuts off automatically.</li>
            <li> The light: The blue light that stay on/brink all the time is very annoying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t purchase one a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> Why I have waited so long to upgrade, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Built-in timer gives you an idea of how long you&#x27;ve been brushing.</li>
            <li> The positions are &#x27;fast&#x27;, &#x27;slow&#x27; and &#x27;off&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> About the only drawback I&#x27;ve seen is that it feels less solid than the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> finally decided to give my little brush a rest and try out this big brother version.  </li>
            <li> Although the brush heads are equally expensive, the Oral-B was sealed much better and did not succumb to moisture that seeped inside and eventually shorted out the electronics, which is what killed my SoniCare</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s far less mess</li>
            <li> I have multiple crowns and a bridge and could NEVER get above the crowns along the gumline with an ordinary brush as I can with the 7850 DLX.</li>
            <li> When I usually go to the dentist, it&#x27;s the same story: a handful of cavities, sore gums, and a lecture about proper brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li> Of course, such a thing may make the unit less resistant to water.</li>
            <li> Likely because it does not really clean the teeth.     </li>
            <li> It is too rough.</li>
            <li> being that we always want things that we dont have, i am curious as to how the sonicare performs.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:</li>
            <li> now only uses battery packs that, upon removal, destroy something on the circuit board, rendering it inoperable....</li>
            <li> there.t there now only uses battery packs that, upon removal, destroy something on the circuit board, rendering it inoperable....</li>
            <li> If it would get the rough edges out of it.</li>
            <li> Better to get a cheaper model with the same power but without the annoying extras.</li>
            <li> The speed difference between fast and slow is small.  </li>
            <li> It cleans under the edge of the gums so that all the tartar and other gunk gets taken away.  </li>
            <li> and I would not consider any toothbrush with any other type or size head.</li>
            <li> Incorrect brushing can cause excessive wear and tear on portions of the teeth- such as with the enamel.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to an ordinary toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> It will cut your dental bills in due course.</li>
            <li> Think about it, dentists&#x27; polishing instruments are all small and round so that they can get in and around each individual tooth.]</li>
            <li> I attribute the lack of change to my consumption of carbonated, dark sodas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the down side is finding where to purchase the replacement INTERSPACE BRUSH HEAD.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rechargeable and I can stop purchasing junky kids battery-operated toothbrushes every 1-2 months after the batteries wear down.  </li>
            <li> This \\&quot;timer\\&quot; is a waste and pretty annoying to have the stuttering occurring so frequently.</li>
            <li> The battery charge is supposed to last for a week with normal use, but I&#x27;ve just left the base plugged in, so I haven&#x27;t tested that out.</li>
            <li> I just had a checkup after using this for 6 months and luckily no cavities</li>
            <li> but hopefully I will have less buildup because of it.</li>
            <li> this is arguable but i have never had any problems whatsoever with previous oral b products.</li>
            <li> wanted to address some of the previous complains... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;</li>
            <li> while the small brush heads make it convenient to reach harder places, you have to keep in mind that there is less surface area for the brush head</li>
            <li> and my gums would always be a little softer than they should be.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little noisy, but what do you expect?</li>
            <li> I wish I knew before what I was missing out on.</li>
            <li> And this brush cost less money too!  </li>
            <li> As others have noted, the drawback here is the lack of an automatic shut-off on the Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of cleanliness, the base of the Sonicare rests inside its recharger where old tooth paste and general muck tend to accumulate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing to learn, after buying the new toothbrush, that its rechargeable battery is not replaceable.  </li>
            <li> but my checkups are not better than before I started using the brush.  </li>
            <li> Not enough to make using it difficult, but you won&#x27;t be leaving the safety of the sink, either.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> (could be because of the small brush head)&lt;br /&gt;Compared</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush for myself for the past 3 years and no longer have a problem with receding gums or plaque build-up.</li>
            <li> (I shopped extensively for this item and learned you can buy replacement handheld only and continue to use the charger base forever.  </li>
            <li> small brush head to reach the \\&quot;hard to reach\\&quot; places, like the molars.&lt;BR&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed I was not recommended these toothbrushes... but they really work wonders for your dental hygeine and to strengthen gums(and</li>
            <li> The built-in power sensor is a helpful feature that stops bristle movement if you&#x27;re brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> It often stops if you press too hard against your teeth.</li>
            <li> every month\\&quot; person (also a person that gets slammed by their dentist for brushing toooo hard)</li>
            <li> Dentists recommend at least two minutes&lt;BR&gt;7.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy when it comes to flossing, but after using this brush, there seems to be no need to floss!</li>
            <li> so the timer does me no good.</li>
            <li> tend to brush too hard - get in there and attack those teeth!</li>
            <li> big difference in performance as compared to the $15 base oral b electronic toothbrush i use to own.&lt;BR&gt;7.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush hasn&#x27;t broken or shown signs of wear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The two-speed thing feels useless because the lower speed feels harsher.  </li>
            <li> Some people may think it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> Expensive,</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> the problem is that after a couple of days it gets dirty in the storage area.</li>
            <li> I am rather disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is very inconvenient.</li>

            <li> and you would not get bloody gums, but</li>
            <li> , for me, flossing gave me bloody gums...</li>
            <li> Not as much crap stuck in your teeth; however, flossing is still required to strengthen your gums to avoid gum disease.  </li>
            <li> I hate using Listerine</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutly the best electric toothbrush I have ever used. My teeth have only felt this clean after a dentist visit.  I could never go back to my old electric toothbrush (Sonicare). Ever bit worth the price</li>
            <li> I used another brand of power toothbrush before purchasing the 7850 model and I am really pleased with this one.  However, the down side is finding where to purchase the replacement INTERSPACE BRUSH HEAD.  I can find no... stores that sell the 7850 replacement INTERSPACE BRUSH HEAD.  The replacement cost from internet stores is about [$$$] each plus S&amp;H charges making the expenditure sort of steep.  But the specific brush is really great.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with this.  I have had excellant teeth all my life, but now that 50 is here, well, the effects of coffee, tea, etc. has some effect.  The dentist hygienist reccomended this, and I love the feel of my teeth afterwards, you know that its getting those tarter areas, etc.  I used a manual toothbrush once earlier this week (was in a hurry and not in the bathroom that had the Oral B brush), just not the same anymore.</li>
            <li> This is my current brush of choice, though I&#x27;ve been using various Braun Oral-B brushes for over ten years. Note that this set has storage for 4 brush heads, so you can use separate heads for morning and evening brushing (something dentists recommend to halt the growth of bacteria).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set also comes with 2 extra-soft EB17 heads, which are essentially the same heads packaged and sold for children. If you have a full family you&#x27;re shopping for, this is a great starter set. (You can buy replacement EB17 heads here on Amazon; if the set price averages out to about $5 a head, that&#x27;s a good value.)</li>
            <li> The bright blue charging light blinks on and off all the time the unit is charging. If things like that bother you easily at night, then you will have to close the bathroom door if the bathroom opens into themaster bedroom. This was the thing I liked the least.  Also, the brush stutters every 30 seconds and stutters longer at 2 minutes. This \\&quot;timer\\&quot; is a waste and pretty annoying to have the stuttering occurring so frequently. I never use the highest brushing speed. It is too rough. All in all, the products works well to keep my teeth clean though the extra bells and whistles are a waste of money. Better to get a cheaper model with the same power but without the annoying extras.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve needed a new power toothbrush since my old one broke a couple months ago and knew I wanted another oral B. Loved my old one and I love my new one. The only thing I can do without is the 30 second beeps. My old one only beeped after 2 minutes which is sufficient.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has a lot of brushes included and one of them is a contrarotating double bruch.  Technologically an amazing device .      It operates quietly and charges completely overnight .  On a trip recently of 10 days it did not require re recharging.  I think it is a great product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re considering an electronic brush over the old fashion kind, do it.  There are no reasons not to.  The investment in your teeth is a no brainer.      If you&#x27;re considering this brush against other brushes, you really get what you pay for.  Higher end options offer more extras but you might not care, lower end modes have cheaper batteries and don&#x27;t last as long.  This mode in particular is great and you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> The instruction manual for the Braun 7850DLX (aka D17565X and XT, and Type 4729) tells on page 20 how to remove the battery \\&quot;at the end of the product&#x27;s useful life\\&quot;, and says \\&quot;Opening the handle will destroy the appliance and invalidate the guarantee\\&quot;, and \\&quot;You will not be able to place new batteries in the handle.\\&quot;  My old Braun toothbrush, type 4804, was maybe 30 years old or more and I had a shaver shop replace its battery about 3 times.  It&#x27;s disappointing to learn, after buying the new toothbrush, that its rechargeable battery is not replaceable.  The expected \\&quot;useful life\\&quot; of the \\&quot;product\\&quot; is not hinted at in the manual, except that the warranty is good for 24 months.  Moral:  read the manual before buying stuff.     My rating is based on this finding, but before charging or using the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Ive found competing products out there for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;What more to say.</li>
            <li> I am rather disappointed with this purchase. There were so many good reviews when I bought it that I thought it must be great.  I am really wondering if people who work for the company&#x27;s of Oral B and Sonicare don&#x27;t write these reviews.      What I expect out of an electric toothbrush is to be able to clean with slight pressure and without having to brush like a normal toothbrush. I hate to say it but this kind of feels like the cheap $10 electric toothbrush you can buy at your drugstore.  It does not clean nearly well enough so you end up having to use it almost like a normal toothbrush just to get the stuff off your teeth like after a meal.  In fact many times I have to go over my teeth with a normal toothbrush if I have just eaten, or I have to rinse first.      I just had a checkup after using this for 6 months and luckily no cavities but I did have lots of build up.  Likely because it does not really clean the teeth.     You are better off sticking with a normal toothbrush or trying another brand.  I just ordered a sonicare flex care.  So far it is much much better.  Actually cleans stuff off my teeth.  Haven&#x27;t had a checkup but hopefully I will have less buildup because of it.</li>
            <li> love this works great.</li>
            <li> I feared my dentist. I was sure she enjoyed using the drill on my tender gums and teeth. Then she recommended sonicare. However, I found that sonicare with its large brush head was best for people with big mouth. Oral B on the other hand had round smaller head that was easy to use on the my molars. The brush itself cleaned effectively and quickly. It has been almost an year and my dentist struggles to find plaque and tartar on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got this one and the old Sonicare toothbrush.  I bought this one as a replacement for my Sonicare, whose juice has just about run out.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: smaller head, cheaper heads, interdental head, cheaper toothbrush&lt;BR&gt;Cons: not as clean feeling as old Sonicare, battery life is worse, head life is shorter, no quadpacer&lt;br /&gt;The two-speed thing feels useless because the lower speed feels harsher.  The spinning brush doesn&#x27;t do a better job either.  Basically, you get what you pay for.  Sonicare costs more and is better.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned. I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get one. My teeth have been feeling very sparkly. I highly recommend getting a power toothbrush if you don&#x27;t already have one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tend to brush too hard - get in there and attack those teeth! Take no prisoners! Watch the gum lines recede! So the new toothbrush has been a good thing as far as that goes - I just have to hold it against my teeth and I can feel it working, so I don&#x27;t feel a need to scrub. In fact, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve really felt that I&#x27;m cleaning behind my back molars, which is something my dental hygienist mentions every visit. I&#x27;m actually kind of looking forward to my next dentist visit, just to see if the new toothbrush really has made a difference. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This model spins and pulses in and out at some ridiculously fast speed - it has a slower speed, but I haven&#x27;t felt the need to use it. It has a timer that vibrates every 30 seconds, so you can spend 30 seconds on each quadrant of your mouth and know that you&#x27;ve brushed for the recommended 2 minutes. Also a nice feature for me since I tend to short-change my brushing time. I did have to learn to avoid the power button - it&#x27;s right where I want to rest my thumb. It came with his and her brush sets. There&#x27;s a regular brush and a neat tapered brush for between the teeth, which is almost as good as flossing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fairly nice looking unit and the brush storage is discreet but easy to access. It has a charging light that&#x27;s bright enough to double as a nightlight. It flashes when it&#x27;s charging and is steady when charged. Believe me, you don&#x27;t want to be able to see it from your bedroom if it&#x27;s charging at night - it makes for a kind of strobe-light effect. The battery charge is supposed to last for a week with normal use, but I&#x27;ve just left the base plugged in, so I haven&#x27;t tested that out.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable Oral-B ProfessionalCare 7000 series toothbrushes are the best value when it comes to electric toothbrushes. It cleans teeth by both pulsation (in-and-out movement) and oscillation (side-to-side movement). Reviews say the Oral-B toothbrush is comfortable and easy to use, although some testers complain that it&#x27;s a bit noisy. The built-in power sensor is a helpful feature that stops bristle movement if you&#x27;re brushing too hard. There&#x27;s a two-minute timer (but no auto-shut-off) with 30-second beep to signal you to clean another area. The Sonicare toothbrush above gets slightly better ease-of-use scores, but the 7000 series is less expensive for essentially the same features. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For value for money toothbrush, look no further than Oral B - However I would recommend if you had a little more money to look for Sonicare products - it&#x27;s just that little bit better</li>
            <li> This is a good toothbrush and you won&#x27;t have to buy replacements for the 6-10 months.  While brushing, it works best to progress slowly from tooth to tooth without trying to brush back and forth or in circles.  It definitely does better than regular brushing but my checkups are not better than before I started using the brush.  The back teeth and the gumline seemed to be missed more but the main surfaces feel smoother.  After 2 years, the battery is not holding charge well anymore and the charge indicator LED lights only dimly.  Overall, I would say it is worth it but I want to see if there is something better.  I am going to buy a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I like the 4 brush holder and the power and brushing action of this model.  The kids find the 30 second interval timer especially helpful to keep moving around the mouth.  It&#x27;s a bit louder than the older model, probably because it&#x27;s got an additional motion, and the blue charging light is bright enough for a night light. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, just what we wanted.</li>
            <li> If you have any gum problems, or just like the feeling of teeth that have been thoroughly cleaned, you&#x27;re going to love this toothbrush.  It cleans under the edge of the gums so that all the tartar and other gunk gets taken away.  The built-in timer (one signal every 30 seconds for each quarter of your mouth, then another to tell you you&#x27;ve finished two minutes) helps you to make sure you brush your teeth sufficiently.  This is just a part of a complete program to ward off gum disease, but it&#x27;s a critical one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for over a year now and the results are obvious - my hygenist was commenting on how my gums looked great and that I had NO plaque (except a teensy bit on one tooth). Before the Oral-B, I had a cavity almost every time I went to the dentist and my gums would always be a little softer than they should be. Not any more!! Honestly, the best $80 I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I purchase an electric toothbrush since I am getting older and I want my teeth to last.  I have no idea what he&#x27;ll say when I have my next appointment, but I expect that he will have good things to say.  This toothbrush is the easiest thing to use.  I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t purchase one a long time ago.  It charges quickly, and I particularly like the design of the stand, since it holds all the brushes I use.  I also like the fact that I can rinse the brushes and the handle under running water without damaging them.  My guess is that I&#x27;ll get a good review from my dentist also!</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I have ever used, so I don&#x27;t have any others to compare it to...but I love it! It is easy to use, nice looking and has a timing feature so that you can brush your teeth for the suggested 2 minutes. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> For the price it was more than I expected. The power toothbrush works just as advertised, excellent and the extra cleaning brushes makes for an even better deal. I&#x27;m more than satisfied with this product and will purchase another once this one dies. An excellent choice.</li>
            <li> Were you told by your dentist to floss, floss, floss and you would not get bloody gums, but that you had to floss first on a regular basis before this would happen???  &lt;br /&gt;Well, for me, flossing gave me bloody gums... even after flossing many times a week, for weeks in a row, my gums would still be ultra sensitive. &lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Oral B toothbrushes for only 3-4 months (received as a gift for christmas &#x27;03) now and have noticed a difference in the strength of my gums.  Okay, so I slacked off and didn&#x27;t floss _at all_ since I got the Oral B toothbrush...  A couple weeks ago I flossed and you would *think that I would get very bloody gums after not flossing for months, BUT NO!  The floss didn&#x27;t even hurt my gums like floss normally would if had been using a soft bristle toothbrush 100% of the time.  &lt;br /&gt;I have also came to the conclusion that oral B toothbrushes even clean your teeth better as well!  Now, when I was younger I had braces and so I can tell you that having straighter teeth is definately more convenient while brushing your teeth.  Not as much crap stuck in your teeth; however, flossing is still required to strengthen your gums to avoid gum disease.  I believe even if you had slightly less perfect teeth the benefits of using the Oral B toothbrushes are still better than using just normal toothbrushes... you will never have a problem with plaque again with normal usage of an Oral B toothbrush.  &lt;br /&gt;Good Vibrations:&lt;BR&gt;There are two settings for the toothbrush: high and medium setting(and the OFF setting, if you count that).  There isn&#x27;t a low setting as I might prefer on really sleepy mornings so this is the ONLY con to using the toothbrush.  Sometimes I would occastionally prefer to use a soft bristle toothbrush if I didn&#x27;t feel like having a motor toothbrush pulsating in my mouth.  For the most part I always use the medium setting on the toothbrush and that is comfortable. &lt;br /&gt;If you are in your early 20&#x27;s, you are at risk for acquiring gum disease.  This is when dentists start checking your gums every time you go to the dentist.  I am disappointed I was not recommended these toothbrushes... but they really work wonders for your dental hygeine and to strengthen gums(and Lysine helps too).  Flossing? Well, you can still floss,...except when you do it, it will be without PAIN! Yay flossing:) &lt;br /&gt;USING THIS TOOTHBRUSH IS THE #1 way to avoid GUM DISEASE!</li>
            <li> I had an Interplaque electric toothbrush, which was great. The plaque really came off, and my teeth felt smooth to the tongue. The thing finally broke, and I decided to get this Oral B as a replacement. What a disappointment. I tried the circular brush, and the double brush head. It&#x27;s big and bulkn, makes a lot of noise and hub-bub in your mouth. It often stops if you press too hard against your teeth. But the main problem is that my teeth are not smooth afterwards. It simply does not work as well as the old interplaque. I think the interplaques bristles went in and out and rotated. These bristles do not rotate, and what they DO do does not work as well. I spend a hundred bucks on this including a pack of double brush heads. I then bought the new version of the interplaque, made by Conair, for about $20. My teeth are smoother, and brush head is smaller, and it just works better. (used without toothpaste, though sometimes with an anti-plaque mouthwash). I don&#x27;t know why the interplaque is not more widely popular. It just works better.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 7850DLX for about a week now, and so far I&#x27;m happy with it.  I&#x27;m glad this one doesn&#x27;t have that two minute timer built in, I know when to stop brushing my teeth!  Instead of making the light blink on and off when it&#x27;s charging, they should have made it so a light stays on steadily, and shuts off when it&#x27;s charged.  The blinking light doesn&#x27;t bother me though, mine stays in the kitchen.  I like the way the brush-head spins, my last toothbrush just vibrated.  Some people may think it&#x27;s a bit expensive, but you get what you pay for.  Hopefully it&#x27;s made to last.  Amazon is selling this product at the right price, I paid exactly the same thing at a department store.</li>
            <li> After hearing my neighbor Gladys declare she would never go back to a manual toothbrush after trying an electric, I just had to see for myself.  I chose this one because of all the positive feedback and will add mine to those.  I LOVE this one.  At first I thought I had overbought because didn&#x27;t think I needed the 30 second reminder to change areas, but find that is one of the top features as it takes the guesswork out of wondering if you are spending enough/even time  across all teeth.  Just like having a professional dental cleaning every single time I use it.  Now I as well will NEVER go back to a manual toothbrush.  Also like having the different brushing heads to work with.  Finding also that my toothpaste goes farther.  Looking forward to my next dental visit to see if it has made a difference as far as my dentist is concerned.  The only trouble I find is with the power button being right where I would usually rest my thumb--I keep accidentally turning it off.  My husband is trying it out too and so far thinks its wonderful.  With the four-part storage chamber for the brush heads, it has plenty of room to store for more than one user.</li>
            <li> The first time I used Oral-B I was surprised. I had no idea that it was so good. My mouth feels \\&quot;so fresh and so clean clean\\&quot;. Now I have a faster way to brush my teeth. I also have my own personal dentist now.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this model. I bought it to replace an old Oral-b that now seems really underpowered compared to this. I really think they can produce this item in a different color, like all yellow and sell it as a grout cleaner. Anyways buy it!!!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product after reading so many great reviews.  Nobody mentioned the fact that it is so loud you feel like you are at the dentist(sounds like the drill), and that when used on high speed your brain actually shakes in you head?  Not so sure I would have spent such a great deal of money for a TOOTHBRUSH.  I do remember a reviewer mentioning the flasing blue light.  It is pretty bright...</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush in Feb. and began noticing a difference very quickly after I began using it.  My teeth feel cleaner and I love brushing my teeth.  I had my first dentist appointment since using the brush about a week ago and it was the best appointment of my life. I used to hate going to the dentist, this was the first time in ages that I haven&#x27;t had a cavity, and both my hygenist and dentist commented on my \\&quot;great brushing\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush and I love it.  I&#x27;m a compulsive brusher who routinely spends 3 or more minutes brushing 2 -3 times per day.  While shopping for a replacement Braun electric shaver I came across ads and reviews for Braun/Oral B toothbrushes and went for the 7000 series.  Expensive, but I ordered the 2-handle pack online for about $82. My wife and I now love &#x27;em.  I can brush for 2 - 2 &amp; half minutes now and my teeth are clearly cleaner than when flailing away with the hand brush.  Glad I found it...</li>
            <li> My teath feel so smooth after brushing with it</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this toothbrush to replace my old Sonicare brush and I am amazed at how much cleaner my teeth feel. It literally feels like I just stepped out of the dentist--every time I use it. Not to mention how much healthier my gums feel.  Even my dentist noticed the difference!  My teeth also appear to be much whiter. Plus, the small, round head on the Oral-B brush is so much easier to reach my back teeth, (much better than the oversized head of the Sonicare brush). And this brush cost less money too!  I would definitely recommend this toothbrush for anyone that really cares about their teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> [I have been using a $12 battery operated toothbrush (changeable heads of course!) for over 2 yrs now and loving it since day one. Why I have waited so long to upgrade, I don&#x27;t know. My old brush had a mini head like this Braun does and I would not consider any toothbrush with any other type or size head. Think about it, dentists&#x27; polishing instruments are all small and round so that they can get in and around each individual tooth.] As I expected, this new Braun toothbrush is wonderful. I found the high speed too fast for my liking, but the slower speed is fine. I like the timer (it does not turn the brush off-just pulsates at 30 second intervals, then shudders at 2 min.) which cues you to an adequate amount of time to brush your teeth per quadrant. You&#x27;ll find you will be brushing with much less force, but getting much more clean. However, (if you&#x27;re like me) gone are your days of wandering around your home while brushing. These snazzy toothbrushes will have you frothing like a rabid dog! I think this is a very small price to pay for a product which will absolutely give you that fresh from the Dental Hygientist cleaning feeling. Your teeth will feel marvelous, your smile will be brighter, and your gums tremendously more healthy. What a wise investment for one of your most important personal hygiene needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the much cheaper, AA battery-powered version of this Braun power brush for a year or two, and I really like it. I wrote a review of it in that section, so if you are interested, take a look.&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to give my little brush a rest and try out this big brother version.  I have to say, I&#x27;m very impressed.  This thing is so powerful it feels like a dental scaler.  While I&#x27;m certain it can&#x27;t take off tarter (only your dentist can do that), I *am* certain that no plaque remains after using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;The timer, which I thought was just a gimmick, actually works well.  It doesn&#x27;t beep at the 30 second mark, it vibrates instead, which is very unobtrusive and works well. So far, I&#x27;ve been brushing for the full two minutes instead of my usual 20 seconds or so (hey, I&#x27;m in a hurry!) because of the timer. According to Braun, brushing for two minutes takes off about 25% more plaque than brushing for one minute, and I don&#x27;t doubt it.  Most people don&#x27;t brush anywhere near long enough, and the timer does make it easier.&lt;br /&gt;It is completely sealed, and rinses off easily.  It is lightweight, well-balanced, and easy to hold and use.  The integral rubber grips help when it is wet.&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty quiet too, perhaps quieter than my little AA-powered brush.  Not loud enough to be annoying.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that the brushes on all the Brauns are the same (except for the power cross-action brush), which lets you change from one to the other without buying new brush heads.  The heads are fairly reasonably priced given what they are, and seem well-designed and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;If there is a drawback, it is that you&#x27;ll have to make sure you brush over a sink as the power brush combined with toothpaste creates some foam.  Not enough to make using it difficult, but you won&#x27;t be leaving the safety of the sink, either.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, then you have just returned from the dentist and have vowed to take better care of your teeth.&lt;BR&gt;This toothbrush is a great buy!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;BR&gt;1. Teeth feel cleaner compared to brushing with a regular toothbrush. I will never go back to regular toothbrushing again. It&#x27;s just more convenient and most of us are probably brushing incorrectly anyway. &lt;BR&gt;2. small brush head to reach the \\&quot;hard to reach\\&quot; places, like the molars.&lt;BR&gt;3. easy to use.&lt;BR&gt;4. replacement brush heads are relatively inexpensive.&lt;BR&gt;5. price for the unit is not too bad.&lt;BR&gt;6. big difference in performance as compared to the $15 base oral b electronic toothbrush i use to own.&lt;BR&gt;7. 2 speed option just in case. (i dont really care for this feature).&lt;BR&gt;8. great for taking care of the gums. I use to focus more on brushing my teeth, but with this toothbrush it helps take care of the gum line too.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Cons:&lt;BR&gt;1. the toothbrush heads can be detached and stored but the problem is that after a couple of days it gets dirty in the storage area. just be sure to clean that area out frequently as you do not want to keep use a toothbrush that has a bunch of bacteria on it.&lt;BR&gt;2. while the small brush heads make it convenient to reach harder places, you have to keep in mind that there is less surface area for the brush head so you literally have to brush tooth by tooth which takes a longer.&lt;BR&gt;3. brushing can get a bit messy.&lt;BR&gt;4. no auto shut-off feature (discussed below).&lt;BR&gt;5. not as satisfied when trying to clean my tongue and below the tongue. (could be because of the small brush head)&lt;br /&gt;Compared with Sonicare 7500.&lt;BR&gt;1. price- oral b has price going for it.&lt;BR&gt;2. reliability- this is arguable but i have never had any problems whatsoever with previous oral b products. While reading the reviews of the sonicare models I came across some reviews that indicated problems here and there. (i just didnt want to deal with that type of problem.)&lt;BR&gt;3. RPM - the oral b model spins at approx. 40,000 rpm vs 31,000 rpm for the sonicare. i really dont know how much a factor the difference in speed helps but i assume that faster is better (?).&lt;BR&gt;4. both the oral b and the sonicare models feature oscillating heads. (although not noted on the oral b description). (again, i dont know how much it helps having an oscillating feature).&lt;BR&gt;5. No auto shut off feature- The Oral B does not have this feature, while the sonicare does. The reason why i believe this is an important feature is because at 40,000 rpm&#x27;s you don&#x27;t know exactly how much pressure is ok to use with the Oral B. At least with the sonicare, if you are using too much pressure, it shuts off automatically. Incorrect brushing can cause excessive wear and tear on portions of the teeth- such as with the enamel. Especially with the rise in use of whitening toothpastes that have more granules and such, you can do damage to the outer layer of the teeth. just keep in mind that you do not want to use too much pressure while brushing. &lt;BR&gt;6. curiosity- being that we always want things that we dont have, i am curious as to how the sonicare performs.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: great buy, and i am now a believer of electronic toothbrushes. i have tried regular brushing and it just doesnt feel the same anymore. dont expect this toothbrush to do miracles because in the end its a toothbrush. Even so, it performs as promised and my next dentist appointment will hopefully confirm that the health of my teeth and gums have improved. Price is reasonable and i do not foresee any issues with reliability.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew before what I was missing out on. This toothbrush is awesome. Talk about getting your teeth really clean and gums treated well simultaneously. I will never go back to an ordinary toothbrush again. I have multiple crowns and a bridge and could NEVER get above the crowns along the gumline with an ordinary brush as I can with the 7850 DLX. If you have gum disease, it is a definite sure solution to a quick healing. I also highly recommend this particular model because of it&#x27;s performance and because you have the storage compartment for your brushes. It can be mounted to the wall also for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 2017....I still own this device and it is still running good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for 9 months now and it&#x27;s been wicked good.  My teeth feel fresh.  The toothbrush hasn&#x27;t broken or shown signs of wear.  The battery still charges well.  I find that the heads don&#x27;t wear down as fast as they say.  Overall--satisfied.</li>
            <li> I had been using a 10 year old model and decided to get this one.  The major improvement is the better battery charger.  The two speeds and 30 second timer are so so.  The speed difference between fast and slow is small.  I brush by going over the whole set of teeth several times so the timer does me no good.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, it actually took my Oral B Professional Care 7850 DLX a total of 19 hours and a few more minutes to be fully charged for the first time (the manual states that it takes at least 16 hours for a full charge, so keep this in mind). Several heads come with this set and in my opinion, the Extra Soft Brushheads would be good for polishing fine jewelry perhaps; the bristles are so very soft.  I tried one of the FlexiSoft Brushheads, but quickly switched to a separately purchased Oral B Power Polisher head EB 18-3 (3 pack).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself not really paying attention to the timing of the 30 second vibration since I probably use it for two full cycles. One cycle totalling 2 minutes just doesn&#x27;t seem thorough.  I&#x27;ll say this though, no simple/manual toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned does as good of a job and I don&#x27;t think it can.  I&#x27;ve used this for a month now and have not noticed a change in my coloring, but my teeth do feel very clean and polished, in any case.  I attribute the lack of change to my consumption of carbonated, dark sodas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my rating system:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans teath and gums:  5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Improves staining:  3 stars (indifferent)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use:  4 stars (would be easier for me if I  were only one using it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed options:  3 stars (would like it to be at slow speed to start, paste goes flying off fast otherwise)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clothing intact:  3 stars (dribble factor, always have to keep chin up and keep a kleenex at the ready)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:  5 stars (most places charge $100. for this one, or more)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease in getting replacement heads: 4 stars (most brick and mortar places have tons of the extra soft heads, and usually some flexisoft heads, harder to find the Polishing heads, not to mention cheaper here on Amazon.com anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery:  1 star (it seems every deluxe toothbrush out there now only uses battery packs that, upon removal, destroy something on the circuit board, rendering it inoperable....I used to have a Braun and was able to replace the battery by having one built at Batteries Plus...up until the Braun gave up the ghost)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;___________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d give this a handicapped total of 4 stars since I believe that some of my ratings would apply to any brand/type of deluxe toothbrush out there.t there now only uses battery packs that, upon removal, destroy something on the circuit board, rendering it inoperable....I used to have a Braun and was able to replace the battery by having one built at Batteries Plus...up until the Braun gave up the ghost) &lt;br /&gt;___________________________________________________________ &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d give this a handicapped total of 4 stars since I believe that some of my ratings would apply to any brand/type of deluxe toothbrush out there.</li>
            <li> This is one of those purchases -- like my iPod, my electric do-it-yourself hair clipper, and my subscription to NetFlix -- that have made my life a lot more pleasant.  No regrets at all.  More important, on my last visit to the dentist, after having used the brush for around a month, I was praised for how good my teeth and gums looked.  Is this particular model the best or even the best value?  I haven&#x27;t the faintest idea.  I suspect almost any electric toothbrush is pretty good, if you use it regularly for a couple of minutes each night.  I spent a lot of time researching the various competing brands and models and ended up choosing this one, but whether I could have gotten just as good a brush for less money is entirely possible.  I&#x27;m not mad about the fact that part of this brush&#x27;s barrel stays lit, like a purple night light, to show that it&#x27;s fully charged (and that it blinks on and off to show that it&#x27;s charging) -- not necessary!  Nor, after a couple of weeks of warmup, do I need the slower speed (the brush has two speeds).  Aside from that, I like the way it feels and I like the little signal it gives after each 30-second interval, with a more extended signal after two minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my 7850DLX toothbrush for about a month and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It cleans very well and is comfortable to use. When I used my manual brush I  didn&#x27;t spend the recommended time brushing.  With this brush I know I&#x27;m doing it two minutes every time. It feels like a quality product and is a good balance of price and features.  I like knowing I&#x27;m taking much better care of my teeth. With the price of dental care, this brush is a very good investment.</li>
            <li> Good product but if you have an extra $30, please spend it on a upgraded model. This product will last over 7 years in most cases.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush! It&#x27;s small and powerful, just like the ones dentists use.  There are two speeds, fast and slow, so it ok for people with sensitive teeth.  I prefer this over the Sonicare Elite because it is MUCH smaller.  The timer function is good, and saves time because you don&#x27;t need to over brush.  It does whiten the teeth, even without whitening toothpaste.  The brush is definitely worth the price and because it is smaller, I prefer it over the Sonicare Elite.</li>
            <li> At first use the large brush was too big, however after swapping to the small brush this toothbrush is awesome!!  The timer is most convenient and easy to use.  Great replacement for my old one that I paid almost twice as much for.</li>
            <li> We love this new power toothbrush because it does a great job cleaning the teeth and it has so much more power than our old brush.</li>
            <li> I like the oral b line, had very good luck with them.  Ordering was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I bought this Braun/Oral-B Professional Care power toothbrush to replace my previous Philips SoniCare toothbrush.  Although the brush heads are equally expensive, the Oral-B was sealed much better and did not succumb to moisture that seeped inside and eventually shorted out the electronics, which is what killed my SoniCare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was disappointed that the Oral-B toothbrush&#x27;s head didn&#x27;t spin/vibrate as fast as my previous SoniCare, but I quickly found that it had much better reach inside my mouth, and could really clean every little crevice, nook, and cranny around my teeth and gums.  Overall, the Oral-B&#x27;s maneuverability allowed me to get my teeth a lot cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried some generic toothbrush heads to save on cost, but the bristles were much harder than those of the genuine Oral-B brush heads.  (Ideally, you want to use the softest brush possible to help avoid damaging your tooth enamel.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, after almost ten years of faithful service, the Lithium Ion battery no longer holds a charge.  I might try replacing the battery, but for the time being I just steal my wife&#x27;s brush handle, which is a newer, faster model.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is far better than my original electric toothbrush by far.  I love the 30 second warning for each quadrant and the space provided to hold extra toothbrush heads.  Would recommend this to anyone.  Feels like a professional cleaning daily!</li>
            <li> The item arrived in a timely manner, in an undamaged box, and I am pleased with this order from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I just bought this toothbrush a few days ago and I am already sure that I am going to keep it.  It feels great when I brush and my teeth look much cleaner after using it.  The extra brusheads that come with the package are extremely useful, and might I add it makes the purchase a great value.  The only downside is that the &#x27;hygenic&#x27; storage compartment is a little plastic hole in the top of the charging unit covered by a flimsy plastic cover, which might let dust settle down into the compartment.</li>
            <li> I got this on recommendation from my dentist and boy am I so pleased with the results.  At my age, you worry more about gums care than cavities.  Regular tooth brushes just was not providing what I needed no matter how many times I brushed.  I could tell the difference in a week, in two I was really surprised, by the end of three weeks, even my dentist was surprised.&lt;br /&gt;This only only clear so well, it conditions your gums so it fights gums receding and gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;So make the most of your brushing minutes each day and save yourself a lot of problems down the road and keep that smile dazzling.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these to give as Christmas gifts and the recipients raved so much I had to buy one for myself.  I will probably only use the firmer brush heads so the added heads are \\&quot;lost\\&quot; on me.  I very much like the compact size and will attach this to the wall rather than stand it on the surface.  (I shopped extensively for this item and learned you can buy replacement handheld only and continue to use the charger base forever.  I shall be buying my spouse a handheld only soon.)  A tiny quirk of mine ... I really like to \\&quot;blue\\&quot; indicator charging light! My unit came with a battery only toothbrush bonus ... why?  I will only use the 7500 series with the pulse and high brush rate!  A downside?  The literature indicates the blue bristles on the brush will wear off and tell me when to buy new .... they are expensive and I will not be able to fool myself that I can continue to use them once the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; is gone. Would Braun design the heads so the \\&quot;blue\\&quot; goes earlier rather than later?  Nah... I&#x27;m just being negative. :)</li>
            <li> Almost.....because nothing is perfect.  And it does have a shut-off feature - it is the third press of the &#x27;on&#x27; button.  The positions are &#x27;fast&#x27;, &#x27;slow&#x27; and &#x27;off&#x27;.  The various brushes are great - didn&#x27;t think I would use more than 1 or 2, but after trying all four, I see their individual benefit.  It would be a good idea to get a child used to this as young as possible because it cleans so well in a short time, especially with the choice of different size heads.  Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush: 2 minute timer w/ 30 second intervals (but it keeps going after 2 minutes - you have to shut it off), pressure sensitive, adjustable speeds, many attachments (basically - all of them), easy wall attachment option included with screws, and a long battery life BUT a one inch tall portion of tooth brush base/handle flashes blue when charging and stays blue when charged. If you need this as a reminder or want a \\&quot;night light\\&quot; (you certainly won&#x27;t knock it over in the middle of the night if you have it sitting on the counter), the blue light is great but I don&#x27;t like it from an aethestic standpoint. However, my more practical husband does like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it a five because my husband is delighted with it AND though I&#x27;m a long-time \\&quot;brusher in the shower\\&quot; and a \\&quot;wander around the house with a tooth brush in my mouth\\&quot; and a \\&quot;chewer of tooth brushes\\&quot; &amp; a \\&quot;new toothbrush every month\\&quot; person (also a person that gets slammed by their dentist for brushing toooo hard), I must admit that this brush really gets your teeth CLEAN. Almost dentist clean. And it feels great. I have my teeth cleaned every 4 months but if I used this brush consistently, I&#x27;d bet they&#x27;d never have any plaque to chip - even in the bottom front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on this brush even if it does require more effort on my part.</li>
            <li> This cleans great, and its true... you&#x27;ll never want to brush with a normal toothbrush again. The small head is the perfect size to get all your teeth and not take up too much space in your mouth. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now, and it still holds it charge, and the magic doesn&#x27;t stop! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I wanted to address some of the previous complains... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) LED light - unless your cuddling with a charging unit at night, the blue light will not bother you. it makes a modern nightlight for the bathroom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2) Noise - it&#x27;s a little noisy, but what do you expect? it&#x27;s not like you can do anything else when you&#x27;re brushing your teeth anyways. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3) Cleaning power - this can clean anything. I&#x27;m lazy when it comes to flossing, but after using this brush, there seems to be no need to floss! i can see the spaces between my front teeth after i brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hated the concept of using electronics to brush your teeth.  I&#x27;ve always felt like it makes all of human-kind less capable of survival by needing a machine to brush teeth...I bought this for my wife, used it once and haven&#x27;t been able to stop since.</li>
            <li> This really is an excellent brush. I have had it over a year and love it.</li>
            <li> First off, I must say this is the best electronic brush I have used to date. Having tried some of the lesser-priced models out there...none of them thrilling me, I went ahead and splurged on this one. I bought the stripped-down version (brush only, no extras) at Target for $50 a couple of months ago.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;BR&gt;1. It is powerful. You will feel instantly comforted that you didn&#x27;t just purchase a gimmick. If the high setting is too much for you, mashing the button will take you to a lower speed.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is ergonomically sound. The shape and grip of this brush make brushing easy, and it can get to far back teeth quite well.&lt;BR&gt;3. It looks nice and has a small footprint on your countertop - if that means anything to you.&lt;BR&gt;4. The brush will not overcharge, unlike many rechargeable electronics, which allows you to keep it fully charged all the times without worrying about killing your battery life. And that is important considering that the battery cannot be replaced.&lt;BR&gt;5. Oral-B/Braun guarantees that you will be satisfied with the results of this brush, and if you&#x27;re not - even after 2 years of use - they will give you a full refund. That&#x27;s what the manual says at least.&lt;BR&gt;6. Built-in timer gives you an idea of how long you&#x27;ve been brushing. Dentists recommend at least two minutes&lt;BR&gt;7. You&#x27;re teeth will feel great, and your gums will surely be more healthy if you use this properly. Remember to brush your gums as much as your teeth...this will stimulate blood flow, and will also help rid bacteria from under the gum line.&lt;BR&gt;8. Whitens naturally - over time. I quit smoking about four months ago, and since then my oral-b has helped remove stubborn tobacco stains from the backs of my front teeth. &lt;BR&gt;9. Cleans in between teeth better than a normal toothbrush, but should not be considered a substitute to flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;BR&gt;1. I guess some people will consider this unit and the accompanying brush heads expensive, but you should put it in prospective...over timeyou will need less cleaning/scraping/drilling/surgery at the dentist/oral surgeon, and will have better overall oral health. That&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;Advise: Do not use abrasive whitening toothpastes with this brush. The brush is powerful enough to whiten \\&quot;naturally\\&quot;, and abrasive toothpastes may damage your teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a basic Sonicare for about two years now and just switched to the Oral-B 7850dlx.&lt;br /&gt;Cost:&lt;br /&gt;One of the things that bothered me about the Sonicare was the high price of replacement heads and, at times, difficulty in finding a replacement head at all.  The Oral-B 7850 doesn&#x27;t have this problem.  The replacement heads, while still more than a regular tooth brush, are far cheaper than Sonicare&#x27;s.  The cost of the brush itself, depending on where you purchase it, is also far less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Operation:&lt;br /&gt;Both Sonicare and Oral-B have the same principle of 30 seconds per quadrant of your mouth to make a total of 2 minutes brushing.  As others have noted, the drawback here is the lack of an automatic shut-off on the Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of cleanliness, the base of the Sonicare rests inside its recharger where old tooth paste and general muck tend to accumulate.  The Oral-B, however, rests on top of a rod.  Since there&#x27;s no depression there&#x27;s far less mess and what there is you see and can immediately clean up.&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:&lt;br /&gt;Consumer Reports has ranked Oral-B as being the best electronic tooth brush.  It seems that other researchers have confirmed that conclusion.  The smaller head of the Oral-B is far more effective at getting at hard to reach areas.  After just a few days use it seems to me that it is indeed better at cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare is a good brush.  But in just a few days use I can safely say that the Oral-B is better.  It&#x27;s cheaper and more effective.  About the only drawback I&#x27;ve seen is that it feels less solid than the Sonicare.  It just feels like it might break more easily.  But for now my brush is working great.  I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my husband on the advice of my dentist. I&#x27;ve never been one to spend a whole lot of time on my teeth, and I am paying for it now, as I get older. I hate using Listerine and I hate flossing. So I was surprised at how much I enjoy this toothbrush. It really makes your gums feel much better. My husband&#x27;s teeth are looking much less yellow, and he says his gums feel better also. This is an inexpensive way of fixing your teeth so you don&#x27;t have to spend as much money and time at the dentist. If they are recommending this, at the risk of having less work to do, and promote dental health, I would certainly listen to the dentist.</li>
            <li> When I usually go to the dentist, it&#x27;s the same story: a handful of cavities, sore gums, and a lecture about proper brushing and flossing. Last time I went was 2.5 years ago just because I couldn&#x27;t bear the thought of more drilling and scraping.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But! I got this toothbrush based on the reviews here about a year ago and have used it almost every day. The results: the dentist said I have perfect teeth and gums today! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just having that handy 30-second timer that keeps me brushing for 2 mins or whether it&#x27;s the 40,000+ pulses or what, but I&#x27;m sure about one thing. This toothbrush works. I&#x27;m buying a few more for my friends!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a much better toothbrush than the typical $20 unit you may get on sale. Ergonomic design, the relief after brushing, the timer and the autostop feature in case of overpressure on your gums are all very nice. It will cut your dental bills in due course. But most importantly, you LOOK FORWARD to using this brush because it is A TOOTH MASSAGER.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What could have been better? Instead of two speeds, there may have been a user adjustable knob to vary the speed. Of course, such a thing may make the unit less resistant to water. The instruction manual suggests that the unit should not be used in shower, but I dont believe it will suffer any leaks. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION: BUY! BUY! BUY! &lt;br /&gt;****************************** &lt;br /&gt;However, you can get a great deal on it in different ways.  &lt;br /&gt;(1) The lowest price, I saw at Amazon for it was 60$. On Ebay, you can get the same unit in brand new condition for around $40 including shipping. &lt;br /&gt;(2) You can buy another Braun/Oral-B product and use the rebate Amazon offers (either $30 or $50 depending on the offer). For example, you can get the Braun 7526 refurbished razor with this brush ($50), and activate the $50 rebate, so you can get the razor for free.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviews, I find that this toothbrush is excellent -- with one significant flaw.  The LED light that blinks when the toothbrush is on the charger.  This light is so bright that it keeps me up at night.  I had to move my charger into the kitchen so that I didn&#x27;t see it at night.  ugh.</li>
            <li> The light: The blue light that stay on/brink all the time is very annoying. My wife called it a Starwar toothbrush. It is so bright like there is a light saber in our bathroom. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The noise: The unit operate quite noisy. It remind me of cleaning at dentist office. It is OK for every six months, but not everyday. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The plus side is it works quite robustly. If it would get the rough edges out of it. It would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the second Oral B electric brush I have owed.  They do a good job of getting your teeth clean with very little effort.  The first one I owned lasted almost 10 years.  I prefer this type of electic brush over the inexpensive, battery operated ones you can purchase or the old manual way of brushing.  It just gets your teeth cleaner.  This one has the timer for each quadrant which is helpful.</li>
            <li> I used to own a brush from another manufacturer.  It never brushed well: the heads wore out waaaaaaaay too quickly.  I just never felt I was getting a good brush.    After using this brush for about a couple of months, I went in for a regular checkup.  My dentist told me my teeth had never looked better.  That&#x27;s all the testimony I need.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush for my 2 young daughters.  It&#x27;s a great brush head for pediatric (and adult) mouths. They swap out the heads, it&#x27;s rechargeable and I can stop purchasing junky kids battery-operated toothbrushes every 1-2 months after the batteries wear down.  I have used this toothbrush for myself for the past 3 years and no longer have a problem with receding gums or plaque build-up.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes often fall off the power handle in the middle of brushing. This is very inconvenient. I would not buy again.</li>
