            <li>This is the best.  </li>
            <li>The best over the counter acne cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>It works amazing!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredible.</li>
            <li>(great when you&#x27;re just sitting around the house)  </li>
            <li>The 10% is great</li>
            <li>This is a great price for a 3-pack, too, and you will not regret having three.</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the brands and can&#x27;t say any of them are very effective on me.</li>
            <li>I know that Benzoyle Peroxide is good for treating Acne, that&#x27;s the reason why I got it</li>
            <li>So make sure you was your hands well after applying it!</li>
            <li>have used this product since I was 13 with amazing results for about 15 years.</li>
            <li>If you use this make sure to use a good moisturizer with it.  </li>
            <li>I read so many good review about this product and as it advertises the 24 hr acne treatment, I have seen no results whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>got like 3 pimples on my face, but I saw so many good reviews about this product, so I decided to get this product from Walgreens and gave it a try.</li>
            <li>really hope it will work for you, because it&#x27;s one of the best things to happen to me.</li>
            <li>Im super happy that I found a product that works</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for acnes out there and so far this one works great!.</li>
            <li>I dare say that it is a smidge more effective.</li>
            <li>Just dont try and mix chemicals so you wont break out even more.</li>
            <li>so I learned my lesson on thinking more products will work by using them together.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else.</li>
            <li>Within days my skin was clearing up and after a couple weeks my skin looked better than it has ever looked in my life.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using another 10% BP product that I like better:</li>
            <li>It blends into the skin instead of caking on top of it.</li>
            <li>I forgot how great this stuff really is, until it literally saved my butt.</li>
            <li>so I ordered it from Amazon and was pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>Love the three pack .</li>
            <li>My face is like how it was before, smooth with no zits or bumpiness!</li>
            <li>will last lifetime :) perfect buy.</li>
            <li>It disappears on my skin and works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>so they heal more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From off brand to doctor&#x27;s office brands, value to top dollar, it&#x27;s been on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Infact, I can see two more acne&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Not at all satisfied.</li>
            <li>and she does much better.</li>
            <li>What more needs to be said?</li>
            <li>I try most cream in the market &amp; this one don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>However, I will continue to use and buy more of this over the summer and update as I go along.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of clearing spots, and, for the most part, it prevents new spots from forming.</li>
            <li>Let me first say if you&#x27;ve never used this before there&#x27;s a good chance you will feel a \\&quot;burning sensation\\&quot; and if you wear it to bed it will bleach your pillows.</li>
            <li>if you do I am sure you will get great results but as to regards to clearasil, stay way CLEAR from it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised that it worked so fast and perfect!</li>
            <li>and whenever I put a product on my skin or even buy it, I meticulously check its ingredients list against the list of pore clogging ingredients (which you can find easily in google).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Same product as always - Great price</li>
            <li>As for my pillowcases they are light</li>
            <li>I am usuin an LED Light Therapy device which you can purchase for about 40 Pound (UK) and has three lights.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the summer it comes in handy especially when using heavier sunscreens that can cause more breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I know each and everyone of us react either negatively or positively top certain skin products but Clearasil did nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>This product does not work at all, despite all the other great reviews.</li>
            <li>The only thing to warn about is that if you apply this more than once a day, be sure to use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Great price, no smell, fast acting.</li>
            <li>I applied it to my face and chin much more generously than the directions suggested because as I mentioned, it didn&#x27;t really work for me the first time I bought the product.</li>
            <li>The Clearisil Daily (NOT the new \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot;, which is runny, doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well, and STINGS) is the best acne treatment cream I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>I only use this on my face every night and it helps amazingly.</li>
            <li>Good for breaking the heads of pimples that need to come out, with minimal damage to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With that in mind it&#x27;s kind of obvious that</li>
            <li>but it is pretty mild and washes away.</li>
            <li>I use it only for treating spots, and it works good this way, clearing pimples pretty fast.</li>
            <li>After about a year of a new skincare regime, I feel comfortable updating this review.</li>
            <li>I have a nice clear complexion on my rear face and it brings out the shine of my soft fur.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing short of outstanding.</li>
            <li>:) The only thing I should warn you is that I does bleach fabric.</li>
            <li>Steaming, hot showers.</li>
            <li>But yea it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve bought for pimple since somebody showed me this many years ago and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to last longer (per tube) than Oxy and the more \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; face</li>
            <li>I would suggest not wearing it during the day (only at night) unless you can make sure it will not at any point be transferred to your clothes.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well, which is all I can ask.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I saw nothing happen to my skin.</li>
            <li>But let me go back and explain before I start reviewing more on this</li>
            <li>simply bought Clearasil instead of oxy10 because amazon made it more affordable and convenient...</li>
            <li>So glad I did because it cleared up my white heads in 2 days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does dry out the skin a bit, so make sure you re-moisturize after you</li>
            <li>It does however bleach certain fabrics.</li>
            <li>However, when I do get breakouts, it&#x27;s my WHOLE FACE.</li>
            <li>This cream really helps me keep my face from breaking out.</li>
            <li>This REALLY helped my acne, but didn&#x27;t get rid of it</li>
            <li>rubbing it all over your face would be very wasteful.)  </li>
            <li>(I felt really sunburned).  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and Very well packaged.</li>
            <li>I sleep with white or light brown sheets and pillowcases.  </li>
            <li>Works really well on my granddaughter when she uses it.</li>
            <li>I use it absolutely every night</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve had acne my whole life, and have tried proactive before, but that&#x27;s never worked too well.</li>
            <li>Overall a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Clearasil once again.</li>
            <li>Like based on the instruction, we have to put a light layer on the entire surface.</li>
            <li>I regretted using it so much.</li>
            <li>A week later and my face is now acne &amp; blemish free.  </li>
            <li>I recommend using Clean and Clear Dual Action Moisturizer after the Benzoyl treatment.</li>
            <li>In the past I have had more colorful sheets ruined by my acne cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did clear up my skin at first</li>
            <li>I full endorse this product and hope others out there that uses this product does the same.</li>
            <li>Instead of going back to the Accutane, I went back to my healthy diet, used the clearasil, steamed, and took care of it before it could turn into what it was before.</li>
            <li>I brought this product hoping that it will help me once and for all eliminate Pimples and decrease the amount of pimples my skin produces, I know that having Acne is mainly a condition that occurs within the body</li>
            <li>a single tube lasts me a couple years since I don&#x27;t get huge breakouts</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the Walmart generic of Clean and Clear Persagel 10.</li>
            <li>The last spot treatment product I had used was \\&quot;Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Acne Spot Treatment, .75</li>
            <li>The 2.5% may be better for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>On the rare occasions when I&#x27;ve noticed any dryness starting to occur I just skip a day.  </li>
            <li>I was actually on the verge of tears when I came across a youtube video by someone who was simply talking about their own personal experience with treating acne.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out and make it produce more oil, like regular cleansers do.</li>
            <li>Then one day about two weeks ago this very large pimple began forming on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>Of course, my face because very dry and flaky but by the 4th day, I specifically noticed that my larger pimples either disappeared or were no longer as prominent.</li>
            <li>I say &amp;#34;for the most part,&amp;#34; because my acne formed below the surface of my skin, deep in my pores... and sometimes the skin can&#x27;t absorb this deep enough to stop the acne from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>I put neutrogena on first and Clarity on second then a emulsion moisturizer after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>It works fine to dry up the pimples, but I definitely will never rebuy it once I run out.</li>
            <li>Switching to a completely plant-based, low fat, low sodium, clean eating diet.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to go back to my tried and true Clearisil.  </li>
            <li>Instead of putting an enormous amount as he did, I opted to apply less but more frequently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m one of thousands who have gone through countless of acne products and researched hundreds of articles with little results.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had skin this clear since before I went through puberty.  </li>
            <li>Breaking a sweat once a day to clear the pores out.</li>
            <li>After my skin was clear and I didn&#x27;t break out anymore</li>
            <li>, I took the clear skin for granted.</li>
            <li>This stuff will help clear your skin in a matter of hours.</li>
            <li>The most effective spot treatment I&#x27;ve ever used, but the bleaching of clothes is just too annoying.</li>
            <li>My face is so clear now that I can&#x27;t be any happier.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is the only acne cream that really works for me.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and having been using this for almost thirty years.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and clear now.</li>
            <li>Clearasil alone cleared it completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li>I know that over the years I seemed to have developed an intolerance to products</li>
            <li>I continue to use it for the second night, I didn&#x27;t really see anything either.</li>
            <li>Ive been battling adult acne for 2 years now.</li>
            <li>Well, as it turns out it worked as promised and the pimple was pretty much completely gone after just 2 days, but my lip and nose was incredibly dry</li>
            <li>Every day, I would take a hot shower, dry myself off, and apply the product.</li>
            <li>Cheap compared to other similar products I have seen.</li>
            <li>Also, I must note that my skin is not very sensitive so aside from the dryness, the large amounts that I apply does not irritate my skin as it might for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin had never been rough either, and THIS IS THE FIRST TIME.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, be careful if this is your first time using the product.</li>
            <li>It takes care of the little zits quickly as well.</li>
            <li>His face was extremely dry and flaky for the first week but by the second, his skin was almost completely clear.</li>
            <li>It really halps dry up and prevent breakouts</li>
            <li>I used to have a constant acne breakout (at least 20 zits or more, ick)</li>
            <li>In addition I never ever put in on my entire face, only for spot treating, as this stuff is extremely drying and my skin looks like I&#x27;m 50 years old if I put this on my full face.</li>
            <li>Since the last few days I&#x27;ve been a total acne inspector (taught by my own bitter experience)</li>
            <li>It is not perfect, but for the most part it will clear up acne and prevent new breakouts, as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I personally use aloe gel since it moisturizes and can help clear up acne as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since the very beginning, and it is the only product that has stayed with me for so long.</li>
            <li>Apply it to spots directly after you take a shower when your pores are open.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I am self conscious of my red pimples on my posterior.</li>
            <li>I have suffered acne since adolescence through my entire adult life.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the product does not seem to actually prevent any new acne.</li>
            <li>Gentle Milk Cleanser - doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out like traditional soap.</li>
            <li>I apply a small dab because it can be super drying.</li>
            <li>i was so suprised that when i woke up the next morning my acne was actually starting to clear up</li>
            <li>It absorbs immediately and does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>This is one of the only holy grail products in my small, tried and true acne arsenal.</li>
            <li>The only other product I use now is the Yes to Cucumbers Gentle Milk Cleanser, for taking off my makeup.</li>
            <li>The results are well worth this small inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>Plus this stuff will dry out your face like crazy if you use it more than just a spot treatment, and I use it on my whole face, chest and back...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Same product as always - Great price</li>
            <li> As for my pillowcases they are light</li>
            <li> I am usuin an LED Light Therapy device which you can purchase for about 40 Pound (UK) and has three lights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the summer it comes in handy especially when using heavier sunscreens that can cause more breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I know each and everyone of us react either negatively or positively top certain skin products but Clearasil did nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> This product does not work at all, despite all the other great reviews.</li>
            <li> The only thing to warn about is that if you apply this more than once a day, be sure to use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great price, no smell, fast acting.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my face and chin much more generously than the directions suggested because as I mentioned, it didn&#x27;t really work for me the first time I bought the product.</li>
            <li> The Clearisil Daily (NOT the new \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot;, which is runny, doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well, and STINGS) is the best acne treatment cream I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  </li>
            <li> I only use this on my face every night and it helps amazingly.</li>
            <li> Good for breaking the heads of pimples that need to come out, with minimal damage to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With that in mind it&#x27;s kind of obvious that</li>
            <li> but it is pretty mild and washes away.</li>
            <li> I use it only for treating spots, and it works good this way, clearing pimples pretty fast.</li>
            <li> After about a year of a new skincare regime, I feel comfortable updating this review.</li>
            <li> I have a nice clear complexion on my rear face and it brings out the shine of my soft fur.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing short of outstanding.</li>
            <li> :) The only thing I should warn you is that I does bleach fabric.</li>
            <li> Steaming, hot showers.</li>
            <li> But yea it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve bought for pimple since somebody showed me this many years ago and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to last longer (per tube) than Oxy and the more \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; face</li>
            <li> I would suggest not wearing it during the day (only at night) unless you can make sure it will not at any point be transferred to your clothes.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well, which is all I can ask.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I saw nothing happen to my skin.</li>
            <li> But let me go back and explain before I start reviewing more on this</li>
            <li> simply bought Clearasil instead of oxy10 because amazon made it more affordable and convenient...</li>
            <li> So glad I did because it cleared up my white heads in 2 days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does dry out the skin a bit, so make sure you re-moisturize after you</li>
            <li> It does however bleach certain fabrics.</li>
            <li> However, when I do get breakouts, it&#x27;s my WHOLE FACE.</li>
            <li> This cream really helps me keep my face from breaking out.</li>
            <li> This REALLY helped my acne, but didn&#x27;t get rid of it</li>
            <li> rubbing it all over your face would be very wasteful.)  </li>
            <li> (I felt really sunburned).  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and Very well packaged.</li>
            <li> I sleep with white or light brown sheets and pillowcases.  </li>
            <li> Works really well on my granddaughter when she uses it.</li>
            <li> I use it absolutely every night</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had acne my whole life, and have tried proactive before, but that&#x27;s never worked too well.</li>
            <li> Overall a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Clearasil once again.</li>
            <li> Like based on the instruction, we have to put a light layer on the entire surface.</li>
            <li> I regretted using it so much.</li>
            <li> A week later and my face is now acne &amp; blemish free.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using Clean and Clear Dual Action Moisturizer after the Benzoyl treatment.</li>
            <li> In the past I have had more colorful sheets ruined by my acne cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It did clear up my skin at first</li>
            <li> I full endorse this product and hope others out there that uses this product does the same.</li>
            <li> Instead of going back to the Accutane, I went back to my healthy diet, used the clearasil, steamed, and took care of it before it could turn into what it was before.</li>
            <li> I brought this product hoping that it will help me once and for all eliminate Pimples and decrease the amount of pimples my skin produces, I know that having Acne is mainly a condition that occurs within the body</li>
            <li> a single tube lasts me a couple years since I don&#x27;t get huge breakouts</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the Walmart generic of Clean and Clear Persagel 10.</li>
            <li> The last spot treatment product I had used was \\&quot;Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Acne Spot Treatment, .75</li>
            <li> The 2.5% may be better for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> On the rare occasions when I&#x27;ve noticed any dryness starting to occur I just skip a day.  </li>
            <li> I was actually on the verge of tears when I came across a youtube video by someone who was simply talking about their own personal experience with treating acne.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out and make it produce more oil, like regular cleansers do.</li>
            <li> Then one day about two weeks ago this very large pimple began forming on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Of course, my face because very dry and flaky but by the 4th day, I specifically noticed that my larger pimples either disappeared or were no longer as prominent.</li>
            <li> I say &amp;#34;for the most part,&amp;#34; because my acne formed below the surface of my skin, deep in my pores... and sometimes the skin can&#x27;t absorb this deep enough to stop the acne from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> I put neutrogena on first and Clarity on second then a emulsion moisturizer after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It works fine to dry up the pimples, but I definitely will never rebuy it once I run out.</li>
            <li> Switching to a completely plant-based, low fat, low sodium, clean eating diet.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to go back to my tried and true Clearisil.  </li>
            <li> Instead of putting an enormous amount as he did, I opted to apply less but more frequently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m one of thousands who have gone through countless of acne products and researched hundreds of articles with little results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had skin this clear since before I went through puberty.  </li>
            <li> Breaking a sweat once a day to clear the pores out.</li>
            <li> After my skin was clear and I didn&#x27;t break out anymore</li>
            <li> , I took the clear skin for granted.</li>
            <li> This stuff will help clear your skin in a matter of hours.</li>
            <li> The most effective spot treatment I&#x27;ve ever used, but the bleaching of clothes is just too annoying.</li>
            <li> My face is so clear now that I can&#x27;t be any happier.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is the only acne cream that really works for me.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and having been using this for almost thirty years.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and clear now.</li>
            <li> Clearasil alone cleared it completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li> I know that over the years I seemed to have developed an intolerance to products</li>
            <li> I continue to use it for the second night, I didn&#x27;t really see anything either.</li>
            <li> Ive been battling adult acne for 2 years now.</li>
            <li> Well, as it turns out it worked as promised and the pimple was pretty much completely gone after just 2 days, but my lip and nose was incredibly dry</li>
            <li> Every day, I would take a hot shower, dry myself off, and apply the product.</li>
            <li> Cheap compared to other similar products I have seen.</li>
            <li> Also, I must note that my skin is not very sensitive so aside from the dryness, the large amounts that I apply does not irritate my skin as it might for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin had never been rough either, and THIS IS THE FIRST TIME.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, be careful if this is your first time using the product.</li>
            <li> It takes care of the little zits quickly as well.</li>
            <li> His face was extremely dry and flaky for the first week but by the second, his skin was almost completely clear.</li>
            <li> It really halps dry up and prevent breakouts</li>
            <li> I used to have a constant acne breakout (at least 20 zits or more, ick)</li>
            <li> In addition I never ever put in on my entire face, only for spot treating, as this stuff is extremely drying and my skin looks like I&#x27;m 50 years old if I put this on my full face.</li>
            <li> Since the last few days I&#x27;ve been a total acne inspector (taught by my own bitter experience)</li>
            <li> It is not perfect, but for the most part it will clear up acne and prevent new breakouts, as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I personally use aloe gel since it moisturizes and can help clear up acne as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since the very beginning, and it is the only product that has stayed with me for so long.</li>
            <li> Apply it to spots directly after you take a shower when your pores are open.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am self conscious of my red pimples on my posterior.</li>
            <li> I have suffered acne since adolescence through my entire adult life.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the product does not seem to actually prevent any new acne.</li>
            <li> Gentle Milk Cleanser - doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out like traditional soap.</li>
            <li> I apply a small dab because it can be super drying.</li>
            <li> i was so suprised that when i woke up the next morning my acne was actually starting to clear up</li>
            <li> It absorbs immediately and does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only holy grail products in my small, tried and true acne arsenal.</li>
            <li> The only other product I use now is the Yes to Cucumbers Gentle Milk Cleanser, for taking off my makeup.</li>
            <li> The results are well worth this small inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> Plus this stuff will dry out your face like crazy if you use it more than just a spot treatment, and I use it on my whole face, chest and back...</li>
            <li> So I did, and that whole surface became so rough and extremely itchy.</li>
            <li> He had used oxy10 (with 10% benzoyl peroxide, just like this Clearasil cream has) and would everyday place a LARGE amount of the product on his face, so much that he was going through 3 of these small bottles a week.</li>
            <li> Acne takes a long time to go away &amp; sometimes it comes back on same spot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually experiencing strange bumps beneath the surface of my skin that felt like a zit might show up but never did.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it an noticed an immediate difference in my skin - after 2 days, much less inflammation, less flakes, softer, more supple, less irritated, less oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I could use this daily as a spot treatment or a way to prevent them from coming back at all, but I will maybe get 1 or two pesky zits that slowly get worse until the day I use it again.</li>
            <li> It works better than all the other expensive products out there.</li>
            <li> It used to be creamy and smooth but now has this weird graininess to</li>
            <li> It took one round to clear my skin.</li>
            <li> After just 2 days of use, I could see that a few pimples went away and my face became clear.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as oily as it</li>
            <li> review is long overdue.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not surprised my reaction to the product</li>
            <li> Probably going to be using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of daily use I noticed my pimples were smaller and less irritated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only other products in my acne arsenal:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Clearasil uses benzoyl peroxide, which is an ingredient that plenty of other acne creams use, but this one is somehow different.</li>
            <li> Killing Acne bacteria and other facial bacteria&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green-</li>
            <li> I use it on zits and it does eventually help but seems to take a very long time for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d let the clearasil dry before putting on clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used clearasil to control sebum and dry out the hormonal flare ups .</li>
            <li> It was so dry that I had to apply a moisturizer and even rinse my face off throughout the day to relive the dryness.  </li>
            <li> if you over use this stuff it&#x27;ll seriously dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or anything.</li>
            <li> Now I am desperately waiting for all of this allergy to go and my smooth skin to come back.</li>
            <li> Same active ingredient as the Clearasil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has 10% Benzoyl Peroxide, the same active ingredient in Oxy, Clean&amp;Clear,</li>
            <li> after all the active ingredient is the same.</li>
            <li> I personally hate not having this stuff around (because it really does help keep my skin under control) and normally just buy it at a regular brick and mortar store, but I ran out unexpectedly</li>
            <li> The results aren&#x27;t as dramatic as the first few days but it must be working since my face has not been this clear in a while.</li>
            <li> It will dry, but it works!</li>
            <li> However, in the past few months, I had been breaking out so much that no amount of neutrogena foundation could cover it.</li>
            <li> To balance out with the dryness, I use an Aveeno oil-free daily moisturizer with sunscreen (it&#x27;s not good to be directly exposed to the sun when using benzoyl peroxide).</li>
            <li> I only applied a lot because I knew a little for me was ineffective.</li>
            <li> So now Clearasil is a part of my daily routine, apply a little before bed and before leaving the house in the morning.</li>
            <li> You can microwave a wet washcloth to steam your face with.</li>
            <li> Be really careful not to burn yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much to say, product does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Works extra well if you just put a thick dab on leave it for several hours</li>
            <li> It sucks the life out of pimples, making them smaller and less red overnight.</li>
            <li> It will get rid of acne slowly... but leave you with dry red skin if you use it too often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wondering all along, if I&#x27;m doing more bad than good to my skin using it, because of the pore clogging ingredients and the horrible aging effect of benzoyl peroxide???</li>
            <li> are the other things that worked for me:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Extremely gentle.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works as well as any other productive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a form of peroxide which will bleach clothing and other fabrics.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using benzoyl peroxide for 10 years on my terrible terrible skin and let me tell you, I&#x27;ve tried most of them and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for the past 4 days and my acne are just about the same as they were 4 days ago.</li>
            <li> True disappointment.</li>
            <li> My calico gets kitty acne and other spots on her-</li>
            <li> my kitty&#x27;s face pat it dry and rub in a little Clearasil</li>
            <li> It feels a little weird at first</li>
            <li> I actually forgot how bad my skin had been before when I first started using this.</li>
            <li> and it will clear up the small amount of pimples that will slowly reappear throughout the week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a little luck with other creams like Clearasil, but the others took waaaaay longer.</li>
            <li> so daily might mean a day or two without using.</li>
            <li> At month one, half of my acne was gone and my face was looking clearer.</li>
            <li> It flakes less.</li>
            <li> Also, in this review I previously mentioned that I used T.N. Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t have any stupid sparkles in it, and soaks into your skin so your face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.    </li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different skincare products, and my skin is not the sensitive type (it&#x27;s combination) but it broke out so bad.</li>
            <li> When I see my girlfriend at the end of the week I like to strut around and put out the vibe, and if I slather this cream on my rear at night and in the morning when I goto work a few days before we meet</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so harsh</li>
            <li> Everyday I probably reached for this bottle 5-8 times.</li>
            <li> Once every few days I&#x27;ll see the start of a pimple or two</li>
            <li> The few pimples then disappear within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product description is not accurate.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a pretty bad breakout.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this, since every other acne treatment has failed to clear up my face.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have oily skin, but usually don&#x27;t suffer from breakouts (a miracle, I know).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only needed to use this once a week or so for my terrible break outs, but it works very well!</li>
            <li> I put on the tiniest amount on an acne-rich part of my face, waited til the next day, and BAM the size definitely decreased!</li>
            <li> It helps bumps heal quicker and if you don&#x27;t go overboard</li>
            <li> but if I wake up and have a gnarly break out I dab just a little on the spot and it prevents it from getting worse and usually clears it up by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I have used just about every single OTC acne wash/cream/astringent out there, so I was a bit skeptical when I saw an ad for this one from Clearasil.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find elsewhere</li>
            <li> So here we go, the product that is supposed to help you fight acne has at least 2 ingredients on its list that have 3 and 5</li>
            <li> Witch Hazel constricts the blood vessels which makes the skin appear less red, but is actually very bad to repeatedly subject the skin to.</li>
            <li> If you are really serious, reapply before you go to bed, in the morning - they WILL go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a good idea to put it on when your skin is going to be exposed to sunlight</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so frustrating.  </li>
            <li> but then my skin seemed to respond poorly after repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try a thin layer on any enlarged, clogged pores.</li>
            <li> just made my acne worse</li>
            <li> acne started in when I was 13 or so and have gradually gotten worse as I entered college.</li>
            <li> using it daily all over can be painful!</li>
            <li> recently, I developed a case of horrible cystic acne on my bum.</li>
            <li> I seriously looked like I was diseased or something.  </li>
            <li> I tried everything including one of those expensive acne product lines you buy online.  </li>
            <li> In two weeks, the horrible cystic acne was gone, and it hasn&#x27;t come back since.</li>
            <li> but this product (for me) was useless.</li>
            <li> How ridiculous and upsetting is that?!?!?</li>
            <li> My skin has never been this bad like ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For 11 years, I struggled with horrible acne.</li>
            <li> (the worst) rating in pore clogging rating.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you use this make sure to use a good moisturizer with it.  It will get rid of acne slowly... but leave you with dry red skin if you use it too often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for acnes out there and so far this one works great!. Just dont try and mix chemicals so you wont break out even more. I have sensitive skin so I learned my lesson on thinking more products will work by using them together. This one I can see the result every night. I apply it through out the day.</li>
            <li> This is the only acne cream that really works for me. Great stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I Used this product about only like10 days, the acne almost disappeared at all. I&#x27;m very surprised that it worked so fast and perfect! Recommend it, it&#x27;s the best one !</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have oily skin, but usually don&#x27;t suffer from breakouts (a miracle, I know). However, when I do get breakouts, it&#x27;s my WHOLE FACE. Just last week my entire forehead was covered and so were my temples. I&#x27;ve had a little luck with other creams like Clearasil, but the others took waaaaay longer. Two days ago I got my Clearasil and started using it immediately, and today there is no sign of a pimple on my face. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the company or what, but Clearasil has ALWAYS worked for me. The only thing to warn about is that if you apply this more than once a day, be sure to use a moisturizer. I personally use aloe gel since it moisturizes and can help clear up acne as well.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing short of outstanding. I full endorse this product and hope others out there that uses this product does the same.</li>
            <li> This cream really helps me keep my face from breaking out. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY acne product that works for me.  After I had my baby my face broke out like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  I seriously looked like I was diseased or something.  I tried everything including one of those expensive acne product lines you buy online.  Nothing worked at all.  I finally decided to go back to my tried and true Clearisil.  I had stopped using it because it bleaches fabric and I didn&#x27;t want my pillow case to get stained.  But it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me so I had to go back to using it.  Within days my skin was clearing up and after a couple weeks my skin looked better than it has ever looked in my life.  I haven&#x27;t had skin this clear since before I went through puberty.  To deal with the bleaching issue I use a solid white pillow case and only use Clearisil at night.  I don&#x27;t care if it stains my pajamas anyway.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this, since every other acne treatment has failed to clear up my face. After two weeks of daily use I noticed my pimples were smaller and less irritated. At month one, half of my acne was gone and my face was looking clearer. And here I am at month three of daily use and I have NO PIMPLES!!! Im super happy that I found a product that works :) The only thing I should warn you is that I does bleach fabric. So make sure you was your hands well after applying it!</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and having been using this for almost thirty years. It absorbs immediately and does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase. I will shop again when there is a need for the product once again</li>
            <li> Update 12/15/2015: After about a year of a new skincare regime, I feel comfortable updating this review. I&#x27;ve been using another 10% BP product that I like better: Equate 10% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Treatment Gel. It&#x27;s the Walmart generic of Clean and Clear Persagel 10. It&#x27;s cruelty free. It blends into the skin instead of caking on top of it. It flakes less. I dare say that it is a smidge more effective. Same active ingredient as the Clearasil. Also, in this review I previously mentioned that I used T.N. Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel. Witch Hazel constricts the blood vessels which makes the skin appear less red, but is actually very bad to repeatedly subject the skin to. The alcohol dries the skin and further irritates the acne. Any benefit from it would be from the antibacterial properties of alcohol. I stopped using it an noticed an immediate difference in my skin - after 2 days, much less inflammation, less flakes, softer, more supple, less irritated, less oily. The only other product I use now is the Yes to Cucumbers Gentle Milk Cleanser, for taking off my makeup. It doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out and make it produce more oil, like regular cleansers do. It&#x27;s very gentle. My skin is so soft and clear now. Not nearly as oily as it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;First, beware - it will bleach fabrics. This is one of the only holy grail products in my small, tried and true acne arsenal. Apply it to spots directly after you take a shower when your pores are open. If you are really serious, reapply before you go to bed, in the morning - they WILL go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is long overdue. For 11 years, I struggled with horrible acne. I&#x27;ve been using this since the very beginning, and it is the only product that has stayed with me for so long. That&#x27;s because it works. I used to apply this stuff to my entire face and back. It does a great job of clearing spots, and, for the most part, it prevents new spots from forming. I say &amp;#34;for the most part,&amp;#34; because my acne formed below the surface of my skin, deep in my pores... and sometimes the skin can&#x27;t absorb this deep enough to stop the acne from forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the other things that worked for me:&lt;br /&gt;1. Switching to a completely plant-based, low fat, low sodium, clean eating diet. Basically, I ate fruits, vegetables, and grains. This REALLY helped my acne, but didn&#x27;t get rid of it completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Steaming, hot showers. Breaking a sweat once a day to clear the pores out. You can microwave a wet washcloth to steam your face with. Be really careful not to burn yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Isotretanoin aka Accutane - This is what stopped my acne in its tracks. It took one round to clear my skin. After my skin was clear and I didn&#x27;t break out anymore, I took the clear skin for granted. I went back to my junky diet. BOOM, I broke out all over my jaw, blackheads on my nose, pimples in my hairline. Instead of going back to the Accutane, I went back to my healthy diet, used the clearasil, steamed, and took care of it before it could turn into what it was before. It&#x27;s stayed in check since then. Whenever I get a pimple, steam and use Clearasil. This product kept my acne from evolving back into what it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other products in my acne arsenal:&lt;br /&gt;1. Yes to Cucumbers Gentle Milk Cleanser - doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out like traditional soap. Extremely gentle.&lt;br /&gt;2. Tweezerman tweezers. Good for breaking the heads of pimples that need to come out, with minimal damage to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very recently, I developed a case of horrible cystic acne on my bum. Clearasil alone cleared it completely. Every day, I would take a hot shower, dry myself off, and apply the product. I&#x27;d let the clearasil dry before putting on clothes. Periodically, I&#x27;d apply it again when I had the chance. In two weeks, the horrible cystic acne was gone, and it hasn&#x27;t come back since. That&#x27;s why I came here today to finally write this. I forgot how great this stuff really is, until it literally saved my butt.</li>
            <li> This is the same product you&#x27;d buy in the store, there&#x27;s just three boxes lumped together in a bag. I personally hate not having this stuff around (because it really does help keep my skin under control) and normally just buy it at a regular brick and mortar store, but I ran out unexpectedly so I ordered it from Amazon and was pleased with the result. Can&#x27;t actually attest to the price comparison but it was convenient and because I have Amazon Prime it came in two days.</li>
            <li> Best acne medication I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Works extra well if you just put a thick dab on leave it for several hours (great when you&#x27;re just sitting around the house)  And you only ever need to use it when you have a pimple and only on that spot (rubbing it all over your face would be very wasteful.)  But yea it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve bought for pimple since somebody showed me this many years ago and a single tube lasts me a couple years since I don&#x27;t get huge breakouts anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps  Doesn&#x27;t work so well with the hormonal pimples you get around your period until after they surface but nothing does.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am self conscious of my red pimples on my posterior. When I see my girlfriend at the end of the week I like to strut around and put out the vibe, and if I slather this cream on my rear at night and in the morning when I goto work a few days before we meet I have a nice clear complexion on my rear face and it brings out the shine of my soft fur.</li>
            <li> Did not work well for me, but can&#x27;t say it will not work for others. Would give it a try. Cheap compared to other similar products I have seen.</li>
            <li> I only use this on my face every night and it helps amazingly. It works better than all the other expensive products out there.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a pretty bad breakout. Unlike Proactive, which is a total scam, the vanishing cream stopped the breakout in its tracks within 12 hours. It feels a little weird at first but you&#x27;ll get used to it in a day or so. It DOES cause some flaking but it is pretty mild and washes away. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now and have always had oily skin with breakouts. I&#x27;ve always used clearasil to control sebum and dry out the hormonal flare ups . It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day. I cannot take birth control for various health reasons to clearasil has been so helpful. Love the three pack .</li>
            <li> I have used just about every single OTC acne wash/cream/astringent out there, so I was a bit skeptical when I saw an ad for this one from Clearasil.  The last spot treatment product I had used was \\&quot;Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Acne Spot Treatment, .75 oz\\&quot; and it did nothing.  Then one day about two weeks ago this very large pimple began forming on my upper lip.  I have them pop up in this area quite often and when they do they linger for about 3 weeks, it&#x27;s so frustrating.  Out of desperation, I decided to give Clearsil Vanishing Acne Treatment Cream a go.  The instructions say to apply 1-3 times daily but I amped that up to about 8-9 because I didn&#x27;t think the product would work.  Well, as it turns out it worked as promised and the pimple was pretty much completely gone after just 2 days, but my lip and nose was incredibly dry (I felt really sunburned).  It was so dry that I had to apply a moisturizer and even rinse my face off throughout the day to relive the dryness.  I don&#x27;t blame the product for this as I did not follow the label instructions.  Not only did it beat my expectations but it also made my skin the clearest it has ever been.</li>
            <li> Although the product does work, it also does irritate the skin causing it to be itchy and turn red. I still use it anyhow.</li>
            <li> This does help with acne.  In the summer it comes in handy especially when using heavier sunscreens that can cause more breakouts.  In the winter use moisturizers at night to counteract drying.  The 2.5% may be better for everyday use.  The 10% is great a couple times a week at night.</li>
            <li> This product used to be different in texture. It used to be creamy and smooth but now has this weird graininess to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product since I was 13 with amazing results for about 15 years. However I believe they changed their ingredients in the past 5 or so years because I haven&#x27;t been getting the same exact results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually experiencing strange bumps beneath the surface of my skin that felt like a zit might show up but never did. I know that over the years I seemed to have developed an intolerance to products contains benzoyl peroxide (toothpaste, mouth wash, hair color) so I&#x27;m not surprised my reaction to the product has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did clear up my skin at first but then my skin seemed to respond poorly after repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switch to Clarity by melaleuca which uses saylic acid and tea tree oil. I also switched to neutrogena acne cream which only has 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. I put neutrogena on first and Clarity on second then a emulsion moisturizer after 5 minutes. My face is like how it was before, smooth with no zits or bumpiness!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only needed to use this once a week or so for my terrible break outs, but it works very well! I used to have a constant acne breakout (at least 20 zits or more, ick) and now I use it once a week before bed and it will clear up the small amount of pimples that will slowly reappear throughout the week. I&#x27;m sure I could use this daily as a spot treatment or a way to prevent them from coming back at all, but I will maybe get 1 or two pesky zits that slowly get worse until the day I use it again. Plus this stuff will dry out your face like crazy if you use it more than just a spot treatment, and I use it on my whole face, chest and back...using it daily all over can be painful!</li>
            <li> Everything perfect! Highly recommended. Everything as espected.  Arrived on time and Very well packaged.</li>
            <li> I use it on zits and it does eventually help but seems to take a very long time for me. I&#x27;ve tried all the brands and can&#x27;t say any of them are very effective on me.</li>
            <li> Had an outburst of acne all over my face. Applied clearsil and it dries up acne in a day, isnt that awesome? And I got something like 3 tubes for an awesome price, will last lifetime :) perfect buy.</li>
            <li> It disappears on my skin and works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have suffered acne since adolescence through my entire adult life.  I use Clearasil nightly, all over my face, as a preventive cream that also treats current breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has 10% Benzoyl Peroxide, the same active ingredient in Oxy, Clean&amp;Clear, and, yes, even the same as ProActiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as well as any other productive.  It is not perfect, but for the most part it will clear up acne and prevent new breakouts, as advertised.  It even dries up blemishes and scabs so they heal more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works on the face and the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to last longer (per tube) than Oxy and the more \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; face creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon for a three pack can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a form of peroxide which will bleach clothing and other fabrics.  DO NOT GET THIS ON FABRICS.  I sleep with white or light brown sheets and pillowcases.  In the past I have had more colorful sheets ruined by my acne cream.  You just have to prepare and plan around it.  I would suggest not wearing it during the day (only at night) unless you can make sure it will not at any point be transferred to your clothes.  When I wear it during the day, I wear a white shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does dry out the skin a bit, so make sure you re-moisturize after you shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are necessary evils in my world, because if I don&#x27;t use a Benzoyl Peroxide cream at night, my face breaks out within a day or two.  It works pretty well, which is all I can ask.</li>
            <li> Works really well on my granddaughter when she uses it. She is 16 so daily might mean a day or two without using. I would but again, because it does work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using benzoyl peroxide for 10 years on my terrible terrible skin and let me tell you, I&#x27;ve tried most of them and this is the best. From off brand to doctor&#x27;s office brands, value to top dollar, it&#x27;s been on my face. This is the best.  Let me first say if you&#x27;ve never used this before there&#x27;s a good chance you will feel a \\&quot;burning sensation\\&quot; and if you wear it to bed it will bleach your pillows. (And that means your clothing too! and your towels if you don&#x27;t wash it off your hands well enough!). With that in mind it&#x27;s kind of obvious that if you over use this stuff it&#x27;ll seriously dry out your skin. I recommend using Clean and Clear Dual Action Moisturizer after the Benzoyl treatment. It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t have any stupid sparkles in it, and soaks into your skin so your face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.    This stuff will help clear your skin in a matter of hours. I use it absolutely every night and if I miss a night there&#x27;s a noticeable difference in my skin. Because it&#x27;s so harsh it&#x27;s not a good idea to put it on when your skin is going to be exposed to sunlight but if I wake up and have a gnarly break out I dab just a little on the spot and it prevents it from getting worse and usually clears it up by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve had acne my whole life, and have tried proactive before, but that&#x27;s never worked too well. I looked up this product, saw the reviews, and decided to go for it. It&#x27;s got benzoyl peroxide, which helps to kill off the microorganisms setting up shop in your pores. I put on the tiniest amount on an acne-rich part of my face, waited til the next day, and BAM the size definitely decreased! I&#x27;ve been putting it on all potential acne spots, and within 1-3 days, the acne visibly diminished. It&#x27;s incredible. Probably going to be using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this. I saw it at the drugstore for $5 so I decided to try it out. I only use it at night after I wash my face. My pores are noticeably smaller and my blackheads (I have a LOT) are almost all gone. It takes care of the little zits quickly as well. It is a bit drying, hence why I only use it at night. Overall a fantastic product. It does however bleach certain fabrics. I would recommend using a pillow case you don&#x27;t mind getting ruined.</li>
            <li> Clearasil uses benzoyl peroxide, which is an ingredient that plenty of other acne creams use, but this one is somehow different. It sucks the life out of pimples, making them smaller and less red overnight. If that weren&#x27;t enough, it will also suck dirt out of your pores. This does for my nose what an army of pore strips could not do. Try a thin layer on any enlarged, clogged pores. I don&#x27;t know how this stuff does what it does, but it works. This is a great price for a 3-pack, too, and you will not regret having three.</li>
            <li> The only thing that ever cured my acne</li>
            <li> It works amazing!! i was so suprised that when i woke up the next morning my acne was actually starting to clear up</li>
            <li> I read so many good review about this product and as it advertises the 24 hr acne treatment, I have seen no results whatsoever. I have been using the product for the past 4 days and my acne are just about the same as they were 4 days ago. Infact, I can see two more acne&#x27;s. Not at all satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product does not work at all, despite all the other great reviews. True disappointment. Would not be ordering again.</li>
            <li> The product description is not accurate.  The product description say this is a &amp;#34;Pack of 3&amp;#34;.  The product ships with only two items.</li>
            <li> My son uses this along with his prescription medicine for severe acne,  he likes this real well and can use it 2 or 3 times a day without getting very red and dried out skin.</li>
            <li> Same product as always - Great price</li>
            <li> It will dry, but it works! It helps bumps heal quicker and if you don&#x27;t go overboard it&#x27;s not too drying! Like it!</li>
            <li> After just 2 days of use, I could see that a few pimples went away and my face became clear. I really recommend this product, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> The best over the counter acne cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.  To this day, still works each and every time. Thanks, Clearasil once again.</li>
            <li> My calico gets kitty acne and other spots on her- the vet suggested I use Clearasil because salicylate shampoos are possibly toxic to cats. I wash my kitty&#x27;s face pat it dry and rub in a little Clearasil and she does much better.</li>
            <li> This spot treatment has helped my cystic acne! I apply a small dab because it can be super drying. I recommend only wearing at night because it is a chalky cream.</li>
            <li> Works.  What more needs to be said?</li>
            <li> I try most cream in the market &amp; this one don&#x27;t work. Acne takes a long time to go away &amp; sometimes it comes back on same spot.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, product does what it is supposed to do. This product was received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Ointment/cream works well.</li>
            <li> I definitely won&#x27;t ever ever use this product again. My skin has never been this bad like ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got like 3 pimples on my face, but I saw so many good reviews about this product, so I decided to get this product from Walgreens and gave it a try. The first time I used it, I saw nothing happen to my skin. It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin or anything. I continue to use it for the second night, I didn&#x27;t really see anything either. However, after the third use, I noticed that my skin became rougher, and the affected area spread. Like based on the instruction, we have to put a light layer on the entire surface. So I did, and that whole surface became so rough and extremely itchy. I have used a lot of different skincare products, and my skin is not the sensitive type (it&#x27;s combination) but it broke out so bad. My skin had never been rough either, and THIS IS THE FIRST TIME. I regretted using it so much. I&#x27;ve been suffering from these roughness and itchiness for two days already. Now I am desperately waiting for all of this allergy to go and my smooth skin to come back.</li>
            <li> The Clearisil Daily (NOT the new \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot;, which is runny, doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well, and STINGS) is the best acne treatment cream I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  It really halps dry up and prevent breakouts and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I received my shipment last night and after one application, this morning I can see a big difference in my skin. On the rare occasions when I&#x27;ve noticed any dryness starting to occur I just skip a day.  A heads-up though to anyone not familar with these - as with any manufacturer&#x27;s Benzoyl Peroxide product, it will bleach out fabrics, so I use it only at home, while wearing a white shirt.  The results are well worth this small inconvenience.  As for my pillowcases they are light so no issues there.</li>
            <li> Since the last few days I&#x27;ve been a total acne inspector (taught by my own bitter experience) and whenever I put a product on my skin or even buy it, I meticulously check its ingredients list against the list of pore clogging ingredients (which you can find easily in google). So here we go, the product that is supposed to help you fight acne has at least 2 ingredients on its list that have 3 and 5 (the worst) rating in pore clogging rating. How ridiculous and upsetting is that?!?!? In addition I never ever put in on my entire face, only for spot treating, as this stuff is extremely drying and my skin looks like I&#x27;m 50 years old if I put this on my full face. I use it only for treating spots, and it works good this way, clearing pimples pretty fast. I&#x27;ve been wondering all along, if I&#x27;m doing more bad than good to my skin using it, because of the pore clogging ingredients and the horrible aging effect of benzoyl peroxide??? It works fine to dry up the pimples, but I definitely will never rebuy it once I run out.</li>
            <li> The most effective spot treatment I&#x27;ve ever used, but the bleaching of clothes is just too annoying.</li>
            <li> just made my acne worse didnt help at all trying a diffrent product hopefully it will work but i dont recomend this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m one of thousands who have gone through countless of acne products and researched hundreds of articles with little results. In fact, I had bought this a while back and eventually stopped using it...just labeling Clearasil as another one that didn&#x27;t work. But let me go back and explain before I start reviewing more on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My acne started in when I was 13 or so and have gradually gotten worse as I entered college. However, in the past few months, I had been breaking out so much that no amount of neutrogena foundation could cover it. I was actually on the verge of tears when I came across a youtube video by someone who was simply talking about their own personal experience with treating acne. There was no advertisements and nothing that required me to buy him or his product. I guess that was what made me tried his method. He had used oxy10 (with 10% benzoyl peroxide, just like this Clearasil cream has) and would everyday place a LARGE amount of the product on his face, so much that he was going through 3 of these small bottles a week. His face was extremely dry and flaky for the first week but by the second, his skin was almost completely clear. So I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply bought Clearasil instead of oxy10 because amazon made it more affordable and convenient...after all the active ingredient is the same. Instead of putting an enormous amount as he did, I opted to apply less but more frequently. Everyday I probably reached for this bottle 5-8 times. I applied it to my face and chin much more generously than the directions suggested because as I mentioned, it didn&#x27;t really work for me the first time I bought the product. Of course, my face because very dry and flaky but by the 4th day, I specifically noticed that my larger pimples either disappeared or were no longer as prominent. To balance out with the dryness, I use an Aveeno oil-free daily moisturizer with sunscreen (it&#x27;s not good to be directly exposed to the sun when using benzoyl peroxide). I also washed my face with an Aveeno face wash once or twice a day, especially after sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now the 9th day and my face is look a bit clearer than the 4th. The results aren&#x27;t as dramatic as the first few days but it must be working since my face has not been this clear in a while. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the product does not seem to actually prevent any new acne. However, I will continue to use and buy more of this over the summer and update as I go along. I can&#x27;t guarantee that you&#x27;ll get the same results though because everyone&#x27;s skin is different. I do hope that my review will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, be careful if this is your first time using the product. I only applied a lot because I knew a little for me was ineffective. Also, I must note that my skin is not very sensitive so aside from the dryness, the large amounts that I apply does not irritate my skin as it might for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE after 7 months: It works. I actually forgot how bad my skin had been before when I first started using this. My face is so clear now that I can&#x27;t be any happier. Once every few days I&#x27;ll see the start of a pimple or two (although I blame it on my lack of sleep). So now Clearasil is a part of my daily routine, apply a little before bed and before leaving the house in the morning. The few pimples then disappear within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope it will work for you, because it&#x27;s one of the best things to happen to me.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. Ive been battling adult acne for 2 years now. Got fed up and decided to do something about it. Decided to give this a try. So glad I did because it cleared up my white heads in 2 days. A week later and my face is now acne &amp; blemish free.  Don&#x27;t even 2nd guess it. Just get it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find elsewhere</li>
            <li> Great. Great price, no smell, fast acting.</li>
            <li> I brought this product hoping that it will help me once and for all eliminate Pimples and decrease the amount of pimples my skin produces, I know that having Acne is mainly a condition that occurs within the body but I have to say that I would not recommend this product to anyone. I know each and everyone of us react either negatively or positively top certain skin products but Clearasil did nothing for my skin. I applied the cream after washing my face hoping that it will help heal the Pimple but day after day the pimple was still present and there was no change in size. I know that Benzoyle Peroxide is good for treating Acne, that&#x27;s the reason why I got it but this product (for me) was useless. I am currently usuing Exposed Skin Care and this has done wanders for my skin, along side my daily face routine I am usuin an LED Light Therapy device which you can purchase for about 40 Pound (UK) and has three lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red- for healing, increasing Collogen in the Skin, improving skin tone and blood flow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue- Killing Acne bacteria and other facial bacteria&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green- for improving oxygen and cell reproduction like red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed improvements in my skin and would reccomend that plan along side eating fruit and taking Vitamin A, E, Zinc B-Complex tablets and Vitamin B5 if you do I am sure you will get great results but as to regards to clearasil, stay way CLEAR from it.</li>
