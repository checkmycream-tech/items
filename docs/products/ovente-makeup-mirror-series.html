    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great Price and Product!</li>
            <li>PERFECT! !!!</li>
            <li>That makes it totally awesome!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for what I need it for.</li>
            <li>The magnification of 10x is wonderful, I can see even those &amp;#34;peachfuzz&amp;#34; hairs without my glasses!</li>
            <li>It looks great!  </li>
            <li>It looks great</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s great it can run on batteries.</li>
            <li>Totally happy with purchase</li>
            <li>Mirror is very nice looking.</li>
            <li>This is a great mirror-nice bronze finish and good magnification.</li>
            <li>Looks good in the master bath</li>
            <li>It is very pretty and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>She is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love this lighted mirror!</li>
            <li>Really good size and lights up better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s attractive and, most important, it does the job.  </li>
            <li>The magnification is crisp and not distorted, the light is an ideal brightness.  </li>
            <li>but my hand held is much better.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Lovely, love that there is a no cord option.</li>
            <li>The magnification is great for tweezing or applying eye makeup and the lighting is enough to help the process along.</li>
            <li>Transacrion was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Can be used with batteries, and no ugly AC chord&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I have another older Revlon vanity mirror which has variable lighting strength, and the light on the Ovente is just as bright as the brightest setting on my old one.</li>
            <li>The natural light in my bathroom is more powerful than the LED light.</li>
            <li>Luckily I have a lot of natural light</li>
            <li>It looks beautiful, great color, but the LED is awful.  </li>
            <li>it is also light enough to hold up as a hand mirror.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I will probably give it to my daughter and get a new one soon.</li>
            <li>The LED light is not very strong.</li>
            <li>I am only 5&#x27;4 and have to bend down to look into the mirror&lt;br /&gt;Color - is more of a brass than a rubbed bronze&lt;br /&gt;Mirror</li>
            <li>Light could be a little brighter.</li>
            <li>and I have to move my face around to get a clear image</li>
            <li>I bought this mirror for the color and the battery options as there is no outlet near where I need to place the mirror on my vanity.</li>
            <li>only keeping it because it would cost too much to ship it back.  </li>
            <li>not get hot like other vanity mirrors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light is a bit cheesy, but in the dark it does illuminate fine.</li>
            <li>but the light is not bright enough.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the light is weak at all...</li>

            <li> Lights started flickering off and on 8 days after receiving. Should shave heeded the warnings from other reviewers ;(</li>
            <li> Looks good in the master bath but the light is not bright enough.  The magnification says it is a 10x but my hand held is much better.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for the color and the battery options as there is no outlet near where I need to place the mirror on my vanity. I like it less every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Battery operated, with corded option&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Light too dim (can hardly use it at night)&lt;br /&gt;Too short.  I am only 5&#x27;4 and have to bend down to look into the mirror&lt;br /&gt;Color - is more of a brass than a rubbed bronze&lt;br /&gt;Mirror - Is very small and I have to move my face around to get a clear image&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only keeping it because it would cost too much to ship it back.

            <li> Great Price and Product!</li>
            <li> PERFECT! !!! Really good size and lights up better then I thought it was going to!</li>
            <li> This has been working well for me.  The magnification is great for tweezing or applying eye makeup and the lighting is enough to help the process along.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient to use but not very bright and the battery cover doesn&#x27;t sit flush.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror-nice bronze finish and good magnification. The light is a bit cheesy, but in the dark it does illuminate fine. Luckily I have a lot of natural light so it&#x27;s not an issue. It looks great o my dressing table as well. AND it can be cordless if need be. That makes it totally awesome!</li>
            <li> Light bulb comes on and off without turning it off, also very dull lighting!</li>
            <li> Mirror is very nice looking. And it&#x27;s great it can run on batteries. But the light is VERY WEAK!  Not much comes in this color without a cord. Looks like I&#x27;m going back to corded.</li>
            <li> Bought it for wife for Christmas. She is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Product was just what I wanted.  Transacrion was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty and works perfectly.  I bought it as a gift for my hair dresser and she loves it.</li>
            <li> The LED light is not very strong. The natural light in my bathroom is more powerful than the LED light. I generally do not even plug in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Totally happy with purchase</li>

            <li> Looks like a mirror, acts like a mirror.  I thing it is a mirror.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate this mirror.  It looks great!  I tried for over a month to grow accustomed to the LED lights, but no matter what I did, I had to move it to a window to use daylight.  It looks beautiful, great color, but the LED is awful.  I want to return it but I procrastinated to long and now I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Can be used with batteries, and no ugly AC chord&lt;br /&gt;Does not get hot like other vanity mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer name is etched in the mirror&lt;br /&gt;Light is not very powerful&lt;br /&gt;Copper base is more like a plastic of some sort&lt;br /&gt;Mirror size is small, check measurements carefully</li>
