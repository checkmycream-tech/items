            <li>This is the best lip pencil I have found.  </li>
            <li>This is a great pencil!</li>
            <li>Great wear!</li>
            <li>Great neutral color!</li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful color to be worn alone or with gloss; I like it alone which speaks volumes for the product color.</li>
            <li>Really great color and good quality.</li>
            <li>Love the color!  </li>
            <li>Stays on most of the day!</li>
            <li>and I love it !</li>
            <li>to say when it arrived it was a lot darker than I liked.</li>
            <li>I think this would look good on most anyone.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a nice product otherwise.</li>
            <li>Lovely pencil, color goes on very smoothly</li>
            <li>Perfect neutral liner to wear daily at work.</li>
            <li>Just a lovely color</li>
            <li>I like it because it stays on, doesn&#x27;t smear, &amp; goes with most colors of lipstick.</li>
            <li>I LOVE MAC cosmetics anyway.</li>
            <li>But this color is absolutly gorgeous kinda of a natural mocha</li>
            <li>I use it as a full lipstick, not just a lip liner, and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t turn out to be the right one.  </li>
            <li>The color can be filled in the lip completely and worn with a bit of gloss</li>
            <li>Exactly like I get at the department store but didn&#x27;t have to leave the house.</li>
            <li>I think for anyone like me, white hair and fair complexion, and neutral enough for any fabric shades.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blonde with fair skin and it isn&#x27;t too dark for me.  </li>
            <li>A classic, versatile color.</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that it&#x27;s a little pricy for a lip pencil, but it does last for awhile without breaking or drying out, so I guess it&#x27;s kind of worth the price.</li>

            <li> or I usually use it to line my lips when I wear red lipstick to keep the lipstick from running!</li>

            <li> horrible pencil for the  pricey price ,doesn&#x27;t last long ,barely noticeable</li>
            <li> Hard to judge color on the internet.  </li>
            <li> Nothing thick, greasy, or drying.  </li>
            <li> Got the wrong color.  </li>
