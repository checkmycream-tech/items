            <li>WELL WORTH the cost.</li>
            <li>worth the price for peace of mind</li>
            <li>I bought it as part of the evolution of my lifestyle toward using more holistic, natural substance, both inside and out.</li>
            <li>They agree with sensitive skin and don&#x27;t have some of ingredients that are good to stay away from which most other soaps have.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try out some other oils next, but I&#x27;ll keep using this wonderfully lathered bar of soap.</li>
            <li>It cleans them right up, and doesn&#x27;t take forever either.</li>

            <li>I had been using Paul Mitchell brand soap and shampoo until I read how toxic it was compare to many others, but I&#x27;d been convinced of the power of many essential oils in other contexts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These bars to the job really well.  </li>
            <li>It suds up really fast</li>
            <li>Cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I did expect a stronger citrus fragrance but overall am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed by it, as it left my skin feeling stretched and dried out.</li>

            <li>This was my first purchase of Castile soap in general and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s brand in particular.</li>
            <li>For my preferences, it doesn&#x27;t have the overpowering sweet smell of the most common brands but that is an individual preference I guess.</li>
            <li>My new bar soap for life.</li>
            <li>The scents are no too strong and the bars last a long time.  </li>
            <li>The price is higher than standard chemical induced soap but this one is organic!!</li>
            <li>Love the smell but left my skin feeling ashy and dry later in the day.</li>
            <li>If you want organic and natural..........</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s natural to boot,</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This soap calmed things considerably.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to anyone although I think they could come down on the price quite a bit.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m just now discovering this stuff. My new bar soap for life. It lathers like crazy! Rinses off completely, and afterwards your skin is so soft, it feels like you&#x27;ve applied an expensive lotion! Amazing! Plus it feels so good to know you&#x27;re not putting chemicals on your skin. I HIGHLY recommend you try a bar. You won&#x27;t regret it and you&#x27;ll likely spread the word.</li>
            <li> If you want organic and natural..........Dr. Bronner - Organic Citrus Bar Soap, 5 oz bar soap.....They are a good line of products!~</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know Dr. Bonner had a citrus scent until I found it on Amazon. None of the stores carry it, only Lavender and Mint. Love the soap, lasts a good while compared to other soaps and it&#x27;s natural to boot, thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the best bar soap that I have ever used.  It has the richest, creamiest lather and smells wonderful. This is the only bar soap that I will ever use on my skin and hair. I highly recommend this product. It is 100 percent GREAT!</li>
            <li> I usually use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Soap, but wanted something to travel with &amp; take to the gym.  These bars to the job really well.

Would highly recommend this product to anyone although I think they could come down on the price quite a bit.</li>
            <li> This soap is great. Its like rubbing navel oranges onto your navel! The price is higher than standard chemical induced soap but this one is organic!! WELL WORTH the cost. I have to buy more! This may make the supply run low so buy it whilst you can.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap.  It has very little scent, didn&#x27;t last long and did not lather well.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Dr Bronners soaps are great!  They agree with sensitive skin and don&#x27;t have some of ingredients that are good to stay away from which most other soaps have.  The scents are no too strong and the bars last a long time.  Not a bad deal on Amazon either!</li>
            <li> The smell of this soap was amazing, and it made me feel extremely clean. I would buy this again, especially since the price is affordable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found my new favorite soap. Smells great and the lather is super foamy. Its like a lemon and bar of soap made passionate love and this is their offspring.</li>
            <li> I discovered this at a local health foods store about six months ago, and I am so glad I did! It takes my makeup off perfectly, leaving none of it behind while also not stripping my face of natural oils. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight and gross after I wash with this. This soap bar is also so perfect for washing makeup brushes! I get my brushes wet and swirl them around on the bar. It cleans them right up, and doesn&#x27;t take forever either. This is definitely an item that I do not want to be without!</li>
            <li> A little pricey I thought but the soap itself is wonderful. I also bought the orange lavender lotion to go with it and its a great combo.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog up my washing machine water intake/outlet like non-Dr. Bronners.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent pure soap, organic and fair trade, wonderful lather and rinse factors. I will definitely purchase this and the other varieties of this soap in the future. I did expect a stronger citrus fragrance but overall am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> No really impressed with this soap, hardly any citrus smell, the bar didn&#x27;t last long, will not order this soap again.</li>
            <li> ITEM OF EXCEPTIONALLY EXCELLENT QUALITY, GREAT ITEM, GOOD PRICE PRODUCT, DETAILED, WORKS VERY WELL, LOVE THE ITEM, RECOMMEND IT ! A++++++++</li>
            <li> This works great! I have a hard time with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps in my hair. This bar soap is great. It suds up really fast and I use it for shaving and washing my face. My face and skin always feel really clean after using and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I like this soap.  I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve been having problems with regular soaps causing irritations on various parts of my body.  This soap calmed things considerably.  I have ordered the eucalyptus and lavender soaps to give them a try, but this one will stay on my list to continue to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  but I&#x27;ve just found out palm oil is causing catatrosphic destruction rain forest.  I&#x27;m no longer buying products with palm oil as its ingredient.  I hope Dr. Bonner soap would eliminate palm oil from this product.</li>
            <li> This soap is great, if you have sensitive this is what to buy! The price was great also. It also has a delightful scent, not too strong.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh scent. Cleans very well. worth the price for peace of mind</li>
            <li> The item was delivered quickly and is perfect in every way. I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of Castile soap in general and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s brand in particular. I bought it as part of the evolution of my lifestyle toward using more holistic, natural substance, both inside and out. I had been using Paul Mitchell brand soap and shampoo until I read how toxic it was compare to many others, but I&#x27;d been convinced of the power of many essential oils in other contexts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a hard time choosing which essential oil I wanted to try, and since citrus is an uplifting oil to use, I decided to start here. I wasn&#x27;t terribly impressed by it, as it left my skin feeling stretched and dried out. My scalp reacted in a similar way. It didn&#x27;t feel good and my hair didn&#x27;t look good. I have normal-to-oily hair. I&#x27;m going to try out some other oils next, but I&#x27;ll keep using this wonderfully lathered bar of soap.</li>
            <li> A very pleasant orange scent-- nice size-- and makes good suds.  Great!</li>
            <li> Love the smell but left my skin feeling ashy and dry later in the day. Bar did hold up for about a month but wont be buying another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and am glad to have found it in all of its varieties on Amazon. It lasts forever and creates a lot of suds. For my preferences, it doesn&#x27;t have the overpowering sweet smell of the most common brands but that is an individual preference I guess.</li>
            <li> Very pleasing scent and has a crisp clean that make it really nice. It reminds me of what an old fashioned soap would be like, no nonsense clean. A++++</li>
