            <li>I love these brushes, I bought them three times!</li>
            <li>and I COULDN&#x27;T AGREE MORE!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this brush set!</li>
            <li>There are so many!</li>
            <li>they came very quickly and are great quality.</li>
            <li>The large fan brush is beautiful, probably my favourite out of the bunch!</li>
            <li>Brushes themselves are excellently made and are very high quality.</li>
            <li>However, that hasn&#x27;t changed my review because this an amazing kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing quality.</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li>This would make for an amazing gift for a makeup lover.</li>
            <li>I really like is the tightness of the bristles, they don&#x27;t fall out, the softness and the perfect tapers of the angled and rounded brushes.</li>
            <li>i am thrilled with this set and how well the brushes perform.  </li>
            <li>The handles are made of wood and feel really nice.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to receive these brushes in the mail courtesy of the company to test and review.</li>
            <li>However, I was amazed at how nice the package was presented when I opened it.</li>
            <li>The brush set comes with its own carrying/storage case too.</li>
            <li>(My wife got this kit to review and this is what she had to say about it in her own</li>
            <li>the case showed up with 32 pieces inside which is a nice verity of brushes, and</li>
            <li>label would have been a nice addition to the kit.</li>
            <li>but it looks nice</li>
            <li>I like how the brushes all have their own place in this case as well as their own head cover.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this set in exchange for my honest opinionlean.</li>
            <li>I was given this set in exchange for my honest opinion</li>
            <li>The opinions are based on my own use of and experience with the item(s).</li>
            <li>but they are all nice brushes, the travel case that they come in has a plastic smell to it.</li>
            <li>It also comes in a nice case to hold your brushes and see what you have instead of just being thrown in a bag.  </li>
            <li>Brush heads are nicely made and have a gradient color to them.</li>
            <li>The brushes are packed in a nice plastic pouch for convenience.</li>
            <li>Each brush has its own protective sleeve and a separate slot in the pouch.</li>
            <li>EACH BRUSH HAS IT&#x27;S OWN SLOT WITH A PLASTIC BRUSH COVER.</li>
            <li>The set comes in a nicely constructed fold-able travel pouch.  </li>
            <li>The kit is lightweight and fits nicely into any medium-sized purses.</li>
            <li>The bag folds nicely and has a string to wrap around it.</li>
            <li>and I was thinking of a nice supplemental gift for the girl that has everything.  </li>
            <li>all my fellas out there, pick this one up as a nice gift add-on to that jewelry purchase.  </li>
            <li>The wrap also folds up perfectly so it does not take up to much room in your kit.  </li>
            <li>I got this kit as a trial run for a honest review, so here we go.</li>
            <li>Though a button or something to wrap the sting around would&#x27;ve been nice.</li>
            <li>It applies makeup nicely.  </li>
            <li>The carry case is nice and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These makeup brushes are an excellent value and seem very well-made for the price.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love!!</li>
            <li>The brush Set comes in a great quality brush wrap to keep all your brushes tidy and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product that the person which tested it for me loved so much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product that the person which tested it for me loved so much!</li>
            <li>Will make a great gift for that special lady in your life but be forewarned</li>
            <li>Between the quality of the brushes and the ease of storage, I can&#x27;t think of a more ideal set for me and I am so glad to have it!or getting detailed lines -</li>
            <li>If you are new to makeup then these are the perfect brushes for you!</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t be buying new brushes because these are perfect!</li>
            <li>Nice and soft and a wonderful price to boot!  </li>
            <li>The package have a very strong plastic smell, but can be wash.</li>
            <li>It does have a very strong paint scent....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure she will buy more from USpicy!</li>
            <li>this is by far the best set of makeup brushes i have ever used!  </li>
            <li>you go because of the really nice, stylish travel pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you go because of the really nice, stylish travel pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And everyone was impressed by how professional it looks.</li>
            <li>As for the case, it looks like real leather and is incredibly compact and travel-friendly.</li>
            <li>Brushes feel  soft on your skin and leave a perfect finish.</li>
            <li>first thing that stood out to me is how great the travel pouch is.</li>
            <li>The quality is excellent and that&#x27;s apparent as soon as you touch them.</li>
            <li>The case they came in is nice, though did have a strong chemical smell, as I think others have noted.</li>
            <li>My order showed up super fast which was awesome.</li>
            <li>There are a great range of brushes for eye makeup, and large brushes come equipped with a protective casing - would recommend this to anyone wanting to build out their brush set collection.</li>
            <li>and I love makeup and just for a lower price for all these softly handled brushes , there very very good at wat they do and or are ment for..</li>
            <li>But these are perfect if you do make-over, theatrical make-up, share with others, or you do a lot of playing around with make-up yourself, then there are plenty of options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and get lost when trying them. :)</li>
            <li>Also, for the price, you get what you pay for and more in terms of quality, style, and performance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, for the price, you get what you pay for and more in terms of quality, style, and performance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>– they are much better than any I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash them before you use them (like any brush).</li>
            <li>My brushes came fast and they are great  in the sense that they are sturdy and don&#x27;t shed.(even during washing)</li>
            <li>Most every day people would not know which brush if for what.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Get them you&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li>Overall a great set though!</li>
            <li>After attempting makeup application with the brushes, I fell even deeper in love with my purchase.</li>
            <li>So, overall, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>She told me that there was a brush for everything and more.</li>
            <li>My favorite was the angled eye liner brush.</li>
            <li>For those reasons I am deducting one star, but overall I&#x27;d recommend this roll up make up brush kit to anyone and it would make a great gift!</li>

            <li>Still great and soft brushes!</li>

            <li>She&#x27;s kind of new to experimenting with makeup and wasn&#x27;t even sure what all the brushes were used for!  </li>
            <li>So far, haven&#x27;t used all of the brushes but great set for the price</li>
            <li>These brushes are great for applying powder makeup but are too soft for applying liquid products.</li>
            <li>fast shipping and good quality.</li>
            <li>THEY CAME PACKAGED NICELY IN A VERY NICE ROLL UP SOFT CAST FOR EASY ORGANIZATION OF YOUR BRUSHES.&lt;br</li>

            <li>So, yes the makeup artists are right when they say the better the makeup brush- the better your makeup</li>
            <li>The brushes come in a beautiful case that has loops inside to hold each brush in a specific place.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find my package on the doorstep exactly when it was scheduled to arrive.</li>
            <li>and they come in a box which is great because most atuff comes in a envelope i can&#x27;t say much since i can&#x27;t really use them nor touch them</li>
            <li>they make the application of makeup so easy and precise.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed the brushes in cleaning solution after I was finished, and they seemed to hold up fine - again</li>

            <li>The construction is sound.</li>
            <li>Clean up was easy</li>
            <li>Now lets get to the important stuff,</li>

            <li>The brushes are lightweight and comfortable to hold.</li>

            <li>After use, the brushes are easy to clean and hold up well, too.</li>
            <li>brushes are smooth against my skin and my makeup application has improved drastically.</li>
            <li>This would be a great gift for a teenage girl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this kit for free to review the product.</li>
            <li>The pouch is stylish and useful.</li>
            <li>Though the bag is light weight it will take up space in your purse.</li>
            <li>They are light weight but durable and are perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved them and have had no problems with them thus far.</li>
            <li>brushes are soft, well-crafted, and of exceptional quality.&lt;br /&gt;They are easily cleaned with just a touch of warm water and do not shed.&lt;br /&gt;The faux-leather roll-up bag is very sleek and fashionable:</li>
            <li>Lots of choices, so far so good.</li>
            <li>It had many eye brushes that because the kit is all synthetic are too dense to really pack on color maybe better for a cream?  </li>
            <li>So many styles to choose, always have the right brush for the job.</li>
            <li>Feel like my mac &amp; real techniques brushes!!!</li>
            <li>They came packaged very nicely and all wrapped individually.</li>
            <li>What I love about this brand is the crisp, sleek look of the faux patent leather snakeskin case, and the huge, exhaustive variety of brushes and applicators.</li>
            <li>These brushes have SUPER soft bristles and so far the ones I have used have applied my makeup perfectly.</li>
            <li>had a sharp slanted angle, which was perfect for my cats-eye makeup; I really noticed how firm the bristles were, making it perfect for getting detailed lines -</li>
            <li>I love my new brushes i feel like i never need to buy brushes again :).</li>
            <li>The handles of the brushes are very sturdy and easy to hold on to so the days of dropping your brush at the most inopportune moment are over.</li>
            <li>I then washed the brushes and they smell super good and feel soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to have a choice between quick makeup session or in dept.&lt;br /&gt;-Upkeep: So far I&#x27;ve been using the brushes for almost a week and they haven&#x27;t shed yet.</li>
            <li>I did notice that the white tips do soak up bright colors and stain easily.</li>
            <li>This seemed like just the thing, so I was excited to give it</li>
            <li>but they feel sooo soft and seems very elegant.</li>
            <li>(sp) clean.  </li>
            <li>These make-up brushes really help your make-up look more smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is a complete 32-piece set, which I love because most sets don&#x27;t provide that</li>
            <li>It didnt distribute it the way it should, kind of absorbed too much and didnt distribute it</li>
            <li>My make-up went on very smooth, the bristles did not fall out, and they seem to be very high quality brushes.  </li>
            <li>I gave my Niece these brushes as a gift,and asked her for her opinion on them, she has said she was very impressed with them as they were well made, not cheap like some brushes she had purchased, and they were smooth to put make up on with, and gave a nice finish , also as there were 32 brushes in total</li>
            <li>There is a special brush for every type of make-up application, from contouring to blush to shaows.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The handles on the brushes are easy to grip and the bristles are very soft on the skin, making it easy to both apply and remove product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an amazing kit with a wide assortment of brushes that are of studio-quality, and are very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a breakdown of what you get in the really nice travel pouch:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It would have been really handy to have the brush&#x27;s name written somewhere in the handle, like many other brushes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>It would have been really handy to have the brush&#x27;s name written somewhere in the handle, like many other brushes do.  </li>
            <li>this is my very first set of brushes , I am trying to become a makeup artist</li>
            <li>They are top quality, and really make my makeup look much better than my old brushes.</li>
            <li>Okay first off, if you need a backup arsenal of brushes this is certainly your set.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re obviously not super great quality.</li>
            <li>The case allows you to store the brushes without taking up too much space in your bathroom, and also allows for easy access when they are needed again.  </li>
            <li>This is a full set with every kind of brush you can possibly need.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes have a good quality feel to them, no pokey or loose bristles.</li>
            <li>The soft texture of the brushes make applying makeup both easy and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Although with a little more practice, I am sure I will get used to them just fine.</li>
            <li>From whether it&#x27;s applying the makeup/powder correctly, evenly, and accurately across your face without leaving large traces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>+ on it and receiving an intriguing introduction from the company them self.&lt;br</li>
            <li>+ on it and receiving an intriguing introduction from the company them self.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have a nice, matte-like finish which definitely feels like studio-quality.</li>
            <li>All of the brushes have their own individual slot to keep them from moving around or messing up the tips.</li>
            <li>really nice brush set but some brushes were very similar</li>
            <li>They come in a nice carrying case that is simple to unroll for use.  </li>
            <li>worth every dollar</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned there are too many brushes.  </li>
            <li>brush was individually wrapped in it&#x27;s own slot.</li>
            <li>Bought it because my old Sephora set was shedding and used this set as a placeholder until I got better brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a complimentary makeup brush set for testing and review.  </li>
            <li>but it got better after I let it aired out for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but for such a set it would be nice to have one.  </li>
            <li>They are also very easy to clean and air dry rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>The high quality of the product holds the makeup well which makes it easy to apply</li>
            <li>all right</li>
            <li>We expect this type of experience right out the gate since we&#x27;re paying $40</li>
            <li>We expect this type of experience right out the gate since we&#x27;re paying $40</li>
            <li>highly recommend these fabulous brushes.</li>
            <li>USpicy makeup kit is certainly one of the most complete ones I&#x27;ve ever seen!  </li>
            <li>These brushes also  work very well with special effects makeup.</li>
            <li>Likewise, the large bristle brushes that I used for sweeping on powder and blush had soft bristles that were very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Likewise, the large bristle brushes that I used for sweeping on powder and blush had soft bristles that were very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Packaging is really cute, but has a slight odor, not terrible or anything.</li>
            <li>The handles are really nice with a smooth black finish (wood I think?)</li>
            <li>The bristles are incredibly soft and gentle on the skin and they are easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>with those minor details, I think this set is really amazing</li>
            <li>Even with those minor details, I think this set is really amazing</li>
            <li>The price is nice but you&#x27;d be better off using the same amount of money to buy a higher quality, smaller set of brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very well made with bristles that are incredibly soft and gentle on the skin and comfortable, easy to hold handles.</li>
            <li>Also be sure to properly clean them before putting them back in the kit to store them and have them ready to take them with you wherever you go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are really soft and really easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had these for a short amount of time, but they seem great.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy using these and recommend them to anyone else looking for a complete set!</li>
            <li>The smaller ones work very well but the big ones aren&#x27;t very good for blending because the bristles are really flimsy.</li>
            <li>Washing them is really easy and they always end up soft, like the first time I used them.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not really sanitary to share brushes or applicators with friends, if you have a teen girl who loves to play with makeup with her friends, this would be a great gift because there are enough brushes for everybody to have their own while applying, without worrying about spreading eye infections or the bacteria which can cause</li>
            <li>but they look and feel very promising.</li>
            <li>Always important to keep those brushes clean to make them last longer.</li>
            <li>Another thing would have been nice if the kit could have been able to tie around your waste for the professional user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a huge, complete set of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I was only able to write this review with her help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are better than the ones I work with on a daily basis with my company &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Thanks Sunvalleytek!</li>
            <li>First off being a guy, I don&#x27;t use brushes so this review was written by a family member.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only suggestion I would have is that I would prefer a greater variety of brush types.</li>
            <li>So, I still have more eye shadow brushes to use next couple of times.  </li>
            <li>recommend this product to any avid makeup wearer or someone looking to spice up their look.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a fantastic quality / value set!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves the look and quality!</li>
            <li>Almost too many options for the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li>For the price and what you are getting you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>I like to wash my brushes with baby shampoo first, to remove the excess makeup</li>
            <li>I like to wash my brushes with baby shampoo first, to remove the excess makeup</li>
            <li>I like to test many different brands.</li>
            <li>Unrolling them the first time gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>This will have more types and styles of brushes than you could ever possibly need.</li>
            <li>If you buy it as a gift, it is better to open the film wrap and vent it to get rid of the smell first.</li>
            <li>I also tried the smaller brushes on my eyelids; I was able to shade with precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>OK, I did not personally review this product but gave them to Kelly to review.  </li>
            <li>So I wouldn&#x27;t exactly travel with this often.</li>
            <li>These brushes work better than other brushes I own that I bought at Sephora and Ulta, so I would definitely recommend getting</li>
            <li>This kit from USpicy is ideal for me, because it folds up into a small purse which takes up little room while keeping your brushes safe.</li>
            <li>This set ranges from feathering brushes to stipple, angled, fan, fine point, mascara applicator, two eye shadow sponge tips (quality sponge/foam tips...not the cheap rough sponge), and eyebrow brush/comb.</li>
            <li>Like a stickler brush and a more fuller eye shadow brush, as well as a foundation applicator brush that are usually flat.  </li>
            <li>My boss and the other girls in our troupe can&#x27;t wait to buy their own.</li>
            <li>Love the BINO, it is very solid and very high edges.</li>
            <li>Being a 32 piece set this would make a great gift to any makeup enthusiast or beginner as it has such a wide range of brushes.</li>
            <li>Great for a dusting of powder, highlighter or even subtle contour.</li>
            <li>We are both in agreement that these would make a great gift for anyone that is serious about their makeup.</li>
            <li>The smaller eyeshadow brushes are not as soft, and not too effective for a smokey look.</li>
            <li>USpicy Complete 32 Piece Essential Makeup Brush kit looks nice.</li>
            <li>Finally, the layout of the brushes is logical and easy to find and use.  </li>
            <li>These brushes feel great on your face, and are long and durable so you can use every single one with ease.</li>
            <li>have used these brushes a few times since they arrived, and I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I scoffed at the people bemoaning the plastic-y smell, figuring it was your average, fresh-out-of-the-package kind of thing.</li>
            <li>The foundation brush really isn&#x27;t a foundation brush, I wish it was either more domed or flat.  </li>
            <li>The smaller lip and eye liner brushes are generally of a higher quality, except when it comes to the fine liner brush.</li>
            <li>I love them sooo much, they work extremely well for such cheap brushes and they came quickly too.</li>
            <li>With the kit, you can easily carry all 32 pieces and not have to pack everything last minute.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and plush.</li>
            <li>The brushes in this set are super soft, wash well and do not shed.</li>
            <li>Super soft, no shed brushes.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been easy for the girls in my family to find a makeup kit with enough brushes and applyers</li>
            <li>The handle is made of wood in matte black and feels nice in the hand</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and hold makeup well.</li>
            <li>it was so strong that i let it air out outside.</li>
            <li>&gt;  &amp;#62; 6x  Large Shadow Brushes</li>
            <li>I tried out the large brushes, which distributed foundation and powder evenly over my face.  </li>
            <li>she stated she has never owned a collection of make up brushes this large before.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft yet they are able to carry out the desired make-up effect at the same time.</li>
            <li>When I first got the kit the bag looked very classy though it did come with a chemical smell at first</li>
            <li>The eyeliner brush just isn&#x27;t fine enough.  </li>
            <li>The little stippling brushes are great for applying concealer around your nose and eye area but not for entire face.</li>
            <li>They grab make-up and hold it until gently applied.</li>
            <li>The larger brushes blended my foundation and contour powder smoothly</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m not the type of girl who wears a whole lot of makeup, so I&#x27;m not well versed in which brush does what.</li>
            <li>are very well</li>
            <li>I really recommend these.</li>
            <li>And reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this set to makeup students, professionals and even diyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this brush set.  </li>
            <li>While the face, powder, and blush brushes are absolutely divine, the eye shadow brushes aren&#x27;t my cup of tea.</li>
            <li>Because of the travel case, she could fit all these brushes inside and conveniently carry them all in her backpack for her daily makeup work.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>It is designed for makeup professionals, but its price point is also suitable for the average lady.</li>
            <li>High quality brushes!</li>
            <li>At a very affordable price</li>
            <li>It was very affordable and looked to be made of high-quality materials, so I gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li>Worked really well.</li>
            <li>Distributes very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bronzer brush/Blush brush, didnt distribute very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Eyebrow brush works very well also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only way they could have been better would be if they were marked, e.g. eye shadow, eyeliner, etc.  </li>
            <li>would have liked to see a fluffy eyeshadow brush.</li>
            <li>Most likely I would leave it someplace I frequent like my job.</li>
            <li>Recently purchased these brushes and am very satisfied with them, but as I am new to contouring and all the application processes, I need the brushes to be individually identified.  </li>
            <li>The handles are well made and very nice looking with a flat black look to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a complete brush set from broad application of foundation to stipple brush and fine detail for eyes.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my new USpicy makeup brush set because it truly is a very complete set of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>It is not bad but it smells little bit of cheap plastic</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes themselves are higher quality than I expected; since this is my first “Real” makeup brush set, I noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li>I think it would make it a lot easier for someone new to a large brush set.</li>
            <li>There are a ton of brushes, probably more than the average person will use.</li>
            <li>It came in a nice vinyl bag that resembles a small hand purse.</li>
            <li>I love the way they apply my eye shadow, the different sizes to get the look you want from inside to outside of eye.  </li>
            <li>Good for the price, but I was missing a brush when I got it and the hairs fall out of some of the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li>Either way, you have every brush necessary to beautify your eyes from the outside to the inside - safely of course.</li>
            <li>Many are the same style and almost the same size.  </li>
            <li>The travel bag is the main source of the paint</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li>They are VERY soft and I really like them.</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes!</li>
            <li>The long handle makes the brushes easy to hold and are comparable to professional sets.</li>
            <li>I mainly use the large powder brush so far.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>We both highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We both highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Everything about these brushes just says High Quality.</li>
            <li>but i highly recommend if ur a makeup lover like my sister</li>
            <li>they are high quality!😍</li>
            <li>I am a Cosmetologist and I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this makeup brush set.  </li>
            <li>wow can&#x27;t believe this set it has a brush for everything !!  </li>
            <li>but I really love the little wrap around string.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Brushes come in all sizing which is good for getting the tough spots like under your eyes.</li>
            <li>her opinion, these are very high quality brushes which give her professional touch and toning looks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft and they hold the product very well.</li>
            <li>we found it a pleasure to use makeup brushes that were so soft, gentle, and easy-to-use without worrying about them snapping or breaking during usage.</li>
            <li>we found it a pleasure to use makeup brushes that were so soft, gentle, and easy-to-use without worrying about them snapping or breaking during usage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about the size of a clutch purse when closed, and would fit neatly in a suitcase, briefcase, or vanity drawer.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are really soft and feel gentle on the skin, comparable to some branded brushes that I have&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>My girlfriend was pleasantly surprised and told me she would ABSOLUTELY recommend them without hesitation.  </li>
            <li>I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got to use my new makeup brushes for my one year anniversary dinner.</li>
            <li>The case is still looking brand new</li>
            <li>I wish there were a few more shadow brushes that were not stiff like a foundation brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more economical to wash and dry brushes instead of replacing foam ones every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;We would recommend this to every woman out there who wants to have professional makeup tools and the appearance you can get from them without having to go to a professional every time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We would recommend this to every woman out there who wants to have professional makeup tools and the appearance you can get from them without having to go to a professional every time.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a foundation brush, a blending brush, or a pencil brush, but that&#x27;s not a disclaimer though I got a different set on Amazon that was equally as cheap</li>
            <li>The black case that all the brushes came in also makes it very convenient to travel with and helps keep them clean.</li>
            <li>Every brush and tool feels very soft on the face.</li>
            <li>I like them because they are very soft and durable.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed and they feel very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>They are very soft.</li>
            <li>Im very surprised on the packaging of this..</li>
            <li>wife likes it very much and highly recommend it to anyone who needs daily a convenient set of brushes like this USpicy Complete 32.</li>
            <li>the brushes:&lt;br /&gt;-Bristles are very soft</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and comfy against the skin.  </li>
            <li>stitches came unraveled which isn&#x27;t a big deal because you can get a new one from many of other stores.</li>
            <li>I was recently provided with a free USpicy Complete 32 Piece Essential Makeup Brush Set with Travel Pouch for the purposes of evaluating it and writing this review.</li>
            <li>Each brush I tried had a different bristle texture, making them each uniquely suited to the different products I was using – be it powder, concealer, or eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>but overall they stayed in tact pretty well.</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m headed to YouTube to start upgrading my natural beauty!</li>
            <li>I hate the idea now that each brush coming on my face may have the poisons the are within Chinese products but for the price i still am happy :)</li>
            <li>got here early and no bends or shedding!</li>
            <li>My reaction after receiving this set was simply WOW!</li>
            <li>Opened this set of brushes up and WOW!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty big, which makes sense for a bag carrying 32 brushes(believe</li>
            <li>Soft, doesn’t absorb too much makeup and blends it all very well with no streaks left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the smell just comes from being in the make up bag so long so not a huge deal.</li>
            <li>certainly none that were high quality, so I may also have different needs than, say, a makeup artist.</li>
            <li>After using a few of these brushes Kelly stated they worked fine but were softer than what she normally buys.  </li>
            <li>They brushes are all very soft and no shedding so far.  </li>
            <li>I really would have loved if there was a small, round blending brush for the eyes.</li>

            <li>The larger brushes are very soft and have worked very well for contouring.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t any brushes that can be used to blend out eyeshadow, a very basic brush need in a set as large as this.</li>
            <li>Some brushes are very thin tipped, some are angled for precision and some are large and fluffy, making any kind of makeup application easy and efficient.  </li>
            <li>and then I clean them with your typical brush</li>

            <li>It looks really professional and sleek.</li>
            <li>Also if you have sensitive eyelids like I do, these brushes are so soft that they wont hurt when using them.</li>
            <li>They are still as soft as when I they arrived.</li>
            <li>They are still as soft as when I they arrived.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I think there are too much brushes period</li>
            <li>The makeup roll leaves much to be desired as the brushes are constantly falling</li>
            <li>I aired them out overnight and</li>
            <li>So soft, and well shaped.</li>
            <li>Plus, there&#x27;s a brush for every conceivable technique.</li>
            <li>Looking for a professional look to your makeup?  </li>
            <li>I found these brushes a pleasure to use, and I felt like a professional makeup artist as I selected the brushes and made up</li>
            <li>The brushes are silky soft indeed, and they pick up makeup and apply it well.</li>
            <li>THIS POUCH IS SOFT AND DURABLE, TIES SHUT</li>
            <li>As I unwrapped them, I noticed the sturdy construction and soft hairs.  </li>
            <li>brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li>So so soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes stay soft after washing with soap.</li>
            <li>The soft bristles do not seem to cause any irritation, and I have had no issues with these losing bristles over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This review is for the USpicy Complete 32 Piece Makeup Brush Set w/ Travel Pouch.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the bristles shedding so far.</li>
            <li>The brushes picked up the powders perfectly like base, primer and eye shadows.</li>
            <li>Brushes picked up powders (base, primer, and eye shadows) perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The repeats also mean that you are getting any more versatility than you would from a 10-15 brush set.</li>
            <li>The inside of the case is a thicker vinyl/pleather material (for easy wipe down) and an upper flap covers the brush bristles to keep protected.  </li>
            <li>The smaller eye shadow brushes are pretty meh, I&#x27;ve gone back to using my old ones, but I really like the face brushes and have been using them daily!</li>
            <li>Even though it was a bit overwhelming for me I learned a few new tricks especially with the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth checking out, especially with the high prices of other makeup kits.</li>
            <li>would say that I wish there were more of the larger brushes and less of the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li>As I just received this set, I have only had the opportunity to try it out once, so I can&#x27;t comment on the long-term durability; I&#x27;ve also only used 8 out of the 32 brushes, since this was my first test.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first since I have my Sigma brushes and love them</li>
            <li>My wife highly recommends them, and she provided the following comments:&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had no fallout or shedding of the bristles and they dry supper fast.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had no fallout or shedding of the bristles and they dry supper fast.</li>
            <li>After using it for a month, I feel that the brushes are bit long because when using it, my face is very close to the mirror and it bumps into it sometimes.</li>
            <li>brushes come in a faux leather (&amp;#34;pleather&amp;#34;) case with wrap strings to keep it closed</li>
            <li>The thin one appropriate for the outer edge of the lip, with the larger one distributing lipstick on the whole lip.</li>
            <li>I do wish the case had a snap closure instead of the tie laces, but overall this is a very complete, high quality set of brushes that should last a lifetime.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The kit includes various brushes of different sizes for certain purposes.  </li>
            <li>have recently gotten into experimenting with new kinds of makeup and these brushes have me covered on everything.  </li>
            <li>Got it the same day, thanks to prime and same day deliveries.</li>
            <li>USpicy Complete 32 Piece Essential Makeup Brush Set is really complete with variety of brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The set looks small but it has a full complete 32 brushes for all makeup needs.</li>
            <li>The tools dry very fast if washed and laid out properly.</li>
            <li>Or at least my wife does! :)</li>
            <li>I could also easily do without the sponge applicators, I find those pretty useless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-1x Blending Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Blush Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Powder Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Large Power Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Angled Contour Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Small Fan Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Large Fan Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the foundation brush absorbed the make up a little too much which made it harder to evenly distribute the make up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist so having brushes is key.</li>
            <li>I left it out in the garage for a couple of days and the odor was completely gone.</li>
            <li>The container that comes with them definitely has a plastic odor and needs aired out</li>
            <li>The hairs are soft, the brushes are solid, and I have not observed any shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve seen so far is a bridle or two staying from the group sort to speak.</li>
            <li>so they feel extra soft.</li>
            <li>Gets concealer into small areas, soft and with Just the right texture.</li>
            <li>Here was a slight chemical smell to set when first opened but after airing for about 10 min,</li>
            <li>What makes this set unique is that you get a few brushes not normally seen in other large sets.</li>
            <li>They feel akin to a more expensive professional set I purchased years ago.</li>
            <li>The case did smell a little plasticity when I first received it, but that went away after a day or so.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very stiff and many are very similar to other ones in the set.</li>
            <li>I found that none of the bristles came loose and the handles were very firm and smooth.</li>
            <li>She has a few favorites out of the set, I&#x27;ve noticed, and even after a week or so of use, they all look the same as when we first got them.</li>
            <li>This may seem like a very obvious thing to say, but most of the small brush sets I&#x27;ve owned before had little difference in texture, so to me this is a mark of a higher-quality set than the inexpensive ones I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li>To ice it all off, the kit comes with a fashionable little faux leather case to store everything in that is very travel</li>
            <li>Also, expected a variety of eyeshadow brushes that is not all synthetic not stiff because they all are.</li>
            <li>I loved the case it came in, however the smell was really bad</li>

            <li> I think this was a good deal for a good price.  </li>
            <li> a good shampooing of the stiffer brushes may help the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love these brushes, I bought them three times!</li>
            <li> and I COULDN&#x27;T AGREE MORE!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this brush set!</li>
            <li> There are so many!</li>
            <li> they came very quickly and are great quality.</li>
            <li> The large fan brush is beautiful, probably my favourite out of the bunch!</li>
            <li> Brushes themselves are excellently made and are very high quality.</li>
            <li> However, that hasn&#x27;t changed my review because this an amazing kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li> This would make for an amazing gift for a makeup lover.</li>
            <li> I really like is the tightness of the bristles, they don&#x27;t fall out, the softness and the perfect tapers of the angled and rounded brushes.</li>
            <li> i am thrilled with this set and how well the brushes perform.  </li>
            <li> The handles are made of wood and feel really nice.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to receive these brushes in the mail courtesy of the company to test and review.</li>
            <li> However, I was amazed at how nice the package was presented when I opened it.</li>
            <li> The brush set comes with its own carrying/storage case too.</li>
            <li> (My wife got this kit to review and this is what she had to say about it in her own</li>
            <li> the case showed up with 32 pieces inside which is a nice verity of brushes, and</li>
            <li> label would have been a nice addition to the kit.</li>
            <li> but it looks nice</li>
            <li> I like how the brushes all have their own place in this case as well as their own head cover.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this set in exchange for my honest opinionlean.</li>
            <li> I was given this set in exchange for my honest opinion</li>
            <li> The opinions are based on my own use of and experience with the item(s).</li>
            <li> but they are all nice brushes, the travel case that they come in has a plastic smell to it.</li>
            <li> It also comes in a nice case to hold your brushes and see what you have instead of just being thrown in a bag.  </li>
            <li> Brush heads are nicely made and have a gradient color to them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are packed in a nice plastic pouch for convenience.</li>
            <li> Each brush has its own protective sleeve and a separate slot in the pouch.</li>
            <li> EACH BRUSH HAS IT&#x27;S OWN SLOT WITH A PLASTIC BRUSH COVER.</li>
            <li> The set comes in a nicely constructed fold-able travel pouch.  </li>
            <li> The kit is lightweight and fits nicely into any medium-sized purses.</li>
            <li> The bag folds nicely and has a string to wrap around it.</li>
            <li> and I was thinking of a nice supplemental gift for the girl that has everything.  </li>
            <li> all my fellas out there, pick this one up as a nice gift add-on to that jewelry purchase.  </li>
            <li> The wrap also folds up perfectly so it does not take up to much room in your kit.  </li>
            <li> I got this kit as a trial run for a honest review, so here we go.</li>
            <li> Though a button or something to wrap the sting around would&#x27;ve been nice.</li>
            <li> It applies makeup nicely.  </li>
            <li> The carry case is nice and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are an excellent value and seem very well-made for the price.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love!!</li>
            <li> The brush Set comes in a great quality brush wrap to keep all your brushes tidy and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great product that the person which tested it for me loved so much!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great product that the person which tested it for me loved so much!</li>
            <li> Will make a great gift for that special lady in your life but be forewarned</li>
            <li> Between the quality of the brushes and the ease of storage, I can&#x27;t think of a more ideal set for me and I am so glad to have it!or getting detailed lines -</li>
            <li> If you are new to makeup then these are the perfect brushes for you!</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t be buying new brushes because these are perfect!</li>
            <li> Nice and soft and a wonderful price to boot!  </li>
            <li> The package have a very strong plastic smell, but can be wash.</li>
            <li> It does have a very strong paint scent....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure she will buy more from USpicy!</li>
            <li> this is by far the best set of makeup brushes i have ever used!  </li>
            <li> you go because of the really nice, stylish travel pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you go because of the really nice, stylish travel pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And everyone was impressed by how professional it looks.</li>
            <li> As for the case, it looks like real leather and is incredibly compact and travel-friendly.</li>
            <li> Brushes feel  soft on your skin and leave a perfect finish.</li>
            <li> first thing that stood out to me is how great the travel pouch is.</li>
            <li> The quality is excellent and that&#x27;s apparent as soon as you touch them.</li>
            <li> The case they came in is nice, though did have a strong chemical smell, as I think others have noted.</li>
            <li> My order showed up super fast which was awesome.</li>
            <li> There are a great range of brushes for eye makeup, and large brushes come equipped with a protective casing - would recommend this to anyone wanting to build out their brush set collection.</li>
            <li> and I love makeup and just for a lower price for all these softly handled brushes , there very very good at wat they do and or are ment for..</li>
            <li> But these are perfect if you do make-over, theatrical make-up, share with others, or you do a lot of playing around with make-up yourself, then there are plenty of options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and get lost when trying them. :)</li>
            <li> Also, for the price, you get what you pay for and more in terms of quality, style, and performance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> – they are much better than any I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash them before you use them (like any brush).</li>
            <li> My brushes came fast and they are great  in the sense that they are sturdy and don&#x27;t shed.(even during washing)</li>
            <li> Most every day people would not know which brush if for what.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Get them you&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> Overall a great set though!</li>
            <li> After attempting makeup application with the brushes, I fell even deeper in love with my purchase.</li>
            <li> So, overall, I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> She told me that there was a brush for everything and more.</li>
            <li> My favorite was the angled eye liner brush.</li>
            <li> For those reasons I am deducting one star, but overall I&#x27;d recommend this roll up make up brush kit to anyone and it would make a great gift!</li>

            <li> Well, I started digging for cosmetic accessories and came across this wonderful USpicy 32-Piece Essential Makeup Brush Kit.  </li>
            <li> She will surely appreciate it. :)</li>
            <li> Maybe this set is better suited for those that use cream as opposed to powder products</li>
            <li> I love it.....</li>
            <li> but i love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, there is more than one brush of each.&lt;br /&gt;No foundation Brush,Used powder brush instead of foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I love that there are so many brushes to use from foundation to lips to blush.</li>
            <li> The handles are a beautiful matte black and feel great to hold.</li>

            <li> pleased with the set and have recommended to friends and family as it&#x27;s much more handy getting these brushes in a set, in a pouch, compared to having to seek the right brushes out and buying them separately!</li>
            <li> This is my first real set of make up brushes, and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> I go and some of the brushes even come with its own protective plastic cover which keeps it clean.</li>
            <li> These are high quality and work great in applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> Good quality and very fast post.</li>
            <li> (I use a special cleanser from my esthetician but warm soapy water would work).</li>
            <li> It has the look and feel of real leather while being incredibly compact and super travel-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wife said the brushes were definitely the best quality she had ever used and the travel case made them easy to store and carry around.</li>

            <li> I say they hold up pretty good.</li>
            <li> I loved the pouch the brushes came in and the feel and look of them on first impressions</li>
            <li> As a reviewer, I&#x27;ve received a number of makeup brush kits for free to review, so as the owner of seven such kits, I can tell you with confidence that this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> My brushes have just arrived and they look great and their very soft.  </li>
            <li> As for the brushes, they are very soft and I haven&#x27;t experienced any fall out.</li>
            <li> Still great and soft brushes!</li>
            <li> They all fit perfect and stand pretty much straight up, so they are not at an angle spreading out and taking up allot of room on counter.  </li>
            <li> Was NOT disappointed, they are beautiful and high quality.</li>
            <li> The case is very nice looking - glossy back with a shiny gloss and has a nice texture to it.</li>
            <li> Brushes are nice quality and well presented, no stray hairs falling out of the brushes during use, and there&#x27;s a nice variety of sizes and shapes and types, in a decent quality wrap.</li>

            <li> Overall, they are very good brushes for this price.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes, easy to work with and the material is very soft.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s kind of new to experimenting with makeup and wasn&#x27;t even sure what all the brushes were used for!  </li>
            <li> So far, haven&#x27;t used all of the brushes but great set for the price</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for applying powder makeup but are too soft for applying liquid products.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and good quality.</li>
            <li> THEY CAME PACKAGED NICELY IN A VERY NICE ROLL UP SOFT CAST FOR EASY ORGANIZATION OF YOUR BRUSHES.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Cleaning the brushes are easy as well.</li>
            <li> more thing, this set is really easy to clean.</li>

            <li> Easy to wash off the make up from the brushes without using makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and I promised to provide a completely honest and fair review.ing last minute.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong</li>

            <li> I would definitely recommend this brush set, it is a really good quality and has every brush you need as-well as keeping neat and tidy.</li>
            <li> travel case is WAY better than what I was expecting, it is a pretty leather with a nice leather interior, which makes it easier to clean.</li>
            <li> So, yes the makeup artists are right when they say the better the makeup brush- the better your makeup</li>
            <li> The brushes come in a beautiful case that has loops inside to hold each brush in a specific place.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find my package on the doorstep exactly when it was scheduled to arrive.</li>
            <li> and they come in a box which is great because most atuff comes in a envelope i can&#x27;t say much since i can&#x27;t really use them nor touch them</li>
            <li> they make the application of makeup so easy and precise.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed the brushes in cleaning solution after I was finished, and they seemed to hold up fine - again</li>

            <li> If you do have a problem with it just wash the brushes and it&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li> The bag will fit easily into a travel bag or carry-on luggage.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot for work and love that I can quickly roll it up, tie, and throw in my overnight bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes are smooth but the glue scent is really strong tho</li>
            <li> it is super cute</li>
            <li> They are very soft and has a good variety.  </li>
            <li> The quality is good and the brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I otherwise compensated for giving my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> They shipped super fast!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent  brushes super soft and apply make up very well</li>
            <li> Nice for a large set.</li>
            <li> The roll up travel case is a huge convenience.</li>
            <li> set includes a huge number of brushes.</li>
            <li> When opened up the set is huge.</li>
            <li> My makeup turned out great, and I could definitely tell a difference in using these brushes</li>
            <li> My makeup turned out great, and I could definitely tell a difference in using these brushes</li>
            <li> The construction is sound.</li>
            <li> Clean up was easy</li>
            <li> Now lets get to the important stuff,</li>
            <li> gave this a solid 5 stars it is a great assortment</li>
            <li> These are great for beginners with makeup, who want to step into the process of highlights, bronzer, concealer, shadows and such.</li>
            <li> The brushes are lightweight and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> but you can definitely tell that they are great quality brushes.  </li>
            <li> After use, the brushes are easy to clean and hold up well, too.</li>
            <li> brushes are smooth against my skin and my makeup application has improved drastically.</li>
            <li> This would be a great gift for a teenage girl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this kit for free to review the product.</li>
            <li> The pouch is stylish and useful.</li>
            <li> Though the bag is light weight it will take up space in your purse.</li>
            <li> They are light weight but durable and are perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved them and have had no problems with them thus far.</li>
            <li> brushes are soft, well-crafted, and of exceptional quality.&lt;br /&gt;They are easily cleaned with just a touch of warm water and do not shed.&lt;br /&gt;The faux-leather roll-up bag is very sleek and fashionable:</li>
            <li> Lots of choices, so far so good.</li>
            <li> It had many eye brushes that because the kit is all synthetic are too dense to really pack on color maybe better for a cream?  </li>
            <li> So many styles to choose, always have the right brush for the job.</li>
            <li> Feel like my mac &amp; real techniques brushes!!!</li>
            <li> They came packaged very nicely and all wrapped individually.</li>
            <li> What I love about this brand is the crisp, sleek look of the faux patent leather snakeskin case, and the huge, exhaustive variety of brushes and applicators.</li>
            <li> These brushes have SUPER soft bristles and so far the ones I have used have applied my makeup perfectly.</li>
            <li> had a sharp slanted angle, which was perfect for my cats-eye makeup; I really noticed how firm the bristles were, making it perfect for getting detailed lines -</li>
            <li> I love my new brushes i feel like i never need to buy brushes again :).</li>
            <li> The handles of the brushes are very sturdy and easy to hold on to so the days of dropping your brush at the most inopportune moment are over.</li>
            <li> I then washed the brushes and they smell super good and feel soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to have a choice between quick makeup session or in dept.&lt;br /&gt;-Upkeep: So far I&#x27;ve been using the brushes for almost a week and they haven&#x27;t shed yet.</li>
            <li> I did notice that the white tips do soak up bright colors and stain easily.</li>
            <li> This seemed like just the thing, so I was excited to give it</li>
            <li> but they feel sooo soft and seems very elegant.</li>
            <li> (sp) clean.  </li>
            <li> These make-up brushes really help your make-up look more smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is a complete 32-piece set, which I love because most sets don&#x27;t provide that</li>
            <li> It didnt distribute it the way it should, kind of absorbed too much and didnt distribute it</li>
            <li> My make-up went on very smooth, the bristles did not fall out, and they seem to be very high quality brushes.  </li>
            <li> I gave my Niece these brushes as a gift,and asked her for her opinion on them, she has said she was very impressed with them as they were well made, not cheap like some brushes she had purchased, and they were smooth to put make up on with, and gave a nice finish , also as there were 32 brushes in total</li>
            <li> There is a special brush for every type of make-up application, from contouring to blush to shaows.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It is really sturdy and keeps the brushes clean and safe.</li>
            <li> Very high quality for a fantastic price !</li>
            <li> What I expected, and great for the price.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and smooth and feel very comfortable on the face.  </li>

            <li> The brushes are nice and soft, though they don&#x27;t always pick up the product that well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice set and the brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and soft, and includes 32 pieces with case.</li>

            <li> They are very soft to the touch, and the handles are very strong</li>
            <li> It had a strong, plastic odor when I first opened it</li>
            <li> This set of brushes from USpicy is perfect for anyone who is serious about doing makeup or who wants to get more into it, and has every tool you&#x27;ll need to get the job done.</li>
            <li> This review is based on the packaging, appearance and how quickly they arrived...</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The handles on the brushes are easy to grip and the bristles are very soft on the skin, making it easy to both apply and remove product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an amazing kit with a wide assortment of brushes that are of studio-quality, and are very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a breakdown of what you get in the really nice travel pouch:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It would have been really handy to have the brush&#x27;s name written somewhere in the handle, like many other brushes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> It would have been really handy to have the brush&#x27;s name written somewhere in the handle, like many other brushes do.  </li>
            <li> this is my very first set of brushes , I am trying to become a makeup artist</li>
            <li> They are top quality, and really make my makeup look much better than my old brushes.</li>
            <li> Okay first off, if you need a backup arsenal of brushes this is certainly your set.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re obviously not super great quality.</li>
            <li> The case allows you to store the brushes without taking up too much space in your bathroom, and also allows for easy access when they are needed again.  </li>
            <li> This is a full set with every kind of brush you can possibly need.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes have a good quality feel to them, no pokey or loose bristles.</li>
            <li> The soft texture of the brushes make applying makeup both easy and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Although with a little more practice, I am sure I will get used to them just fine.</li>
            <li> From whether it&#x27;s applying the makeup/powder correctly, evenly, and accurately across your face without leaving large traces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> + on it and receiving an intriguing introduction from the company them self.&lt;br</li>
            <li> + on it and receiving an intriguing introduction from the company them self.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have a nice, matte-like finish which definitely feels like studio-quality.</li>
            <li> All of the brushes have their own individual slot to keep them from moving around or messing up the tips.</li>
            <li> really nice brush set but some brushes were very similar</li>
            <li> They come in a nice carrying case that is simple to unroll for use.  </li>
            <li> worth every dollar</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned there are too many brushes.  </li>
            <li> brush was individually wrapped in it&#x27;s own slot.</li>
            <li> Bought it because my old Sephora set was shedding and used this set as a placeholder until I got better brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I received a complimentary makeup brush set for testing and review.  </li>
            <li> but it got better after I let it aired out for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but for such a set it would be nice to have one.  </li>
            <li> They are also very easy to clean and air dry rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> The high quality of the product holds the makeup well which makes it easy to apply</li>
            <li> all right</li>
            <li> We expect this type of experience right out the gate since we&#x27;re paying $40</li>
            <li> We expect this type of experience right out the gate since we&#x27;re paying $40</li>
            <li> highly recommend these fabulous brushes.</li>
            <li> USpicy makeup kit is certainly one of the most complete ones I&#x27;ve ever seen!  </li>
            <li> These brushes also  work very well with special effects makeup.</li>
            <li> Likewise, the large bristle brushes that I used for sweeping on powder and blush had soft bristles that were very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Likewise, the large bristle brushes that I used for sweeping on powder and blush had soft bristles that were very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Packaging is really cute, but has a slight odor, not terrible or anything.</li>
            <li> The handles are really nice with a smooth black finish (wood I think?)</li>
            <li> The bristles are incredibly soft and gentle on the skin and they are easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> with those minor details, I think this set is really amazing</li>
            <li> Even with those minor details, I think this set is really amazing</li>
            <li> The price is nice but you&#x27;d be better off using the same amount of money to buy a higher quality, smaller set of brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very well made with bristles that are incredibly soft and gentle on the skin and comfortable, easy to hold handles.</li>
            <li> Also be sure to properly clean them before putting them back in the kit to store them and have them ready to take them with you wherever you go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are really soft and really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had these for a short amount of time, but they seem great.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy using these and recommend them to anyone else looking for a complete set!</li>
            <li> The smaller ones work very well but the big ones aren&#x27;t very good for blending because the bristles are really flimsy.</li>
            <li> Washing them is really easy and they always end up soft, like the first time I used them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really sanitary to share brushes or applicators with friends, if you have a teen girl who loves to play with makeup with her friends, this would be a great gift because there are enough brushes for everybody to have their own while applying, without worrying about spreading eye infections or the bacteria which can cause</li>
            <li> but they look and feel very promising.</li>
            <li> Always important to keep those brushes clean to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> Another thing would have been nice if the kit could have been able to tie around your waste for the professional user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a huge, complete set of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I was only able to write this review with her help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are better than the ones I work with on a daily basis with my company &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Thanks Sunvalleytek!</li>
            <li> First off being a guy, I don&#x27;t use brushes so this review was written by a family member.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only suggestion I would have is that I would prefer a greater variety of brush types.</li>
            <li> So, I still have more eye shadow brushes to use next couple of times.  </li>
            <li> recommend this product to any avid makeup wearer or someone looking to spice up their look.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a fantastic quality / value set!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves the look and quality!</li>
            <li> Almost too many options for the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> For the price and what you are getting you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I like to wash my brushes with baby shampoo first, to remove the excess makeup</li>
            <li> I like to wash my brushes with baby shampoo first, to remove the excess makeup</li>
            <li> I like to test many different brands.</li>
            <li> Unrolling them the first time gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> This will have more types and styles of brushes than you could ever possibly need.</li>
            <li> If you buy it as a gift, it is better to open the film wrap and vent it to get rid of the smell first.</li>
            <li> I also tried the smaller brushes on my eyelids; I was able to shade with precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> OK, I did not personally review this product but gave them to Kelly to review.  </li>
            <li> So I wouldn&#x27;t exactly travel with this often.</li>
            <li> These brushes work better than other brushes I own that I bought at Sephora and Ulta, so I would definitely recommend getting</li>
            <li> This kit from USpicy is ideal for me, because it folds up into a small purse which takes up little room while keeping your brushes safe.</li>
            <li> This set ranges from feathering brushes to stipple, angled, fan, fine point, mascara applicator, two eye shadow sponge tips (quality sponge/foam tips...not the cheap rough sponge), and eyebrow brush/comb.</li>
            <li> Like a stickler brush and a more fuller eye shadow brush, as well as a foundation applicator brush that are usually flat.  </li>
            <li> My boss and the other girls in our troupe can&#x27;t wait to buy their own.</li>
            <li> Love the BINO, it is very solid and very high edges.</li>
            <li> Being a 32 piece set this would make a great gift to any makeup enthusiast or beginner as it has such a wide range of brushes.</li>
            <li> Great for a dusting of powder, highlighter or even subtle contour.</li>
            <li> We are both in agreement that these would make a great gift for anyone that is serious about their makeup.</li>
            <li> The smaller eyeshadow brushes are not as soft, and not too effective for a smokey look.</li>
            <li> USpicy Complete 32 Piece Essential Makeup Brush kit looks nice.</li>
            <li> Finally, the layout of the brushes is logical and easy to find and use.  </li>
            <li> These brushes feel great on your face, and are long and durable so you can use every single one with ease.</li>
            <li> have used these brushes a few times since they arrived, and I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I scoffed at the people bemoaning the plastic-y smell, figuring it was your average, fresh-out-of-the-package kind of thing.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush really isn&#x27;t a foundation brush, I wish it was either more domed or flat.  </li>
            <li> The smaller lip and eye liner brushes are generally of a higher quality, except when it comes to the fine liner brush.</li>
            <li> I love them sooo much, they work extremely well for such cheap brushes and they came quickly too.</li>
            <li> With the kit, you can easily carry all 32 pieces and not have to pack everything last minute.</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and plush.</li>
            <li> The brushes in this set are super soft, wash well and do not shed.</li>
            <li> Super soft, no shed brushes.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been easy for the girls in my family to find a makeup kit with enough brushes and applyers</li>
            <li> The handle is made of wood in matte black and feels nice in the hand</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and hold makeup well.</li>
            <li> it was so strong that i let it air out outside.</li>
            <li> &gt;  &amp;#62; 6x  Large Shadow Brushes</li>
            <li> I tried out the large brushes, which distributed foundation and powder evenly over my face.  </li>
            <li> she stated she has never owned a collection of make up brushes this large before.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft yet they are able to carry out the desired make-up effect at the same time.</li>
            <li> When I first got the kit the bag looked very classy though it did come with a chemical smell at first</li>
            <li> The eyeliner brush just isn&#x27;t fine enough.  </li>
            <li> The little stippling brushes are great for applying concealer around your nose and eye area but not for entire face.</li>
            <li> They grab make-up and hold it until gently applied.</li>
            <li> The larger brushes blended my foundation and contour powder smoothly</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not the type of girl who wears a whole lot of makeup, so I&#x27;m not well versed in which brush does what.</li>
            <li> are very well</li>
            <li> I really recommend these.</li>
            <li> And reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this set to makeup students, professionals and even diyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brush set.  </li>
            <li> While the face, powder, and blush brushes are absolutely divine, the eye shadow brushes aren&#x27;t my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> Because of the travel case, she could fit all these brushes inside and conveniently carry them all in her backpack for her daily makeup work.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> It is designed for makeup professionals, but its price point is also suitable for the average lady.</li>
            <li> High quality brushes!</li>
            <li> At a very affordable price</li>
            <li> It was very affordable and looked to be made of high-quality materials, so I gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li> Worked really well.</li>
            <li> Distributes very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bronzer brush/Blush brush, didnt distribute very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eyebrow brush works very well also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only way they could have been better would be if they were marked, e.g. eye shadow, eyeliner, etc.  </li>
            <li> would have liked to see a fluffy eyeshadow brush.</li>
            <li> Most likely I would leave it someplace I frequent like my job.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased these brushes and am very satisfied with them, but as I am new to contouring and all the application processes, I need the brushes to be individually identified.  </li>
            <li> The handles are well made and very nice looking with a flat black look to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a complete brush set from broad application of foundation to stipple brush and fine detail for eyes.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my new USpicy makeup brush set because it truly is a very complete set of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> It is not bad but it smells little bit of cheap plastic</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes themselves are higher quality than I expected; since this is my first “Real” makeup brush set, I noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li> I think it would make it a lot easier for someone new to a large brush set.</li>
            <li> There are a ton of brushes, probably more than the average person will use.</li>
            <li> It came in a nice vinyl bag that resembles a small hand purse.</li>
            <li> I love the way they apply my eye shadow, the different sizes to get the look you want from inside to outside of eye.  </li>
            <li> Good for the price, but I was missing a brush when I got it and the hairs fall out of some of the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> Either way, you have every brush necessary to beautify your eyes from the outside to the inside - safely of course.</li>
            <li> Many are the same style and almost the same size.  </li>
            <li> The travel bag is the main source of the paint</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li> They are VERY soft and I really like them.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes!</li>
            <li> The long handle makes the brushes easy to hold and are comparable to professional sets.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the large powder brush so far.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> We both highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We both highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Everything about these brushes just says High Quality.</li>
            <li> but i highly recommend if ur a makeup lover like my sister</li>
            <li> they are high quality!😍</li>
            <li> I am a Cosmetologist and I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this makeup brush set.  </li>
            <li> wow can&#x27;t believe this set it has a brush for everything !!  </li>
            <li> but I really love the little wrap around string.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Brushes come in all sizing which is good for getting the tough spots like under your eyes.</li>
            <li> her opinion, these are very high quality brushes which give her professional touch and toning looks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft and they hold the product very well.</li>
            <li> we found it a pleasure to use makeup brushes that were so soft, gentle, and easy-to-use without worrying about them snapping or breaking during usage.</li>
            <li> we found it a pleasure to use makeup brushes that were so soft, gentle, and easy-to-use without worrying about them snapping or breaking during usage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the size of a clutch purse when closed, and would fit neatly in a suitcase, briefcase, or vanity drawer.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are really soft and feel gentle on the skin, comparable to some branded brushes that I have&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was pleasantly surprised and told me she would ABSOLUTELY recommend them without hesitation.  </li>
            <li> I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got to use my new makeup brushes for my one year anniversary dinner.</li>
            <li> The case is still looking brand new</li>
            <li> I wish there were a few more shadow brushes that were not stiff like a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also more economical to wash and dry brushes instead of replacing foam ones every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;We would recommend this to every woman out there who wants to have professional makeup tools and the appearance you can get from them without having to go to a professional every time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We would recommend this to every woman out there who wants to have professional makeup tools and the appearance you can get from them without having to go to a professional every time.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a foundation brush, a blending brush, or a pencil brush, but that&#x27;s not a disclaimer though I got a different set on Amazon that was equally as cheap</li>
            <li> The black case that all the brushes came in also makes it very convenient to travel with and helps keep them clean.</li>
            <li> Every brush and tool feels very soft on the face.</li>
            <li> I like them because they are very soft and durable.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed and they feel very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> They are very soft.</li>
            <li> Im very surprised on the packaging of this..</li>
            <li> wife likes it very much and highly recommend it to anyone who needs daily a convenient set of brushes like this USpicy Complete 32.</li>
            <li> the brushes:&lt;br /&gt;-Bristles are very soft</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and comfy against the skin.  </li>
            <li> stitches came unraveled which isn&#x27;t a big deal because you can get a new one from many of other stores.</li>
            <li> I was recently provided with a free USpicy Complete 32 Piece Essential Makeup Brush Set with Travel Pouch for the purposes of evaluating it and writing this review.</li>
            <li> Each brush I tried had a different bristle texture, making them each uniquely suited to the different products I was using – be it powder, concealer, or eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> but overall they stayed in tact pretty well.</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m headed to YouTube to start upgrading my natural beauty!</li>
            <li> I hate the idea now that each brush coming on my face may have the poisons the are within Chinese products but for the price i still am happy :)</li>
            <li> got here early and no bends or shedding!</li>
            <li> My reaction after receiving this set was simply WOW!</li>
            <li> Opened this set of brushes up and WOW!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty big, which makes sense for a bag carrying 32 brushes(believe</li>
            <li> Soft, doesn’t absorb too much makeup and blends it all very well with no streaks left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the smell just comes from being in the make up bag so long so not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> certainly none that were high quality, so I may also have different needs than, say, a makeup artist.</li>
            <li> After using a few of these brushes Kelly stated they worked fine but were softer than what she normally buys.  </li>
            <li> They brushes are all very soft and no shedding so far.  </li>
            <li> I really would have loved if there was a small, round blending brush for the eyes.</li>

            <li> The larger brushes are very soft and have worked very well for contouring.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t any brushes that can be used to blend out eyeshadow, a very basic brush need in a set as large as this.</li>
            <li> Some brushes are very thin tipped, some are angled for precision and some are large and fluffy, making any kind of makeup application easy and efficient.  </li>
            <li> and then I clean them with your typical brush</li>
            <li> and then I clean them with your typical brush cleaner.  </li>

            <li> It looks really professional and sleek.</li>
            <li> Also if you have sensitive eyelids like I do, these brushes are so soft that they wont hurt when using them.</li>
            <li> They are still as soft as when I they arrived.</li>
            <li> They are still as soft as when I they arrived.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I think there are too much brushes period</li>
            <li> The makeup roll leaves much to be desired as the brushes are constantly falling</li>
            <li> I aired them out overnight and</li>
            <li> So soft, and well shaped.</li>
            <li> Plus, there&#x27;s a brush for every conceivable technique.</li>
            <li> Looking for a professional look to your makeup?  </li>
            <li> I found these brushes a pleasure to use, and I felt like a professional makeup artist as I selected the brushes and made up</li>
            <li> The brushes are silky soft indeed, and they pick up makeup and apply it well.</li>
            <li> THIS POUCH IS SOFT AND DURABLE, TIES SHUT</li>
            <li> As I unwrapped them, I noticed the sturdy construction and soft hairs.  </li>
            <li> brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li> So so soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes stay soft after washing with soap.</li>
            <li> The soft bristles do not seem to cause any irritation, and I have had no issues with these losing bristles over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This review is for the USpicy Complete 32 Piece Makeup Brush Set w/ Travel Pouch.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the bristles shedding so far.</li>
            <li> The brushes picked up the powders perfectly like base, primer and eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Brushes picked up powders (base, primer, and eye shadows) perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The repeats also mean that you are getting any more versatility than you would from a 10-15 brush set.</li>
            <li> The inside of the case is a thicker vinyl/pleather material (for easy wipe down) and an upper flap covers the brush bristles to keep protected.  </li>
            <li> The smaller eye shadow brushes are pretty meh, I&#x27;ve gone back to using my old ones, but I really like the face brushes and have been using them daily!</li>
            <li> Even though it was a bit overwhelming for me I learned a few new tricks especially with the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth checking out, especially with the high prices of other makeup kits.</li>
            <li> would say that I wish there were more of the larger brushes and less of the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> As I just received this set, I have only had the opportunity to try it out once, so I can&#x27;t comment on the long-term durability; I&#x27;ve also only used 8 out of the 32 brushes, since this was my first test.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first since I have my Sigma brushes and love them</li>
            <li> My wife highly recommends them, and she provided the following comments:&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had no fallout or shedding of the bristles and they dry supper fast.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had no fallout or shedding of the bristles and they dry supper fast.</li>
            <li> After using it for a month, I feel that the brushes are bit long because when using it, my face is very close to the mirror and it bumps into it sometimes.</li>
            <li> brushes come in a faux leather (&amp;#34;pleather&amp;#34;) case with wrap strings to keep it closed</li>
            <li> The thin one appropriate for the outer edge of the lip, with the larger one distributing lipstick on the whole lip.</li>
            <li> I do wish the case had a snap closure instead of the tie laces, but overall this is a very complete, high quality set of brushes that should last a lifetime.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The kit includes various brushes of different sizes for certain purposes.  </li>
            <li> have recently gotten into experimenting with new kinds of makeup and these brushes have me covered on everything.  </li>
            <li> Got it the same day, thanks to prime and same day deliveries.</li>
            <li> USpicy Complete 32 Piece Essential Makeup Brush Set is really complete with variety of brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The set looks small but it has a full complete 32 brushes for all makeup needs.</li>
            <li> The tools dry very fast if washed and laid out properly.</li>
            <li> Or at least my wife does! :)</li>
            <li> I could also easily do without the sponge applicators, I find those pretty useless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-1x Blending Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Blush Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Powder Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Large Power Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Angled Contour Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Small Fan Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Large Fan Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the foundation brush absorbed the make up a little too much which made it harder to evenly distribute the make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist so having brushes is key.</li>
            <li> I left it out in the garage for a couple of days and the odor was completely gone.</li>
            <li> The container that comes with them definitely has a plastic odor and needs aired out</li>
            <li> The hairs are soft, the brushes are solid, and I have not observed any shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve seen so far is a bridle or two staying from the group sort to speak.</li>
            <li> so they feel extra soft.</li>
            <li> Gets concealer into small areas, soft and with Just the right texture.</li>
            <li> Here was a slight chemical smell to set when first opened but after airing for about 10 min,</li>
            <li> What makes this set unique is that you get a few brushes not normally seen in other large sets.</li>
            <li> They feel akin to a more expensive professional set I purchased years ago.</li>
            <li> The case did smell a little plasticity when I first received it, but that went away after a day or so.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very stiff and many are very similar to other ones in the set.</li>
            <li> I found that none of the bristles came loose and the handles were very firm and smooth.</li>
            <li> She has a few favorites out of the set, I&#x27;ve noticed, and even after a week or so of use, they all look the same as when we first got them.</li>
            <li> This may seem like a very obvious thing to say, but most of the small brush sets I&#x27;ve owned before had little difference in texture, so to me this is a mark of a higher-quality set than the inexpensive ones I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> To ice it all off, the kit comes with a fashionable little faux leather case to store everything in that is very travel</li>
            <li> Also, expected a variety of eyeshadow brushes that is not all synthetic not stiff because they all are.</li>
            <li> I loved the case it came in, however the smell was really bad</li>
            <li> I mean for the price, it&#x27;s worth it because that&#x27;s a lot of brushes</li>
            <li> As a huge makeup lover, I&#x27;ve owned a few small sets of inexpensive brushes, and I knew I was long overdue to get a proper, larger set of brushes for my makeup arsenal.</li>

            <li> I have a relatively small bathroom with storage space at a premium, so I&#x27;ve wondered how I would store a large brush set.</li>
            <li> Several of the flat brushes seem very similar to one another, and there are some omissions that I feel are a necessity especially for a beginner with no other tools, such as a domed crease brush, fluffy eye blending brush, and foundation brush.</li>
            <li> There is no way they can break as long as you use them properly.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t owned these long enough to comment on the durability.</li>

            <li> I want to start this review by saying I am a normal everyday person.</li>
            <li> get clumped on the brushes, these should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cut incorrectly and applying any kind of liner with the brush is impossible.</li>
            <li> Brushes are fluffy and professional</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t let the powder, etc.</li>
            <li> I used the small sponge brush for dabbing on concealer, and I noticed how much softer it was than any other sponge brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I used the small sponge brush for dabbing on concealer, and I noticed how much softer it was than any other sponge brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Was jokingly accused of spying, as the recipient was considering purchasing the very same set a little earlier.</li>
            <li> Some may prefer a hard case to a soft roll up case but that&#x27;s personal preference.</li>
            <li> Dry your brushes upright.  </li>
            <li> A little stiff, but it should be like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye shadow brush, I didn&#x27;t like this one too much.</li>
            <li> You have every single brush you could ever need at your disposal.</li>
            <li> I usually wash them and blow dry them for a bit to keep the bristles soft.</li>
            <li> The only thing i&#x27;d suggest tweaking is removing the sponge applicators and a few of flat eye brushes for some fluffier blending brushes.</li>
            <li> She used some common ones and did a head to head comparison with her more expensive brushes, she did not feel a big difference.</li>
            <li> I didn’t notice any loose hairs, which is a plus.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised to see the high quality that this set has to offer, a lot of the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen on the market the brushes usually are stiff or the hairs fall out after a few times of use.</li>
            <li> The bristles are black with white tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They come in a black case, all individually wrapped.  </li>
            <li> The variety of the brushes in terms of size and shape is like a one stop shop of a make-up center.</li>
            <li> thought i do feel that there are a few brushes that are very similar to one another,</li>
            <li> weeks later they STILL smell heavily of plastic.</li>
            <li> It comes with a wrap around tie to keep it closed.</li>
            <li> Even though she used only a few brushes out of the set, she loves the quality on these brushes so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fan brushes are dented and not straight.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel as if the metal will come loose from the handle like some other brush sets</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t find a thing wrong with this set other than my personal preference would be a hardcase for brushes.</li>
            <li> Brushes and leathery pouch smelled of plastic as expected due to shipping and time spent in an enclosed box.</li>
            <li> Theyre decent quality just not great to work with.</li>
            <li> As someone who spent hours looking through brushes on here just stop here and buy these, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> 20$ for durable brushes with endless possibilities?</li>
            <li> All the other dancers and their moms were trying them out and asking here where she purchases them.</li>
            <li> AND IS NO BIGGER THAN A SMALL SIZE HANDBAG.&lt;br /&gt;FOUX CROC DESIGN</li>
            <li> My girlfriend noted that unlike other brushes she has gotten, these do not lose the hairs like others may.</li>
            <li> The kit is slick and portable, and carries enough accessories to handle any makeup job.</li>
            <li> Very minimal shredding.</li>
            <li> Overall not too bad, well worth it for $20.</li>
            <li> Although I can appreciate the thought behind this collection of brushes it definitely fell short of my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still going to have to buy a couple blending brushes and a couple other, but that is the only negative that I can say.</li>
            <li> My other half likes the kit and suggested that I give it a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the pouch had a plasticizer odor.</li>
            <li> When using the eye-makeup brushes, the eyeshadow falls off of the brushes slightly, but what makes it onto the eyes works well and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> When i received this kit in the mail it was a shiny black foe leather style fabric.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> They are matte black with the brand name in the handle.</li>
            <li> set of 32 brushes came with a black faux leather snake print pouch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a slight chemical smell when I opened the pouch</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t too bad and went away quickly.</li>
            <li> the bag did smell a little funky but duhh , its plastic .</li>
            <li> I have every brush I&#x27;m going to need all in a neat little pouch.</li>
            <li> few caveats:</li>
            <li> A few hairs did fall out</li>
            <li> and it goes away after a few days.</li>
            <li> Waste makeup.</li>
            <li> The brushes seem well made, have survived a few washings now, and don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> but 2 brushes were missing</li>
            <li> I find that despite the ample amount of brushes there are some that are missing.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived, I pulled a few out and started using them.</li>
            <li> wife has been using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> The larger power brushes, blending brushes, and thin eye liner brush came with a plastic protector for the brushes</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the brushes.</li>
            <li> - it will set the bar very high and might be difficult to follow up with!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some harsh brushes in the past and they were just not ideal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The travel pouch is like the size of a small purse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  &amp;#62; 3x  Small Eye Shadow Brushes</li>
            <li> Usually she will buy one or two as needed.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the Anastasia Beverly hills eyebrow brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an amateur when it comes to makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for that one for a long time, but it can be really expensive.</li>
            <li> thing I did notice was that the fabric on the case was semi thin and could of been stitched a little better.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> the wide assortment of brushes and applicators you can go wrong with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> There is at least 1  brush for all purposes.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, so I&#x27;m not sure whether or not they will come apart!</li>
            <li> but, I only ended up getting 31 brushes which isn&#x27;t a big deal but was shocking to say the least.</li>
            <li> Only issue is i feel like the paint smell shocked me because i read some reviews</li>
            <li> my daughter absolutely loves it you will not be disappointed !.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very stiff, meaning it&#x27;s difficult to blend shadows and powder eye shadows tend to flake at their touch, resulting in a lot of product fall out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not experienced in applying makeup</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t see anything being broken anytime soon).</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s comparable to the really expensive liner brush I already have.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I am incredibly disappointed in the shoddy construction of the bristles.</li>
            <li> Bad Stuff</li>
            <li> They are well made and my pouch did not smell so bad.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Anybody who says they have a horrible smell, yes they do have a smell, but no it is reaallyyy not that bad</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t listen to the bad reviews these brushes are bomb!</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> if you want to earn some SERIOUS brownie points ORDER THIS KIT NOW!!!!!</li>
            <li> all, for the price, this isn&#x27;t a terrible purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This brush set is a bit of an investment so as I&#x27;ve been using them, I keep the price in mind. There are a ton of brushes, probably more than the average person will use. There are duplicates as well. But these are perfect if you do make-over, theatrical make-up, share with others, or you do a lot of playing around with make-up yourself, then there are plenty of options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like is the tightness of the bristles, they don&#x27;t fall out, the softness and the perfect tapers of the angled and rounded brushes. They grab make-up and hold it until gently applied. The handles are a beautiful matte black and feel great to hold. The case holds all the brushes, rolls up and ties for securing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is very good makeup brushes. I was overwhelmed when I open the package. and get lost when trying them. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The carry case is a big plus. the texture of it is very outstanding. it is not bulky with all the brushes in place.&lt;br /&gt;2. Each brush has different bristle texture so you can know which is it but it has no name on each brush.&lt;br /&gt;3. The brushes picked up the powders perfectly like base, primer and eye shadows. The larger brushes blended my foundation and contour powder smoothly</li>
            <li> this is by far the best set of makeup brushes i have ever used!  these brushes are professional quality in my opinion.  they make the application of makeup so easy and precise.  this collection  offers a brush for your every need.  i am thrilled with this set and how well the brushes perform.  i highly recommend this product.  you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Before I start this review, I would like to say that this review would not have been possible without the lady of the house. I was only able to write this review with her help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing kit with a wide assortment of brushes that are of studio-quality, and are very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a breakdown of what you get in the really nice travel pouch:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1x Blending Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Blush Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Powder Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Large Power Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Angled Contour Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Small Fan Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Large Fan Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with those brushes, you are also presented with these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1x Eyebrow Comb&lt;br /&gt;-1x Lash Brush&lt;br /&gt;-6x Large Eye Shadow Brush&lt;br /&gt;-3x Small Eye Shadow Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Angled Eye Shadow Brush&lt;br /&gt;-2x Nose Shading Brush&lt;br /&gt;-3x  Eyebrow Brush&lt;br /&gt;-4x Concealer Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Lip Brush&lt;br /&gt;-2x Sponge Eye Shadow Brush&lt;br /&gt;-1x Eyeliner Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Impressions: We were amazed at the assortment of the brushes, and the quality of them. The handles are made of wood and feel really nice. They have a nice, matte-like finish which definitely feels like studio-quality. Every brush and tool feels very soft on the face. You can just notice the difference with a regular brush and these studio-quality brushes. So far, the presentation, quality, and build seem to be pretty nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a while, it is safe to say that this makeup kit is very nice! You have every single brush you could ever need at your disposal. These brushes feel great on your face, and are long and durable so you can use every single one with ease. There is no way they can break as long as you use them properly. Also be sure to properly clean them before putting them back in the kit to store them and have them ready to take them with you wherever you go. Cleaning these brushes is a breeze, and the softness is still there every time! With the kit, you can easily carry all 32 pieces and not have to pack everything last minute. You have professional makeup tools with you everywhere you go because of the really nice, stylish travel pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would recommend this to every woman out there who wants to have professional makeup tools and the appearance you can get from them without having to go to a professional every time. Also, for the price, you get what you pay for and more in terms of quality, style, and performance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product that the person which tested it for me loved so much! We both highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a unit for testing purposes and I promised to provide a completely honest and fair review.ing last minute.

            <li> I was recently provided with a free USpicy Complete 32 Piece Essential Makeup Brush Set with Travel Pouch for the purposes of evaluating it and writing this review. As a huge makeup lover, I&#x27;ve owned a few small sets of inexpensive brushes, and I knew I was long overdue to get a proper, larger set of brushes for my makeup arsenal. This seemed like just the thing, so I was excited to give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few caveats: As I just received this set, I have only had the opportunity to try it out once, so I can&#x27;t comment on the long-term durability; I&#x27;ve also only used 8 out of the 32 brushes, since this was my first test. I haven&#x27;t owned many makeup brushes before and certainly none that were high quality, so I may also have different needs than, say, a makeup artist. All that being said, I am very impressed with my initial trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that stood out to me is how great the travel pouch is. I have a relatively small bathroom with storage space at a premium, so I&#x27;ve wondered how I would store a large brush set. This kit from USpicy is ideal for me, because it folds up into a small purse which takes up little room while keeping your brushes safe. This also makes it feasible for me to take this along when I travel, which is frequently!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are higher quality than I expected; since this is my first “Real” makeup brush set, I noticed the difference right away. Each brush I tried had a different bristle texture, making them each uniquely suited to the different products I was using – be it powder, concealer, or eyeshadow. This may seem like a very obvious thing to say, but most of the small brush sets I&#x27;ve owned before had little difference in texture, so to me this is a mark of a higher-quality set than the inexpensive ones I&#x27;ve owned before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the eyeshadow brushes I used had a sharp slanted angle, which was perfect for my cats-eye makeup; I really noticed how firm the bristles were, making it perfect for getting detailed lines - the best brush I&#x27;ve personally used for that. I used the small sponge brush for dabbing on concealer, and I noticed how much softer it was than any other sponge brush I&#x27;ve used. Likewise, the large bristle brushes that I used for sweeping on powder and blush had soft bristles that were very comfortable. My makeup turned out great, and I could definitely tell a difference in using these brushes – they are much better than any I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed the brushes in cleaning solution after I was finished, and they seemed to hold up fine - again, I haven&#x27;t owned these long enough to comment on the durability. Between the quality of the brushes and the ease of storage, I can&#x27;t think of a more ideal set for me and I am so glad to have it!or getting detailed lines - the best brush I&#x27;ve personally used for that.

            <li> When using the face brushes, the makeup stays on well and distributes well over the face. When using the eye-makeup brushes, the eyeshadow falls off of the brushes slightly, but what makes it onto the eyes works well and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first since I have my Sigma brushes and love them but USpicy is definitely a contender with a bang for your buck! They are light weight but durable and are perfect for everyday use. A few hairs did fall out but overall they stayed in tact pretty well. If you are new to makeup then these are the perfect brushes for you! Make sure you wash them before you use them (like any brush).</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to receive these brushes in the mail courtesy of the company to test and review. Now, I&#x27;m not the type of girl who wears a whole lot of makeup, so I&#x27;m not well versed in which brush does what. However, I was amazed at how nice the package was presented when I opened it. The brushes come in a beautiful case that has loops inside to hold each brush in a specific place. After testing them out one night and washing them, I was impressed to see that the bristles didn&#x27;t fall out like those you purchase from other retailers. They retain their softness, but do a great job holding and applying makeup. 10 stars!</li>
            <li> This is a complete brush set from broad application of foundation to stipple brush and fine detail for eyes.  The brushes are super soft and plush. They feel akin to a more expensive professional set I purchased years ago. The construction is sound. I don&#x27;t feel as if the metal will come loose from the handle like some other brush sets tend to do. Brushes picked up powders (base, primer, and eye shadows) perfectly.  The larger brushes feathered my liquid foundation and contour powder perfectly/smoothly.  Clean up was easy (I use a special cleanser from my esthetician but warm soapy water would work). Dry your brushes upright.  After drying, bristles remained soft...no hardness or crunchy bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All brushes come in a faux leather (&amp;#34;pleather&amp;#34;) case with wrap strings to keep it closed (refer to my uploaded pics). Case type is akin to what a chef would carry knives in. Some may prefer a hard case to a soft roll up case but that&#x27;s personal preference. The inside of the case is a thicker vinyl/pleather material (for easy wipe down) and an upper flap covers the brush bristles to keep protected.  Some of the bigger brushes have a plastic holder for bristles as to help keep shape/protection.  This set ranges from feathering brushes to stipple, angled, fan, fine point, mascara applicator, two eye shadow sponge tips (quality sponge/foam tips...not the cheap rough sponge), and eyebrow brush/comb. Each brush type has various sizes.  Here was a slight chemical smell to set when first opened but after airing for about 10 min, the smell dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent set and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase for friends, myself, etc. My esthetician (who&#x27;s my best friend) saw the set, gave approval, and has intentions of purchasing her own set.  I really can&#x27;t find a thing wrong with this set other than my personal preference would be a hardcase for brushes. This set was provided to me by Uspicy for review. I keep my reviews honest to the best of my ability.</li>
            <li> These Brushes are great. While playing around with them, no hairs came off the brush, had a great feel in my hand, and applied makeup without a problem. All of the brushes have their own individual slot to keep them from moving around or messing up the tips. Really enjoy using these and recommend them to anyone else looking for a complete set!</li>
            <li> The USpicy 32 piece brush set is an amazing set of brushes that comes in a beautiful and extremely handy case! This set of brushes from USpicy is perfect for anyone who usues makeup, whether a beginner, pro or even a special effects makeup artist. It has just about every tool you need to get the job done and achieve the maximum desired effect, all without breaking your budget. The handles of the brushes are very sturdy and easy to hold on to so the days of dropping your brush at the most inopportune moment are over. The bristles are incredibly soft and gentle on the skin and they are easy to clean as well. The brush set comes with its own carrying/storage case too. It has the look and feel of real leather while being incredibly compact and super travel-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife said the brushes were definitely the best quality she had ever used and the travel case made them easy to store and carry around. The USpicy Complete 32 Piece Essential Makeup Brush Set with Travel Pouch would be a great addition to anyone&#x27;s makeup kit and would also be an excellent gift, for someone else or you could wrap it and keep it for yourself!!!! Personally, I gave one to my wife and she is still singing the praises of this kit. Fellas....if you want to earn some SERIOUS brownie points ORDER THIS KIT NOW!!!!! You&#x27;ll thank me later. Trust!</li>
            <li> I want to start this review by saying I am a normal everyday person. I ordered these brushes just by the price and the good reviews. My brushes came fast and they are great  in the sense that they are sturdy and don&#x27;t shed.(even during washing) BUT it&#x27;s not the brushes that I need. I&#x27;m not experienced in applying makeup but I am learning. I&#x27;m still going to have to buy a couple blending brushes and a couple other, but that is the only negative that I can say.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product, not only was I checking out different brush sets, but I was also reading the reviews. I am a makeup artist and was looking for a good deal with good quality brushes, this was one of those deals.&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is WAY better than what I was expecting, it is a pretty leather with a nice leather interior, which makes it easier to clean. Now lets get to the important stuff, the brushes. I LOVE THEM!!!! These are better than the ones I work with on a daily basis with my company &amp;#60;3 They are very soft to the touch, and the handles are very strong (I don&#x27;t see anything being broken anytime soon). I haven&#x27;t used them with products yet, but just by the feel of them I have a good feeling that they will dispense product beautifully.</li>
            <li> Good makeup brushes, and good price.</li>
            <li> (My wife got this kit to review and this is what she had to say about it in her own words.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a USpicy 32 piece makeup brush set to test out and review. When i received this kit in the mail it was a shiny black foe leather style fabric.&lt;br /&gt;Now the case showed up with 32 pieces inside which is a nice verity of brushes, and applicators.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice was that the fabric on the case was semi thin and could of been stitched a little better.&lt;br /&gt;Some stitches came unraveled which isn&#x27;t a big deal because you can get a new one from many of other stores. My guess is this was just a freak incident with the stitching on mine.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the brushes and applicators are very well built.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are soft and sturdy with no lose to the bristles when applying makeup. The handles are well made and very nice looking with a flat black look to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now one thing I would have loved to see in this kit is a label for each brush. Most every day people would not know which brush if for what.&lt;br /&gt;A label would have been a nice addition to the kit. Another thing would have been nice if the kit could have been able to tie around your waste for the professional user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the wide assortment of brushes and applicators you can go wrong with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;This kit is a must have if you are into professional makeup look.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a solid 5 stars it is a great assortment and well made brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set!  I feel like a professional makeup artist.  There is a brush for every purpose and the quality is wonderful.  This set allows me to apply makeup like I never have before.  It allows me to experiment and create new looks and makes me feel beautiful. Thanks Sunvalleytek!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes! they came very quickly and are great quality. The eyeliner brush and some angled brushes could stand to be thinner, but overall for the price and amount of brushes you receive i cannot complain. As someone who spent hours looking through brushes on here just stop here and buy these, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my girlfriend. She was quite pleased! She&#x27;s kind of new to experimenting with makeup and wasn&#x27;t even sure what all the brushes were used for!  I gave her the description that was on the item listing and that definitely helped. The brushes appear to be good quality and the case for holding them is really nice as well. Overall, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love them! I feel like i don&#x27;t know what to do with so many brushes, but I will learn.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great.  The only way they could have been better would be if they were marked, e.g. eye shadow, eyeliner, etc.  I have gone thru many brushes before looking for the right brushes that will do the job they are supposed to do, and these are it!!!!!!!!! I love the way they apply my eye shadow, the different sizes to get the look you want from inside to outside of eye.  I would recommend these to anyone.  Get them you&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> First off being a guy, I don&#x27;t use brushes so this review was written by a family member.&lt;br /&gt;I like this brush set because it is convenient to carry. The travel pouch is like the size of a small purse. The variety of the brushes in terms of size and shape is like a one stop shop of a make-up center. If you have it with you, you have everything you need for make-up. The brushes are very soft yet they are able to carry out the desired make-up effect at the same time. The handles are made of wood and feel good in your hands. Cleaning the brushes are easy as well. After using it for a month, I feel that the brushes are bit long because when using it, my face is very close to the mirror and it bumps into it sometimes. I would recommend this to those who want to have pro looking makeup brushes without going to the pros.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush Set was provided for review by USpicy</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes, the quality is good and I love having the roll. They are soft and well-made, no shedding or anything. The only suggestion I would have is that I would prefer a greater variety of brush types. Several of the flat brushes seem very similar to one another, and there are some omissions that I feel are a necessity especially for a beginner with no other tools, such as a domed crease brush, fluffy eye blending brush, and foundation brush. I could also easily do without the sponge applicators, I find those pretty useless. Overall a great set though!</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat the quality! These are great for beginners with makeup, who want to step into the process of highlights, bronzer, concealer, shadows and such. I&#x27;d suggest them to anyone!</li>
            <li> What a great deal for all these brushes!  They are very soft and has a good variety.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find my package on the doorstep exactly when it was scheduled to arrive. Brushes and leathery pouch smelled of plastic as expected due to shipping and time spent in an enclosed box. I let it air out overnight and then proceeded to wash all the brushes. I found that none of the bristles came loose and the handles were very firm and smooth. The tools dry very fast if washed and laid out properly. After attempting makeup application with the brushes, I fell even deeper in love with my purchase. 20$ for durable brushes with endless possibilities? A definite yes! Everything looks, feels, and performs marvelously! Would definitely buy again and even recommend to friends!&lt;br /&gt;*This opinion was not promoted and NOT sponsored in any way.*</li>
            <li> Great selection of brushes. There is at least 1  brush for all purposes.  Great to have so many eye shadow brushes.  I use them once and put in a jar to be cleaned later.  So, I still have more eye shadow brushes to use next couple of times.  I don&#x27;t want to mix colors on brushes and i like to keep hygeinically (sp) clean.  So, overall, I am very happy with this purchase. I keep my brushes in the BINO Triad compartment acrylic makeup organizer I bought on Amazon..  They all fit perfect and stand pretty much straight up, so they are not at an angle spreading out and taking up allot of room on counter.  Love the BINO, it is very solid and very high edges. Is a greatcontainer to use with these brushes instead of having to open the roll up they come in each time you apply makeup. See pics of the brushes in the BINO container!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great brushes at a great price. Everything was shipped in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I love them sooo much, they work extremely well for such cheap brushes and they came quickly too. Anybody who says they have a horrible smell, yes they do have a smell, but no it is reaallyyy not that bad and it goes away after a few days. If you do have a problem with it just wash the brushes and it&#x27;ll be fine I&#x27;m pretty sure the smell just comes from being in the make up bag so long so not a huge deal. They are ssooo worth it if you&#x27;re a beginner make up artist or just want some nice brushes for make up definitely DEFINITELY would recommend these they are awesome!! The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a foundation brush, a blending brush, or a pencil brush, but that&#x27;s not a disclaimer though I got a different set on Amazon that was equally as cheap I think it was only 8 dollars with those things and it works perfectly too so no worries. Love, love, love!!</li>
            <li> really nice brush set but some brushes were very similar</li>
            <li> This set has it all!  From powder to highlighting to contouring to eye shadow and everything in between, this kit has it.  I travel a lot for work and love that I can quickly roll it up, tie, and throw in my overnight bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently gotten into experimenting with new kinds of makeup and these brushes have me covered on everything.  The soft texture of the brushes make applying makeup both easy and comfortable.  I&#x27;ve had some harsh brushes in the past and they were just not ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to any avid makeup wearer or someone looking to spice up their look.  Great product!</li>
            <li> A great well presented, well rounded brush set. The brushes in this set are super soft, wash well and do not shed. Being a 32 piece set this would make a great gift to any makeup enthusiast or beginner as it has such a wide range of brushes. What makes this set unique is that you get a few brushes not normally seen in other large sets. The large fan brush is beautiful, probably my favourite out of the bunch! Great for a dusting of powder, highlighter or even subtle contour. Speaking of contour this set includes a nose contour brush which is a great addition that i&#x27;ve not seen before. The only thing i&#x27;d suggest tweaking is removing the sponge applicators and a few of flat eye brushes for some fluffier blending brushes. Overall this is a fantastic quality / value set!</li>
            <li> I gave these to my daughter and she LOVES them. She is part of a competition dance team so there is always a ton of makeup being applied. When she brought these to her dress rehearsal last night she was the hit of the dance school. All the other dancers and their moms were trying them out and asking here where she purchases them. She told me that there was a brush for everything and more. So I guess if a dance team loves them then they are perfect!!</li>
            <li> Love this set!! I am very pleased with my purchase. These are high quality and work great in applying makeup.  Also the case is great to keep them all together and protected.  I recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> These make-up brushes really help your make-up look more smooth.  I like them because they are very soft and durable.  They come in a nice carrying case that is simple to unroll for use.  The case allows you to store the brushes without taking up too much space in your bathroom, and also allows for easy access when they are needed again.  The set contains 32 brushes, a brush for every need you may have while applying your make-up.  I absolutely loved them and have had no problems with them thus far.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves the look and quality! I&#x27;m sure she will buy more from USpicy!</li>
            <li> Note: I was provided one of these to review, but since neither I nor my wife use makeup we had one of my wife&#x27;s friends use it. This is her review, edited by me only for readability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes have a good quality feel to them, no pokey or loose bristles. There&#x27;s a brush for everything you&#x27;d need, even multiple of some in different sizes. The brushes are lightweight and comfortable to hold. My favorite was the angled eye liner brush. I would say it&#x27;s comparable to the really expensive liner brush I already have. The roll up travel case is a huge convenience. It keeps the brushes situated and in place without smashing the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that I wish there were more of the larger brushes and less of the smaller brushes. Almost too many options for the smaller brushes. Also, the foundation brush absorbed the make up a little too much which made it harder to evenly distribute the make up. For those reasons I am deducting one star, but overall I&#x27;d recommend this roll up make up brush kit to anyone and it would make a great gift!</li>
            <li> I received these 32 piece brush set to review and I must say that I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality. They don&#x27;t shed and they feel very soft on the skin. You can find every type of brush that you need, my favorites are the fan brush and the eye liner brush. They come in a pouch that make them easy to carry and perfect to take anywhere. I really recommend these.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with d quality of this brushes. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. They are awesome.</li>
            <li> Would have been 5 stars but it didn&#x27;t include a blending eyeshadow brush</li>
            <li> This is my first real set of make up brushes, and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase! They did have a bit of a smell. I aired them out over night and that worked wonders...now I&#x27;m headed to YouTube to start upgrading my natural beauty! I haven&#x27;t used them yet, so I&#x27;m not sure whether or not they will come apart! This review is based on the packaging, appearance and how quickly they arrived...oh and smell!</li>
            <li> My order showed up super fast which was awesome. I got to use my new makeup brushes for my one year anniversary dinner. They are amazing great quality I would recommend them to my friends</li>
            <li> For the price and what you are getting you really can&#x27;t beat it! These brushes have SUPER soft bristles and so far the ones I have used have applied my makeup perfectly. However, a couple of the bigger bristled brushes do split. They haven&#x27;t shed yet but they are separating and bending a bit. The case itself is handy and beautiful but does have a factory smell when it comes. Still, a great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> I was provided with a free sample of these brushes in return for my honest review.  This is a set of 32 brushes, and I absolutely loved them.  My make-up went on very smooth, the bristles did not fall out, and they seem to be very high quality brushes.  I would recommend buying these brushes.  There is a brush for anything and everything you may need.</li>
            <li> Great price great product</li>
            <li> Nice for a large set. Does not grab makeup too well. Waste makeup. If you pay a lot for your makeup, you&#x27;ll pay a lot more if you use this set.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t used them yet! but it looks nice</li>
            <li> great brushes, my daughter loves them and uses them without any complaints. fast shipping and good quality.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome brush set for any one beginner or expert. They are soft. Great value. Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them! Arrived quickly. Will order again!</li>
            <li> worth every dollar thought i do feel that there are a few brushes that are very similar to one another, would have liked to see a fluffy eyeshadow brush. I would totally recommend this though great product!</li>
            <li> Daughter loved them. They are very soft.</li>
            <li> So far, haven&#x27;t used all of the brushes but great set for the price</li>
            <li> These brushes were far beyond what I expected.  Very high quality for a fantastic price !</li>
            <li> I recently bought these brushes for myself and I have to say these are the best brushes I have ever bought. I&#x27;m in love with them already.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter&#x27;s 17th birthday. The look on her face when she saw the collection was priceless. I&#x27;m assuming she was very happy. :)</li>
            <li> Good for the price, but I was missing a brush when I got it and the hairs fall out of some of the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with these brushes! They feel so heavenly soft and seem to be quite sturdy. Packaging is really cute, but has a slight odor, not terrible or anything. Would DEFINITELY purchase these again if needed, and if the price stays low enough, I could see myself buying another set to give as a gift as well.</li>
            <li> Great product and the price makes it even more of a must have.  I am looking to purchase these for some of my friends for Christmas exchange gifts!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush set. Super soft, no shed brushes. I wish there were a few more shadow brushes that were not stiff like a foundation brush. Although with a little more practice, I am sure I will get used to them just fine. Great set for the money.</li>
            <li> I loved the case it came in, however the smell was really bad and I had to air it out for 1 day.  It came with a lot of brushes and I wish they were labelled.  These brushes work better than other brushes I own that I bought at Sephora and Ulta, so I would definitely recommend getting it.&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to use and put my makeup on flawlessly.</li>
            <li> These are great makeup brushes. Nice and soft and a wonderful price to boot!  And enough eye brushes so you can have a set for home and a set for your go bag! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Amazing selection of brushes! They&#x27;re so soft and the carrying case is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had any noticeable issues with them yet, if any occur I&#x27;ll update this review to reflect that.</li>
            <li> Good quality and very fast post. I  will buy more 😊</li>
            <li> Although I can appreciate the thought behind this collection of brushes it definitely fell short of my expectations. The brushes are very stiff and many are very similar to other ones in the set. There aren&#x27;t any brushes that can be used to blend out eyeshadow, a very basic brush need in a set as large as this. The repeats also mean that you are getting any more versatility than you would from a 10-15 brush set. The price is nice but you&#x27;d be better off using the same amount of money to buy a higher quality, smaller set of brushes.</li>
            <li> They are so soft , they have a smell but noghing that alittle air can&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes, easy to work with and the material is very soft. There are a great range of brushes for eye makeup, and large brushes come equipped with a protective casing - would recommend this to anyone wanting to build out their brush set collection.</li>
            <li> This is any women&#x27;s dream to be able to say she owns a set of Make-up brushes like this one. We all have our preferences on what type of make-up we use, but to have this set of brushes on hand makes anyone feel like the professionals. I like how the brushes all have their own place in this case as well as their own head cover. Always important to keep those brushes clean to make them last longer. I was so surprised to see the high quality that this set has to offer, a lot of the one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen on the market the brushes usually are stiff or the hairs fall out after a few times of use. I will treasure this set for many years to come. Everything about these brushes just says High Quality.</li>
            <li> i purchased this set for my daughter , after receiving the parcel (which arrived within 3 days !)i checked it to make sure all pieces were there and they were the kit appears to be very good quality and very impressive my daughter absolutely loves it you will not be disappointed !.</li>
            <li> Excellent  brushes super soft and apply make up very well</li>
            <li> very good quality brushes. And reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great value. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased these brushes and am very satisfied with them, but as I am new to contouring and all the application processes, I need the brushes to be individually identified.  They brushes are all very soft and no shedding so far.  They are also very easy to clean and air dry rather quickly.  I wish a stippling brush was included, but I can deal without it.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> These are great!&lt;br /&gt;They are nice and soft. The smell is strong but hopefully it will go away soon!</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes! I mainly use the large powder brush so far. Great set for the price</li>
            <li> Just got mine like 30 minutes ago but omg they are beautiful !😍 they aren&#x27;t for me doe): Their for a gift for my sister quince😎but omg they are cute! They come wrapped good so they won&#x27;t get damaged while being delivered 😏 and they come in a box which is great because most atuff comes in a envelope i can&#x27;t say much since i can&#x27;t really use them nor touch them but i highly recommend if ur a makeup lover like my sister they are high quality!😍 tbh better than those sephora ones😂💩</li>
            <li> Update*******&lt;br /&gt;These are still going strong. Washing them is really easy and they always end up soft, like the first time I used them. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with shedding whatsoever or  staining. The case is still looking brand new and it has not peeled or anything. I LOVE THESE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently studying to become a cosmetologist. Makeup class is one of my favorites, but it can also be one of the most expensive especially when it comes to getting a brush set. One of the things you need to do a really good makeup is a really good set of makeup brushes. This set is the BOMB!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the looks of this set. It looks really professional and sleek. The pouch is a Pu leather material, with a snake print pattern and a glossy finish. It is really sturdy and keeps the brushes clean and safe. One thing I do suggest is to let the pouch air for a day or two. It had a strong, plastic odor when I first opened it but it is now gone.The brushes are really good looking too. They are matte black with the brand name in the handle. The bristles are black with white tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are really soft and really easy to use. They pick up and deposit the makeup with such ease. Also if you have sensitive eyelids like I do, these brushes are so soft that they wont hurt when using them. They are 32 in total and they all have different textures. One thing that really impressed me about this set is that it includes practically every brush you will ever need, even the big fan brush. I&#x27;ve been looking for that one for a long time, but it can be really expensive. Also, this set has many eye shadow brushes. This is really useful when you are doing a multi color makeup and don&#x27;t wanna mess up the other colors. In my case, I had a makeup competition this week at school and this set helped me out a lot. And everyone was impressed by how professional it looks. I really recommend this set to makeup students, professionals and even diyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, this set is really easy to clean. I cleaned them as soon as they arrived and after the competition. So far I&#x27;ve had no fallout or shedding of the bristles and they dry supper fast. This last one is a mega plus. They are still as soft as when I they arrived. I like to wash my brushes with baby shampoo first, to remove the excess makeup and then I clean them with your typical brush cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestions I have for the company are:&lt;br /&gt;1) I really would have loved if there was a small, round blending brush for the eyes. This makes the job of blending easier and gives another option in the eye shadow brushes.&lt;br /&gt;2) It would have been really handy to have the brush&#x27;s name written somewhere in the handle, like many other brushes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with those minor details, I think this set is really amazing and I really love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this set in exchange for my honest opinionlean.

            <li> Amazing brush set!!!! Feel like my mac &amp; real techniques brushes!!! The one brush I have that I use over these is my sigma f80</li>
            <li> As a reviewer, I&#x27;ve received a number of makeup brush kits for free to review, so as the owner of seven such kits, I can tell you with confidence that this is one of the best. What I love about this brand is the crisp, sleek look of the faux patent leather snakeskin case, and the huge, exhaustive variety of brushes and applicators. I especially love the huge fan shaped one for applying powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s not really sanitary to share brushes or applicators with friends, if you have a teen girl who loves to play with makeup with her friends, this would be a great gift because there are enough brushes for everybody to have their own while applying, without worrying about spreading eye infections or the bacteria which can cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are looking for a makeup brush kit, this is a fun and attractive set which would make a great gift for any woman who enjoys experimenting with makeup.</li>
            <li> These are fabulous make-up brushes! I am impressed by the variety of brushes from the smallest for fine details and the largest of sweeping applications of powder foundations. There is a special brush for every type of make-up application, from contouring to blush to shaows.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are soft, well-crafted, and of exceptional quality.&lt;br /&gt;They are easily cleaned with just a touch of warm water and do not shed.&lt;br /&gt;The faux-leather roll-up bag is very sleek and fashionable: Perfect for keeping the brushes safe and tidy.  The bag will fit easily into a travel bag or carry-on luggage. Also fits well into larger handbags or totes.&lt;br /&gt;I received the brushes to facilitate a review. The opinions are based on my own use of and experience with the item(s).</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and sturdy.  I think this was a good deal for a good price.  I would order again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Im very surprised on the packaging of this.. this is my very first set of brushes , I am trying to become a makeup artist and I love makeup and just for a lower price for all these softly handled brushes , there very very good at wat they do and or are ment for.. I recommend this for anyone</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!!! They shipped super fast!!!!</li>
            <li> Loverd the brushes! One or two began coming lose after washing but no big deal! Still great and soft brushes!</li>
            <li> Okay first off, if you need a backup arsenal of brushes this is certainly your set. The brushes are nice and soft, though they don&#x27;t always pick up the product that well. The smaller eye shadow brushes are pretty meh, I&#x27;ve gone back to using my old ones, but I really like the face brushes and have been using them daily! The brushes seem well made, have survived a few washings now, and don&#x27;t irritate my skin. The case they came in is nice, though did have a strong chemical smell, as I think others have noted. Overall not too bad, well worth it for $20.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist so having brushes is key. I like to test many different brands. I came across these and saw the wonderful reviews. I have got to say, these are the best brushes I have ever purchased. They&#x27;re so soft and they hold the product very well. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Lots of brushes to chose from. Got it the same day, thanks to prime and same day deliveries. Great buy!</li>
            <li> there are like, 8 of the same brushes.</li>
            <li> The Intro: Before you explore our review of this salon-style makeup brush setup we want to clarify that we had a woman of 30+ years of age test these brushes for our testing. She loves them and we are here to share her experiences with you. I will share my opinions as well for those who are men that works in salons as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good Stuff: Your very own makeup brush set in your very own home without the struggle of getting out, burning gas, spending money, and dealing with sales representatives.  You have every brush you need to style your face just like a professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 6x  Large Shadow Brushes&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 3x  Small Eye Shadow Brushes&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 1x  Angled Eye Shadow Brush&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 2x  Nose Shading Brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your face is your image and your image is a 30-second impression to everyone you meet. Personally, I think there are too much brushes period but then again I&#x27;m a guy (lol). Either way, you have every brush necessary to beautify your eyes from the outside to the inside - safely of course. USpicy includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 1x  Eyebrow Comb&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 3x  Eyebrow Brush&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 4x  Concealer Brush&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 1x  Lip Brush&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 2x  Sponge Eye Shadow Brush&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 1x  Lash Brush&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 1x  Eyeliner Brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are crucial points that every brush must meet when being used by the consumer. From whether it&#x27;s applying the makeup/powder correctly, evenly, and accurately across your face without leaving large traces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 1x  Gros Pinceau Eventail&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 1x  Gros Pinceau Poudre&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 1x  Pinceau Fard a Joues&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 1x  Pinceau Poudre&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 1x  Pinceau pour Modeler&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 1x  Pinceau Estompeur&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62; 1x  Petit Pinceau Eventail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad Stuff: We have yet to face any issues, concerns, or problems with this makeup brush set. If anything changes we will inform you about them and update you all right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Experience: Personally, they/we found it a pleasure to use makeup brushes that were so soft, gentle, and easy-to-use without worrying about them snapping or breaking during usage. We expect this type of experience right out the gate since we&#x27;re paying $40+ on it and receiving an intriguing introduction from the company them self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Follow-Up: We&#x27;re budget-hunters when it comes to shopping, but we still expect great products in return. USpicy has presented us with their makeup brush set as if they made it just for us with our suggestions in mind. This is what makes a company stand out and become more noticeable in their industry. They nailed it and made a perfect impression.Personally, they/we found it a pleasure to use makeup brushes that were so soft, gentle, and easy-to-use without worrying about them snapping or breaking during usage.

            <li> Love them. So many styles to choose, always have the right brush for the job.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet but they are all nice brushes, the travel case that they come in has a plastic smell to it.</li>
            <li> My brushes have just arrived and they look great and their very soft.  I have Amazon prime so I order them Sunday night and got them Tuesday around 1pm. I stay in Memphis, TN .</li>
            <li> They came packaged very nicely and all wrapped individually. Upon opening, there was a bit of a smell but it wasn&#x27;t too bad and went away quickly. The brushes are very soft and seem very sturdy. I haven&#x27;t used them to apply makeup yet but they look and feel very promising. Overall, they are very good brushes for this price.</li>
            <li> Really impressed with how soft they are and how easy it is to clean them but, I only ended up getting 31 brushes which isn&#x27;t a big deal but was shocking to say the least.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, I bought them three times!</li>
            <li> love it ... arrived on time and the product it&#x27;s the same as a picture thanck you for all</li>
            <li> I like the brush set but 2 brushes were missing</li>
            <li> The brushes are smooth but the glue scent is really strong tho</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this brush set.  As far as I am concerned there are too many brushes.  Many are the same style and almost the same size.  I find that despite the ample amount of brushes there are some that are missing.  Like a stickler brush and a more fuller eye shadow brush, as well as a foundation applicator brush that are usually flat.  They are well made and my pouch did not smell so bad.  I took the advise of a reviewer and left it open for a day.</li>
            <li> In purchasing these brushes I was looking for something that would help me get more comfortable using a variety of brushes and also hone in on what techniques I find most effective. While the face, powder, and blush brushes are absolutely divine, the eye shadow brushes aren&#x27;t my cup of tea. They&#x27;re very stiff, meaning it&#x27;s difficult to blend shadows and powder eye shadows tend to flake at their touch, resulting in a lot of product fall out. The smaller lip and eye liner brushes are generally of a higher quality, except when it comes to the fine liner brush. I am incredibly disappointed in the shoddy construction of the bristles. They&#x27;re cut incorrectly and applying any kind of liner with the brush is impossible. I&#x27;ll probably end up having to trim and pluck the bristles myself. The makeup roll leaves much to be desired as the brushes are constantly falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, for the price, this isn&#x27;t a terrible purchase. There are some winners in here and a good shampooing of the stiffer brushes may help the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would however, DEFINITELY recommend airing your brushes and roll out after receiving them. I scoffed at the people bemoaning the plastic-y smell, figuring it was your average, fresh-out-of-the-package kind of thing. I was wrong. Unrolling them the first time gave me a headache. I aired them out overnight and weeks later they STILL smell heavily of plastic. Be warned.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for applying powder makeup but are too soft for applying liquid products. The little stippling brushes are great for applying concealer around your nose and eye area but not for entire face.</li>
            <li> The brushes were awesome!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice set and the brushes are really soft. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> These brushes came as ordered and were as reviewed by others here. NO HAIRS FALLING OUT ALL OVER MY FACE!!!  YIPPPPEEEEE&lt;br /&gt;Each brush was individually wrapped in it&#x27;s own slot.</li>
            <li> Loved this set! Bought it because my old Sephora set was shedding and used this set as a placeholder until I got better brushes. I probably won&#x27;t be buying new brushes because these are perfect! The larger brushes are very soft and have worked very well for contouring. The smaller eyeshadow brushes are not as soft, and not too effective for a smokey look. Overall, though, I am very very happy with this set.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the brushes. Theyre decent quality just not great to work with. Get sigma instead.</li>
            <li> I love this set. When it arrived, I pulled a few out and started using them. So soft, and well shaped. Plus, there&#x27;s a brush for every conceivable technique.</li>
            <li> Brushes are nice quality and well presented, no stray hairs falling out of the brushes during use, and there&#x27;s a nice variety of sizes and shapes and types, in a decent quality wrap. What I expected, and great for the price.</li>
            <li> Impressive wow can&#x27;t believe this set it has a brush for everything !!  I just received it today and I am so happy with this set.  I haven&#x27;t tried them out yet but you can definitely tell that they are great quality brushes.  I am a Cosmetologist and I highly recommend this.  It also comes in a nice case to hold your brushes and see what you have instead of just being thrown in a bag.  You can&#x27;t beat the price for all these wonderful brushes</li>
            <li> An amazing set of brushes in a beautiful case! This set of brushes from USpicy is perfect for anyone who is serious about doing makeup or who wants to get more into it, and has every tool you&#x27;ll need to get the job done. The brushes are very well made with bristles that are incredibly soft and gentle on the skin and comfortable, easy to hold handles. After use, the brushes are easy to clean and hold up well, too. As for the case, it looks like real leather and is incredibly compact and travel-friendly. The brushes are definitely the best quality I&#x27;ve ever used and the travel case makes them easy to store and carry around. The set would make an excellent gift, for someone else or yourself!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this set of beauty brushes. This will have more types and styles of brushes than you could ever possibly need. The case is very nice looking - glossy back with a shiny gloss and has a nice texture to it. It comes with a wrap around tie to keep it closed. Brushes themselves are excellently made and are very high quality. Brush heads are nicely made and have a gradient color to them. Finally, the layout of the brushes is logical and easy to find and use.  Will make a great gift for that special lady in your life but be forewarned - it will set the bar very high and might be difficult to follow up with!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush set. There are all different sizes that you can use to apply different things to your face. The best of all is the powder brush. They have also included an eyebrow brush and lash brush. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with these makeup brushes. Looking for a professional look to your makeup?  These brushes will deliver! They are top quality, and really make my makeup look much better than my old brushes. The bristles are nice and soft, and includes 32 pieces with case.</li>
            <li> My daughters have been trying to convert me from foam makeup applicators and powder puffs to makeup brushes for several years, and just recently I decided to give them a try.  I have to admit that brushes make application easier and blending smoother, and that brushes last a lot longer too.  It&#x27;s also more economical to wash and dry brushes instead of replacing foam ones every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This USpicy makeup kit is certainly one of the most complete ones I&#x27;ve ever seen!  It contains 32 different types of brushes - everything from lipliner brushes to eyeshadow and powder brushes, two sponge applicators, and even a mascara brush and eyebrow/eyelash comb.  Some brushes are very thin tipped, some are angled for precision and some are large and fluffy, making any kind of makeup application easy and efficient.  Each brush has a wooden handle, and firmly affixed, soft natural hair bristles.  I found these brushes a pleasure to use, and I felt like a professional makeup artist as I selected the brushes and made up my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes in a vinyl roll-up case that keeps everything neat, protected and organized.  It&#x27;s about the size of a clutch purse when closed, and would fit neatly in a suitcase, briefcase, or vanity drawer.  I do wish the case had a snap closure instead of the tie laces, but overall this is a very complete, high quality set of brushes that should last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary makeup brush set for testing and review.  I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I otherwise compensated for giving my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:9f0ff6d71aad68c566b58aa5a502082]] USpicy Complete 32 Piece Essential Makeup Brush Set is really complete with variety of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been using it for a few days. Even though she used only a few brushes out of the set, she loves the quality on these brushes so much.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great gift box for her as it comes with a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;Some of these brushes come with protected brush heads which can be reused to avoid damages on these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I have been traveling back and forth between my mom&#x27;s house and her brother&#x27;s house. Because of the travel case, she could fit all these brushes inside and conveniently carry them all in her backpack for her daily makeup work.&lt;br /&gt;In her opinion, these are very high quality brushes which give her professional touch and toning looks.&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes it very much and highly recommend it to anyone who needs daily a convenient set of brushes like this USpicy Complete 32. The set looks small but it has a full complete 32 brushes for all makeup needs.</li>
            <li> I love my new brushes i feel like i never need to buy brushes again :). Only issue is i feel like the paint smell shocked me because i read some reviews and it said it had a smell but some said it didnt. it was so strong that i let it air out outside. I then washed the brushes and they smell super good and feel soft. The travel bag is the main source of the paint smell btw it would be easy to replace the bag though. So based off my review i gave it four stars for the paint smell and the big made in china logo when i open the box. I hate the idea now that each brush coming on my face may have the poisons the are within Chinese products but for the price i still am happy :)</li>
            <li> Incredible value, bought as a gift, very welcome. Was jokingly accused of spying, as the recipient was considering purchasing the very same set a little earlier.</li>
            <li> Brushes are fluffy and professional</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes!! The quality is excellent and that&#x27;s apparent as soon as you touch them. This is a complete 32-piece set, which I love because most sets don&#x27;t provide that many pieces.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are smooth against my skin and my makeup application has improved drastically. So, yes the makeup artists are right when they say the better the makeup brush- the better your makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these fabulous brushes.</li>
            <li> USpicy Complete 32 Piece Essential Makeup Brush kit looks nice. The brushes are packed in a nice plastic pouch for convenience. Lots of different sizes are there for all your needs. Each brush has its own protective sleeve and a separate slot in the pouch. It is designed for makeup professionals, but its price point is also suitable for the average lady. The Amazon web site pictures have one picture that shows two foundation kits. They are not part of the brush kit as implied by the item title. The brushes are silky soft indeed, and they pick up makeup and apply it well. They do what they are supposed to do.  The entire kit gives the appearance of a premium set. My other half likes the kit and suggested that I give it a 5-star rating. My only complaint is that the pouch had a plasticizer odor. I left it out in the garage for a couple of days and the odor was completely gone. For this inconvenience, I deducted one star. If you buy it as a gift, it is better to open the film wrap and vent it to get rid of the smell first. I think your friend will like it better that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had these for a short amount of time, but they seem great. The brushes feel nice and soft against my skin. There&#x27;s a huge assortment of brushes, for every kind of makeup that you&#x27;d need to apply. The case did smell a little plasticity when I first received it, but that went away after a day or so.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t listen to the bad reviews these brushes are bomb! High quality brushes! At a very affordable price</li>
            <li> USPICY MAKEUP BRUSH SET OF 32 IS A GREAT DEAL, SO I SAY JUMP ON IT FAST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ENJOYED THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING ABLE TO REVIEW THIS ITEM. THEY CAME PACKAGED NICELY IN A VERY NICE ROLL UP SOFT CAST FOR EASY ORGANIZATION OF YOUR BRUSHES.&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL NEVER NEED TO DECIDE ON JUST 1 OR 2 BRUSHES WHEN YOUR ON THE GO;  JUST ROLL UP THE CASE AND GO AND YOUR ALL SET WITH THE ENTIRE COLLECTION AT HAND. THIS POUCH IS SOFT AND DURABLE, TIES SHUT AND IS NO BIGGER THAN A SMALL SIZE HANDBAG.&lt;br /&gt;FOUX CROC DESIGN ON YOUR POUCH SHINES IN A PATIENT LEATHER LOOK. EACH BRUSH HAS IT&#x27;S OWN SLOT WITH A PLASTIC BRUSH COVER. JUST SENSATIONAL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BRUSHES GLIDE ACROSS YOUR FACE EVER SO SOFTLY WITH A BEAUTIFUL STURDY HANDLE, AND SILVER HARDWARE.&lt;br /&gt;I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS KIT AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERY WOMAN, AND IT WILL LAST A LIFE TIME.</li>
            <li> I gave my Niece these brushes as a gift,and asked her for her opinion on them, she has said she was very impressed with them as they were well made, not cheap like some brushes she had purchased, and they were smooth to put make up on with, and gave a nice finish , also as there were 32 brushes in total, it gave her the versatility to use different brushes where needed, all in all, she was very Happy with them.</li>
            <li> This is a huge, complete set of makeup brushes. They are VERY soft and I really like them. The handles are really nice with a smooth black finish (wood I think?) The container that comes with them definitely has a plastic odor and needs aired out but it is great for traveling. This would be a great gift for a teenage girl. I received a trial of this product for my review.</li>
            <li> These brushes are beautiful and functional.  My wife highly recommends them, and she provided the following comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this kit for free to review the product. However, that hasn&#x27;t changed my review because this an amazing kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set includes a huge number of brushes. They come in a black case, all individually wrapped.  As I unwrapped them, I noticed the sturdy construction and soft hairs.  The variety of sizes is also impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makeup application with these brushes is a breeze!  I didn’t notice any loose hairs, which is a plus.  I tried out the large brushes, which distributed foundation and powder evenly over my face.  I also tried the smaller brushes on my eyelids; I was able to shade with precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used these brushes a few times since they arrived, and I am very satisfied.  The hairs are soft, the brushes are solid, and I have not observed any shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend these brushes to others.</li>
            <li> My wife was impressed with the quality of this huge set of makeup brushes. She did not expect they are as good as those &amp;#62;$10 per piece ones, but surprised that they are fairly close. She used some common ones and did a head to head comparison with her more expensive brushes, she did not feel a big difference.</li>
            <li> OK, I did not personally review this product but gave them to Kelly to review.  1st she stated she has never owned a collection of make up brushes this large before.  Usually she will buy one or two as needed.  This set has a total of 32 premium quality brushes in it for all areas of facial makeup.  After using a few of these brushes Kelly stated they worked fine but were softer than what she normally buys.  The set comes in a nicely constructed fold-able travel pouch.  We are both in agreement that these would make a great gift for anyone that is serious about their makeup.</li>
            <li> I purchased this makeup brush set based on reading the reviews and the price. Was NOT disappointed, they are beautiful and high quality. I will order again for myself and as a gift item</li>
            <li> I bought them for my 13-year-old daughter.  She loves them!</li>
            <li> Smells like paint. The minute I opened the package my entire living room smelled like paint. Now I&#x27;m nervous to use the brushes.</li>
            <li> Lots of brushes!  Seem to be good quality!</li>
            <li> For the price of these brushes, they well exceeded my expectations! I will probably lay buy them for my daughters for Christmas as well.</li>
            <li> I mean for the price, it&#x27;s worth it because that&#x27;s a lot of brushes but they&#x27;re obviously not super great quality. The smaller ones work very well but the big ones aren&#x27;t very good for blending because the bristles are really flimsy. If that&#x27;s what you need then these are not what you want. The eyeshadow and spooky brushes work well though.</li>
            <li> brushes are so soft. I am in love with the eyebrow brush. I usually use the Anastasia Beverly hills eyebrow brush but i replaced it with this brush from this package!!! makes it easier to apply the dip brow</li>
            <li> The fan brushes are dented and not straight. Also, expected a variety of eyeshadow brushes that is not all synthetic not stiff because they all are.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality. So so soft. Will last a while</li>
            <li> they are absolutely amazing ! the bag did smell a little funky but duhh , its plastic . got here early and no bends or shedding!</li>
            <li> Love them :) Great price for an excellent product.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. I love all of them.</li>
            <li> They are just perfect. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but they feel sooo soft and seems very elegant. The package have a very strong plastic smell, but can be wash. I definitely recommend it to everyone who&#x27;s makeup fan.</li>
            <li> Lots of choices, so far so good. I got this for my girlfriend and she has been using it every day. She has a few favorites out of the set, I&#x27;ve noticed, and even after a week or so of use, they all look the same as when we first got them. As long as you don&#x27;t let the powder, etc. get clumped on the brushes, these should last a very long time. My girlfriend noted that unlike other brushes she has gotten, these do not lose the hairs like others may. She likes it, and I like that she likes it.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been easy for the girls in my family to find a makeup kit with enough brushes and applyers but this is it! The kit is slick and portable, and carries enough accessories to handle any makeup job. The kit is lightweight and fits nicely into any medium-sized purses. The brushes are diverse and works for any situation. The pouch is stylish and useful. It&#x27;s a win for my girls! Definitely worth checking out, especially with the high prices of other makeup kits.</li>
            <li> My reaction after receiving this set was simply WOW! The travel pouch the brushes come in looks well made and seeing the magnitude of brushes  is very impressive in person. This would make for an amazing gift for a makeup lover. As for the brushes, they are very soft and I haven&#x27;t experienced any fall out.</li>
            <li> The feedback below was provided by my girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of 32 brushes came with a black faux leather snake print pouch. The bag folds nicely and has a string to wrap around it. The set of brushes contain the majority of brushes you will need for make up routine with different sizes and for various purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Bristles are really soft and feel gentle on the skin, comparable to some branded brushes that I have&lt;br /&gt;- The brushes stay soft after washing with soap. Very minimal shredding. Easy to wash off the make up from the brushes without using makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;- The handle is made of wood in matte black and feels nice in the hand&lt;br /&gt;- The brushes pick up products well including the lip brush&lt;br /&gt;- The concealer brush blends the concealer well&lt;br /&gt;- The larger power brushes, blending brushes, and thin eye liner brush came with a plastic protector for the brushes&lt;br /&gt;- There is an upper flap within the pouch to protect the bristles&lt;br /&gt;- The set of brushes is portable for travel needs.&lt;br /&gt;- No foundation brush in this set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight chemical smell when I opened the pouch but it got better after I let it aired out for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free of charge for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The USpicy 32 piece brush set is an amazing set of brushes, it comes in a beautiful traveling case that is great to carry anywhere with you.&lt;br /&gt;All the brushes work great! They pick up powers, eye shadows, and blend foundation perfectly! I love this set, it brings everything you need to get a perfect make up application. Brushes feel  soft on your skin and leave a perfect finish. I would recommend this to my family, friends and everyone who&#x27;s looking to  purchase a great make up brush set!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Johanna Ferrari&lt;br /&gt;Instagram: @nailsbyjoha</li>
            <li> My girlfriend&#x27;s birthday was coming up and I was thinking of a nice supplemental gift for the girl that has everything.  Well, I started digging for cosmetic accessories and came across this wonderful USpicy 32-Piece Essential Makeup Brush Kit.  It was very affordable and looked to be made of high-quality materials, so I gave it a shot.  My girlfriend was pleasantly surprised and told me she would ABSOLUTELY recommend them without hesitation.  The kit includes various brushes of different sizes for certain purposes.  The handles on the brushes are easy to grip and the bristles are very soft on the skin, making it easy to both apply and remove product.  To ice it all off, the kit comes with a fashionable little faux leather case to store everything in that is very travel friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all my fellas out there, pick this one up as a nice gift add-on to that jewelry purchase.  She will surely appreciate it. :)</li>
            <li> I guess for what you pay it is alright.  The foundation brush really isn&#x27;t a foundation brush, I wish it was either more domed or flat.  It had many eye brushes that because the kit is all synthetic are too dense to really pack on color maybe better for a cream?  No stippling brush but it already states that but for such a set it would be nice to have one.  The eyeliner brush just isn&#x27;t fine enough.  The fan brush is great and the quality of the brushes is good hairs don&#x27;t fall out.  Maybe this set is better suited for those that use cream as opposed to powder products</li>
            <li> Just got my set...it is super cute I love it.....It does have a very strong paint scent....have not used it as yet but i love it. I gave it 3 stars because I have not wash it as yet.</li>
            <li> It is not bad but it smells little bit of cheap plastic</li>
            <li> Great seller with a great product and great price too. Will alwasy lookup for this seller each I buy because of his wonderful and high-quality products!!!</li>
            <li> Opened this set of brushes up and WOW! I could not believe how big the set actually was. It came in a nice vinyl bag that resembles a small hand purse. When opened up the set is huge. It has every brush you could possibly need. The quality is good and the brushes are very soft. I have purchased smaller sets from Walmart at almost the same price. The quality and selection were not even close to what you get here. This set is like having your own professional set of make-up brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect brush set. There is every brush you need in this great set. The brushes are a great quality synthetic hair. The bristles are very soft and smooth and feel very comfortable on the face.  This would be a great starter brush set as-well as perfect for any professionals. These brushes also  work very well with special effects makeup. The brush Set comes in a great quality brush wrap to keep all your brushes tidy and clean. The wrap also folds up perfectly so it does not take up to much room in your kit.  I would definitely recommend this brush set, it is a really good quality and has every brush you need as-well as keeping neat and tidy.</li>
            <li> I got this kit as a trial run for a honest review, so here we go. I&#x27;m an amateur when it comes to makeup but when my boss saw this he neatly hit the roof. We dress up as characters for tours. At first I thought 32 brushes seems a bit excessive... I was wrong. During this week alone is used about 60% of the brushes. When I first got the kit the bag looked very classy though it did come with a chemical smell at first, just let it air out. The bag itself had a pleather feel to and it&#x27;s pretty big, which makes sense for a bag carrying 32 brushes(believe me I counted them). I had to get use to closing it but I really love the little wrap around string. Though a button or something to wrap the sting around would&#x27;ve been nice. Though the bag is light weight it will take up space in your purse. So I wouldn&#x27;t exactly travel with this often. Most likely I would leave it someplace I frequent like my job. Or take the brushes I normally use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the brushes:&lt;br /&gt;-Bristles are very soft&lt;br /&gt;-Brushes come in all sizing which is good for getting the tough spots like under your eyes. It also helps, especially the angular brushes, with precision like designs on the face. It&#x27;s good to have a choice between quick makeup session or in dept.&lt;br /&gt;-Upkeep: So far I&#x27;ve been using the brushes for almost a week and they haven&#x27;t shed yet. Some my job is about makeup I say they hold up pretty good. The only thing I&#x27;ve seen so far is a bridle or two staying from the group sort to speak. I usually wash them and blow dry them for a bit to keep the bristles soft. Seems to work fine.&lt;br /&gt;This set is a definite buy according to my boss, but I agree. Even though it was a bit overwhelming for me I learned a few new tricks especially with the smaller brushes. My boss and the other girls in our troupe can&#x27;t wait to buy their own. It&#x27;s essential like they say and I COULDN&#x27;T AGREE MORE!</li>
            <li> I loved the pouch the brushes came in and the feel and look of them on first impressions already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there is more than one brush of each.&lt;br /&gt;No foundation Brush,Used powder brush instead of foundation brush. Worked really well. Soft, doesn’t absorb too much makeup and blends it all very well with no streaks left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concealer brush:&lt;br /&gt;perfect! Distributes very well. Gets concealer into small areas, soft and with Just the right texture. A little stiff, but it should be like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye shadow brush, I didn&#x27;t like this one too much. It didnt distribute it the way it should, kind of absorbed too much and didnt distribute it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mascara wand, really good, adds volume but not length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bronzer brush/Blush brush, didnt distribute very well. Worked good with bronzer, but didnt like it with blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angled (jel) eyeliner brush. Two sizes, these are really good! Perfect angle and wings eyeliner well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipstick brush. The thin one appropriate for the outer edge of the lip, with the larger one distributing lipstick on the whole lip. Loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrow brush works very well also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the set and have recommended to friends and family as it&#x27;s much more handy getting these brushes in a set, in a pouch, compared to having to seek the right brushes out and buying them separately!</li>
            <li> This is a full set with every kind of brush you can possibly need. The bristles are very soft and comfy against the skin.  It applies makeup nicely.  The carry case is nice and convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would happily recommend this set to family and friends!</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are an excellent value and seem very well-made for the price.  The soft bristles do not seem to cause any irritation, and I have had no issues with these losing bristles over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this makeup brush set.  Or at least my wife does! :)</li>
            <li> This review is for the USpicy Complete 32 Piece Makeup Brush Set w/ Travel Pouch. I got this for my gf and she loves it. This is what she had to say ...The USpicy 32 piece makeup brush set are synthetic hair so they feel extra soft. The high quality of the product holds the makeup well which makes it easy to apply and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the bristles shedding so far. The long handle makes the brushes easy to hold and are comparable to professional sets. The black case that all the brushes came in also makes it very convenient to travel with and helps keep them clean. I can just leave each brush in the slot that it came in and bring it with me everywhere I go and some of the brushes even come with its own protective plastic cover which keeps it clean. I love that there are so many brushes to use from foundation to lips to blush. There&#x27;s even a handful of different eye makeup brushes. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my new USpicy makeup brush set because it truly is a very complete set of makeup brushes. I have every brush I&#x27;m going to need all in a neat little pouch.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this brush set! There are so many! The brushes are super soft and hold makeup well. I did notice that the white tips do soak up bright colors and stain easily. I did find myself wishing that the brushes were printed with the area it&#x27;s supposed to be used on. I think it would make it a lot easier for someone new to a large brush set. The bag that the brushes come with is excellent and really handy!</li>
