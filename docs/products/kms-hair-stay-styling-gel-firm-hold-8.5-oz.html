            <li>KMS Styling Gel is a great product.  </li>
            <li>It has a great hold, and no flakes.  </li>
            <li>Smells great does not hold that well.</li>
            <li>The best way I can describe the smell is a full diaper doused in Lysol.</li>

            <li>It is a great product, Fast Shipping and good price.  </li>

            <li>I like it and got a better price ordering it online than purchasing it a the beauty supply store</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for more years than i can remember and love it.  </li>
            <li>I got this, reading that the hold was even more and it was shiny, and well . . .</li>
            <li>Love this gel.  </li>
            <li>this is a repeat order love the product</li>
            <li>I always liked the original and used it for many years, but this product does not work as well.  </li>
            <li>I am a fan because it provides strong hold without the flakiness.</li>
            <li>and that is working just as well without the strong odor.</li>
            <li>, however im pretty sure if i did ...it would smell like this gel</li>
            <li>They were right!</li>
            <li>I was happy to see I could purchase KMS from Amazon since my beauty store has closed.</li>
            <li>product works great just what I expected</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>I love KMS cream for my hair (far stronger hold).</li>
            <li>I even called the company and they don&#x27;t make the old one any more.</li>
            <li>but it looks and smells to be the right stuff</li>
            <li>Like it very much.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>stuff does stink and I almost tossed it when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>Just a little offers body and texture and makes me and my hair happy.</li>
            <li>When the store that normally carried it, closed, I was very glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Put it on your hair when it&#x27;s dry - just like scrunch it in to add more body and some waves.</li>
            <li>Good but leaves my hair looking very stiff.  </li>
            <li>Much of it, I have learned, has to do with the product.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>my partner uses this, he likes the firm hold, plus there is NO flaking and the smell is really nice.</li>
            <li>It works for me every time and gives me body and control over my blow dry of my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients have changed only slightly but enough to ruin a once great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a while and don&#x27;t intend to change it to anything new.</li>
            <li>The scent is powerful enough to stay on your hands for most of the day even after washes, will wreck your towel after a shower/rinse, and destroy your confidence in public.</li>
            <li>This product when put on wet hair before drying gives you so much body!!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, which is pretty easy to tame with say even :WATER, so this stuff is pretty sad.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy not too light.</li>
            <li>I wish they would have kept the old fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it holds as well as the old formula.</li>
            <li>The picture on the website is the old design.</li>
            <li>I use a small amount after spraying on Thickr and it gives my fine thinning hair the body it needs.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair which becomes flat after a few hours.  </li>
            <li>Great finishing product and bigger package is much less expensive than in Ulta.</li>
            <li>Works the same as the old formula that came in the white tube/pink cap and smelled nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fine, thin hair requires a pea size dollop.  </li>
            <li>Too much leaves little flecks.  </li>

            <li> I really like this for styling but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the KMS firm hold because I couldn&#x27;t find it here in Miami, FL, but when it arrived I knew immediately it was different from the KMS I normally buy.</li>
            <li> I never worry as long as I have enough of this in my supply drawer!</li>
            <li> This is a product I have used for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Gel was as expected.</li>
            <li> I was crushed.</li>
            <li> Now if I can just find some WET.</li>
            <li> perhaps it is shiny while it is wet, but the biggest problem is the fact that if I rub the stuff through my hair, the gel no longer works as it dries and fluffs away into the air.</li>
            <li> I would have given this gel a 5 star rating but they have changed the formula and design of the container (it was pink)</li>
            <li> If enough people complain the idiot that perfumed a men&#x27;s product that strongly will learn a lesson.</li>
            <li> I found this out when I ran out of it and tried other brands.</li>
            <li> Will throw this in the drawer with all the other &amp;#34;failures&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The texture was clumpy and it had an odd odor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too gummy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and unnatural.  </li>
            <li> Curls lasted longer than usual.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.  </li>
            <li> To clarify, #1, not #2, so that at least is favorable.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was do to heat or extreme cold exposure in shipping</li>
            <li> There is an awful chemical/dead-animal smell to it now which makes it completely unusable.  </li>
            <li> was disappointed, as it was not as firm a  hold as I wanted, and I&lt;br /&gt;hate</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks!</li>
            <li> When I started using it, I was appalled at the stench it had.</li>

            <li> This is a product I have used for a long time.  I like it and got a better price ordering it online than purchasing it a the beauty supply store</li>
            <li> I ordered the KMS firm hold because I couldn&#x27;t find it here in Miami, FL, but when it arrived I knew immediately it was different from the KMS I normally buy. The texture was clumpy and it had an odd odor. I don&#x27;t know if it was do to heat or extreme cold exposure in shipping but I returned it and Amazon refunded my money.</li>
            <li> This item was requested to me.  Love it.  I have problem hair and this product gave it body.  Curls lasted longer than usual.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair which becomes flat after a few hours.  This product is a Godsend.  I often receive compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve been using KMS Styling Gel.  I am so happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li> People ask me about my hair all the time. Much of it, I have learned, has to do with the product. I found this out when I ran out of it and tried other brands. Ugh! This holds well and doesn&#x27;t build up. Best of the best by reputation.</li>
            <li> KMS Styling Gel is a great product.  I have used it for years.  When the store that normally carried it, closed, I was very glad to find it on Amazon.Com.  It is a great product, Fast Shipping and good price.  Thanks! Debbie</li>
            <li> Gel was as expected. Like it very much.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!  Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and unnatural.  Just wish they had a traveler&#x27;s size that meets TSA guidelines.</li>
            <li> I really like this for styling but a little goes a long way.  Too much leaves little flecks.  Just a little offers body and texture and makes me and my hair happy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more years than i can remember and love it.  It is the only unscented (or almost so) gel that I could find and it does a terrific job holding my hair in place.</li>
            <li> The only store in Macon,Ga. that sold this went out of business. I was crushed. I have fine, straight, shoulder length hair. This product when put on wet hair before drying gives you so much body!! Put it on your hair when it&#x27;s dry - just like scrunch it in to add more body and some waves. It NEVER flakes or feels sticky!&lt;br /&gt;Patricia</li>
            <li> my partner uses this, he likes the firm hold, plus there is NO flaking and the smell is really nice.</li>
            <li> My hubby&#x27;s go-to product for the last 15 years!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  It has a great hold, and no flakes.  Now I found a source for twice the quantity for the same price that I paid in a local salon!  Thanks!  I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
            <li> I like the KMS brand, but had never seen this &amp;#34;in person&amp;#34;.  Bought it online,&lt;br /&gt;and was disappointed, as it was not as firm a  hold as I wanted, and I&lt;br /&gt;hate the smell!  ugh.  Will throw this in the drawer with all the other &amp;#34;failures&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> (Reviewing this for my husband) Relive the 80s as you take in the aroma of this gel. I am a fan because it provides strong hold without the flakiness. Now if I can just find some WET.</li>
            <li> I love KMS cream for my hair (far stronger hold). I got this, reading that the hold was even more and it was shiny, and well . . . perhaps it is shiny while it is wet, but the biggest problem is the fact that if I rub the stuff through my hair, the gel no longer works as it dries and fluffs away into the air. One gust of wind and your hairstyle is gone. I have fine hair, which is pretty easy to tame with say even :WATER, so this stuff is pretty sad.</li>
            <li> Good but leaves my hair looking very stiff.  I would use this for the back of my hair that I need flattened but not the front. Use KMS Hair Play Gel Wax for the front then this gel for the back.</li>
            <li> I use KMS hair styling from time to time and it always proforms as advertised. I have bought it from Amazon before and I will probably buy it from Amazon again. It is dependable and I like that.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It works for me every time and gives me body and control over my blow dry of my fine hair.  I never worry as long as I have enough of this in my supply drawer!</li>
            <li> The best.  Love this gel.  I cannot find it in the beauty supply stores anymore.  Not sure why.  But wish they would continue to carry it</li>
            <li> Smells great does not hold that well.</li>
            <li> Works the same as the old formula that came in the white tube/pink cap and smelled nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does stink and I almost tossed it when I first got it.  It actually reminded me of manure.  After using your hair will not smell like the gel, however.  And over time you get used to the smell and don&#x27;t notice it anymore.</li>
            <li> Or so it seems anyway.  I always liked the original and used it for many years, but this product does not work as well.  It&#x27;s too gummy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and was as described. Have not used yet but it looks and smells to be the right stuff</li>
            <li> this smells like horse dick..... i have never smelled a horses dick, however im pretty sure if i did ...it would smell like this gel...peace out</li>
            <li> I use a small amount after spraying on Thickr and it gives my fine thinning hair the body it needs.</li>
            <li> this is a repeat order love the product</li>
            <li> When I started using it, I was appalled at the stench it had. The scent is powerful enough to stay on your hands for most of the day even after washes, will wreck your towel after a shower/rinse, and destroy your confidence in public.The best way I can describe the smell is a full diaper doused in Lysol. To clarify, #1, not #2, so that at least is favorable.  If the imagery of diapers don&#x27;t come to mind, then either 1) your sense of smell is gone 2) got lucky with a good batch.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. Not too heavy not too light. The only thing I&#x27;m not that fond of is the smell. I wish they would have kept the old fragrance.</li>
            <li> The product has the same name tho now comes in a new-look packaging.  There is an awful chemical/dead-animal smell to it now which makes it completely unusable.  The ingredients have changed only slightly but enough to ruin a once great product.</li>
            <li> Fine, thin hair requires a pea size dollop.  That said this 8.5 Oz tube will last me a life time.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this styling gel before in my local beauty store. I was happy to see I could purchase KMS from Amazon since my beauty store has closed. It&#x27;s a good product and holds ok. I would have given this gel a 5 star rating but they have changed the formula and design of the container (it was pink) and I don&#x27;t think it holds as well as the old formula. The picture on the website is the old design.</li>
            <li> I used this for years and liked it. I read one review that said they changed it and now it smells like perfumed embalming fluid. They were right! I threw it away and ordered the Crew and that is working just as well without the strong odor. I even called the company and they don&#x27;t make the old one any more. If enough people complain the idiot that perfumed a men&#x27;s product that strongly will learn a lesson. This stuff stinks!</li>
            <li> Has a stronger chemical odor than it should, I have used this brand for years and never smelled like this...</li>
            <li> Great finishing product and bigger package is much less expensive than in Ulta. I&#x27;ve used it for a while and don&#x27;t intend to change it to anything new. Works.</li>
            <li> product works great just what I expected</li>
            <li> Excellent gel at a great price.</li>
            <li> i use this all the time never makes your hair sticky</li>
