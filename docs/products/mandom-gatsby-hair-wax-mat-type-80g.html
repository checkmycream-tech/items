    <ol>
            <li>Best wax I have ever used.</li>
            <li>this wax gives you the perfect amount of durability and dryness.</li>
            <li>Perfect for medium length hair.</li>
            <li>Very good hair wax.</li>
            <li>I wear a blowout and this stuff is great</li>
            <li>Great hold without being too spiky/stiff. . . .</li>
            <li>Keeps good volume and had a good all day hold.</li>
            <li>I bought it, used it, loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>and it holds amazingly throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Has nice holding yet stays flexible and I like the mat finish.</li>
            <li>but it may work for people looking for that kind of finish.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and it washes off in the shower quite well unlike most greasy waxes that you get at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I like this one much better.</li>
            <li>Axe putty works better.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care as much about my hair these days, but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Wish it was easier to find than just from this one Amazon Marketplace seller, but will continue buying regardless the price :).</li>
            <li>So glad I did, been using for two years and works everytime.</li>
            <li>people may argue that axe&#x27;s version of this is better</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more of a cream</li>
            <li>since it works okay</li>
            <li>This is my favorite wax out of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>most have a shiny look</li>
            <li>and I wanted a more matte finish but still something that holds my wavy hair.</li>
            <li>and I just love the matte look.</li>
            <li>Love It.</li>
            <li>Glad to know I can get it in the States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite mat wax for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well priced and works better than stuff 3 times</li>
            <li>Once my hair dries I have more control with a damp hand.</li>
            <li>wax on the other hand is perfect ive been using it for 3 days now</li>
            <li>Easy to applu and wash out.  </li>
            <li>Smell is quite strong and bothersome...</li>
            <li>I first discovered this amazing product while living in Singapore.</li>
            <li>This is great for short, spiky or disheveled hair styles.</li>
            <li>, doesn.t need a work to emulsify like crew clay or sebastion products and as light as it is</li>
            <li>Cheap for its price too</li>
            <li>This is a heavy hold wax that keeps your hair looking awesome and styled.  </li>
            <li>They call this wax, which I wouldn&#x27;t completely agree with, but it is still good, and I don&#x27;t know what else to call it.</li>
            <li>This definitely works best for short hair.</li>
            <li>Much more natural than stronger waxes/pomades.  </li>
            <li>After I&#x27;m done molding the hair how I want, I use a small amount of hairspray to keep it together and it lasts alll day and looks great.</li>
            <li>its ok, sometimes would turn white when in hair.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best hair product and almost the only hair product I used for the past 3-4 years.</li>
            <li>This is my third favorite wax product after Bumble and Bumble Sumotech and TIGI Bed Head.</li>
            <li>the hold is good and it looks naturally messy.</li>
            <li>I seriously hope they don&#x27;t change this formula, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Plus it smells really</li>
            <li>I feel like I need to wash my hair twice to really get this product out.</li>
            <li>It sort of just dissolves and doesn&#x27;t feel very sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its good, but doesnt provide enough strength as the pink gatsby does.</li>
            <li>It can be very hard to wash out, however, its a minor issue for an otherwise excellent product.</li>
            <li>Last long and washes out very easy.</li>
            <li>It only takes a couple finger-coatings worth to keep my hair styled the way I want all day.  </li>
            <li>Not super heavy but great for all types of hair.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Has a very natural look and doesn&#x27;t get crusty.</li>
            <li>I usually apply it to damp hair, and it goes in easily.</li>
            <li>As a reference point, I&#x27;ve got course, thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply less for a completely natural look, or apply more for a more controlled, slick look.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair which i some how mold into a messy mohawk kind of deal every morning.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, normally I have a problem with the store bought crap, I&#x27;ve used Bed head manipulator, American crew fiber, a couple of the axe products, and to put it simply they all suck in comparison to this stuff.</li>

            <li> Gave a very dry look, but this particular Gatsby was chunky unlike their other hair rubber molding products.</li>
            <li> Hold was weak and didn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not completely matte.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other gatsby producs like their moving rubber line</li>
            <li> Nothing like the dozens or hundreds of other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> It does what I need it to, keep my hair from sticking up everywhere as it dries, and with only a small amount I can shape my hair all day.</li>
            <li> , I have typical thick black asian hair.</li>
            <li> but i find it simply not true.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair moldable when you apply, it, but it gives it a little hold.</li>
            <li> It leaves a little shine/grease in your hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair firm with no shine whatsoever.</li>
            <li> this usually takes me multiple tries with the mediocre stuff i was using before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have wavy-ish hair that I usually straighten a little then put this in afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and have been for the past year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure why people like this product...</li>
            <li> This product was definite disappointment.</li>
            <li> You can feel that it is a thin product when you work it in your hands.</li>
            <li> This wax is mediocre.</li>
            <li> worst part about it is that it smells a little like sunblock.</li>

            <li> its ok, sometimes would turn white when in hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other gatsby producs like their moving rubber line and I like this one much better. No oily or greasy feeling. Has nice holding yet stays flexible and I like the mat finish. I have wavy-ish hair that I usually straighten a little then put this in afterwards. Keeps good volume and had a good all day hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure why people like this product...It doesn&#x27;t hold well at all. Axe putty works better. This product was definite disappointment.</li>
            <li> Best wax I have ever used. Don&#x27;t care as much about my hair these days, but this stuff is great. Nothing like the dozens or hundreds of other brands I have tried. Wish it was easier to find than just from this one Amazon Marketplace seller, but will continue buying regardless the price :).</li>
            <li> i have seen this product when I was in japan. I bought it, used it, loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Does what it says... MAtte look and keeps your hair up. Plus it smells really nice.&lt;br /&gt;buy it!! now!!</li>
            <li> Had been using more expensive designer products for years at $20-$40 a pop. Stumbled onto this brand and gave it a shot. So glad I did, been using for two years and works everytime. As a reference point, I&#x27;ve got course, thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply less for a completely natural look, or apply more for a more controlled, slick look. Smells good.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair which i some how mold into a messy mohawk kind of deal every morning. this usually takes me multiple tries with the mediocre stuff i was using before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax on the other hand is perfect ive been using it for 3 days now and it holds amazingly throughout the day. It smells amazing and it washes off in the shower quite well unlike most greasy waxes that you get at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may argue that axe&#x27;s version of this is better but i find it simply not true. this wax gives you the perfect amount of durability and dryness.</li>
            <li> I thought it was supposed to be a wax product but it&#x27;s more of a cream and it finishes quite greasy and shiny. Definitely not what I wanted but it may work for people looking for that kind of finish. Hold was weak and didn&#x27;t last more than a few hours. Smell is quite strong and bothersome...&lt;br /&gt;3-stars since it works okay but personally it is not for me at all...</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and have been for the past year. Holds hair all day with no greasy shine. Somewhat resilient to sweat (up to a point of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just some context, I have typical thick black asian hair. This is my favorite wax out of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is great for short, spiky or disheveled hair styles. It gives my pixie cut a &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; look (my preference) without looking greasy or adding weight to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Asian guy with hair that gets oily after a day without a shower.  Did I mention that my hair also never lasts through an entire day in the same position with any product unless it&#x27;s that goo that turns your hair into a porcelain sculpture?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness I found this product.  It only takes a couple finger-coatings worth to keep my hair styled the way I want all day.  It doesn&#x27;t feel oily when I touch it, and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair clump together.  I&#x27;ll continue re-buying this product until I go bald.</li>
            <li> I have used every wax, clay etc for the last twenty years. most have a shiny look and I wanted a more matte finish but still something that holds my wavy hair. this does the trick, doesn.t need a work to emulsify like crew clay or sebastion products and as light as it is the hold is good and it looks naturally messy.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair product and almost the only hair product I used for the past 3-4 years. Cheap for its price too and I just love the matte look.</li>
            <li> Love It. Can&#x27;t live without it. I first discovered this amazing product while living in Singapore. Glad to know I can get it in the States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended...</li>
            <li> This is my third favorite wax product after Bumble and Bumble Sumotech and TIGI Bed Head. The only issue I have with this wax occurs when I try to wash my hair. I feel like I need to wash my hair twice to really get this product out.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy hold wax that keeps your hair looking awesome and styled.  Easy to applu and wash out.  Not super heavy but great for all types of hair. If you want to keep it rockin, then use this.  I wear a blowout and this stuff is great</li>
            <li> Tried every different brand of wax, but Gatsby is the one. Last long and washes out very easy. Going to use this forever!!</li>
            <li> Very good hair wax. It keeps my hair firm with no shine whatsoever. It can be very hard to wash out, however, its a minor issue for an otherwise excellent product.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite mat wax for many years. It&#x27;s well priced and works better than stuff 3 times it&#x27;s price. Has a very natural look and doesn&#x27;t get crusty.</li>
            <li> They call this wax, which I wouldn&#x27;t completely agree with, but it is still good, and I don&#x27;t know what else to call it. This definitely works best for short hair. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair moldable when you apply, it, but it gives it a little hold. I usually apply it to damp hair, and it goes in easily. Once my hair dries I have more control with a damp hand. It does what I need it to, keep my hair from sticking up everywhere as it dries, and with only a small amount I can shape my hair all day. I like it.</li>
            <li> This wax is mediocre. It&#x27;s not completely matte. It leaves a little shine/grease in your hair. The hold I would rate at a 5/10. You can feel that it is a thin product when you work it in your hands. It sort of just dissolves and doesn&#x27;t feel very sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part about it is that it smells a little like sunblock.</li>
            <li> Always helpful and just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Great hold without being too spiky/stiff. . . . Much more natural than stronger waxes/pomades.  Perfect for medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a different wax, but actually it was a softer version. Its good, but doesnt provide enough strength as the pink gatsby does. I have to order that one next time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, normally I have a problem with the store bought crap, I&#x27;ve used Bed head manipulator, American crew fiber, a couple of the axe products, and to put it simply they all suck in comparison to this stuff. After I&#x27;m done molding the hair how I want, I use a small amount of hairspray to keep it together and it lasts alll day and looks great. I seriously hope they don&#x27;t change this formula, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Gave a very dry look, but this particular Gatsby was chunky unlike their other hair rubber molding products. Really similar to what you find in axe styling wax.</li>
