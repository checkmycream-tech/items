    <ol>
            <li>I have been using these for about a year and they are great!</li>
            <li>Also price is great.</li>
            <li>Great product and price.  </li>
            <li>These do a great job of just that.</li>
            <li>anyway, I took my eye makeup off and everything was good.  </li>
            <li>Awesome, removed perfectly even the more stubborn mascara and eyeliner and gently , to me</li>
            <li>Work great insofar as I am concerned and the price is okay.  </li>
            <li>First of all, they smell great, just like cucumbers!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely effective in removing mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>The container was a nice size making it easy to throw in my suitcase.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with product.</li>
            <li>I love this and recco to everyone.  </li>
            <li>By day 3, it looked noticeably better.</li>
            <li>Now on day 4, and I feel free again!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These do have a lovely (cucumber) smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, removed makeup</li>
            <li>Work awesome, if only there  were more in there</li>
            <li>Personally, I love these eye makeup remover pads and they haven&#x27;t stung my eyes</li>
            <li>a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased others that may have worked better but they have ingredients that are harmful while this one hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It works great removing natural mascara and shadows.</li>
            <li>I love cruelty free, natural products and have been really happy with everything I have tried until this.</li>
            <li>I was looking for non toxic eye makeup remover, which is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and convenient for traveling or on the go</li>
            <li>I imagine by the end of the week I will be good as new.</li>
            <li>just expect that it may smudge your makeup a little, but also does a great job of removing it!</li>
            <li>They are not always available at drug stores.</li>
            <li>Gentle, and effective</li>
            <li>This is true of every eye makeup remove I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast :)</li>
            <li>I did get in the shower right afterwards, so I was able to wash my face pretty thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>The pads seem to be pretty smooth and they clean off my makeup well.</li>
            <li>Simple and easy!</li>
            <li>but next time I&#x27;ll just stick to neutorgena as their pads are much larger and work great at removing all the makeup.</li>
            <li>once I try enough of them, I&#x27;ll settle on a trusted favorite.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re moist without being drippy-wet, so they&#x27;d probably work for travel (although the container is somewhat large).  </li>
            <li>They are very saturated, which is better than being too dry, but again they burn</li>
            <li>Very cooling and soothing.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for about a week and Always made sure the car was tightly closed.  </li>
            <li>I would love to see a travel size offered, but I folded half a dozen into a tiny jar and that works fine.</li>
            <li>I love these little eye pads.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t get five stars because it stins a little. will not buy more after I finish what I have.</li>
            <li>In an attempt to go more green, I switched to these pads.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried anything new for my eye makeup remover in  years, but since I like this brand I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I got these to replace my normal eye makeup removal pads when I made the switch to all natural products this month.</li>
            <li>When its finished, peel off the label and you&#x27;ve got a cute little white container.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have never had an allergic reaction to anything (now in my 30&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive eyes, you might want to skip these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes, you might want to give these a try.</li>
            <li>I Don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and although these claim to be made for sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t see how.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these because they claim to be all natural makeup remover pads for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>95% natural and so convenient.</li>
            <li>Go down on price or add alot more because  other than that,excellent  product.</li>
            <li>They remove makeup easily without any irritation to the delicate eye area.  </li>
            <li>I really like these products, they don&#x27;t burn or sting, but they do dry my eyes out</li>
            <li>Am not sure quite how cleansing the wipes are, but they definitely remove enough makeup to get by--maybe more.</li>
            <li>first, I wondered why the other reviewers were complaining about burning/stinging sensations in the eyes.  </li>
            <li>So easy too use, now I always clean the black mascara gunk that the face washing leaves behind.  </li>
            <li>My skin is somewhat sensitive to personal care products.</li>
            <li>It says for &#x27;sensitive eyes&#x27; but these are the only pads I&#x27;ve ever used that actually do burn after use.</li>
            <li>and they did a good job, even though I&#x27;ve had trouble removing this mascara with other products in the past.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and they did a good job, even though I&#x27;ve had trouble removing this mascara with other products in the past.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of any other eye make-up remover with all or mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Also found the product not completely removing all eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Every single one of these expired within 2 weeks of my order.  </li>
            <li> The only trouble I have is separating the pads.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it takes about a minute to dry; if you swipe it under your eye to remove mascara that accidentally got on your skin while you were applying it, it will cause your mascara to bleed onto your skin, which can be counterproductive.</li>
            <li> that itched like crazy and full of bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;Yes to&amp;#34; products with no issue.</li>
            <li> I tossed the rest, it was such a waste!  </li>
            <li> My rash calmed down.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my previous eye makeup remover has parabens, which is why I am no longer using it.  </li>
            <li> it removes the black mascara I wear.  </li>
            <li> Also, it makes my skin feel weirdly warm after I use it, which isn&#x27;t uncomfortable but is just a little weird!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little capricious when it comes to makeup remover products.  </li>
            <li> These, in my opinion, remove eye makeup the easiest, without any watering eyes or messy liquids.</li>
            <li> Found the pads too harsh for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I did not use it for a few days as I forgot to pack it when I went on a trip.  </li>
            <li> It actually wasn&#x27;t the worst burning I&#x27;ve ever had from eye makeup remover, but it wasn&#x27;t fun.  </li>
            <li> For the price,you get very little pads.</li>
            <li> I usually use mascara alone.</li>
            <li> Well, I started to develop a weird rash on my upper arm (?!)</li>
            <li> It also couldn&#x27;t remove the waterproof mascara that I usually wear.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s with one coat of mascara and a small amount of eyeliner.</li>
            <li> If you wear very very heavy eye makeup and line your waterline you might need two though.</li>
            <li> They are very thin and not moist enough.</li>
            <li> I wear thick eyeliner, eye shadow, a base, but rarely mascara, I&#x27;d probably need one per eye if I put on a lot of mascara.</li>
            <li> I typically just wear liquid eyeliner and mascara on my eyes and need to use about 3 pads to get all my eye make up off, they are thin pads.  </li>
            <li> The material feels a little scratchy and the liquid stings!!</li>
            <li> But they are very very small</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not exactly a good thing.</li>
            <li> They leave behind no residue and get all the eye make-up off.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; and for &amp;#34;sensitive skin.&amp;#34; My eyes have never watered so badly with any other eye product.</li>
            <li> Pads very thin and soaked in watery solution.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when I used it, it made my eyes and skin burn like crazy.</li>
            <li> These are disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very thin pads!.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed to find out the the remainder of the pads were completely dried out! :(</li>
            <li> Whatever is in these pads is bad news for me.</li>
            <li> They work but smell bad and not at all like the cucumber pads you buy in the store.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work to take off make-up :(</li>
            <li> They smelled really bad!</li>
            <li> Worst product I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> it looked so terrible.</li>
            <li> This is a BAD item, do not buy!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome, removed perfectly even the more stubborn mascara and eyeliner and gently , to me it doesn&#x27;t burn at all</li>
            <li> I was looking for non toxic eye makeup remover, which is easy to use. Pads very thin and soaked in watery solution. It works great removing natural mascara and shadows. I already ordered another bottle. Also price is great. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with product.</li>
            <li> I do like the cucumber scent! Am not sure quite how cleansing the wipes are, but they definitely remove enough makeup to get by--maybe more. I just don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re quite moist enough.</li>
            <li> Great product and price.  I love this and recco to everyone.  Easy to use and convenient for traveling or on the go</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these.  They did not remove all of my makeup and they sting my eyes.</li>
            <li> These, in my opinion, remove eye makeup the easiest, without any watering eyes or messy liquids. Simple and easy! I bought a &#x27;stash of &#x27;em&#x27;  when I found them at Amazon.  They are not always available at drug stores.</li>
            <li> I love these little eye pads.  They remove makeup easily without any irritation to the delicate eye area.  I would love to see a travel size offered, but I folded half a dozen into a tiny jar and that works fine.</li>
            <li> Very cooling and soothing.  Try them, you will like them.  Cucumbers have been used for years to soothe and comfort the eyes.  These do a great job of just that.</li>
            <li> I really like these products, they don&#x27;t burn or sting, but they do dry my eyes out and I put eye drops in after use. This is true of every eye makeup remove I&#x27;ve used. The pads seem to be pretty smooth and they clean off my makeup well. If you wear very very heavy eye makeup and line your waterline you might need two though. I wear thick eyeliner, eye shadow, a base, but rarely mascara, I&#x27;d probably need one per eye if I put on a lot of mascara.</li>
            <li> These are disappointing. They are very thin and not moist enough. The material feels a little scratchy and the liquid stings!! I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin either. Also it takes 3-5 pads to remove my mascara, (not waterproof and no eyeliner)!</li>
            <li> Found the pads too harsh for my skin type. My skin is somewhat sensitive to personal care products. Also found the product not completely removing all eye makeup. I usually use mascara alone.</li>
            <li> Work great insofar as I am concerned and the price is okay.  I have purchased them two or three times now.</li>
            <li> Worst product I&#x27;ve ever tried. In an attempt to go more green, I switched to these pads. Well, I started to develop a weird rash on my upper arm (?!) that itched like crazy and full of bumps. Now, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and have never had an allergic reaction to anything (now in my 30&#x27;s). But suddenly I couldn&#x27;t even wear short sleeved tops it looked so terrible. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was prompting the rash and started the elimination routine, not once thinking that my eye makeup remover pads could be the problem. But once I finally thought, what the heck, let&#x27;s see if this does anything if I stop using the pads at night... boom! My rash calmed down. By day 2, it didn&#x27;t itch anymore. By day 3, it looked noticeably better. Now on day 4, and I feel free again! I imagine by the end of the week I will be good as new. NEVER going to use this stuff again. I&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;Yes to&amp;#34; products with no issue. Whatever is in these pads is bad news for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little capricious when it comes to makeup remover products.  I figure once I try enough of them, I&#x27;ll settle on a trusted favorite.  It probably won&#x27;t be these, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I wondered why the other reviewers were complaining about burning/stinging sensations in the eyes.  I used these to remove eyeshadow and waterproof mascara and they did a good job, even though I&#x27;ve had trouble removing this mascara with other products in the past.  (I did have to use one pad per eye.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, I took my eye makeup off and everything was good.  A minute or two later, though, my eyes started burning.  I have no idea what was going on with the delayed effect.  I did get in the shower right afterwards, so I was able to wash my face pretty thoroughly.  It actually wasn&#x27;t the worst burning I&#x27;ve ever had from eye makeup remover, but it wasn&#x27;t fun.  If you have sensitive eyes, you might want to skip these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do have a lovely (cucumber) smell.  They&#x27;re moist without being drippy-wet, so they&#x27;d probably work for travel (although the container is somewhat large).  If you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes, you might want to give these a try.</li>
            <li> So easy too use, now I always clean the black mascara gunk that the face washing leaves behind.  Use one side for each eye.  When its finished, peel off the label and you&#x27;ve got a cute little white container.  I like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, removed makeup well. I would give 4 stars if the pads were thicker. Won&#x27;t get five stars because it stins a little. will not buy more after I finish what I have.</li>
            <li> Very thin pads!. I need 3 or 4 pads to remove the non waterproof makeup from my eyes. My eyelids seem irritated because I have to rub quite a lot to remove all the eye shadow, pencil and mascara.</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling. The container was a nice size making it easy to throw in my suitcase. Unfortunately when I used it, it made my eyes and skin burn like crazy. It also couldn&#x27;t remove the waterproof mascara that I usually wear. Definitely won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> While these pads do remove your makeup, they BURN!  I typically just wear liquid eyeliner and mascara on my eyes and need to use about 3 pads to get all my eye make up off, they are thin pads.  And then they BURN!! I Don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and although these claim to be made for sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t see how.  I will not buy these again.</li>
            <li> Work awesome, if only there  were more in there I would be buying this all the time.For the price,you get very little pads.Go down on price or add alot more because  other than that,excellent  product.</li>
            <li> They burn my eyes!!!!</li>
            <li> I use the Yes to... line for all of my skin care and buy it for my husband and daughter as well. I love cruelty free, natural products and have been really happy with everything I have tried until this. I haven&#x27;t tried anything new for my eye makeup remover in  years, but since I like this brand I gave it a try. It is supposed to be &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; and for &amp;#34;sensitive skin.&amp;#34; My eyes have never watered so badly with any other eye product. It burned like I was squirting dish soap in my eyes. My eyes were so red after and watered for a couple of minutes. I would never recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought these as they were cheaper than the Neutrogena eye pads. I see why. First of all, they smell great, just like cucumbers! But they are very very small and I have to do a lot of rubbing to remove my eye makeup. It says for &#x27;sensitive eyes&#x27; but these are the only pads I&#x27;ve ever used that actually do burn after use. They are very saturated, which is better than being too dry, but again they burn so it&#x27;s not exactly a good thing. I will continue to use them until they are gone but next time I&#x27;ll just stick to neutorgena as their pads are much larger and work great at removing all the makeup.</li>
            <li> These work well, but still burn my eyes. The pads are pretty small, I have to use 2-3 pads each use and that&#x27;s with one coat of mascara and a small amount of eyeliner. The shipping was fast :)</li>
            <li> I bought this because my previous eye makeup remover has parabens, which is why I am no longer using it.  This product works - it removes the black mascara I wear.  The only trouble I have is separating the pads.  I would prefer a liquid eye makeup remover but I will use this until (if) I find one that works without parabens.</li>
            <li> Personally, I love these eye makeup remover pads and they haven&#x27;t stung my eyes a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased others that may have worked better but they have ingredients that are harmful while this one hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is the only makeup remover I use for my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t sting or hurt and gets all the product off.</li>
            <li> I got these to replace my normal eye makeup removal pads when I made the switch to all natural products this month. It&#x27;s definitely effective in removing mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow. My only complaint is that it takes about a minute to dry; if you swipe it under your eye to remove mascara that accidentally got on your skin while you were applying it, it will cause your mascara to bleed onto your skin, which can be counterproductive. Also, it makes my skin feel weirdly warm after I use it, which isn&#x27;t uncomfortable but is just a little weird! Overall, I definitely recommend these- just expect that it may smudge your makeup a little, but also does a great job of removing it!</li>
            <li> Gentle, and effective</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like  Doesn&#x27;t work to take off make-up :(</li>
            <li> I used this product for about a week and Always made sure the car was tightly closed.  I did not use it for a few days as I forgot to pack it when I went on a trip.  Very disappointed to find out the the remainder of the pads were completely dried out! :(</li>
            <li> Every single one of these expired within 2 weeks of my order.  Don&#x27;t order these unless you want to throw them away!!  They smelled really bad!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about a year and they are great! They leave behind no residue and get all the eye make-up off. I only wish Amazon had them as a subscribe option.</li>
            <li> I think these are expired. They work but smell bad and not at all like the cucumber pads you buy in the store.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because they claim to be all natural makeup remover pads for sensitive skin. They burn my eyes and skin when I used them. I tossed the rest, it was such a waste!  This is a BAD item, do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> 95% natural and so convenient. I don&#x27;t know of any other eye make-up remover with all or mostly natural ingredients.</li>
