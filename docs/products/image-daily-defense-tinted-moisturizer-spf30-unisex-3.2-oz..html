            <li>The service was excellent.  </li>
            <li>This is guaranteed the best product.</li>
            <li>Its the best thing for your money.</li>
            <li>Not the best product for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li>the quality, the way it feels when wearing, and the protection is incredible, and the reason I continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Have switched to Olala - best tinted sunscreen I have ever used, including the Image one that I liked.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer for the summer - it&#x27;s tinted</li>
            <li>The color is great though, it made me look</li>
            <li>Excellent sunscreen and the tint makes my skin look so healthy.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>I love Image products and the tinted moisturiser is great.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I am a licensed Esthetician and Image is one of my favorite product lines!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it out!  </li>
            <li>so I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worse, I paid a lot to get the product shipped to me, and now they want me to pay for my own postage to return it.  </li>
            <li>it is a moisturizer that goes on smoothly and lightly; it is a sun protector with an SPF of 30; and it provides the PERFECT tint of color which evens out the coloring on your skin.  </li>
            <li>A  wonderful light moisturizer with a hint of color to use alone or under a light foundation.  </li>
            <li>It does not clog pores and gives a nice tan hue to your skin.  </li>
            <li>lotion is perfect for everyday: great moisturizer, evens the skin tone since it has a bit of tint and has SPF35.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now giving it 3 stars as, in my opinion, it lost a very important feature.</li>
            <li>I have been using Image for around two years, and love it.</li>
            <li>She would only carry the very best, and this came from her spa.</li>
            <li>Love this tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Love this for the tint...</li>
            <li>Was ok but tint was off not for all skin types I am fairly light.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to apply without needing additional moisture.</li>
            <li>but the tint works perfectly on my skin in the winter when I am pale and in the summer when I have more color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it as a primer, and that&#x27;s working out fine.</li>
            <li>Might work fine for oily skins.</li>
            <li>It sort of settles into fine lines and is not that smooth going on.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for the person who wears little make up.  </li>
            <li>but this is no longer available for the tinted.</li>
            <li>(it is oil free, but if you wash your hands after you apply it, the water beads up like it</li>
            <li>It gives you THREE benefits in one tube (which by the way can be put in your carry on on the plane since it is only 3.2 ounces--another great benefit):  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an overall great product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, I first got it from my plastic surgeon, whom I trust impeccably with my skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, the Image products are the best products I&#x27;ve found for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The product is light, absorbs quickly and provides all day sun protection for your face&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and silky and the blends in very well!!</li>
            <li>This product really is great for any skin tone and it makes a great primer, making my usually oily skin not shiny, but dewey and makes my make up last all day!</li>
            <li>It  was mailed quickly and I received it within 3 days.</li>
            <li>Used old formula for 3 years, this is my first tube on new formula and having great results</li>
            <li>I do miss the tint of the old formula, but this one provides more of a \\&quot;dewy\\</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to see that I could still get the old formula.  </li>
            <li>Probably great for someone young, with smooth average skin.</li>
            <li>, it is very light and super sheer coverage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dark and I have fair skin.</li>
            <li>I first discovered this at a local salon and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel of this moisturizer and it does not look chalky at all - even though it is a physical sunblock product.</li>
            <li>I love this product but you can only buy it through a dermatologist&#x27;s office, spa, or a consultant.  </li>
            <li>Also, someone else&#x27;s review said their skin was too dry to use this, try using a Vitamin C serum on your skin first, then if you have to, another moisturizer, and then this on the top.</li>
            <li>Wish it had a little better cover to all my age spots!  </li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and professional.</li>
            <li>I guess everyone has a different experience :) I did return and get a full refund back.</li>
            <li>but I must say now that I&#x27;m using it, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating, leaves your skin looking and feeling dewy &amp; youthful.  </li>
            <li>it does make face really greasy</li>
            <li>If you are buying this product for its high zinc, you will no longer be getting that benefit from this product.</li>
            <li>Having rosacea, I&#x27;m grateful for the high SPF also.</li>
            <li>using it for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I ordered two of these because I do not like the new formula.  </li>
            <li>I understand, we live out west where your skin turns into leather in 2 months.</li>
            <li>I really liked this moisturizer initially and bought it quite a few times because the zinc oxide in the product was 18%.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking tan color.</li>
            <li>More times than I can count I have tried to squeeze a small amount out to have a bunch come out because it is so watery.  </li>
            <li>I have super dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use this product everyday, it is an easy way to remember to protect your skin.  </li>
            <li>This SPF moisturizer took me a very long time to find (no white cast with high zinc and does not go on super greasy).</li>
            <li>It was very high for an SPF moisturizer and this tinted version does not leave a white cast unlike the non-tinted version.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just surprised the zinc percentage is not posted with the details of the products on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The image shows the old packaging</li>
            <li>This product was no different than what they would have sold but it was soooo much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I had previously used the one with a dark tint (that just made my medium skin look healthily tanned, not dark) but how it&#x27;s a lighter foundation-like formulation.  </li>
            <li>Changed the formula but still works for sensitive skin - this is the only sunscreen my skin will tolerate.</li>
            <li>It might be a good color match for the ladies at the spa that do the skin peels that never ever want you to go outside, but for someone who likes to pick up a little color it is not really a good tinted moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am extremely pale and when I first put this on I panicked, because even after I massaged it into my skin, it looked like my face had a tan.</li>
            <li>and when I first saw the color I figured this wouldn&#x27;t work on my pale skin, but it somehow blends in to every skin type and color, even my friends with olive skin use it.</li>
            <li>The last formula was dark, but when it rubbed in it made you look like you had a tan and made my skin look really even.  </li>

            <li> it is hard to get out of the tube and when you have to squeeze hard, too much comes out.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little to oily to handle this product.</li>
            <li> It is all you need in the summer--or all year round--if you are not into heavy makeup.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am extremely pale and when I first put this on I panicked, because even after I massaged it into my skin, it looked like my face had a tan. I used my regular foundation and powder, though and you couldn&#x27;t even tell. This product really is great for any skin tone and it makes a great primer, making my usually oily skin not shiny, but dewey and makes my make up last all day!</li>
            <li> Changed the formula but still works for sensitive skin - this is the only sunscreen my skin will tolerate. Used old formula for 3 years, this is my first tube on new formula and having great results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because I wanted to let consumers know that the zinc oxide content has changed for this product. I really liked this moisturizer initially and bought it quite a few times because the zinc oxide in the product was 18%. It was very high for an SPF moisturizer and this tinted version does not leave a white cast unlike the non-tinted version. This SPF moisturizer took me a very long time to find (no white cast with high zinc and does not go on super greasy). Unfortunately, when I received the a recent order of the product, the ingredients (drug facts) were not included on the back like it did on the old bottle. I went to their site and to my disappointment, the zinc oxide for the tinted moisturizer is just a mere 6% ([...] If you are buying this product for its high zinc, you will no longer be getting that benefit from this product. The non-tinted, hydrating formula still contains the 18% but this is no longer available for the tinted. I&#x27;m just surprised the zinc percentage is not posted with the details of the products on Amazon. I&#x27;m now giving it 3 stars as, in my opinion, it lost a very important feature.</li>
            <li> This is a fab product. I have been using Image for around two years, and love it. Although this Moisturizer could be a bit darker tinted for me, the quality, the way it feels when wearing, and the protection is incredible, and the reason I continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these because I do not like the new formula.  The image shows the old packaging so I was very excited to see that I could still get the old formula.  It is actually the new formula, and while it feels \\&quot;silky\\&quot; it also feels very heavy and synthetic.  (it is oil free, but if you wash your hands after you apply it, the water beads up like it would if you had just rubbed oil onto your hands)  it is a little weird and even worse it makes my skin break out.&lt;br /&gt;Last, it is very light and super sheer coverage.  The last formula was dark, but when it rubbed in it made you look like you had a tan and made my skin look really even.  It might be a good color match for the ladies at the spa that do the skin peels that never ever want you to go outside, but for someone who likes to pick up a little color it is not really a good tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Worse, I paid a lot to get the product shipped to me, and now they want me to pay for my own postage to return it.  I wish I had not bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;Since I was stuck with 3 bottle of it, I decided to give it a try.  It took a while for my skin to really adjust to (I have never used cream this thick before) but I must say now that I&#x27;m using it, I really like it. I&#x27;m into my 3rd tube at this point, and it looking like I will order it again.  I do miss the tint of the old formula, but this one provides more of a \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; look.  Overall, the Image products are the best products I&#x27;ve found for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and silky and the blends in very well!! &amp;#34;I am a licensed Esthetician and Image is one of my favorite product lines!</li>
            <li> Wish it had a little better cover to all my age spots!  Is there a darker version of this product?</li>
            <li> I love image cosmetic and just recently started buying it on line through amazon (less expensive &amp; convenient) and same quality is there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is perfect for everyday: great moisturizer, evens the skin tone since it has a bit of tint and has SPF35.</li>
            <li> too brown for me. I have color 1 in Cliniuque, if it helps.</li>
            <li> They have changed the formulation.  I had previously used the one with a dark tint (that just made my medium skin look healthily tanned, not dark) but how it&#x27;s a lighter foundation-like formulation.  Don&#x27;t like it at all.  Have switched to Olala - best tinted sunscreen I have ever used, including the Image one that I liked.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this tinted moisturizer since I have very pale skin.  However I read some reviews that said don&#x27;t let the tint scare you, it blends well...I&#x27;m glad I tried it out!  It does not leave my skin oily but does moisturize well and the tint actually helps with some of my redness so I love it!  Having rosacea, I&#x27;m grateful for the high SPF also.</li>
            <li> Was ok but tint was off not for all skin types I am fairly light. It was visible and streaked ... I did keep using it because of the cost!</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this product. I have very dry skin and it was easy to apply without needing additional moisture. The one drawback was the color. It&#x27;s dark and I have fair skin. I mix it with another tinted moisturizer in a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> Ormedic line caused a robust allergic reaction and it was a nightmare trying to obtain a product return/reimbursement. I could not obtain one.</li>
            <li> The product is light, absorbs quickly and provides all day sun protection for your face&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Although I did not keep the product, due to the fact that it was not needed for my skin type.  The service was excellent.  Delivery was quick and professional. I would recommend this seller for skincare products.</li>
            <li> I have super dry sensitive skin and when I first saw the color I figured this wouldn&#x27;t work on my pale skin, but it somehow blends in to every skin type and color, even my friends with olive skin use it. I highly recommend this product, I first got it from my plastic surgeon, whom I trust impeccably with my skin. She would only carry the very best, and this came from her spa. Highly recommended. Also, someone else&#x27;s review said their skin was too dry to use this, try using a Vitamin C serum on your skin first, then if you have to, another moisturizer, and then this on the top. I understand, we live out west where your skin turns into leather in 2 months.</li>
            <li> it is hard to get out of the tube and when you have to squeeze hard, too much comes out. I also did not expect it to be so watery.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this at a local salon and fell in love with it.  It is perfect for the person who wears little make up.  It gives you THREE benefits in one tube (which by the way can be put in your carry on on the plane since it is only 3.2 ounces--another great benefit):  it is a moisturizer that goes on smoothly and lightly; it is a sun protector with an SPF of 30; and it provides the PERFECT tint of color which evens out the coloring on your skin.  I don&#x27;t know how they do it but the tint works perfectly on my skin in the winter when I am pale and in the summer when I have more color.</li>
            <li> This is guaranteed the best product. Sunscreen to protect you without making you feel oily, WHILE keeping your face looking tan without the damage. I use this as a foundation under my Smashbox halo powder and NARS illuminator cream and walk out the door. Its the best thing for your money.</li>
            <li> I love Image products and the tinted moisturiser is great.</li>
            <li> Used after cleansing in morning.  A  wonderful light moisturizer with a hint of color to use alone or under a light foundation.  I love the feel of this moisturizer and it does not look chalky at all - even though it is a physical sunblock product.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for the summer - it&#x27;s tinted so I don&#x27;t have to put makeup on if I don&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little to oily to handle this product. The color is great though, it made me look I had a tan!</li>
            <li> Very natural looking tan color. Very hydrating, leaves your skin looking and feeling dewy &amp; youthful.  Refered to this product by an esthetician, bought my second bottle now.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Excellent sunscreen and the tint makes my skin look so healthy. I no longer wear foundation!</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday, it is an easy way to remember to protect your skin.  It  was mailed quickly and I received it within 3 days. I will buy here again.</li>
            <li> While there is nothing wrong with this product for an average user, it&#x27;s not quite as moisturizing as I wanted. I&#x27;ve been using it as a primer, and that&#x27;s working out fine. Probably great for someone young, with smooth average skin. It sort of settles into fine lines and is not that smooth going on.</li>
            <li> Its too dry for a regular skin type.Might work fine for oily skins. Not the best product for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> I love this product but you can only buy it through a dermatologist&#x27;s office, spa, or a consultant.  This product was no different than what they would have sold but it was soooo much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love this product line but this tinted moisturizer was the worst! It left orange streaks on my face and felt yucky! I prefer the hydrating moisturizer. I have fair skin so I don&#x27;t know if it has something to do with that. When I read the reviews on both I decided I would try this one. I guess everyone has a different experience :) I did return and get a full refund back.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful night time moisturizer. You must use a small amount for day wear. It&#x27;s an overall great product.</li>
            <li> More times than I can count I have tried to squeeze a small amount out to have a bunch come out because it is so watery.  I have olive colored skin and went with one of the mid level tones but it was too dark.  If I hit the gym later in the day and would start sweating the stuff would bleed onto my shirt or stain my towel like I was wearing heavy foundation.  Really disappointed with the product and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this tinted moisturizer.  I use it for makeup all summer long.  It does not clog pores and gives a nice tan hue to your skin.  It is all you need in the summer--or all year round--if you are not into heavy makeup.</li>
            <li> Love this for the tint...sometimes I feel like I can go out without any makeup just the subtle tint from this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;But it does make face really greasy</li>
