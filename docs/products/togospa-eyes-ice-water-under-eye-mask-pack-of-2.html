    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I read about these things in a magazine and Jenny McCarthy said she used them when traveling. I put them to the ultimate test this week, when my husband (who is in the Air Force) left for a 7 month deployment. I cried for a good 24 hours straight. The next morning I looked like I was in a boxing match. Put these babies on for a little while, while I laid in bed watching tv and they worked like a charm! Took away the redness and puffiness. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> The area underneath my eyes tends to be dry and undereye cream didn&#x27;t do anything for me, so I thought I&#x27;d try undereye patches.  I put them on before bedtime and leave them on all night.  They start of a spongey texture and in the morning, they are a dried, thin layer of what it used to be.  When I was using these about every other night, my undereye area seemed to look more hydrated and the lines less noticeable.  And the price is reasonable too.</li>
            <li> I just purchased these a few weeks ago and love them! They don&#x27;t take care of the dark circles but work great for puffiness! Purchasing 2nd order today.</li>
            <li> With shipping they are about $7.50 a treatment, and I only have tried it once... but it didn&#x27;t do much.... waste of time and money.....</li>
            <li> I use the product as needed and follow instructions. No others used. no comment. It gives a cool sensation. The product did not help with puffiness or redness as much as I had hoped it would,</li>
            <li> I saw these on the Today Show. I love them. They remove my morning puffiness and my allergy related red/black morning eyes. The slimy, thin strips are cut to fit the curve of the under eye and crows feet area. I love the cooling feel of the product. Once removed the skin feels clean and regenerated. I bought both the Ice Water and Pomegranete gels but I can&#x27;t tell any difference in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: they do work to remove puffiness and discoloration&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Price...ridiculously overpriced and only sold in salons, actual product website and Amazon</li>
            <li> I tried this product, it smells really refreshing, I see a difference in my puffiness, it&#x27;s going down. I love this I thought I was at a spa.</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing but I really did not notice any difference on puffiness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels great after a long flight or a stressful day! ;)</li>
            <li> So refreshing and a great way to start my morning!  I look rested and energized.  Would highly recommend for anyone</li>
            <li> Love it after a rough night with my toddler.it helps my dark circles</li>
            <li> These are okay.  I had another brand but can&#x27;t sem to find it a I can&#x27;t remember the name of  them!!! These are okay though</li>
            <li> I really like these pads. Gooey and slippery at first. I recommend lying down for at least 5 min to give them time to adhere and settle in. I slept with them on last night and they stayed in place.. Key is to get them under the eyeand not move them too much. I noticed a difference this morning after having a really salty dinner last. NO PUFFINESS.. Doesnt help with dark circles ( for me) but i have a great under eye concealer anyway.. Delivery was on time and package was intact. Good Prime seller.</li>
            <li> Did not help at all its a waste of money i put them before i went to bed and i seen no change at all when i woke up</li>
            <li> These are simply awesome...feel so good especially after placing in the fridge.</li>
            <li> Love these!  Wish they sold them in a bigger pack!  Get rid of puffy eyes! Use them when I fly too!  Might freak people out a bit but who cares</li>
            <li> I really like these.  Allergies make your eyes itchy.  This really helps.  I put them in the refrigerator and keep them cold.  I gave them to a friend who was flying to Australia for two weeks.  The first thing she told me was, &amp;#34;I love these and where can I get more&amp;#34;.  The flight is 13 hours.  Good work on these put them in the fridge.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  I work on a computer all day long, and sometimes eyes get tired and puffy.  I put these on, lie down for a little whiel, and the puffiness is gone.  I love these!</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions precisely, was hoping to finally reduce the under eye&lt;br /&gt;puffiness that I wake up with every morning. Total waste of time and money, absolutely&lt;br /&gt;would never buy again.</li>
            <li> They are cooling and somewhat soothing but I didn&#x27;t see any real results.</li>
            <li> I love putting these on in the morning! Instant relief for swollen eyes! I also took them with me when I went overseas recently, and they made the first few mornings a lot better!</li>
            <li> Imagine yourself having a day where your eyes are swollen, sore &amp; puffy. Nothing you do can help sooth it even though your under eye area is red and wrinkled. All of a sudden this wave of cool refreshingly overpowers your skin and before you know it, you&#x27;re senses are taken over by the MOST amazing combination of collagen, vitamin e &amp; other great ingredients to not only make you feel better (goodbye allergy eyes) but in my experience actually help get rid of those fine lines! It&#x27;s also my only can&#x27;t fail item on nights full of insomnia. I take out a chilled pair of eyedews, put them one &amp; go to bed sleeping in them. By the time the gel pairs dry out and my skin has absorbed its contents, I&#x27;m fast asleep! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t just take my word for it - go to the official Eyedews website Eyedews dot come and see why people &amp; celebrities alike love Eyedews. PLUS you can order directly from the manufacturers, and get Eyedews for much less than $40 ;)</li>
            <li> I am not sure they really do much good for the eyes considering how much they cost to use but maybe.</li>
            <li> After using these pads, my eyes felt refreshed.  But I wanted more than that.  My dark areas and bagginess is not extreme, but I was expecting some difference.  I experienced none.</li>
            <li> Love these eye gels - great way to relax. Smooth and efficient transaction. Thank you!</li>
