            <li>Goes on light and does the trick!</li>
            <li>It has the ingredients I want but more importantly, it does not contain the ones that I don&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li>and I have even been able to use on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream is most gentle and very effective.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals in great in all their products.</li>
            <li>Huge difference in my skin</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, not greasy</li>
            <li>So far so good - no reactions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used different ones before but bare minerals has the best eye cream I have tried.</li>
            <li>I use it day and night for the full effect.</li>
            <li>About 20-30 minutes after application of the eye cream, I noticed that my vision was becoming very blurry.</li>
            <li>Hmmm... I love bareMinerals brand, I have pretty much switched over almost exclusively to their products (still in transition with makeup).  </li>
            <li>At first, I freaked out.  </li>
            <li>I found it as good as the more expensive creams I was using.  </li>
            <li>This is the very first eye cream I&#x27;ve ever owned (I&#x27;m 24 years old)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for me to find a good product to use without having sensitivity or burning.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li>but it really seems to give me the results I would want from an eye</li>
            <li>It is very soothing to my skin too.</li>
            <li>hydrate the eyes, haha.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating, and after letting it dry for a couple of minutes, my makeup goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>i do not experience sensitivity or burning and my eye lids are left feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>, I am highly allergic to all others.</li>
            <li>No issues so far, I can&#x27;t really say that lines have minimalized for sure - usually I only notice such things once I run out of a product.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing but made my sensitive eyes burn.</li>
            <li>, I am 35 and still had breakouts - I rarely  have breakouts anymore, so I am a big supporter of them.  </li>
            <li>Husband with very sensitive skin uses also with no problem.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It helps my eye shadow apply much easier and last longer.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use any products with perfume and this cream doesn&#x27;t have any of that.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;old looking\\</li>
            <li>I am young looking and noticed the area around my eyes was pretty dry and in my opioning</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed much of a difference, except it isn&#x27;t as dry.  </li>
            <li>I use Bare Escentuals&#x27; mineral makeup line, so I figured this eye cream would work well under the makeup.  </li>
            <li>I did some research online before deciding on Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>I have used Bare Minerals powder products for years but not their creams.  </li>
            <li>I will use the whole jar before I add any other comment.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals in the only product I can use</li>
            <li>I put a little dot of it under each eye and gently rub into my skin.</li>

            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a very small amount of this product for it to be useful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really liked the eye cream. I use morning and night time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different ones before but bare minerals has the best eye cream I have tried. This will last all day and helps hydrate your eyes as it states on the product</li>
            <li> I love it. Works great for me</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, not greasy</li>
            <li> My eye lids are usually dry and flaky. It&#x27;s hard for me to find a good product to use without having sensitivity or burning. This product is amazing! i do not experience sensitivity or burning and my eye lids are left feeling so soft and smooth. I also apply this product before I apply eye shadow. It helps my eye shadow apply much easier and last longer.</li>
            <li> This is the very first eye cream I&#x27;ve ever owned (I&#x27;m 24 years old) and I already feel that I will not ever purchase another eye cream. I&#x27;ve actually had this sitting at my house for probably a year and never used it until about a month ago. I am sure glad I dug this out of a the crevices in my makeup bag and began using it.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a very small amount of this product for it to be useful. I put a little dot of it under each eye and gently rub into my skin. It really moisturizes the skin under my eyes. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my brain playing a trick on me, but I do see (and have seen) a rib of a lightening of the dark circles under my eyes. This cream also helps with puffiness (either from the morning or a night of crying).&lt;br /&gt;I do not really know how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; bare mineral products are, but I do like this product and recommend buying it. It is the only non-organic product I use on my face but it really seems to give me the results I would want from an eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  1. Supposedly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;  2. Moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;  3. Diminishes dark circles and puffiness&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  1. (Maybe) not natural&lt;br /&gt;  2. A bit pricey for the amount of product you get (but it will last you a very long time, so in the long run, it&#x27;s not really that much)</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use any products with perfume and this cream doesn&#x27;t have any of that. It is very soothing to my skin too.</li>
            <li> For the most part, I like this product.  It is very hydrating, and after letting it dry for a couple of minutes, my makeup goes on smoothly.  However, the moisturizer seems to run into my eyes.  About 20-30 minutes after application of the eye cream, I noticed that my vision was becoming very blurry. At first, I freaked out.  It took a few days for me to notice the pattern and realize what was happening.  My eyes do not burn, but definitely becomes blurry.  To avoid the cream running into my eyes, I started applying it to my upper lids just before going to sleep.  However, then I woke up with puffy upper lids.  In summation, I LOVE the way the cream feels on my lower lids.  Since it runs into my eyes, I gave it only 4 stars.  I continue tol use Aubrey Organics Lumessence on my upper lids while using this product on my lower lids.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals in the only product I can use, I am highly allergic to all others. Bare Minerals in great in all their products. Also love buying it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like how it goes on and its not greasy.  I have not used it but 3 days so a little early to give it 5 stars.  I am hoping it helps with dark circles. I will use the whole jar before I add any other comment.</li>
            <li> I use Bare Escentuals&#x27; mineral makeup line, so I figured this eye cream would work well under the makeup.  No issues so far, I can&#x27;t really say that lines have minimalized for sure - usually I only notice such things once I run out of a product.  I use it day and night for the full effect.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.  So far so good - no reactions.</li>
            <li> My wife was not a big fan of this product.  it seemed to be working for a few days and then it made her breakout</li>
            <li> I did some research online before deciding on Bare Minerals Renew and Hydrate Eye Cream. Since I am 30, I really just wanted an eye cream that would be hydrating in the winter (although I use eye cream year round). This one had great reviews and I am glad I purchased it. Goes on light and does the trick!</li>
            <li> This is the best eye hydration i have found that is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Very good product and good price !</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing but made my sensitive eyes burn. Probably should not has used this on my eyes since the packaging and container arrived unsealed. Not sure if this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Hmmm... I love bareMinerals brand, I have pretty much switched over almost exclusively to their products (still in transition with makeup).  Huge difference in my skin, I am 35 and still had breakouts - I rarely  have breakouts anymore, so I am a big supporter of them.  I am young looking and noticed the area around my eyes was pretty dry and in my opioning \\&quot;old looking\\&quot; so I found this eye cream.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed much of a difference, except it isn&#x27;t as dry.  No big \\&quot;wow\\&quot; or noticeable difference.  I&#x27;m undecided whether I should try another eye cream from another brand or just stick to this one?  But it has done its \\&quot;said\\&quot; job...  hydrate the eyes, haha.</li>
            <li> Loved it ! It feels so soothing when I apply it around my eyes. Will continue using it from now on.</li>
            <li> Its a great product. I saved a few dollars by purchasing it thru Amazon.  I can feel and see the difference in the morning especially when I apply my makeup. The lines around my eyes are not as apparent and the skin feels softer and no more flakiness.</li>
            <li> This is a great product in their skincare line. It has the ingredients I want but more importantly, it does not contain the ones that I don&#x27;t!  I believe in this company and their products. I have been using their makeup for over a decade. This eye cream is most gentle and very effective. Glides on smoothly, not greasy or shiny. Husband with very sensitive skin uses also with no problem. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works great. Item came promptly with no problems. The eye cream is creamy and absorbs well. I have very sensitive skin and this does not bother it.</li>
            <li> I have used Bare Minerals powder products for years but not their creams.  My daughter recommend this and I tried it.  I found it as good as the more expensive creams I was using.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> One of the few eye creams I can use without an allergic reaction.  It is very hydrating and I have even been able to use on my eyelids.  This seller is great item arrived quickly.  Also item costs less than I was paying at a TV shopping show that sells Bare Minerals.  Will purchase again.</li>
