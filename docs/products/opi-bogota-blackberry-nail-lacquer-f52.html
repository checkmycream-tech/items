            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful for evening, but it&#x27;s mainstream enough to be okay for work too.</li>
            <li>It is widely regarded as the best polish on the market.</li>
            <li>Also makes touch ups easy.</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 bottles and they all arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to remember off-beat names from OPI.,</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful, shimmering, deep reddish-plum polish.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful color especially at the holiday season.  </li>
            <li>Such a beautiful wine color with a glow</li>
            <li>I love this nail color brand and has never failed me!  </li>
            <li>It is a deep burgundy color and is great for winter styles.  </li>
            <li>In my humble opinion this is the BEST nail polish color ever invented!  </li>
            <li>I found this color a few years ago, and it is  my favorite, it just makes your nails so beautiful.</li>
            <li>I love this nail color so much!</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Rich and glossy without screaming look at me.  </li>
            <li>Looks great on shorter nails as well as long nails!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite classy colors, when I want my nails to look refined and elegant.</li>
            <li>Have never had a color I enjoyed so much</li>
            <li>This color is stunning,I first used it in the early 90&#x27;s, I&#x27;m a bartender, everyone loves my color, very sexy.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful choice if you&#x27;re looking for a deep red.</li>
            <li>I have worn it through the winter with deep colors and in the warm weather with pastels.  </li>
            <li>It is just gorgeous and is just right for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a deeper color, more like blood red or maybe even deeper.</li>

            <li>I first saw this color on my daughters toe nails.</li>

            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The delivery is much quicker than I thought, and of course the color is fab!</li>
            <li>And OPI is always so easy to use and lasts so long.  </li>
            <li>There are definite pink undertones to this polish, so probably better suited to cool skin tones.</li>
            <li>If you like dark frosty nail polish, you&#x27;ll love this one.  </li>
            <li>but I have other polishes that are very similar to it due to my quest to find the perfect vixen red.</li>
            <li>This is a fun shade of red!</li>
            <li>it looks like a crisp candy apple red color.  </li>
            <li>Not too dark or too light.  </li>
            <li>Pretty red with a hint of purple!</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s fresh and dry</li>
            <li>it is rich but not too dark.</li>
            <li>This has been a favorite of mine since the late 1990&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This is the #1 lacquer for nails used by professional manicurists in this city.  </li>
            <li>I use it for touch ups, between professional manicures, or take it with me, in case they don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li>Like this so much, will come back for it</li>
            <li>deep rich dark raspberry with red undertones...</li>
            <li>it is a little dark for summer, but Blackberries are good all year round, Ha Ha.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it a long time.</li>
            <li> OPI lasts and stays longer than other polishes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is that the polish gets too thick about 2/3 of the way down into the bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my holiday go to red color, you will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you like dark polish, you will not be disappointed in this color.</li>
            <li> you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become difficult to find in salons, and I believe it&#x27;s either already been discontinued, or it&#x27;s being fazed out gradually.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was not to be found in any brick and mortar store in our neighborhood.</li>

            <li> In my humble opinion this is the BEST nail polish color ever invented!  It is just gorgeous and is just right for everyday wear.  LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I find this color goes well with pink,wine, and even red tones.  I would recommend this product.  Easy to remember off-beat names from OPI.,</li>
            <li> What can you say about OPI?  It is widely regarded as the best polish on the market. Everyone loves their great colors and clever names!</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful wine color with a glow, it goes with every outfit no matter what color it is.  I have worn it through the winter with deep colors and in the warm weather with pastels.  It looks greatl with all of them.  Have never had a color I enjoyed so much, it&#x27;s perfect!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite color for my pedicure! Pretty red with a hint of purple! Awesome color to use all year long.</li>
            <li> great color looks great on and goes with a lot of my clothes. Nice fall or winter color. Covers great too.</li>
            <li> Bogata Blackberry is a beautiful shade for fall/winter.  And OPI is always so easy to use and lasts so long.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Looks great on my toes!  Beautiful color - good price. Rich and glossy without screaming look at me.  OPI lasts and stays longer than other polishes I&#x27;ve used.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift. Buying nail polish on line is tricky at best. You never know how it will truly look when you get it. This time however was great. She said it arrived on time well packaged and when she used it the polish just glides on and wears well and is a beautiful color. A great purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a fun shade of red! Looks great on shorter nails as well as long nails! It has become a favorite in my house!</li>
            <li> Love the color. Got it in days. Perfect</li>
            <li> The delivery is much quicker than I thought, and of course the color is fab! Like this so much, will come back for it</li>
