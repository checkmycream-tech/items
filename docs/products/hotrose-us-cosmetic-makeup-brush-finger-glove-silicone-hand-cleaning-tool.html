            <li>i love it!...</li>
            <li>she has a great video on how to clean your brushes with thes items.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>She said they do the job that they were meant to do and for the price she was even more thrilled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  This does NOT do an excellent job deep cleaning large brushes...</li>
            <li>Very useful and does the job for my make up brushes</li>
            <li>Love these I just hot them</li>
            <li>Perfect for small brushes.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend says it helps her clean the brush faster.</li>
            <li>So its cool I guess</li>
            <li>Leaves my brusher super clean</li>
            <li>Easy to use and cleans my brushes pretty well.</li>
            <li>If you use your hand to clean your brushes well this is going to be useful to you.</li>
            <li>This is a great little tool for Washing your make up brushes.</li>
            <li>It absolutely cuts the time it takes to clean a brush (thoroughly and deeply) in half...or more!</li>
            <li>it does much, much better with the smaller brushes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for small and medium sized brushes.</li>
            <li>Now, granted, I know close to absolutely nothing about make up</li>
            <li>Cleans my brushes very well.</li>
            <li>Cleaned my brushes really well.</li>
            <li>Got it in lightning fast time.</li>
            <li>The silicone is easy to clean afterwards and it&#x27;s so small you can store it in your make up bag.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t afford the more expensive gloves and matts that other companies make, this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I figured that it would be a good idea for her to have something to clean her brushes when they get dirty.</li>
            <li>Ordered 2 hot pink and looks exactly like picture.</li>
            <li>It has two types of ridged areas to clean both larger face brushes and smaller detail brushes.</li>
            <li>So, if your looking for an item to clean all your brushes, purchase this nifty little silicon brush cleaner.</li>
            <li>It is ok, but is very small.</li>
            <li>With just a few swishes of the brush and they are as clean as you bought them.</li>
            <li>I used to just wash them over and over until the water ran clear, but you can see that the round knobbies and straight lines across this item gets between the brush hairs and cleans them in no time!</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it does well cleaning the tips of large brushes.</li>
            <li>I like this very much, can get a bit messy, but it does get the job done.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like works well. Gave one as a gift she also likes.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this item for my wife. She loves make up so I figured that it would be a good idea for her to have something to clean her brushes when they get dirty. I found these while searching for items for cleaning her brushes and placed an order for her. Now, granted, I know close to absolutely nothing about make up but when they came in the mail she said she had been wanting them for a long time so I was happy. She said they do the job that they were meant to do and for the price she was even more thrilled. So, if your looking for an item to clean all your brushes, purchase this nifty little silicon brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> It is ok, but is very small.</li>
            <li> Cleans my brushes very well. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Ordered July 31st, arrived Aug 10 within&lt;br /&gt;specified time frame. Ordered 2 hot pink and looks exactly like picture. I have the popular expensive brand glove but wanted a smaller alternative for traveling and for when I only have a few brushes to wash. Works great. I have thin fingers and can insert two and it feels snuggled.</li>
            <li> Great product! Use it daily!</li>
            <li> Cleaned my brushes really well. It&#x27;s good for small and medium sized brushes.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend says it helps her clean the brush faster. So its cool I guess</li>
            <li> This device works like magic!!! I&#x27;ve cleaned my brushes before and they never looked like it did when I cleaned it with finger glove. With just a few swishes of the brush and they are as clean as you bought them.</li>
            <li> Very useful and does the job for my make up brushes</li>
            <li> Loved it!! Cleans the brushes great. Got it in lightning fast time.</li>
            <li> Wife was happy to get the item.</li>
            <li> It does the job. Easy to use and cleans my brushes pretty well.</li>
            <li> Perfect color ! My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> Love these I just hot them and I found out about them thru this girl on YouTube she has a great video on how to clean your brushes with thes items. Her link at you tube is genuiniebeautyxox. Her name is Jocelyn Marie.</li>
            <li> REALLY GREAT DUPE !!! The grooves aren&#x27;t as hard , but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> I love it ! Leaves my brusher super clean</li>
            <li> If you use your hand to clean your brushes well this is going to be useful to you. However, i find that this is too small, i wished its a little bit bigger because my hand still gets soaked from the water. Perfect for small brushes. Still does the job though</li>
            <li> I like this very much, can get a bit messy, but it does get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool for Washing your make up brushes. It has two types of ridged areas to clean both larger face brushes and smaller detail brushes. The silicone is easy to clean afterwards and it&#x27;s so small you can store it in your make up bag. If you can&#x27;t afford the more expensive gloves and matts that other companies make, this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> Arrived later than expected but otherwise as advertised!</li>
            <li> I had NO idea that there was an invention to help wash makeup brushes until I received one of these with a makeup brush that I ordered! NOW I wonder how I ever lived without it. It absolutely cuts the time it takes to clean a brush (thoroughly and deeply) in half...or more! I used to just wash them over and over until the water ran clear, but you can see that the round knobbies and straight lines across this item gets between the brush hairs and cleans them in no time! I am very impressed and very happy! I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This does NOT do an excellent job deep cleaning large brushes...it does much, much better with the smaller brushes.  On the other hand, it does well cleaning the tips of large brushes.</li>
            <li> i love it!...Thank You</li>
