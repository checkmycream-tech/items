            <li>but I was in for a pleasant surprise when it arrived.</li>
            <li>these bottles are any good they smell like alcohol</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a good cologne</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>Scent lasts a good 6+ hours.</li>
            <li>No Aventus but still a good scent.</li>
            <li>Creed is superior to a refined nose.</li>
            <li>every time I wear it I receive a TON of compliments asking what cologne I&#x27;m wearing or that I smell really good.  </li>
            <li>Nice packaging with great price.</li>
            <li>Good cologne</li>
            <li>Have received a ton of compliments from people who hug me, asking what I&#x27;m wearing that smells so good.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very nice on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne and have been getting lots of compliments, great scent for spring/summer.  </li>
            <li>Smells so good at a nice price.</li>
            <li>Very good value and great fast service.</li>
            <li>Smells great, strong, and masculine.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my decision to try the Insurrection Pure II.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with Insurrection Pure II.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing.</li>
            <li>People compare the amazing creed to this insurrection .</li>
            <li>Just amazing</li>
            <li>got this bottle, amazing packaging btw</li>
            <li>amazing, I think it is a bit sweeter than Creed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m butchering the description but believe me when i say that it smells nice.</li>
            <li>it has a lot of creed aventus vibe, but on his own way&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own Creed Aventus</li>
            <li>Fast delivery..smells awesome!!</li>
            <li>but I thought it smelled nice.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t worry about comparing to Aventus, just look at it as its own juice.</li>
            <li>It smells great, has a clean fresh scent to it, it&#x27;s got great longevity and adequate projection, plus, it&#x27;s a good compliment getter too!  </li>
            <li>If you can get it cheap, it is a good buy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aventus is way more bright, the pineapple and apple stays upfront way longer with the smokiness in there, I say Aventus is dirtier than IP, however the pineapple and apple are more prominent</li>
            <li>And I came across this nice looking bottle, I&#x27;m gonna give it try for sure, just by the packaging and the bottles design.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a huge deal!</li>
            <li>, I am hopping it will project better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never worn too many colognes in my life.</li>
            <li>I hear Aventus is more smoky.  </li>
            <li>Great price for such a good Cologne</li>
            <li>Sooo many complements when I wear this cologne.</li>
            <li>but it just is not as smokey as aventus, for me i like that better</li>
            <li>Most could not tell the difference and</li>
            <li>most who never heard of either scent chose insurrection as the better scent.  </li>
            <li>love the smell i never smell creed adventus</li>
            <li>but i do love this cologne</li>
            <li>yeah baby &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Love this cologne</li>
            <li>At this point I have a collection of 30+ colognes including most of the populars from Polo,Armani,Burberry,Bvlgari and so on</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Ladies love this.</li>
            <li>Do not have courage to mix use with Aventus but sure will save my Aventus usages.</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>on there will be buying more soon</li>
            <li>I think I like it better than Aventus!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>love the price!&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li>The scent is just OK, the projection is OK and longevity is OK.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, save your money and get something with better quality.</li>
            <li>Why spend $25 on something that just OK.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>but once I got it I was pleased.  </li>
            <li>Great smell thanks again.</li>
            <li>It is a very good Perfume, including its aroma reminds a bit Creed Aventus, only problem here in Brazil, the delivery&lt;br /&gt;was taxed by the IRS, practically the same price of the product, but I liked it and the service from Amazon.com which is very good..</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent, somewhat powdery</li>
            <li>it has very quickly became my go to for many ocassions,</li>
            <li>In greasiness in pure smell well blended and good quality.</li>
            <li>good Aventus mimicer with decent projection and longevity!</li>
            <li>It its special top five of my all time favorite.  </li>
            <li>but I give all the credit to the best $3,695 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li>Fast and good product.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance so much I had to purchase 2!!!</li>
            <li>I got so many complement from this scent, girls love it is a fresh vanilla non gourmet scent.</li>
            <li>I am a female and I brought this insurrection for myself because I really love the way it smells, Great job</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get anything but just strong alcohol smell</li>
            <li>Hands down the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelt</li>
            <li>I have to say that I enjoy Insurrection II</li>
            <li>Liked it so much I ordered another</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh, with pineapple and ash being the most noticeable notes on my skin.  </li>
            <li>But is that quality difference and scent difference worth $300 more?  </li>
            <li>Save another $25 and treat yourself with something your gonna really enjoy.</li>
            <li>Still a great scent that last about 6 hours.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need much to enjoy</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am extremely happy and I&#x27;m praying the Aventus isn&#x27;t much better because I might be tempted to buy it.</li>
            <li>thanks!!!</li>
            <li>In fact, I receive more compliments wearing Insurrection Pure II than I do with Creed&#x27;s Aventus!  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the cost!</li>
            <li>I wanted a more mature cologne that had a better silage and holding power.</li>
            <li>Pure quite a bit more than Aventus.</li>
            <li>Think that Aventus will give you more than Pure?</li>
            <li>I also have Aventus which I want to save for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the fresh smoky smell.</li>
            <li>What makes this such a good buy is that you get a lot of product for literally a fraction of the cost of Aventus, with some reduction in richness.  </li>
            <li>Aventus is my all time favorite and this reminds me so much of it.</li>
            <li>No bad weaker, just weaker.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for dilute version of Aventus but 10 times cheaper.</li>
            <li>But not bad and worthy $17 or even</li>
            <li>This is a very good cologe last all day long my wife love it</li>
            <li>, It should be only for the shipping, because the packing, bottle and juice,me as a collector I would pay $350 easy!!</li>
            <li>In that sense, it&#x27;s fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Adequate....</li>
            <li>Although the bottle itself is more appealing than the actual smell!</li>
            <li>Good always genuine I am buying almost every two month same cologne 100% pure...</li>
            <li>the real Aventus does, I can smell it on my clothes after a full day of wear, albeit not quite as strong as Aventus stays put.</li>
            <li>For the first 2 hours this scent has a good silage, after that its more like any average cologne.</li>
            <li>This one was a real surprise, and I very much enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>but I had seen many reviews claiming this to be a near identical clone of Creed Aventus.</li>
            <li>and i rarely get complimented on any fragrances i wear.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>and this one has by far gotten the most compliments out of anything I wear..</li>
            <li>I will say that the initial aroma is leathery and tobacco with hints of warm fruit.</li>
            <li>I rarely smell my fragrances but continue getting compliments often.</li>
            <li>While it does smell really close to Creed&#x27;s Aventus, I feel it&#x27;s not as potent or as smoky/woodsy or pineappley as the real deal.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll probably rarely wear.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s rare for me.</li>
            <li>First, while it&#x27;s definitely there, it doesn&#x27;t have as strong of a &amp;#34;dirty ash&amp;#34; note, which is a good thing, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good copy of Aventus, not best, but a good value.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use some distance when you spray because too much in on spot can get you high.  </li>
            <li>Yes, Aventus is a higher quality, more natural fragrance, there is no doubt about that.</li>
            <li>Since making Insurrection Pure my signature scent I&#x27;ve managed to acquire over THIRTEEN different vanerial diseases, some could attribute this to my hatred for condoms and love of cheap backpages  ladies of the evening</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely be buying more, for the price its an affordable way to get the tremendous Creed scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IP is softer more powdery less bright, the smokiness (ashy) is there in a different balance, I am OK with smokiness, but not everyday, so</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the box I was surprised at the high quality packaging and bottle, it rivals houses that cost 2-3 times more.  </li>
            <li>Totally blind buy and very happy.</li>
            <li>Sadly it&#x27;s longevity is not the best.</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely buy another when this one runs out.</li>
            <li>The first day i wore it to work</li>
            <li>Unless you feel you need to say your wearing aventus and are willing to pay  $370 more for virtually the same fragrence</li>
            <li>sure, an initial pineapple scent....</li>
            <li>I am told by several people that the cologne I created for myself is better than this, but I would not hesitate to wear this in a heartbeat if I wasn&#x27;t wearing one of my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells like a much more expensive scent I own: Narciso Rodriguez!</li>
            <li>They manage to capture the essence of the first insurrection.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s still an awesome fragrance on</li>
            <li>Complements first day using it at the office.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the exact scent</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Very clean, masculine scent with a decent staying power.</li>
            <li>I decided to shell out the $3,695 for a bottle and WOW was it worth it!</li>
            <li>It has a familiar opening but dries down to something very unique.</li>
            <li>fast, neat, above average, friendly and good</li>
            <li>I own roughly 30 to 40 different colognes and this one will more than likely just get lost in the bunch and get used once in a blue moon.</li>
            <li>It smells very much like Aventus, so much so that I cant really tell a difference,</li>
            <li>Smells like mature scent, suitable for daily wear.</li>
            <li>Smells good and last quite a long time</li>
            <li>The smokiness of Insurrection Pure&#x27;s scent is ashy-like.</li>
            <li>II Pure a couple of times.</li>
            <li>And why do I prefer Pure?</li>
            <li>I prefer Pure for being a fresher, crisper, sweeter, brighter scent than Aventus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried</li>
            <li>When I heard that Insurrection Pure had surpassed Clive Chrisitians</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what Aventus smells like, but lets just say Insurrection Pure II is not a clone of Aventus</li>
            <li>Which I have a feeling it might be, because all the hype about Insurrection Pure II</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s solely based off of the smell and projection of Insurrection Pure II.</li>
            <li>Insurrection Pure will be just as much as a compliment getter...</li>
            <li>However, for a $24 cologne, it&#x27;s hard to beat the price for a good scent without regard to the label.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t try to describe it too much</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very dissatisfied I would not recommend to buy this</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot for the price</li>
            <li>The Cologne also lasts much like</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Lets get things straight, this is a NICHE fragrance house.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend almost to her knees when I wore this cologne, she really like it and said I&#x27;m keeper.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really judge or compare.</li>
            <li>If you smell it, you may be squirting too much.</li>
            <li>However, I really like IP</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about.</li>
            <li>and I know my juice is real as I compare everything to samples...</li>
            <li>Very close to what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>To be honest it&#x27;s not a big deal, but attention should be paid to a detail such as attaching a label.  </li>
            <li>nice after smell and last long</li>
            <li>Nice smell, but it does not last long</li>
            <li>The Box was much nicer than that of many higher-end colognes I had previously purchased.</li>
            <li>2 dark a lil better because my wife loves it on me.</li>
            <li>Wow, I really, really like the smell of Insurrection Pure.</li>
            <li>I bought the bottle because of a video I saw on Youtube, and while it is not the &amp;#34;Aventus killer&amp;#34; everyone wants it to be, it is definitely very similar and very much worth buying and wearing for what it brings to the table on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>what is the main difference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The difference is minimal, and, I believe, primarily comes from the use of ambergris on the part of Creed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It last just as long if not longer and has better projection than aventus.</li>
            <li>Creed has many of us trapped with their advertising with notions that their colognes were made for Napoleon or the Dali Lhama</li>
            <li>; everyday scent at a much more affordable price.</li>
            <li>It goes on very sweet but tones itself down a lot in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>but right there next to it.</li>
            <li>and I was out looking for a new fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap enough where you can have an extra bottle at work for touch ups. .</li>
            <li>Insurrection Pure II starts off slightly smokey and pineappley, but dries down more fruity, less smokey, more citrusey, less pineappley and more vanillash in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also ordered a sample vial of Aventus ($10 wow!)</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Smells the same almost exactly like aventus</li>
            <li>very close, and you would be hard pressed to tell the difference when not wearing side by side the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great complements, bright pineapple opening, fading to smokey and apple and for me last eight hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow, considering this is a clone, this is still a pretty solid fragrance!  </li>
            <li>The opening is a little different than aventus (more of an alcohol smell).As</li>
            <li>I want to clear some things up.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not the Aventus Killer, but very close and clearly, for the price differential IP is very, very similar.</li>
            <li>Definitely masculine.</li>
            <li>Citrus, Masculine, not over powering, not musky masculine.</li>
            <li>I would never compare this cologne to Creed Aventus because it is nowhere near that quality and class.</li>
            <li>First, don&#x27;t put off buying this because someone says it has below par longevity; Ph balance, skin type (dry vs oily), showering with body wash,  and a host of variables play a part.</li>
            <li>you smell this on one wrist and Aventus on the other, Aventus wins, and you can smell the quality difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, Insurrection Pure is not nearly as smoky a GG&#x27;s aftershave.</li>
            <li>Gino Felino even repped me on the CC after he heard I managed to track down a bottle of this rare elixir.</li>
            <li>I have a large collection of much more expensive colognes but this has become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard all about this &#x27;Aventus&#x27; in the last week or so as I&#x27;ve been researching a new summer scent for myself and came upon this one like (seemingly) everyone else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My guess is that they don&#x27;t use the same concentration of natural oils as Aventus does (and I am supposing they DO use all natural oils).  </li>
            <li>100 % real and authentic colognes and they are a fraction of the price cant go wrong here...</li>
            <li>was considering getting a small decant of Aventus after the first time I compared Aventus and Pure, but after the second time pitting them against each other, I want another bottle of Pure.</li>
            <li>Careful, don&#x27;t apply too much at once or the defining notes become a bit overpowering.</li>
            <li>Then gets generic and way too smokey on the dry down and smells cheap.</li>
            <li>Pure goes on a bit harsh where Aventus drips with a soft quality to it, that cannot be denied.</li>
            <li>The opening of Unpredictable is harsh, like Angel Men kind of harsh, but then smooths out and becomes pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>

            <li> but I was in for a pleasant surprise when it arrived.</li>
            <li> these bottles are any good they smell like alcohol</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a good cologne</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Scent lasts a good 6+ hours.</li>
            <li> No Aventus but still a good scent.</li>
            <li> Creed is superior to a refined nose.</li>
            <li> every time I wear it I receive a TON of compliments asking what cologne I&#x27;m wearing or that I smell really good.  </li>
            <li> Nice packaging with great price.</li>
            <li> Good cologne</li>
            <li> Have received a ton of compliments from people who hug me, asking what I&#x27;m wearing that smells so good.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very nice on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne and have been getting lots of compliments, great scent for spring/summer.  </li>
            <li> Smells so good at a nice price.</li>
            <li> Very good value and great fast service.</li>
            <li> Smells great, strong, and masculine.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my decision to try the Insurrection Pure II.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with Insurrection Pure II.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing.</li>
            <li> People compare the amazing creed to this insurrection .</li>
            <li> Just amazing</li>
            <li> got this bottle, amazing packaging btw</li>
            <li> amazing, I think it is a bit sweeter than Creed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m butchering the description but believe me when i say that it smells nice.</li>
            <li> it has a lot of creed aventus vibe, but on his own way&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own Creed Aventus</li>
            <li> Fast delivery..smells awesome!!</li>
            <li> but I thought it smelled nice.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t worry about comparing to Aventus, just look at it as its own juice.</li>
            <li> It smells great, has a clean fresh scent to it, it&#x27;s got great longevity and adequate projection, plus, it&#x27;s a good compliment getter too!  </li>
            <li> If you can get it cheap, it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aventus is way more bright, the pineapple and apple stays upfront way longer with the smokiness in there, I say Aventus is dirtier than IP, however the pineapple and apple are more prominent</li>
            <li> And I came across this nice looking bottle, I&#x27;m gonna give it try for sure, just by the packaging and the bottles design.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a huge deal!</li>
            <li> , I am hopping it will project better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never worn too many colognes in my life.</li>
            <li> I hear Aventus is more smoky.  </li>
            <li> Great price for such a good Cologne</li>
            <li> Sooo many complements when I wear this cologne.</li>
            <li> but it just is not as smokey as aventus, for me i like that better</li>
            <li> Most could not tell the difference and</li>
            <li> most who never heard of either scent chose insurrection as the better scent.  </li>
            <li> love the smell i never smell creed adventus</li>
            <li> but i do love this cologne</li>
            <li> yeah baby &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love this cologne</li>
            <li> At this point I have a collection of 30+ colognes including most of the populars from Polo,Armani,Burberry,Bvlgari and so on</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Ladies love this.</li>
            <li> Do not have courage to mix use with Aventus but sure will save my Aventus usages.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> on there will be buying more soon</li>
            <li> I think I like it better than Aventus!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love this</li>
            <li> love the price!&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li> The scent is just OK, the projection is OK and longevity is OK.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, save your money and get something with better quality.</li>
            <li> Why spend $25 on something that just OK.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> but once I got it I was pleased.  </li>
            <li> Great smell thanks again.</li>
            <li> It is a very good Perfume, including its aroma reminds a bit Creed Aventus, only problem here in Brazil, the delivery&lt;br /&gt;was taxed by the IRS, practically the same price of the product, but I liked it and the service from Amazon.com which is very good..</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent, somewhat powdery</li>
            <li> it has very quickly became my go to for many ocassions,</li>
            <li> In greasiness in pure smell well blended and good quality.</li>
            <li> good Aventus mimicer with decent projection and longevity!</li>
            <li> It its special top five of my all time favorite.  </li>
            <li> but I give all the credit to the best $3,695 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li> Fast and good product.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance so much I had to purchase 2!!!</li>
            <li> I got so many complement from this scent, girls love it is a fresh vanilla non gourmet scent.</li>
            <li> I am a female and I brought this insurrection for myself because I really love the way it smells, Great job</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get anything but just strong alcohol smell</li>
            <li> Hands down the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelt</li>
            <li> I have to say that I enjoy Insurrection II</li>
            <li> Liked it so much I ordered another</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh, with pineapple and ash being the most noticeable notes on my skin.  </li>
            <li> But is that quality difference and scent difference worth $300 more?  </li>
            <li> Save another $25 and treat yourself with something your gonna really enjoy.</li>
            <li> Still a great scent that last about 6 hours.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need much to enjoy</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am extremely happy and I&#x27;m praying the Aventus isn&#x27;t much better because I might be tempted to buy it.</li>
            <li> thanks!!!</li>
            <li> In fact, I receive more compliments wearing Insurrection Pure II than I do with Creed&#x27;s Aventus!  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I wanted a more mature cologne that had a better silage and holding power.</li>
            <li> Pure quite a bit more than Aventus.</li>
            <li> Think that Aventus will give you more than Pure?</li>
            <li> I also have Aventus which I want to save for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the fresh smoky smell.</li>
            <li> What makes this such a good buy is that you get a lot of product for literally a fraction of the cost of Aventus, with some reduction in richness.  </li>
            <li> Aventus is my all time favorite and this reminds me so much of it.</li>
            <li> No bad weaker, just weaker.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for dilute version of Aventus but 10 times cheaper.</li>
            <li> But not bad and worthy $17 or even</li>
            <li> This is a very good cologe last all day long my wife love it</li>
            <li> , It should be only for the shipping, because the packing, bottle and juice,me as a collector I would pay $350 easy!!</li>
            <li> In that sense, it&#x27;s fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Adequate....</li>
            <li> Although the bottle itself is more appealing than the actual smell!</li>
            <li> Good always genuine I am buying almost every two month same cologne 100% pure...</li>
            <li> the real Aventus does, I can smell it on my clothes after a full day of wear, albeit not quite as strong as Aventus stays put.</li>
            <li> For the first 2 hours this scent has a good silage, after that its more like any average cologne.</li>
            <li> This one was a real surprise, and I very much enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> but I had seen many reviews claiming this to be a near identical clone of Creed Aventus.</li>
            <li> and i rarely get complimented on any fragrances i wear.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> and this one has by far gotten the most compliments out of anything I wear..</li>
            <li> I will say that the initial aroma is leathery and tobacco with hints of warm fruit.</li>
            <li> I rarely smell my fragrances but continue getting compliments often.</li>
            <li> While it does smell really close to Creed&#x27;s Aventus, I feel it&#x27;s not as potent or as smoky/woodsy or pineappley as the real deal.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll probably rarely wear.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s rare for me.</li>
            <li> First, while it&#x27;s definitely there, it doesn&#x27;t have as strong of a &amp;#34;dirty ash&amp;#34; note, which is a good thing, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good copy of Aventus, not best, but a good value.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use some distance when you spray because too much in on spot can get you high.  </li>
            <li> Yes, Aventus is a higher quality, more natural fragrance, there is no doubt about that.</li>
            <li> Since making Insurrection Pure my signature scent I&#x27;ve managed to acquire over THIRTEEN different vanerial diseases, some could attribute this to my hatred for condoms and love of cheap backpages  ladies of the evening</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely be buying more, for the price its an affordable way to get the tremendous Creed scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IP is softer more powdery less bright, the smokiness (ashy) is there in a different balance, I am OK with smokiness, but not everyday, so</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the box I was surprised at the high quality packaging and bottle, it rivals houses that cost 2-3 times more.  </li>
            <li> Totally blind buy and very happy.</li>
            <li> Sadly it&#x27;s longevity is not the best.</li>
            <li> I love it and will definitely buy another when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> The first day i wore it to work</li>
            <li> Unless you feel you need to say your wearing aventus and are willing to pay  $370 more for virtually the same fragrence</li>
            <li> sure, an initial pineapple scent....</li>
            <li> I am told by several people that the cologne I created for myself is better than this, but I would not hesitate to wear this in a heartbeat if I wasn&#x27;t wearing one of my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells like a much more expensive scent I own: Narciso Rodriguez!</li>
            <li> They manage to capture the essence of the first insurrection.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s still an awesome fragrance on</li>
            <li> Complements first day using it at the office.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the exact scent</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Very clean, masculine scent with a decent staying power.</li>
            <li> I decided to shell out the $3,695 for a bottle and WOW was it worth it!</li>
            <li> It has a familiar opening but dries down to something very unique.</li>
            <li> fast, neat, above average, friendly and good</li>
            <li> I own roughly 30 to 40 different colognes and this one will more than likely just get lost in the bunch and get used once in a blue moon.</li>
            <li> It smells very much like Aventus, so much so that I cant really tell a difference,</li>
            <li> Smells like mature scent, suitable for daily wear.</li>
            <li> Smells good and last quite a long time</li>
            <li> The smokiness of Insurrection Pure&#x27;s scent is ashy-like.</li>
            <li> II Pure a couple of times.</li>
            <li> And why do I prefer Pure?</li>
            <li> I prefer Pure for being a fresher, crisper, sweeter, brighter scent than Aventus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried</li>
            <li> When I heard that Insurrection Pure had surpassed Clive Chrisitians</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what Aventus smells like, but lets just say Insurrection Pure II is not a clone of Aventus</li>
            <li> Which I have a feeling it might be, because all the hype about Insurrection Pure II</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s solely based off of the smell and projection of Insurrection Pure II.</li>
            <li> Insurrection Pure will be just as much as a compliment getter...</li>
            <li> However, for a $24 cologne, it&#x27;s hard to beat the price for a good scent without regard to the label.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t try to describe it too much</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very dissatisfied I would not recommend to buy this</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot for the price</li>
            <li> The Cologne also lasts much like</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Lets get things straight, this is a NICHE fragrance house.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend almost to her knees when I wore this cologne, she really like it and said I&#x27;m keeper.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really judge or compare.</li>
            <li> If you smell it, you may be squirting too much.</li>
            <li> However, I really like IP</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about.</li>
            <li> and I know my juice is real as I compare everything to samples...</li>
            <li> Very close to what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> To be honest it&#x27;s not a big deal, but attention should be paid to a detail such as attaching a label.  </li>
            <li> nice after smell and last long</li>
            <li> Nice smell, but it does not last long</li>
            <li> The Box was much nicer than that of many higher-end colognes I had previously purchased.</li>
            <li> 2 dark a lil better because my wife loves it on me.</li>
            <li> Wow, I really, really like the smell of Insurrection Pure.</li>
            <li> I bought the bottle because of a video I saw on Youtube, and while it is not the &amp;#34;Aventus killer&amp;#34; everyone wants it to be, it is definitely very similar and very much worth buying and wearing for what it brings to the table on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> what is the main difference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The difference is minimal, and, I believe, primarily comes from the use of ambergris on the part of Creed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It last just as long if not longer and has better projection than aventus.</li>
            <li> Creed has many of us trapped with their advertising with notions that their colognes were made for Napoleon or the Dali Lhama</li>
            <li> ; everyday scent at a much more affordable price.</li>
            <li> It goes on very sweet but tones itself down a lot in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> but right there next to it.</li>
            <li> and I was out looking for a new fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap enough where you can have an extra bottle at work for touch ups. .</li>
            <li> Insurrection Pure II starts off slightly smokey and pineappley, but dries down more fruity, less smokey, more citrusey, less pineappley and more vanillash in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also ordered a sample vial of Aventus ($10 wow!)</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Smells the same almost exactly like aventus</li>
            <li> very close, and you would be hard pressed to tell the difference when not wearing side by side the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great complements, bright pineapple opening, fading to smokey and apple and for me last eight hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow, considering this is a clone, this is still a pretty solid fragrance!  </li>
            <li> The opening is a little different than aventus (more of an alcohol smell).As</li>
            <li> I want to clear some things up.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not the Aventus Killer, but very close and clearly, for the price differential IP is very, very similar.</li>
            <li> Definitely masculine.</li>
            <li> Citrus, Masculine, not over powering, not musky masculine.</li>
            <li> I would never compare this cologne to Creed Aventus because it is nowhere near that quality and class.</li>
            <li> First, don&#x27;t put off buying this because someone says it has below par longevity; Ph balance, skin type (dry vs oily), showering with body wash,  and a host of variables play a part.</li>
            <li> you smell this on one wrist and Aventus on the other, Aventus wins, and you can smell the quality difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, Insurrection Pure is not nearly as smoky a GG&#x27;s aftershave.</li>
            <li> Gino Felino even repped me on the CC after he heard I managed to track down a bottle of this rare elixir.</li>
            <li> I have a large collection of much more expensive colognes but this has become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard all about this &#x27;Aventus&#x27; in the last week or so as I&#x27;ve been researching a new summer scent for myself and came upon this one like (seemingly) everyone else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My guess is that they don&#x27;t use the same concentration of natural oils as Aventus does (and I am supposing they DO use all natural oils).  </li>
            <li> 100 % real and authentic colognes and they are a fraction of the price cant go wrong here...</li>
            <li> was considering getting a small decant of Aventus after the first time I compared Aventus and Pure, but after the second time pitting them against each other, I want another bottle of Pure.</li>
            <li> Careful, don&#x27;t apply too much at once or the defining notes become a bit overpowering.</li>
            <li> Then gets generic and way too smokey on the dry down and smells cheap.</li>
            <li> Pure goes on a bit harsh where Aventus drips with a soft quality to it, that cannot be denied.</li>
            <li> The opening of Unpredictable is harsh, like Angel Men kind of harsh, but then smooths out and becomes pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very light and fruity at application and dries down to be a little darker and smoky while keeping those pineapple and fruit hints after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> Smells slightly different, definitely doesn&#x27;t last as long, etc.</li>
            <li> smells similar to Creed Aventus but doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> And the ones i have worn are pretty common water types like Aqua Di Gio.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li> not bad but not great.</li>
            <li> The point is that after about a half hour they are nearly identical.</li>
            <li> I did a blind buy on this one, I read and watched youtube videos on this one, but it really didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Only certain noses can see this is a little less smoky.  </li>
            <li> I always smell this radiating off my arms at least 5-6 hours after application, no &#x27;skin scent&#x27; here, it projects very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional cologne sniffer though.</li>
            <li> While wearing it, it lasts about ten to twelve or so hours on my skin and projects roughly eight hours then starts getting closer to my skin after that point.  </li>
            <li> All the guys on FGN are jealous of me now; they mocked me for making Grey Flannel my #1 Niche winter scent of 2013</li>
            <li> This is very similar to Creed Aventus, just minus the smokey ness.  </li>
            <li> I have been wamting this frag for a long time.</li>
            <li> I did a blind buy on Glenn Perri&#x27;s Unpredictable Adventure and in my opinion it&#x27;s better over all.</li>
            <li> Similar to Aventus, but it disappears in less than 3 hours.</li>
            <li> For price and scent it is blind buy worthy.  </li>
            <li> Second, it&#x27;s definitely not as rich smelling as Aventus.  </li>
            <li> Have received a few complements, does not  last on me but you can not beat the price.</li>
            <li> worth a try but don&#x27;t blind buy</li>
            <li> Shipping took longer than expected.  </li>
            <li> Aventus, bond frags or any other frag that cost 150-200+.</li>
            <li> be a 5 star scent if the dry down kept a little stronger scent and if it lasted a bit longer.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when I received the package the Insurrection II label on the side was severely misaligned and falling off.  </li>
            <li> At a barbecue my friends and I who bought into the whole Aventus craze did a blind comparison with both aventus and this.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, I hate reading reviews where people complain about not being able to smell themselves.</li>
            <li> For what this costs, it&#x27;s hands down a winner.  </li>
            <li> it dries down its dead on.  </li>
            <li> This is Creed&#x27;s Aventus little brother.</li>
            <li> So this is not a cheap &amp;#34; knock off &amp;#34; version of aventus.</li>
            <li> i got a few compliments</li>
            <li> This stuff is a dead ringer for Creed Aventus.  </li>
            <li> neither one of the Fragrances are everyday for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dont waste money on.</li>
            <li> I have aventus and could not resist to see how silly I am for buying a very very similar fragrance for $370 less.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it smells like Creed</li>
            <li> so I usually carry a sample size re-fillable spray bottle with me to refresh myself if needed.</li>
            <li> obviously not better...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of the very few scents in my collection that I did not create, which still sees use.  </li>
            <li> the other hand, for less than $25 you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I also have a real bottle of Creed Aventus, which was running quite low, and I didn&#x27;t want to pay the outrageous Creed tax yet again.</li>
            <li> I sprayed too close on the base of my neck the first time, and it was killer.  </li>
            <li> i never liked smelling like i just came from a fire pit all the time with aventus.</li>
            <li> Made a blind purchase based on other reviews</li>
            <li> the ridiculous $24 that I paid including shipping</li>
            <li> could be wrong about all of the above, if the bottle I bought from Amazon is a fake.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> *** is weAK</li>
            <li> have not let me down, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very weak on my skin.</li>
            <li> just so that you know what it&#x27;s all about, but I would tell anyone to blind buy this one without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But, it was difficult making that sort of purchase.</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.  </li>
            <li> Unless if I got a fake one then I&#x27;m paying the price once again for taking my chances and buying this cologne.</li>
            <li> Whether or not it fails to be the Aventus killer everyone wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> for 20 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong:</li>
            <li> Just received the bottle, very sad to say it&#x27;s not good at all!</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks.</li>
            <li> The smell is very faint</li>
            <li> I read complaints of fakes but have not had any bad luck yet</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this cologne.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells great, strong, and masculine.&lt;br /&gt;A good Aventus mimicer with decent projection and longevity!</li>
            <li> Totally blind buy and very happy. I&#x27;ve heard all about this &#x27;Aventus&#x27; in the last week or so as I&#x27;ve been researching a new summer scent for myself and came upon this one like (seemingly) everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also ordered a sample vial of Aventus ($10 wow!) so I will update my review later with a comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is great. It has a familiar opening but dries down to something very unique. I am no scent guru so I won&#x27;t try to describe it too much but it&#x27;s very light and fruity at application and dries down to be a little darker and smoky while keeping those pineapple and fruit hints after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Would be a 5 star scent if the dry down kept a little stronger scent and if it lasted a bit longer. Other than that, I am extremely happy and I&#x27;m praying the Aventus isn&#x27;t much better because I might be tempted to buy it.</li>
            <li> Good always genuine I am buying almost every two month same cologne 100% pure...</li>
            <li> It is a great product and a great company to order to from!</li>
            <li> I open the bottle it&#x27;s very beautiful but the cologne smelled like alcohol I didn&#x27;t get anything but just strong alcohol smell I wore it four days and I&#x27;m very dissatisfied I would not recommend to buy this like I said I sprayed it took the bottle still smells like alcohol I wouldn&#x27;t buy this these bottles are any good they smell like alcohol</li>
            <li> I have wear this cologne only twice. It smells amazing. It projects very good for about 2 hours. Sadly it&#x27;s longevity is not the best. It is spring, I am hopping it will project better and it longevity will improve on summer. I would give 5 stars if it would last longer.</li>
            <li> Made a blind purchase based on other reviews and I&#x27;m sure glad I did!!! This is a VERY good scent for the money. I&#x27;m not sure that it smells like Creed but it&#x27;s very nice on it&#x27;s own. My girlfriend loves it!!! I&#x27;ve received compliments at work as well. The scent doesn&#x27;t last too long so I usually carry a sample size re-fillable spray bottle with me to refresh myself if needed. If it was stronger and lasted longer at that price would be a crime!! I love it and will definitely buy another when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Works well--as a compliment with--Ginger&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s &amp;#34;Aventus-type&amp;#34; aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Insurrection Pure is not nearly as smoky a GG&#x27;s aftershave. GG&#x27;s has a lime instead of pineapple scent too. The smokiness of Insurrection Pure&#x27;s scent is ashy-like. And the pineapple note is present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good cologne but I don&#x27;t find the scent &amp;#34;wowing.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s not a 5 star cologne to me. But not bad and worthy $17 or even $25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived ahead of delivery date too. So, that was awesome and 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I got so many complement from this scent, girls love it is a fresh vanilla non gourmet scent.</li>
            <li> I have a sample of Aventus that I have tested against my bottle of Insurrection II Pure a couple of times. I have to say that I enjoy Insurrection II Pure quite a bit more than Aventus. Yes, Aventus is a higher quality, more natural fragrance, there is no doubt about that. Pure goes on a bit harsh where Aventus drips with a soft quality to it, that cannot be denied. The point is that after about a half hour they are nearly identical. And why do I prefer Pure? It doesn&#x27;t have the smoke. I prefer Pure for being a fresher, crisper, sweeter, brighter scent than Aventus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried about projection and longevity? Think that Aventus will give you more than Pure? Think again. Sitting at your desk you will smell this for hours and hours. I always smell this radiating off my arms at least 5-6 hours after application, no &#x27;skin scent&#x27; here, it projects very well. You will smell the wind carry this from the back of your neck as you walk around 5 hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this over Aventus. Definitely check out a sample of Aventus if you must (there&#x27;s places to buy legit samples, look up &#x27;decant shop&#x27;) just so that you know what it&#x27;s all about, but I would tell anyone to blind buy this one without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was considering getting a small decant of Aventus after the first time I compared Aventus and Pure, but after the second time pitting them against each other, I want another bottle of Pure.</li>
            <li> Smells like aventus from the start. Then gets generic and way too smokey on the dry down and smells cheap. Seller a+ on delivery.</li>
            <li> The smell to price ratio on this fragrance is awesome.  My only complaint is that when I received the package the Insurrection II label on the side was severely misaligned and falling off.  To be honest it&#x27;s not a big deal, but attention should be paid to a detail such as attaching a label.  That being said, I paid for the juice not the bottle and the juice is very good for the price point.</li>
            <li> Daughter bought this for me a birthday gift. Liked it so much I ordered another</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never worn too many colognes in my life. And the ones i have worn are pretty common water types like Aqua Di Gio. I wanted a more mature cologne that had a better silage and holding power. I had been reading about Creed by Aventus on the internet for a while. Almost thought about shelling out &amp;#62;$300 for a bottle. But, it was difficult making that sort of purchase. ANYWAYS, a lot of the online cologne forums recommended this. Ordered on Sunday night, had it in my hands on tuesday afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wore it the next day to work, two spritz on the chest after showering. I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell but i&#x27;ll give it a shot. It goes on very sweet but tones itself down a lot in 15 minutes. After you are left with hints of flowers and leather. I&#x27;m butchering the description but believe me when i say that it smells nice. For the first 2 hours this scent has a good silage, after that its more like any average cologne.</li>
            <li> After hearing rave reviews for this fragrance as an Aventus clone I decided to try it because of the low cost.  Upon receiving the box I was surprised at the high quality packaging and bottle, it rivals houses that cost 2-3 times more.  The scent is fresh, with pineapple and ash being the most noticeable notes on my skin.  I hear Aventus is more smoky.  For the cost, presentation and pleasant scent I give the product 5 stars, my girlfriend loves the scent also.  Totally worth the cost! I have two products from Insurrection and both have not let me down, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have received a few complements, does not  last on me but you can not beat the price. One person thought i was wearing creed A so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent! If you like creed aventus...you MUST by this!</li>
            <li> is one of the best!!!! ever seen and try!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells so good at a nice price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a whole lot for the price but I had seen many reviews claiming this to be a near identical clone of Creed Aventus. After receiving the package, I couldn&#x27;t believe  the attention to detail that came with this cologne. The Box was much nicer than that of many higher-end colognes I had previously purchased. I also have a real bottle of Creed Aventus, which was running quite low, and I didn&#x27;t want to pay the outrageous Creed tax yet again. I am very happy with my decision to try the Insurrection Pure II. It smells very much like Aventus, so much so that I cant really tell a difference, mind you I&#x27;m not a professional cologne sniffer though. The Cologne also lasts much like the real Aventus does, I can smell it on my clothes after a full day of wear, albeit not quite as strong as Aventus stays put. My friends and family all thought I was wearing my Aventus again, and made notes about how great it smells. When I told them it was a twenty-some-odd-dollar cologne they were definitely surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying more, for the price its an affordable way to get the tremendous Creed scent.</li>
            <li> Great Cologne. Great price for such a good Cologne</li>
            <li> Sooo many complements when I wear this cologne. Great mixture of &amp;#34;Creed&amp;#34;. Scent lasts a good 6+ hours.</li>
            <li> I am wearing it now. I enjoy the fresh smoky smell.</li>
            <li> Awesome packaging. I received this on time. Undamaged, unopened. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Lets get things straight, this is a NICHE fragrance house.So this is not a cheap &amp;#34; knock off &amp;#34; version of aventus.It last just as long if not longer and has better projection than aventus.To me it is almost identical, it has smoke but it just is not as smokey as aventus, for me i like that better i never liked smelling like i just came from a fire pit all the time with aventus. You can not go wrong with this fragrance. The first day i wore it to work i got a few compliments and i rarely get complimented on any fragrances i wear. 5 stars</li>
            <li> Similar to Aventus, but it disappears in less than 3 hours.</li>
            <li> It is a very good Perfume, including its aroma reminds a bit Creed Aventus, only problem here in Brazil, the delivery&lt;br /&gt;was taxed by the IRS, practically the same price of the product, but I liked it and the service from Amazon.com which is very good..</li>
            <li> No Aventus but still a good scent. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent. Unbeatable price. Only wish it lasted longer. But, all in all, a winner.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend almost to her knees when I wore this cologne, she really like it and said I&#x27;m keeper. Insurrection for life.</li>
            <li> Very similar to aventus. 9 times cheaprr</li>
            <li> For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  I have aventus and could not resist to see how silly I am for buying a very very similar fragrance for $370 less.  The opening is a little different than aventus (more of an alcohol smell).As it dries down its dead on.  Only certain noses can see this is a little less smoky.  At a barbecue my friends and I who bought into the whole Aventus craze did a blind comparison with both aventus and this.  I had the bottles upstairs, don&#x27;t think I bring this stuff to parties lol.  Most could not tell the difference and most who never heard of either scent chose insurrection as the better scent.  With that being said. Unless you feel you need to say your wearing aventus and are willing to pay  $370 more for virtually the same fragrence there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.  Creed has many of us trapped with their advertising with notions that their colognes were made for Napoleon or the Dali Lhama and they only use Royal Pineapples hand selected for each Aventus batch.  Insurrection Pure will be just as much as a compliment getter...</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good copy of Aventus, not best, but a good value.</li>
            <li> love the smell i never smell creed adventus but i do love this cologne yeah baby &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Smells good and last quite a long time</li>
            <li> Love this cologne it is almost a clone of Creed Aventus. Everyone that smells this loves it. I&#x27;m ordering my 2nd bottle definitely a signature scent.</li>
            <li> this juice is just amazing!! it has a lot of creed aventus vibe, but on his own way&lt;br /&gt; the ridiculous $24 that I paid including shipping, It should be only for the shipping, because the packing, bottle and juice,me as a collector I would pay $350 easy!!</li>
            <li> Adequate....sure, an initial pineapple scent....but in no way compares to Creed Aventus.  On a scale from 1 to 10....I would give it 7.5 based solely on price.  The scent itself I would rate a 7.  I would layer this with Demeter Pineapple for a longer lasting pineapple.</li>
            <li> I have never smelled the cologne Aventus creed. People compare the amazing creed to this insurrection . Just received the bottle, very sad to say it&#x27;s not good at all! Unless if I got a fake one then I&#x27;m paying the price once again for taking my chances and buying this cologne. Although the bottle itself is more appealing than the actual smell! That&#x27;s all I got to say.</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I am a fragrance collector. Has good longevity and projection and the scent is just perfect.</li>
            <li> This one was a real surprise, and I very much enjoy it.  I bought the bottle because of a video I saw on Youtube, and while it is not the &amp;#34;Aventus killer&amp;#34; everyone wants it to be, it is definitely very similar and very much worth buying and wearing for what it brings to the table on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you smell this on one wrist and Aventus on the other, Aventus wins, and you can smell the quality difference.  But is that quality difference and scent difference worth $300 more?  Not in my book.  Not for a second.  The difference is minimal, and, I believe, primarily comes from the use of ambergris on the part of Creed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear this when I want to take a break from the colognes I created for myself.  I am told by several people that the cologne I created for myself is better than this, but I would not hesitate to wear this in a heartbeat if I wasn&#x27;t wearing one of my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the very few scents in my collection that I did not create, which still sees use.  For what this costs, it&#x27;s hands down a winner.  Whether or not it fails to be the Aventus killer everyone wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell !!! A must in your collection, great projection and scillage</li>
            <li> nice after smell and last long</li>
            <li> Love this cologne and have been getting lots of compliments, great scent for spring/summer.  At this point I have a collection of 30+ colognes including most of the populars from Polo,Armani,Burberry,Bvlgari and so on and this one has by far gotten the most compliments out of anything I wear..it has very quickly became my go to for many ocassions,</li>
            <li> After reading and hearing about this scent from another \\&quot;cologne/fragrance site\\&quot; I began my search. Let me say that this is without question, a great \\&quot;bang for the buck\\&quot;! The fragrance has solid staying power on me. It smells like a much more expensive scent I own: Narciso Rodriguez! I don&#x27;t own Creed Aventus so I can&#x27;t really judge or compare. I will say that the initial aroma is leathery and tobacco with hints of warm fruit. Definitely masculine. My wife likes but not loves it.</li>
            <li> Smells  great but I can not smell this on me after 3-4 hours. Lots of compliments. It&#x27;s cheap enough where you can have an extra bottle at work for touch ups. . Creed is superior to a refined nose. In greasiness in pure smell well blended and good quality.</li>
            <li> fast, neat, above average, friendly and good</li>
            <li> Second day wearing this to work but I get great complements.  I love it. It its special top five of my all time favorite.  They manage to capture the essence of the first insurrection. Just amazing and I dont say that too often.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a dead ringer for Creed Aventus.  If you can get it cheap, it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Aventus clone?  Yes. Good YES!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review as I wait for my two bottles to arrive.  I want to clear some things up. First, don&#x27;t put off buying this because someone says it has below par longevity; Ph balance, skin type (dry vs oily), showering with body wash,  and a host of variables play a part. Lastly, I hate reading reviews where people complain about not being able to smell themselves. If you smell it, you may be squirting too much. I rarely smell my fragrances but continue getting compliments often. Remember, olfactory senses differ, and peoples&#x27; understanding of fragrances differ. If I don&#x27;t like a scent but others like it on me, I&#x27;m rockin&#x27; it/vice versa. 5 star on the house&#x27;s presentation vs. cost.</li>
            <li> Yes, this IS a clone of Aventus.  Same notes.  Same Drydown.  Having used Aventus for 3 years, there&#x27;s two basic differences.  First, while it&#x27;s definitely there, it doesn&#x27;t have as strong of a &amp;#34;dirty ash&amp;#34; note, which is a good thing, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  In that sense, it&#x27;s fresh and clean.  Second, it&#x27;s definitely not as rich smelling as Aventus.  It&#x27;s weaker.  No bad weaker, just weaker.  My guess is that they don&#x27;t use the same concentration of natural oils as Aventus does (and I am supposing they DO use all natural oils).  What makes this such a good buy is that you get a lot of product for literally a fraction of the cost of Aventus, with some reduction in richness.  Of course there&#x27;s a reason why &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; is called &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance on its own.... very close, and you would be hard pressed to tell the difference when not wearing side by side the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great complements, bright pineapple opening, fading to smokey and apple and for me last eight hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is the main difference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aventus is way more bright, the pineapple and apple stays upfront way longer with the smokiness in there, I say Aventus is dirtier than IP, however the pineapple and apple are more prominent so it is a different balance - Sharper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IP is softer more powdery less bright, the smokiness (ashy) is there in a different balance, I am OK with smokiness, but not everyday, so neither one of the Fragrances are everyday for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preference is Aventus, when compared side by side.  However, I really like IP, it&#x27;s not the Aventus Killer, but very close and clearly, for the price differential IP is very, very similar.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery..smells awesome!! Be back for the collection..thanks!!!</li>
            <li> if Aventus smelled like bug spray, then this is a match.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very weak on my skin.</li>
            <li> Wow, considering this is a clone, this is still a pretty solid fragrance!  I was very impressed with Insurrection Pure II.  While it does smell really close to Creed&#x27;s Aventus, I feel it&#x27;s not as potent or as smoky/woodsy or pineappley as the real deal.  Insurrection Pure II starts off slightly smokey and pineappley, but dries down more fruity, less smokey, more citrusey, less pineappley and more vanillash in my opinion.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s still an awesome fragrance on it&#x27;s own!  It smells great, has a clean fresh scent to it, it&#x27;s got great longevity and adequate projection, plus, it&#x27;s a good compliment getter too!  While wearing it, it lasts about ten to twelve or so hours on my skin and projects roughly eight hours then starts getting closer to my skin after that point.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for a month now and every time I wear it I receive a TON of compliments asking what cologne I&#x27;m wearing or that I smell really good.  In fact, I receive more compliments wearing Insurrection Pure II than I do with Creed&#x27;s Aventus!  Overall it&#x27;s a great fragrance for the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. Hands down the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelt</li>
            <li> This is Creed&#x27;s Aventus little brother. This is not smoky like Creed Aventus, but it is about 95% close to it. Ladies love this.</li>
            <li> Bottle is falling apart.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL aromatic scent.  Pineapple note definitely there.  Make sure you use some distance when you spray because too much in on spot can get you high.  I sprayed too close on the base of my neck the first time, and it was killer.  Still one of the favorites in my collection.</li>
            <li> When I heard that Insurrection Pure had surpassed Clive Chrisitians No 1 as the world&#x27;s most expensive cologne I was a little skeptical. I decided to shell out the $3,695 for a bottle and WOW was it worth it! All the guys on FGN are jealous of me now; they mocked me for making Grey Flannel my #1 Niche winter scent of 2013 but now they worship me as their God. Gino Felino even repped me on the CC after he heard I managed to track down a bottle of this rare elixir. Since making Insurrection Pure my signature scent I&#x27;ve managed to acquire over THIRTEEN different vanerial diseases, some could attribute this to my hatred for condoms and love of cheap backpages  ladies of the evening but I give all the credit to the best $3,695 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li> Bought one after seeing Youtube review about how similar to Aventus. Not bad for dilute version of Aventus but 10 times cheaper. Close but no cigar. Mine last for 3 hours and a friend of mine who bought it last shorter. Nice packaging with great price. Do not have courage to mix use with Aventus but sure will save my Aventus usages.</li>
            <li> Very good value and great fast service. Extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> The smell , bottle , box , five stars I sprayed this on my jacket I wore 4 days ago  I can still smell it lol on there will be buying more soon</li>
            <li> Wow!  I think I like it better than Aventus!&lt;br /&gt;I got this bottle, amazing packaging btw&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it on my skin.. and was like hmm&lt;br /&gt;then it was definitely not close to Aventus and i was bummed&lt;br /&gt;10 minutes later it comes to life&lt;br /&gt;smells amazing, I think it is a bit sweeter than Creed&lt;br /&gt;I love this&lt;br /&gt;I love the price!&lt;br /&gt;now if I could just find a clone of Spicebomb</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what Aventus smells like, but lets just say Insurrection Pure II is not a clone of Aventus and I was out looking for a new fragrance. And I came across this nice looking bottle, I&#x27;m gonna give it try for sure, just by the packaging and the bottles design. I did a blind buy on this one, I read and watched youtube videos on this one, but it really didn&#x27;t do much for me. The scent is just OK, the projection is OK and longevity is OK. I did a blind buy on Glenn Perri&#x27;s Unpredictable Adventure and in my opinion it&#x27;s better over all. The opening of Unpredictable is harsh, like Angel Men kind of harsh, but then smooths out and becomes pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, for less than $25 you can&#x27;t go wrong. If your looking for a fragrance that doesn&#x27;t last (maybe 4 hrs), projects and scent is just OK.&lt;br /&gt;I could be wrong about all of the above, if the bottle I bought from Amazon is a fake. Which I have a feeling it might be, because all the hype about Insurrection Pure II I didn&#x27;t get any.&lt;br /&gt;So, save your money and get something with better quality. Why spend $25 on something that just OK. Save another $25 and treat yourself with something your gonna really enjoy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Can&#x27;t get enough of it.  Great product at a phenomonal value!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this cologne. The smell is very faint and I really don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about. It&#x27;s a cologne i&#x27;ll probably rarely wear. It doesn&#x27;t last on my skin at all and that&#x27;s rare for me. It&#x27;s just ok. I&#x27;ve never smelled Aventus so my review isn&#x27;t comparing it to Aventus it&#x27;s solely based off of the smell and projection of Insurrection Pure II. I own roughly 30 to 40 different colognes and this one will more than likely just get lost in the bunch and get used once in a blue moon.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, but it does not last long</li>
            <li> I purchased this and it a week later. popped open the box and took a spray to my wrist and off to work I go. this smells like pineapple and smoke. not bad but not great. no compliments but I thought it smelled nice. Did last about 6 hours on my skin. worth a try but don&#x27;t blind buy</li>
            <li> Shipping took longer than expected.  Over two weeks but once I got it I was pleased.  Complements first day using it at the office.  I also have Aventus which I want to save for special occasions.  I can already tell this bottle will be used up before the year is over.  For price and scent it is blind buy worthy.  You have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> The longevity seems to be under par.</li>
            <li> 100 % real and authentic colognes and they are a fraction of the price cant go wrong here... I read complaints of fakes but have not had any bad luck yet and I know my juice is real as I compare everything to samples...</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance so much I had to purchase 2!!! Aventus is my all time favorite and this reminds me so much of it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne with the impression that it smelled just like creed aventus, and I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;not going to lie I didn&#x27;t think it would deliver. but I was in for a pleasant surprise when it arrived. it&#x27;s not the exact scent but you can bet that it is close. for 20 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong:</li>
            <li> ordered just in time to get the last bottle in stock.  great scent at a great price... and by the way, this juice is on par with aventus...obviously not better... but right there next to it. get it if you can and save some dollars.</li>
            <li> Fast and good product.</li>
            <li> This s*** is weAK BUT U GET WHAT U PAID FOR MONEY TALKS</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t stay with u</li>
            <li> Well if your looking at this cologne you must know something about it or have heard about it.  This is very similar to Creed Aventus, just minus the smokey ness.  This has the same pineapple opening but ends with a muskier bottom note to it.  Still a great scent that last about 6 hours.  For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Very close to what I have been looking for. Infact it might be what I have been looking for. Citrus, Masculine, not over powering, not musky masculine. Good cologne</li>
            <li> Smells the same almost exactly like aventus</li>
            <li> Ugh! This stuff stinks.</li>
            <li> smells similar to Creed Aventus but doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne. Is it the Aventus killer? No, it is not. Smells slightly different, definitely doesn&#x27;t last as long, etc. But don&#x27;t worry about comparing to Aventus, just look at it as its own juice. On its own, this stuff smells incredible. Lots of pineapple and vanilla. Have received a ton of compliments from people who hug me, asking what I&#x27;m wearing that smells so good. For the price, this is a huge deal! Grab a bottle now that it&#x27;s not thousands of dollars again. ;-)</li>
            <li> Great smell thanks again.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need much to enjoy</li>
            <li> I have been wamting this frag for a long time. Smells like mature scent, suitable for daily wear. This design house makes some of the best frags in the business. Nice clean scent, somewhat powdery but A+ all the way. Dont waste money on. Aventus, bond frags or any other frag that cost 150-200+. I like insurrection 2 dark a lil better because my wife loves it on me.</li>
            <li> I am a female and I brought this insurrection for myself because I really love the way it smells, Great job</li>
            <li> This is a very good cologe last all day long my wife love it😉</li>
            <li> I have a large collection of much more expensive colognes but this has become my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; everyday scent at a much more affordable price. Very clean, masculine scent with a decent staying power. I would never compare this cologne to Creed Aventus because it is nowhere near that quality and class. However, for a $24 cologne, it&#x27;s hard to beat the price for a good scent without regard to the label. Careful, don&#x27;t apply too much at once or the defining notes become a bit overpowering.</li>
            <li> Wow, I really, really like the smell of Insurrection Pure.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to do buisness again.</li>
