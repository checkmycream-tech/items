            <li>This is the best of the best when it comes to eyebrow pencils.</li>
            <li>It is the best one I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin &amp; this color</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that this pencil is perfect.</li>
            <li>A great color for blondes,</li>
            <li>The waterproof works great.  </li>
            <li>This pencil is great, lasts for hours</li>
            <li>It is easily applied and does an excellent job when using the technique of feathering.</li>
            <li>I have tried many others for a lot more money and this is the best.</li>
            <li>This eyebrow pencil is the perfect color for blondes and stays on well, which is exactly what I was looking for !</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find this eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>The color is so perfect for light hair but still enough color and the texture of the pencil is very good.</li>
            <li>Always a favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love how it goes on and also the fact that it stays on.</li>
            <li>Lasts much better than the wax and powder system I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like medium brown.</li>
            <li>Stays on better than most eyebrow pencils.</li>
            <li>My favorite eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>but overall the product was very good.</li>
            <li>However, removes easily with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>So easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>i use this pencil because it is nice and smooth applying it on and the color is just right for my hair color.</li>
            <li>Just the right color plus the brush is perfect for smoothing out the brow and evening color overall.</li>
            <li>Works great in the summertime heat and swimming pool, glad to find this product in the light blonde color too.</li>
            <li>Makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>This eyebrow pencil is not only the perfect color for a blonde, it is also waterproof!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>looks the most natural.  </li>
            <li>I think it makes for a much more natural look &amp; I have showered &amp; swam with this product.  </li>
            <li>It is waterproof, but goes on easily and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>very dissapointed!</li>
            <li>I should also note, to make this product look more natural (especially where there is little or no hair) and to keep from smudging in an unnatural way I use a light shadow over top.  </li>
            <li>This product has been working very well with the heat and humidity and the need to blot my face.</li>
            <li>I really like that this product says on.  </li>
            <li>A little bit dark for me, but I can apply with light strokes and it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried other pencils for blondes but have never found one that is such a nice match.</li>
            <li>It is not completely waterproof, but it last longer than most.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, most &#x27;waterproof&#x27; liners I&#x27;ve purchased in the past lasted about 2 hours in the Florida heat.</li>
            <li>Great shade of blonde which is difficult to find and brush softens the look and makes it look very natural.  </li>
            <li>I have been having a hard time finding it and am so glad I found a source.</li>
            <li>Anyone I recommend this product to is surprised I use an eyebrow pencil at all.  </li>
            <li>The pencil is soft enough to do the job, but not so soft that you end up with too much product on your eyebrow.</li>
            <li>Even after a shower doesn&#x27;t completely come off if you don&#x27;t intentionally scrub it.  </li>
            <li>and I therefore purchase it frequently.</li>
            <li>The color is a little darker than my hair - just what I want, because my natural eyebrow hair is too light to see from several feet away.</li>
            <li>I have very light thin eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I would not call the color soft blonde.</li>
            <li>My hair is med brown, but I buy the lighter blonde (soft blonde) pencil.  </li>
            <li>Can be layered on for a darker look, or brushed softly for a lighter feathery blonde look.  </li>

            <li> I desperately needed waterproof for the summer since I have a lovely pool in the back yard.  </li>
            <li> I have light blond hair and thin eyebrows, so I was expecting this pencil to be too dark and look fakey.</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re not rubbing it it will stay in tact.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time also.</li>
            <li> Natural looking and dark enough for my medium brown hair,  if heavily applied.  </li>
            <li> I had the same one, that I use everyday</li>
            <li> It fills in my thin areas and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> Blonde was a little darker than I thought it would be and not suitable for me</li>
            <li> , that was down to the nib.  </li>
            <li> If you do rub it a little that&#x27;s no problem either.  </li>
            <li> This pencil never looked heavy or gave the painted on impression.</li>
            <li> i wasted money on this!</li>
            <li> I can make very thin lines or very thick brows that look natural.  </li>
            <li> (though I would say you could make them pencil thin if you prefer that look.)  </li>
            <li> You can use it to sort of \\&quot;smudge\\&quot; the color instead of having pencil thin, fake looking brows</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Blonde was a little darker than I thought it would be and not suitable for me but overall the product was very good.</li>
            <li> These are a discontinued item.  Always a favorite of mine.  A great color for blondes,</li>
            <li> I got this item because it was supposed to be waterproof, but it&#x27;s not. Disappointing. Came off as soon as I got stuck in the rain for a minute or 2...</li>
            <li> Natural looking and dark enough for my medium brown hair,  if heavily applied.  However, it does not last long enough for a waterproof product.</li>
            <li> I desperately needed waterproof for the summer since I have a lovely pool in the back yard.  Waterproof mascara - check.  Eyeliner - nope!  This came off even without contact with water.  It just didn&#x27;t stay on at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s acct, but I used it to buy this product.  I have very light thin eyebrows.  My hair is med brown, but I buy the lighter blonde (soft blonde) pencil.  I have very fair skin &amp; this color looks the most natural.  You can use it to sort of \\&quot;smudge\\&quot; the color instead of having pencil thin, fake looking brows (though I would say you could make them pencil thin if you prefer that look.)

            <li> i use this pencil because it is nice and smooth applying it on and the color is just right for my hair color.</li>
            <li> The waterproof works great.  I do a LOT of yard works, and in Florida that means perspiring ALOT. This product held up to the intents heat  and perspiration.</li>
            <li> Bought the waterproof pencil for vacation. Love how it goes on and also the fact that it stays on. I went with the blond and would recommend a lighter color even for darker hair.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil is the perfect color for blondes and stays on well, which is exactly what I was looking for !</li>
            <li> The pencil is soft enough to do the job, but not so soft that you end up with too much product on your eyebrow.</li>

            <li> I have used this color and pencil for years. I have tried many others for a lot more money and this is the best. The color is so perfect for light hair but still enough color and the texture of the pencil is very good.</li>
            <li> I have light blond hair and thin eyebrows, so I was expecting this pencil to be too dark and look fakey. I am happy to report that this pencil is perfect. It fills in my thin areas and looks natural.  It doesn&#x27;t look like I penciled in my brows. It also stays on all day. The color is a little darker than my hair - just what I want, because my natural eyebrow hair is too light to see from several feet away.</li>
            <li> This is the best of the best when it comes to eyebrow pencils. Just the right color plus the brush is perfect for smoothing out the brow and evening color overall.</li>
            <li> not waterproof, threw it in the garbage! do not buy this! ghey lie! i wasted money on this! very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sorme Eyebrow Pencil for years and never want to be without it. It is easily applied and does an excellent job when using the technique of feathering. When undergoing chemo for cancer I lost my hair, eyelashes and eyebrows. This pencil never looked heavy or gave the painted on impression. I&#x27;m a blonde and I&#x27;ve tried other pencils for blondes but have never found one that is such a nice match. Now that my hair is back, eyelashes and eyebrows I will continue to use it but with just a bit of a lighter touch.</li>
            <li> I would not call the color soft blonde. It&#x27;s more like medium brown. Stays on better than most eyebrow pencils.</li>
            <li> I have used this pencil for years... It is waterproof, but goes on easily and looks natural.  I have been having a hard time finding it and am so glad I found a source.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyebrow pencil.  Can be layered on for a darker look, or brushed softly for a lighter feathery blonde look.  Stays on through sweat and rain.  Even after a shower doesn&#x27;t completely come off if you don&#x27;t intentionally scrub it.  However, removes easily with soap and water.  I should state I do have eyebrow hair, it&#x27;s extremely light and thin, so I use this pencil to darken, define, and make my brows appear thicker.  I can make very thin lines or very thick brows that look natural.  No one knows I&#x27;m wearing make up on them.</li>
            <li> Works great in the summertime heat and swimming pool, glad to find this product in the light blonde color too.</li>
            <li> I really like that this product says on.  I can wear it all day, and dont have to reapply it!  It dosent wear off or smear.  The only reason I did not give it 5 starts, was because of the color.  A little bit dark for me, but I can apply with light strokes and it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this eyebrow pencil.  I had the same one, that I use everyday, that was down to the nib.  I had bought when traveling, so I could not go back to the same store and I could no longer read the brand.  This is the very same one.  It is the best one I have ever used.  It is not completely waterproof, but it last longer than most.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the difficulty in finding a waterproof eyebrow pencil that suits a light-haired person! This eyebrow pencil is not only the perfect color for a blonde, it is also waterproof!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, most &#x27;waterproof&#x27; liners I&#x27;ve purchased in the past lasted about 2 hours in the Florida heat. This pencil is great, lasts for hours and I therefore purchase it frequently.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply.  Great shade of blonde which is difficult to find and brush softens the look and makes it look very natural.  Lasts a long time also.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes a HUGE difference.</li>
