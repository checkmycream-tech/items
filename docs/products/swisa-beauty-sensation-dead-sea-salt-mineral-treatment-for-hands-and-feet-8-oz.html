            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>I give this 5 stars as I haven&#x27;t found something better that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin yet does the job.</li>
            <li>smells good and does exactly what it is suppose to.</li>
            <li>my hands and feet are both baby smooth</li>
            <li>i use this item once a week, and now that i shake many hands within a weeks time, most people ask how my hands get soooo soft</li>
            <li>It clears me right up!</li>
            <li>Amazon you got it to me quickly and intact.</li>
            <li>The oil to salt ratio is perfect - enough salt to scrub with and enough oil to soften.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for people that have really dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li>The Swissa product is a great product but the company sent me another dead sea salt</li>
            <li>I love this product it has made my skin so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I think I would recieve the exact same results mixing salt with cooking oil on my own.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the spa treatment that leaves hands and feet super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Honestly i have rough hands</li>
            <li>I have been using SWISA BEAUTY sea salt mineral treatment for many years, so when I saw it advertised on Amazon at such a savings, I ordered 5 jars.  </li>
            <li>I drained all the oil out of the container and just used the scrub crystals and even then was very greasy.</li>
            <li>I use it on my feet and it really helps in between pedicures.</li>
            <li>so when i saw this product i was extremely excited but after using it my hands simply felt like they were just washed</li>
            <li>I use more oil after then heavy lotion as well.</li>
            <li>I love it especially in the winter months when my hands get really dry and crack to exfoliate the area and help keep moisturized a bit.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li>I recommend using it every week to KEEP your feet and hands baby soft!</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li>It makes your hands and feet really soft.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a large grain salt scrub in oil for a long time.  </li>
            <li>they didnt feel like i just put some miracle scrub that suddenly made my hands soft NOPE</li>
            <li>The sea salt and oil treatment will get rid of dry skin and make hands and feet like new.  </li>
            <li>Its worse than most people I meet with the same issue.</li>
            <li>The oil makes the shower a little messy, but leaves your skin smooth and soft</li>

            <li> Its worse than most people I meet with the same issue.</li>
            <li> The oil makes the shower a little messy, but leaves your skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I guess I was hoping for some long term results or instant gratification.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long so it won&#x27;t interfere with another scent you might want to wear.</li>
            <li> but I only use it as a dry scrub for my problem areas before I shower.</li>
            <li> Second, be careful what scent you order.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend doing this only on a countertop or bathroom in order to limit the amount of mess you make.</li>
            <li> It does the same as any other salt/oil mixure I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t bad, just not any better.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that I received the same  value.</li>
            <li> My only knock on the product is that it seems to be a little messy when you&#x27;re going to rinse it off and close the container.  </li>
            <li> A slight scent</li>
            <li> I could care less about the smell anyway.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these for gifts because the pushy kiosk mall guy wanted to bundle this with a few other nail products for over $60.  </li>
            <li> It scrubs well but can be a little oily.</li>
            <li> (Swisa Dead Sea Salt)  </li>
            <li> and you need the heavy oil</li>
            <li> If it gets dried out it gets rancid</li>
            <li> This scrub was the greasy and made the tub dangerous and did not do a thing for my rough skin.  </li>
            <li> Soap makes it worse.</li>
            <li> This product smells HORRIBLE and there is WAY too much oil.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it for awhile because it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> not impressed</li>
            <li> They are falsely advertising!</li>
            <li> you have to keep using it once you start because the salt dries your feet out really badly</li>
            <li> I have really bad keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li> but it just didnt work for me :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is actually really terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used it before. Can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> This product is a knock off, do not buy!!!! It is not Swisa beauty, it is Temptation. The consistency, color, and smell are completely different. The smell is actually really terrible. They are falsely advertising! Again do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite beauty products. I have been using it for several years and my skin looks great! I stopped using it for awhile because it was so expensive. I love that I can get it on Amazon at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> This product has exceeded my expectations!  I love it....</li>
            <li> I love this product it has made my skin so soft and silky. I would recommend this product to anyone.  It is very easy to use and with great results.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It scrubs well but can be a little oily. I recommend pouring some of the oil out an save it for later use.</li>
            <li> i use this item once a week, and now that i shake many hands within a weeks time, most people ask how my hands get soooo soft</li>
            <li> I have topical dermatitis/excema on my hands. Soap makes it worse. I keep this salt/oil scrub by my bathroom sink and use it several times a day. It is no miracle potion. It does the same as any other salt/oil mixure I&#x27;ve used. Which isn&#x27;t bad, just not any better. I guess I was hoping for some long term results or instant gratification. I think I would recieve the exact same results mixing salt with cooking oil on my own.</li>
            <li> Great product ! I like to use it for my manis and pedi! I recommend using it every week to KEEP your feet and hands baby soft! I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 10 yrs!! It&#x27;s a mist have!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it (Swisa Dead Sea Salt)  to all my friends&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon you got it to me quickly and intact.</li>
            <li> This scrub was the greasy and made the tub dangerous and did not do a thing for my rough skin.  I drained all the oil out of the container and just used the scrub crystals and even then was very greasy.</li>
            <li> This product smells HORRIBLE and there is WAY too much oil.  I was on my way to return this product when I dropped it, and it broke. On carpet. So the container is also flimsy.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my grandson who loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It reminds me of the spa treatment that leaves hands and feet super smooth and soft. I even used it on my elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> i saw alot of great reviews for this product but honestly it didnt really do anything for me....Honestly i have rough hands so when i saw this product i was extremely excited but after using it my hands simply felt like they were just washed they didnt feel like i just put some miracle scrub that suddenly made my hands soft NOPE not impressed but this is just my opinion im not trying to bash the product but it just didnt work for me :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-unsatisfied</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, works great!!! Downside...you have to keep using it once you start because the salt dries your feet out really badly and you need the heavy oil its in to keep your feet moisturized. Second, be careful what scent you order. I got some sort of mint this time and its rather over powering.  Fruit scents are more tolerable.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a large grain salt scrub in oil for a long time.  I like this product a lot.  The oil to salt ratio is perfect - enough salt to scrub with and enough oil to soften.  I also like that it&#x27;s not overly fragrant.  A slight scent but it doesn&#x27;t last very long so it won&#x27;t interfere with another scent you might want to wear.</li>
            <li> i love this product. smells good and does exactly what it is suppose to. my hands and feet are both baby smooth</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It makes your hands and feet really soft. I use it at night time before I go to bed. It&#x27;s really good for people that have really dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li> This is the product that I ordered but was sent a substitute product. I am not sure that I received the same  value.Since this was a gift for my wife, she decided to keep it anyway.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and think is it wonderful for feet and hands!  The price and service were excellent too!</li>
            <li> for hand and feet this product is so good and like the way&lt;br /&gt;it may my hand feel and feet</li>
            <li> I have been using SWISA BEAUTY sea salt mineral treatment for many years, so when I saw it advertised on Amazon at such a savings, I ordered 5 jars.  To my displeasure, the jars were NOT SWISA Beauty, but TEMPTATTION beauty and the product was different.  I think this is fraudulent advertising!  I would NOT recommend this product, if you are looking for Swisa Beauty&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift years ago and I make sure I never run out! It&#x27;s awesome. I use it on my feet and it really helps in between pedicures.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these for gifts because the pushy kiosk mall guy wanted to bundle this with a few other nail products for over $60.  The sea salt and oil treatment will get rid of dry skin and make hands and feet like new.  My only knock on the product is that it seems to be a little messy when you&#x27;re going to rinse it off and close the container.  I would definitely recommend doing this only on a countertop or bathroom in order to limit the amount of mess you make.</li>
            <li> Bought this and used it. Didn&#x27;t work that well. Never bought it again. Oh well! Didn&#x27;t like the smell either.</li>
            <li> I have really bad keratosis pilaris. All over my arms and my upper thighs. Its worse than most people I meet with the same issue. I know it&#x27;s for hands and feet but I only use it as a dry scrub for my problem areas before I shower. I use more oil after then heavy lotion as well. It clears me right up! I can&#x27;t live without it now. I tried some others but for some reason this works best.  Yes, there is a lot of oil but it&#x27;s best to keep it. If it gets dried out it gets rancid (lesson learned).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the correct one by swisa as well.  I actually like the smell but that&#x27;s just me, I get the mango.  I could care less about the smell anyway. My skin has been source of embarrassment for since I was a kid I&#x27;m just so happy I have the issue under control now.</li>
            <li> The Swissa product is a great product but the company sent me another dead sea salt &amp; I felt like rather than say they don&#x27;t have it they sent another product hoping I would want to keep it. The product it self is good I&#x27;d give it a 3 1/2. Swissa also had a moisture cream that is excellent! So order their products just not from that seller! Amazon customer service was really great in offering me a refund!</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars as I haven&#x27;t found something better that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin yet does the job. I love it especially in the winter months when my hands get really dry and crack to exfoliate the area and help keep moisturized a bit.</li>
            <li> Great exfolliant. The oil makes the shower a little messy, but leaves your skin smooth and soft</li>
