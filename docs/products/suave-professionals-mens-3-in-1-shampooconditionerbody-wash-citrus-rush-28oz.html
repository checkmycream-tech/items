            <li>Amazing product.</li>

            <li>Smells nice and is a 3-in1 shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been kind of picky about men&#x27;s soap scents.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and inviting.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent - works</li>
            <li>But this product turned out to be some of the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever had in fact my wife was very picky start using it</li>
            <li>perfect for any guy with or without hair who wants to get in and out without having to switch from one soap to another.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, works well for all three purposes as advertised.  </li>
            <li>but they stopped carrying it, glad to find it at a good price.</li>
            <li>This one smells good, has great texture and washes off right away.</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to buy just one product to do my hair and my body.</li>
            <li>It washes my body and hair and leaves me smelling good, clean and moist.</li>
            <li>but he did say that the smell was good and that it did what it was intended for, so it is a good body wash, he fusses over a lot of the stuff that I buy for him, but he didn&#x27;t fuss about this one, he used it and asked for more of the same thing, so it must be pretty good!</li>
            <li>I love that I have everything I need for a shower in one bottle.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, but I&#x27;m feeling sticker shock here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would love to purchase this product at Amazon, but not at these shakedown prices.</li>
            <li>I love using this one product for all of my showering needs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing to use and triples as a shampoo, conditioner, and body wash -</li>
            <li>, I think I like this better than Pert</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It was ok but felt diluted.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping for more but not luck.</li>
            <li>I love the body wash.  </li>
            <li>My favorite now.  </li>
            <li>so now I&#x27;m gonna have to buy more</li>
            <li>I guess :-)</li>
            <li>Mostly use this as body wash.</li>
            <li>It has outstanding lather.</li>
            <li>I would purchase again for that price not a penny more.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it as it has a refreshing scent..</li>
            <li>This is simply the best product I have found as well as the most affordable in this space .</li>
            <li>I KEEP MYSELF CLEAN WITH DISSS, AND IT WORKS BECAUSE THE LADIES LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>/&gt;some conditioning to it and good shampoo properties, so it&#x27;s pretty well suited as claimed.  </li>
            <li>Good price, same product and in stock.&lt;br /&gt;You probably won&#x27;t find models using this, but it&#x27;s a good all around 3 in 1 with&lt;br</li>
            <li>A very convenient product and a good idea.  </li>
            <li>and I love the clean smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is not that strong, but it does lather, no greasy feeling afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I bought this once from a major retailer and thought it was great, then couldn&#x27;t&lt;</li>
            <li>Smells fine and is easy on the budget.  </li>
            <li>and I can vouch for this stuff - because it has a nice clean fresh scent</li>
            <li>I love this stuff , cheap and leaves ones body and hair clean and conditioned .</li>
            <li>Fine as a body wash.</li>
            <li>The bottle is HUGE</li>
            <li>It does the job for relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>Do you want to wash your hair for cheap?  </li>
            <li>I did pay a cheap price</li>
            <li>Available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>well - although women (because it is cheap)</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a great value - you can get a lot for a very cheap price compared to other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice only having one bottle.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and fresh (like most men&#x27;s soaps), but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>I can clean my body, and my hair comes out clean and smooth as well - no tangles.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to - clean</li>
            <li>This wash has great cleaning power, doesn&#x27;t dry out hair nor leave it greasy.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s super cheap as well, which is why I keep buying it on subscribe-and-save.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, it&#x27;s not a cologne shampoo like Axe or Old Spice</li>
            <li>I love that there is a way for guys to use one product and get their whole body cleaned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely a good generic body &amp; hair cleanser</li>
            <li>I use on beard, scalp full body.</li>
            <li>Overall a good buy for body wash.</li>
            <li>Really nice light fragrance that is just basic clean smell.</li>
            <li>Great for a body wash, don&#x27;t recommend for hair wash thou, it will dry out your hair pretty much for sure.</li>
            <li>Fresh fragrance and leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>My hair always smell fresh and clean and it saved me time/money.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, I am not a man, BUT it makes my hair so clean and soft</li>
            <li>Was very pleased to get it here as it is a long walk in my Super store to get it when in buying groceries .</li>
            <li>It smells good and it leaves your hair feeling a little smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and seems to work great.</li>
            <li>(he is a man of few words lol...)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend to try, the price is worth it.</li>
            <li>The Suave 3-in-1 has become my favorite bodywash / shampoo / conditioner by far.</li>
            <li>The scent is not that powerful and doesn&#x27;t stick on you all day.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>I used it on my hair and felt it doesn&#x27;t clean very well</li>
            <li>the downside is, while the moisturizer/conditioner they use works great on my skin, its too much for my hair and by the end of the day my hair seems matted down almost greasy.</li>
            <li>It was not too strong for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t as strong or lingering as Axe, Gillette, Old Spice, etc.</li>
            <li>So I use it primarily as body wash, but the scent is too light, somewhat feminine; I want body wash to smell vigorous like Red Zone.  </li>
            <li>The current $2.88 is a great price and every once in a while you find digital coupons which work here .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and washes off pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Not even close to some of the higher end hair products out there.  </li>
            <li>I only wish they had more scents like pine and peppermint in the 3 in 1 .</li>
            <li>it doesnt seem to leave my hair dry or oily for a combo product, but clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also shave with it and oddly i find it to be clearly superior to many shaving oriented</li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair a bit more flat than I like it.</li>
            <li>Glad to see it here at a reasonable price after my local dollar store stopped stocking it.  </li>
            <li>Everything you want in a product to have an invigorating shower, full of energy and at the same time, fast.&lt;br /&gt;The materials are very gentle and pretty well cleaned!</li>
            <li>They love how it works and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and no need for multiple shampoo bottles (which seems to irritate my husband).</li>
            <li>like the large size</li>
            <li>It may not be as good with hard water, but then again&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been a bar soap guy for my whole life.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really comment on the shampooing ability, but cleans well as a body wash.</li>
            <li>the upside, this product is cheap enough to merit a trial run.</li>
            <li>really likes it,</li>
            <li>and I really like the citrus scent</li>
            <li>The whole family loves this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo mainly because of the cost, I was trying to find the cheapest one I could.</li>
            <li>this product has a run of the mill citrusy-clean scent but not unpleasant, and likely wouldnt clash with colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer a bit more lather but other than that it works well for and worth a try for anyone who is curious about how this would work.</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;Also, its made in the USA - I&#x27;m not sure if most are - just something I noticed.</li>
            <li>Just use one bottle for everything, no thinking in the early morning!</li>
            <li>Suave 3-in-1 men&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner/body wash seemed like a great value, but it was disappointing.</li>
            <li>I was surprised about the value of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;T.S. Charles&lt;br /&gt;Author of young adult book, &amp;#34;Consumed.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I find it open cap with them, haha.</li>
            <li>i like the price the smell, the thickness, and how well this stuff cleans my old gray hair and beard.</li>
            <li>The price seems more than a bit ridiculous now.</li>
            <li>Least expensive body wash I could find but still works great, and fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use this as a shampoo it leaves hair super greasy and oily looking after a few hours.</li>
            <li>It is neither strong nor too weak that it cannot be noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve used those products as well with no complaint other than price.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff , cheap and leaves ones body and hair clean and conditioned .</li>
            <li> Fine as a body wash.</li>
            <li> The bottle is HUGE</li>
            <li> It does the job for relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> Do you want to wash your hair for cheap?  </li>
            <li> I did pay a cheap price</li>
            <li> Available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> well - although women (because it is cheap)</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a great value - you can get a lot for a very cheap price compared to other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very nice only having one bottle.</li>
            <li> It smells clean and fresh (like most men&#x27;s soaps), but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> I can clean my body, and my hair comes out clean and smooth as well - no tangles.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to - clean</li>
            <li> This wash has great cleaning power, doesn&#x27;t dry out hair nor leave it greasy.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s super cheap as well, which is why I keep buying it on subscribe-and-save.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, it&#x27;s not a cologne shampoo like Axe or Old Spice</li>
            <li> I love that there is a way for guys to use one product and get their whole body cleaned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely a good generic body &amp; hair cleanser</li>
            <li> I use on beard, scalp full body.</li>
            <li> Overall a good buy for body wash.</li>
            <li> Really nice light fragrance that is just basic clean smell.</li>
            <li> Great for a body wash, don&#x27;t recommend for hair wash thou, it will dry out your hair pretty much for sure.</li>
            <li> Fresh fragrance and leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li> My hair always smell fresh and clean and it saved me time/money.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, I am not a man, BUT it makes my hair so clean and soft</li>
            <li> Was very pleased to get it here as it is a long walk in my Super store to get it when in buying groceries .</li>
            <li> It smells good and it leaves your hair feeling a little smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and seems to work great.</li>
            <li> (he is a man of few words lol...)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend to try, the price is worth it.</li>
            <li> The Suave 3-in-1 has become my favorite bodywash / shampoo / conditioner by far.</li>
            <li> The scent is not that powerful and doesn&#x27;t stick on you all day.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> I used it on my hair and felt it doesn&#x27;t clean very well</li>
            <li> the downside is, while the moisturizer/conditioner they use works great on my skin, its too much for my hair and by the end of the day my hair seems matted down almost greasy.</li>
            <li> It was not too strong for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t as strong or lingering as Axe, Gillette, Old Spice, etc.</li>
            <li> So I use it primarily as body wash, but the scent is too light, somewhat feminine; I want body wash to smell vigorous like Red Zone.  </li>
            <li> The current $2.88 is a great price and every once in a while you find digital coupons which work here .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and washes off pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Not even close to some of the higher end hair products out there.  </li>
            <li> I only wish they had more scents like pine and peppermint in the 3 in 1 .</li>
            <li> it doesnt seem to leave my hair dry or oily for a combo product, but clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also shave with it and oddly i find it to be clearly superior to many shaving oriented</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair a bit more flat than I like it.</li>
            <li> Glad to see it here at a reasonable price after my local dollar store stopped stocking it.  </li>
            <li> Everything you want in a product to have an invigorating shower, full of energy and at the same time, fast.&lt;br /&gt;The materials are very gentle and pretty well cleaned!</li>
            <li> They love how it works and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and no need for multiple shampoo bottles (which seems to irritate my husband).</li>
            <li> like the large size</li>
            <li> It may not be as good with hard water, but then again&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been a bar soap guy for my whole life.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on the shampooing ability, but cleans well as a body wash.</li>
            <li> the upside, this product is cheap enough to merit a trial run.</li>
            <li> really likes it,</li>
            <li> and I really like the citrus scent</li>
            <li> The whole family loves this product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo mainly because of the cost, I was trying to find the cheapest one I could.</li>
            <li> this product has a run of the mill citrusy-clean scent but not unpleasant, and likely wouldnt clash with colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer a bit more lather but other than that it works well for and worth a try for anyone who is curious about how this would work.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;Also, its made in the USA - I&#x27;m not sure if most are - just something I noticed.</li>
            <li> Just use one bottle for everything, no thinking in the early morning!</li>
            <li> Suave 3-in-1 men&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner/body wash seemed like a great value, but it was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was surprised about the value of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;T.S. Charles&lt;br /&gt;Author of young adult book, &amp;#34;Consumed.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I find it open cap with them, haha.</li>
            <li> i like the price the smell, the thickness, and how well this stuff cleans my old gray hair and beard.</li>
            <li> The price seems more than a bit ridiculous now.</li>
            <li> Least expensive body wash I could find but still works great, and fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this as a shampoo it leaves hair super greasy and oily looking after a few hours.</li>
            <li> It is neither strong nor too weak that it cannot be noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve used those products as well with no complaint other than price.</li>
            <li> This rinses clean and leaves nothing behind.</li>
            <li> I had been ordering this , toilet paper , razor blades , paper towels and septic treatment at prices it would cost to purchase local without having to pay for a assistant to go out .</li>
            <li> Getting old is no fun .</li>
            <li> Hope Amazon offers some solid regular teasers to help the elderly and disabled get what they need during the year .</li>
            <li> It seems heavy on the conditioning agent, which can make normal or oily hair look greasy after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> AXE products were all hype and left me feeling still dirty at 50% more cost .</li>
            <li> and it is not available from Amazon direct and where it is on Amazon costs 3 times what it is local in a store .</li>
            <li> We guys don&#x27;t care much about this stuff like the ladies, we&#x27;d rather be done with it and get back to Battlefield, but 3 in 1 is just plain lazy man.</li>
            <li> Some of these 3 in 1 type body washes dry my skin out, this one doesnt which I like...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other body washes before but they often leave the feeling of lotion / not completely coming off.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is it burns a little bit when exposed to sensitive areas, which makes me wonder what sort of noxious chemicals are in it... could be gentler.  </li>
            <li> I have ever spent on bodycare product.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and on time, no issues.</li>
            <li> may feel dry after wash, so one star less.</li>
            <li> my local WalMart and Target both keep this in stock for a little bit less.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way  </li>
            <li> , also seems a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than other brands but</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it for shampoo except in a pinch since I use dandruff shampoo -- just bought it because it was cheaper than any other body wash.</li>
            <li> (compared to various brands and hotel toiletries I&#x27;ve used in the past).  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes reading some of the reviews, but it left my skin and hair dry, and the smell was odd and artificial.</li>
            <li> Perhaps layering on a cologne or other scents would help cover the odd citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t what I would typically look for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Edited to add that I paid less than $2 for one of these bottles.  </li>
            <li> stuff is a little watery and smells like lemon-lime Gatorade.</li>
            <li> product is very hard to find, but I&#x27;m open to trying another scent if I find one in stock.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and have no plans on changing it.  </li>
            <li> You might be skeptical of an all-in-one shampoo/conditioner/bodywash as I was, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s always sold out at my local store.</li>
            <li> They be slidin&#x27; down my pants and be like ooooh papi u smell goooooood!!!</li>
            <li> The citrus scent comes through as a weird perfume-like smell.</li>
            <li> Sad ....</li>
            <li> The Citrus isn&#x27;t a bad smell.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> But if you have itchy scalp and flake alot I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it makes the problem worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love that I have everything I need for a shower in one bottle. It makes life easier, and it smells good too!</li>
            <li> I bought this once from a major retailer and thought it was great, then couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;find there again.  So amazon to the rescue.  Good price, same product and in stock.&lt;br /&gt;You probably won&#x27;t find models using this, but it&#x27;s a good all around 3 in 1 with&lt;br /&gt;some conditioning to it and good shampoo properties, so it&#x27;s pretty well suited as claimed.  Has a very good light citrus&lt;br /&gt;scent and washes off pretty well.  It may not be as good with hard water, but then again&lt;br /&gt;what is.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to try, the price is worth it.</li>
            <li> This was cheaper than anything I could find and the bottle was larger than I imagined it to be. The smell is nice, it&#x27;s not a cologne shampoo like Axe or Old Spice but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that - I&#x27;ve used those products as well with no complaint other than price. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to - clean you.&lt;br /&gt;Also, its made in the USA - I&#x27;m not sure if most are - just something I noticed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and seems to work great. Very smooth and lathers up good. Fresh fragrance and leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li> this product has a run of the mill citrusy-clean scent but not unpleasant, and likely wouldnt clash with colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it cleans skin well and has moisturizers. it doesnt seem to leave my hair dry or oily for a combo product, but clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also shave with it and oddly i find it to be clearly superior to many shaving oriented products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and is a 3-in1 shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. Perfect if you&#x27;re trying to keep your product count to a minimum.</li>
            <li> The Suave 3-in-1 has become my favorite bodywash / shampoo / conditioner by far. I absolutely love this product, but I&#x27;m feeling sticker shock here on Amazon. The cheapest one I&#x27;m seeing is $9.99 + 5.99 s/h. The one that ships with Prime is almost $18 for one bottle. My local Walmart sells this for about $2.50, and at their website you can get a 4-pack for about $10. I would love to purchase this product at Amazon, but not at these shakedown prices.</li>
            <li> I love using this one product for all of my showering needs. I can clean my body, and my hair comes out clean and smooth as well - no tangles. This rinses clean and leaves nothing behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been kind of picky about men&#x27;s soap scents. This one is great. It smells clean and fresh (like most men&#x27;s soaps), but not overbearing. It&#x27;s refreshing to use and triples as a shampoo, conditioner, and body wash - so all of your basic cleaning needs are consolidated into one convenient bottle, giving your shower or shower caddy some extra space. Also, it&#x27;s a great value - you can get a lot for a very cheap price compared to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it&#x27;s fair to mention that I have seen this product cheaper elsewhere - my local WalMart and Target both keep this in stock for a little bit less. (UPDATE 9/3/14: I can still buy this at Wal-Mart for about $4).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product - would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessings!</li>
            <li> Good smell, lathers nice, I think I like this better than Pert Plus 3 in one.  Try both and choose what ever one you like but both are great.  I only have one thing in my shower!!</li>
            <li> I love that there is a way for guys to use one product and get their whole body cleaned. The smell is nice and inviting.  It is neither strong nor too weak that it cannot be noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first experience with 3-in-1 products, and everything, from price to quality, were wonderful.</li>
            <li> Cleans thoroughly, leave almost no smell. Great for a body wash, don&#x27;t recommend for hair wash thou, it will dry out your hair pretty much for sure.</li>
            <li> I was surprised about the value of this product. The price on Amazon compared to the price at Walmart except here, there isn&#x27;t any taxes. Despite this advantage, this product isn&#x27;t the highest quality of shampoo by any means, but it will get the job done! You can&#x27;t find a better value product out there!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. It washes my body and hair and leaves me smelling good, clean and moist. What more can you ask for? Best $2.88 (Walmart) I have ever spent on bodycare product. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s always sold out at my local store. If you see it stock up!</li>
            <li> Smells fine and is easy on the budget.  The bottle lasts me about 2 months. I get it with subscribed and save to sweeten the deal.</li>
            <li> It does the job for relatively cheap. Girlfriend likes the smell (I don&#x27;t notice it). Very nice only having one bottle.</li>
            <li> Do you want to smell like citrus?  Then douse yourself with lime juice.  Do you want to wash your hair for cheap?  Then buy this.</li>
            <li> I have been a bar soap guy for my whole life. I bought this one because we have guests over once in a while and I figured our male friends can use this. But I tried it and I absolutely love it. I don&#x27;t use it as shampoo/conditioner but just as a body wash. I&#x27;ve tried other body washes before but they often leave the feeling of lotion / not completely coming off. This one smells good, has great texture and washes off right away. I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> One of the best shampoo products I have used. You will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband because he steals my shampoo for body wash and shampoo. It smells great and he really doesn&#x27;t have any hair on his buzzed head so it perfect.</li>
            <li> It was ok but felt diluted. I did pay a cheap price but I was hoping for more but not luck.</li>
            <li> This 3 in 1 shampoo/conditioner/body wash is all you need to fulfill you bathing needs.  Why bombard your shower with countless products when one is all you need.  I use this product everyday and have no plans on changing it.  As a person who’s always on the go, this product has helped me shave minutes off my prep time in the morning.  I couldn’t be happier with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.S. Charles&lt;br /&gt;Author of young adult book, &amp;#34;Consumed.&amp;#34; Available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product for those of us trying to speed up showering and yet not sacrifice shampoo and conditioning.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The product works well for all 3 use cases, and therefore saves time as you can wash everything in one fell swoop.  I just wish that the 3-in-1 Suave came in the Ocean scent that you can find in their 2-in-1.  The Citrus isn&#x27;t a bad smell. It just isn&#x27;t what I would typically look for.</li>
            <li> I love the body wash.  As a man I don&#x27;t want 12 bottles of stuff to take a shower.  Give me one bottle to wash, shampoo etc and I am a happy camper!  Nice scent - works well - although women (because it is cheap) will not use.  My wife has 12 bottles in the shower and I can vouch for this stuff - because it has a nice clean fresh scent and I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and her stuff!!</li>
            <li> Really nice light fragrance that is just basic clean smell. The bottle is HUGE but I like that it&#x27;s an all in one, so it&#x27;s a shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. Perfect for sleep away camp.</li>
            <li> My favorite now.  Nice to be able to buy just one product to do my hair and my body.</li>
            <li> I order those via Subscribe and Save for my husband. doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and no need for multiple shampoo bottles (which seems to irritate my husband). Just use one bottle for everything, no thinking in the early morning!</li>
            <li> Everything you want in a product to have an invigorating shower, full of energy and at the same time, fast.&lt;br /&gt;The materials are very gentle and pretty well cleaned!</li>
            <li> Wanted to find my husband something that he can shower with, wash and condition his hair at the same time. Smells great,</li>
            <li> Not even close to some of the higher end hair products out there.  I had high hopes reading some of the reviews, but it left my skin and hair dry, and the smell was odd and artificial. Good price though.</li>
            <li> You might be skeptical of an all-in-one shampoo/conditioner/bodywash as I was, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised. This wash has great cleaning power, doesn&#x27;t dry out hair nor leave it greasy. And it&#x27;s super cheap as well, which is why I keep buying it on subscribe-and-save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good generic body &amp; hair cleanser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used separate bottles for S/C/Body Wash but after discovering this I&#x27;ve been converted. My hair always smell fresh and clean and it saved me time/money.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo mainly because of the cost, I was trying to find the cheapest one I could. But this product turned out to be some of the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever had in fact my wife was very picky start using it and so has my daughter so now I&#x27;m gonna have to buy more I guess :-)</li>
            <li> Good fragrance. Cheaper than other brands but good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair may feel dry after wash, so one star less.</li>
            <li> Mostly use this as body wash. I can&#x27;t really comment on the shampooing ability, but cleans well as a body wash. Scent isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I loved the aroma. It was not too strong for my sensitive skin. The product is a great value. It has outstanding lather.</li>
            <li> perfect for any guy with or without hair who wants to get in and out without having to switch from one soap to another.</li>
            <li> Suave 3-in-1 men&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner/body wash seemed like a great value, but it was disappointing. It seems heavy on the conditioning agent, which can make normal or oily hair look greasy after a couple of uses. The citrus scent comes through as a weird perfume-like smell. It&#x27;s almost as though the scent is accidental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, this product is cheap enough to merit a trial run. (I downgraded it to a handsoap refill after realizing it wasn&#x27;t working well as shampoo or body wash for the household.) The scent isn&#x27;t as strong or lingering as Axe, Gillette, Old Spice, etc. body washes, which could be a plus for some people. Perhaps layering on a cologne or other scents would help cover the odd citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very hard to find, but I&#x27;m open to trying another scent if I find one in stock.</li>
            <li> I like this one it covers everything hair skin. I use on beard, scalp full body. It leaves a good scent. I use a tea tree oil based soap that doesn&#x27;t leave a good after scent. This 3 in 1 shampoo covers that scent nicely with a pleasant lemon. I recommend for anyone. Feel my family uses it when I leave it around lol. I find it open cap with them, haha. I close the cap when I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s a good size and good price, lasts for a good while too.</li>
            <li> The best on the market. I buy it a dozen at a time.</li>
            <li> Works well and a good price. I like the convenience of a 3 in 1 instead of needing 2 or 3 bottles in the shower.</li>
            <li> i like the price the smell, the thickness, and how well this stuff cleans my old gray hair and beard.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I like to simplify multiple products into one. I used to just mix separate shampoo, conditioner, and body wash all into one container and then shake it until it mixed well. I no longer need to do that.</li>
            <li> MAN, I USE THIS ALLLL DA TIME. I KEEP MYSELF CLEAN WITH DISSS, AND IT WORKS BECAUSE THE LADIES LOVE IT! They be slidin&#x27; down my pants and be like ooooh papi u smell goooooood!!!</li>
            <li> The scent is not that powerful and doesn&#x27;t stick on you all day. However, my girlfriend constantly makes remarks about how it makes my skin softer. Will buy again</li>
            <li> The price is right. It&#x27;s functional. The conditioner leaves my hair a bit more flat than I like it. Next time, no conditioner.</li>
            <li> Least expensive body wash I could find but still works great, and fresh scent.  Only complaint is it burns a little bit when exposed to sensitive areas, which makes me wonder what sort of noxious chemicals are in it... could be gentler.  Don&#x27;t use it for shampoo except in a pinch since I use dandruff shampoo -- just bought it because it was cheaper than any other body wash.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, I am not a man, BUT it makes my hair so clean and soft and I love the clean smell.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and on time, no issues. Works well for my needs. Would order this item again. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this as a shampoo it leaves hair super greasy and oily looking after a few hours. Fine as a body wash.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and had it sent to my Grandson. He was happy to have it so he didn&#x27;t have to use his mom and sister&#x27;s stuff.</li>
            <li> It smells good and it leaves your hair feeling a little smooth. But if you have itchy scalp and flake alot I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it because it makes the problem worst.</li>
            <li> We like that it is an all in one product, smells great, and was available to just order from home.</li>
            <li> I used it on my hair and felt it doesn&#x27;t clean very well (compared to various brands and hotel toiletries I&#x27;ve used in the past).  So I use it primarily as body wash, but the scent is too light, somewhat feminine; I want body wash to smell vigorous like Red Zone.  In summary, it&#x27;s my opinion that shampoo and body wash should not be lumped into one.  We guys don&#x27;t care much about this stuff like the ladies, we&#x27;d rather be done with it and get back to Battlefield, but 3 in 1 is just plain lazy man.</li>
            <li> Purchased for $2.45. The scent is not that strong, but it does lather, no greasy feeling afterwards.  I would purchase again for that price not a penny more.</li>
            <li> im writing this from what my husband told me...&lt;br /&gt;he really likes it, (he is a man of few words lol...) but he did say that the smell was good and that it did what it was intended for, so it is a good body wash, he fusses over a lot of the stuff that I buy for him, but he didn&#x27;t fuss about this one, he used it and asked for more of the same thing, so it must be pretty good!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way  I use daily</li>
            <li> A very convenient product and a good idea.  Glad to see it here at a reasonable price after my local dollar store stopped stocking it.  Nice scent, works well for all three purposes as advertised.  Perfect when you&#x27;re in a rush.  I&#x27;d prefer a bit more lather but other than that it works well for and worth a try for anyone who is curious about how this would work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to buy a product that does so many things. It smells great and leaves my hair feeling and looking good.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and my son both use this.  They love how it works and how long it lasts. Great value too.</li>
            <li> I like the way it cleans and I really like the citrus scent, also seems a little goes a long way. Some of these 3 in 1 type body washes dry my skin out, this one doesnt which I like...the downside is, while the moisturizer/conditioner they use works great on my skin, its too much for my hair and by the end of the day my hair seems matted down almost greasy. I will continue to use it as it has a refreshing scent..,just not on my hair.</li>
            <li> The whole family loves this product.  I use it as a body wash, and I use it as both body wash and shampoo for my son.  Even though my husband likes it too, this isn&#x27;t just for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add that I paid less than $2 for one of these bottles.  The price seems more than a bit ridiculous now.</li>
            <li> great cleaning shampoo and body wash.  the citrus smell wakes me up in the morning.  Another great prices suave product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short time but I like it and I like the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;70+</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man, and I don&#x27;t put a lot of thought into my body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a little watery and smells like lemon-lime Gatorade. I feel like I&#x27;m in a Gatorade commercial when i use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly it works on hair as a shampoo and conditioner. Well, so does a bar of soap, technically. I have a buzz cut so I can&#x27;t comment on the hair part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the large size so I don&#x27;t have to bother buying body wash as often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap that smells good to me.  Lathers well and the size lasts for awhile.  Overall a good buy for body wash.</li>
            <li> hard-to-find locally, good stuff that meets all three requirements well.  A dedicated shampoo with conditioner may make hair smoother, but this does well enough.</li>
            <li> I found this at my local mart but they stopped carrying it, glad to find it at a good price. Give it&#x27;s try.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff , cheap and leaves ones body and hair clean and conditioned . Was very pleased to get it here as it is a long walk in my Super store to get it when in buying groceries . Getting old is no fun . This is simply the best product I have found as well as the most affordable in this space . AXE products were all hype and left me feeling still dirty at 50% more cost . I only wish they had more scents like pine and peppermint in the 3 in 1 . I have come back and purchased this several times as a add on item to ease my walking burden when shopping as well as it is cheaper this way . The current $2.88 is a great price and every once in a while you find digital coupons which work here .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came back to order and it is not available from Amazon direct and where it is on Amazon costs 3 times what it is local in a store . Sad ....who shut in wouldn&#x27;t rather order online then have someone go to the store for them . Hope Amazon offers some solid regular teasers to help the elderly and disabled get what they need during the year . I had been ordering this , toilet paper , razor blades , paper towels and septic treatment at prices it would cost to purchase local without having to pay for a assistant to go out . It is so wonderful to get what you need on your own . Now I will have to be beholding again and have someone shop for me .</li>
