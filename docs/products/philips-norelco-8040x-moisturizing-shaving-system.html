    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I know Phillips-Norelco has excellent customer service, so I called to see if they could help me.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with it.</li>
            <li>I have to say inbuilt moisturizer dispenser is the best feature   </li>
            <li>The best combination would be a SpeedXL used with Edge shaving lotion.  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed!  </li>
            <li>The gel/lotion that this puts out is wonderful and the blades just glide over the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I was quite impressed.  </li>
            <li>This is the best version of this shaver yet.  </li>
            <li>Shaving with a blade gave the best results however...</li>
            <li>Great razor...buy one!</li>
            <li>Both of these shavers give an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for the best electric razor on the market.</li>
            <li>It takes about 6 minutes to get an awesome shave with this.</li>
            <li>these might not be the world&#x27;s best electric razors.</li>
            <li>Head design is perfect for trimming beards.  </li>
            <li>Very happy to be an 8040X owner.</li>
            <li>If you are buying this to replace another electric shaver - this is a very good choice for the price.   </li>
            <li>This is a very good product , I am a Norelco fan</li>
            <li>Charging and battery life also seem to be very good.    </li>
            <li>Coupled with its compact size, I think that the \\&quot;weekend getaway (not for business)\\&quot; may be the ideal application of this razor.        </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because despite all the downfalls, it FELT GOOD!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d be happy.  </li>
            <li>Not to say, however, that they don&#x27;t contribute slightly to a great shave.    </li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I&#x27;ll still happily use this shaver.</li>
            <li>This, coupled with its lightweight, compact design, good battery life and travel lock make it ideal for weekend getaways.  </li>
            <li>The size of this unit is great it fits in my hand</li>
            <li>So I did some research and landed on this razor as a happy medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great if you shave twice a day.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t work for my face, so I have to say, Great device, wouldn&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great choice.  </li>
            <li>it works great</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li>Great features for the money.</li>
            <li>The stuff doesn&#x27;t smell too great either.  </li>
            <li>The stuff doesn&#x27;t smell too great either.  </li>
            <li>Happily surrendered my razor blades...</li>
            <li>so I decided to buy this great deal.  </li>
            <li>It worked great.</li>
            <li>This shaver works great for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>PROBABLY GREAT FOR WOMENS&#x27; LEGS</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver.</li>
            <li>and it works beyond amazing!.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First let me say that the most impressive feature to me is that it does NOT leave my face burning after using.  </li>
            <li>You can even use your own shaving cream in addition to or instead of the shaving gel in the razor!</li>
            <li>THE MOST COMFORTABLE &amp; CLOSEST SHAVE THAT I&#x27;VE EVER HAD!!!!</li>
            <li>It provides a smooth shave, probably the best shave I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  </li>
            <li>Good battery life   </li>
            <li>Good battery life    </li>
            <li>For years I had been looking for an electric razor that would come close to being as good as a blade for shaving with no luck.</li>
            <li>This made me give up my beloved Arcitec.</li>
            <li>- Feels good with the Nivea lotion...</li>
            <li>Found that I can get a good shave without the Nivea lotion by just wetting my face with water or a soapy solution.      </li>
            <li>It looks great and makes a nice ornament for my bathroom.</li>
            <li>If I wasn&#x27;t they have a return policy after the 21 day intro period that makes this fairly risk free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Good:  </li>
            <li>Not So Good:  </li>
            <li>I loved the 7737.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not as good.</li>
            <li>Charging the shaver in 4 hours sounds like a good idea, but the manual strictly admonishes against overcharging.  </li>
            <li>as good as the shaving conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good shaver for the price.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is very good and the recharger stand is easy.  </li>
            <li>This shaver has Li-Ion, the best kind of battery available, with no memory effect.  </li>
            <li>My wife was super impressed and to quote another review on this site....</li>
            <li>The unit was reliable, never having needed any change in parts, and did a pretty good job of giving the best approximation to a razor blade shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver might be great for getting rid of that preteen peach fuzz, but for most adults you can grow hair faster than this thing can cut it.</li>
            <li>the lotion smells really really good and does a amazing job on the face too.     </li>
            <li>It feels good and has a nice aftershave smell that my wife also likes</li>
            <li>At first I thought this was the greatest razor ever.  </li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>Stay tuned!ic, BUT the shaving cream mechanism did allow for a more pleasant shaving experience, but I think I would prefer just spreading some cream manually over my face instead.  </li>
            <li>The sideburns trimmer was easy to add to shaver and worked great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaving gel makes for a more pleasant shaving experience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After charging the shaver for the recommended four hours (reading the instructions is also a good idea) using the cartridge of Nivea to fill the razor&#x27;s cartridge was surprisingly neat and easy to do.  </li>
            <li>This is a very light shaver (weight wise).  </li>
            <li>It gives an amazing close shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;d recommend this shaver, it has some great features you&#x27;ll probably enjoy.  </li>
            <li>A closer shave would be nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A closer shave would be nice too.    </li>
            <li>I have never been an electric razor kind of guy.  </li>
            <li>And to be honest, I tried this electric shaver for close to a month.  </li>
            <li>Hi,  I own 8040 for 2.5 months now.    </li>
            <li>As I said I own the shaver for 2.5 months now.</li>
            <li>I used it in the shower, which was nice, but the time it took made me begin to worry about all that water wastage.  </li>
            <li>Another reviewers have aptly stated the deficiencies with ths scent</li>
            <li>On top of that, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do as good a job at shaving, either.</li>
            <li>but I realize it is a nice feature for those who may need the conditioner to avoid skin irritation.</li>
            <li>The travel locking feature is a nice touch but the travel case is a joke.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The travel locking feature is a nice touch but the travel case is a joke.    </li>
            <li>I decided to try this electric razor since i really liked the lotion dispensing feature.</li>
            <li>but it will be handy.    </li>
            <li>but i did liked it cause i could use shaving cream and in the shower with it.     </li>
            <li>It comes with a nice travel</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sideburn attachment is a nice thought, but there was no ear/nose trimmer which I have seen in $20 Norelco</li>
            <li>The lotion that comes along with the shaver is awesome and goes along really well with the Nivea after shave lotion that I was already used to.</li>
            <li>After reading some reviews that suggested the shaver worked perfectly well without it squirting glop everywhere, I was satisfied this was the right purchase.    </li>
            <li>i could not believe how great it shaved, the lotion helped the razor slide very very easily and smooth along my face and afterwards</li>
            <li>I have been a Norelco customer for many years and up to this point I was always very pleased</li>
            <li>My Philishave is in perfect working condition, however required new blades; so I decided to take this opportunity to upgrade to the sleeker 8040X.   </li>
            <li>Some people say they&#x27;ve experienced success making their own concoction of lotion, but I haven&#x27;t tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m believing more and more that there is no substitute for the good ole faithful water/shaving creme/razor.  </li>
            <li>This was another seller point for me as my face dries out very easily</li>
            <li>I have never used an electric razor before and found the Norelco very easy touse</li>
            <li>product is well designed, it&#x27;s very sleek and cool to use, the battery life is good, and the travel bag is awesome.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco performed perfectly (yes I did replace the rechargeable batteries after 7 years of use).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought the razor as a replacement for my old Norelco Advantage and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This shaver was used in the shower, so there was plenty of (acqua) moisture, in addition to gel moisturizer, available for a close shave, but the shave was not as good as it should have</li>
            <li>This shaver was used in the shower, so there was plenty of (acqua) moisture, in addition to gel moisturizer, available for a close shave, but the shave was not as good as it should have been.    </li>
            <li>I bought the 8040x a couple of days ago and even I am surprised at how impressed I am with the shaver.</li>
            <li>It gives your a nice close shave, and it is shower safe, which saves me a lot of time.  </li>
            <li>To summarize: This is an excellent razor, but it is not worth the money or the hassle you have to go through to make it work effectively!      </li>
            <li>but honestly my Mach 3 has been good to me, so I never thought it worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do wish there was some kind of indicator on the unit that would let me know how much charge remains, but all in all I am quite happy with this.</li>
            <li>It gave me very smooth shave and each shave took about 3 min.</li>
            <li>His take: very comfortable to hold, the heads conform to his face well</li>
            <li>The Nivea lotion filling and dispensing was easy and really helped provide a smooth shave and a wonderful after-shave feeling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;THe VERY first thing I DID NOT like (ZERO stars for this!!) was the plastic \\&quot;Clamshell</li>
            <li>OK,</li>
            <li>One truly outstanding feature of this shaver is an inbuilt moisturizer dispenser, which you can control while you shave.      </li>
            <li>This razor makes it so much more convinient to make this happen.    </li>
            <li>I have to spend quite a bit more time getting the shave that I need.  </li>
            <li>I have to spend quite a bit more time getting the shave that I need.  </li>
            <li>Compared to most closed-head designs, this makes for even more time that the razor requires with each use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than the one built into the Arcitec.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this appliance over some of the more costly ones.</li>
            <li>In retrospect, I think the SpeedXL was a much better shaver.</li>
            <li>Best razor ever in my opinion, even better than the massive 5-blade razor they have out now.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is much more convenient to use this.</li>
            <li>You just stand 10 more minutes under water.</li>
            <li>If it saves time  than ok.    </li>
            <li>Interestingly, it noted there was a transition time.  </li>
            <li>the shaves were noticeably better and quicker.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m quite pleased now.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to work best as a daily shaver, rather than one to use with a couple day or more stubble on the face.  </li>
            <li>I love shaving in the shower - saves time,</li>
            <li>I am able to shave every day with out irritation.  </li>
            <li>I gave 5 stars because I am now able to shave every day with comfort and effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>This is an interesting gadget.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used too many electric razors</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that I shave a bit more surface area than he (I also shave my head,)</li>
            <li>Enjoy your shaving now with this one!</li>
            <li>The lather function also has an interesting refill tube that you twist to expose the pump.       </li>
            <li>I find it more appealing to the Norelco arcitec 1090.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver and will buy another when this one quits.</li>
            <li>Whomever led this product development team is making the top tier team look bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>As I said before I love the lotion feature.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>Every time you use this razor, the better the shave is,because your skn starts to adapt.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go more than 2 days without using it.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the shower every day and love it.  </li>
            <li>and i believe most people who buy these, they do because they need the waterproof/wet shaving feature.    </li>
            <li>My decision: I decided to go with the 8040 because I was comfortable with the 4 hour charge, though a 1.5 hour would be nice.</li>
            <li>Wonderful shaver and very well worth the money.     </li>
            <li>: I think his face looks better, the shave may not be as close</li>
            <li>looks better all around.</li>
            <li>I realized the need for a good electric fairly soon due to the length of time it takes to get a good manual shave.  </li>
            <li>Other than those two trivialities, I am extremely happy with the Philips Norelco 8040X shaver.am extremely happy with the Philips Norelco 8040X shaver.</li>
            <li>I was able to get good shaving results beginning with my first use.  </li>
            <li>A blade always wins on optimum closeness, but takes longer and is more \\&quot;dangerous\\&quot; to those of us with a not so fine touch.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and easy to use and gives the best shave for an electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the manufacturer decided it was a brilliant move to put the contents into a blister pack inside the package box.  </li>
            <li>I have heard that the Norelco brand is pretty good</li>
            <li>Also, I liked the idea of the battery full indicator.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li>The results were the best, smoothest and most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever seen from an electric razor - definitely comparable to using a razor blade without the nicks and cuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I welcome any shaving advice to help my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>very brefly, I am a 79 year old man and, after many electric razors mostly norelco, I have owned, this is he best one yet.    </li>
            <li>The most important thing is the shave.</li>
            <li>in all, the most important feature of a razor is how it performs.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic to be able to shave in the shower.    </li>
            <li>But I was even more fortunate.</li>
            <li>Also, I always shave in the shower, as I&#x27;ve found I get the smoothest, most comfortable shave that way.</li>
            <li>It feels GREAT on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>JUST AS CLOSE AS A RAZOR &amp; WAY MORE COMFORTABLE WITH ZERO NICKS.</li>
            <li>OR SO, THAT YOUR SHAVES WILL GET CLOSER &amp; MORE COMFORTABLE.</li>
            <li>The best of both worlds.. electric shaving, wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco 8040X provides the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>It resulted in a very sticky shave....not good at all.</li>
            <li>The new battery makes for a much more compact and lighter body which is good when traveling.  </li>
            <li>Other than that this was a great buy!</li>
            <li>package comes with a squeeze bottle full of a very pleasant smelling lotion, that you inject into the back of the shaver.  </li>
            <li>The unit does not shave very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The unit does not shave very quickly.  </li>
            <li>So if your looking for a good razor that will apply moisturizer as you shave, that you can use in the shower and ultimately if you want a razor that does an excellent job (in my experience just as good as a wet shave) this is the razor for you!!ower and ultimately if you want a razor that does an excellent job (in my experience just as good as a wet shave)</li>
            <li>The razor is easy to fill up with shaving gel.</li>
            <li>It cleans easily and is compact.</li>
            <li>Cleanup was also easy.</li>
            <li>dispensing the lotion into the shaver is really easy.     </li>
            <li>My fear was that the smell would be overly strong, but this was not the case in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all the good points:  - Sleek looking shaver - Also the blue looks good  - Interesting filling system for the Nivea lotion  </li>
            <li>I have used Norelco before but this was my first Moisturizing Shaving System but to be honest</li>
            <li>Other than those complaints, the razor shaves smoothly and closely, and I am VERY impressed with its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t claim to be getting significantly closer shaves with the Norelco, I can say that I enjoy the experience much more, and my skin feels happier for it.  </li>
            <li>but if you insist, any gel like Gillette&#x27;s Edge works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Well designed, light weight and easy to use   </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not close and at best it takes half capacity of the shaver&#x27;s conditioner tank.</li>
            <li>The 4 hour charge time is just fine for me</li>
            <li>The 4 hour charge time is just fine for me</li>
            <li>I used Nivea for Men shaving gel instead, applied by hand to the face before shaving, and that works just fine.    </li>
            <li>I may not be able to forgive it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to quick recharges on my Panasonic, but this unit took so many hours.</li>
            <li>for the shave itself, the results were lackluster -- Could not get the same close shave as my Panasonic, BUT the shaving cream mechanism did allow for a more pleasant shaving experience, but I think I would prefer just spreading some cream manually over my face instead.  </li>
            <li>Its shaving heads are very compact and pivot nicely so you can easily reach all contours of your face and hard-to-reach areas, e.g. under your nose.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The fact that you couldn&#x27;t get in contact with water or even in a shower used to be a huge disadvantage to electric razors.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d recommend this shaver, it has some great features you&#x27;ll probably enjoy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Notwithstanding bells and whistles, the primary function of any razor is to offer a smooth, comfortable shave and</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been just a huge fan of electric razors over the years.  </li>
            <li>In either case, it uses Nivea for Men shaving conditioner to smooth the razor over your face as you shave.  </li>
            <li>This has been, and still remains, a great razor if used properly.  </li>
            <li>Definitely great for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaver is easy to clean and charge.  </li>
            <li>Shaver is easy to use, charge, clean.  </li>
            <li>Again, the results were fantastic.</li>
            <li>The shave is unbleivabley  smooth.  </li>
            <li>This shaver with accompanying moisturizer makes shaving a breeze and incredibly comfortable.</li>
            <li>The shape of it is pleasing and comfortable in the hand as you shave.  </li>
            <li>I wish the upscale model cleaned as efficiently, but then, as I facetiously stated in another review my primary use for that pricey unit is as a display item now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just pull off the tracker head and lightly press on the trimmer attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just pull off the tracker head and lightly press on the trimmer attachment.    </li>
            <li>for the moisturizing part, the lotion smelled nice but it didn&#x27;t really add to the experience.  </li>
            <li>Although it feels comfortable when I shave, it refuses to finish the job.  </li>
            <li>There are three models available in this series, the 8020, the 8040 and the 8060.</li>
            <li>it was part of the cell phone hands free law.</li>
            <li>Having used the \\&quot;old fashioned shaving creme and razor\\&quot; for years, I thought it would be good to try one of the newer electric shaving systems.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and does leave the skin on your face feeling refreshed afterward (even if it&#x27;s also apparent that the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; is just from some alcohol in the formula).  </li>
            <li>The extendable trimmer isn&#x27;t very useful, but I&#x27;ve never seen a shaver where they are.  </li>
            <li>This is another excellent shaving product from Philips -- it cuts like an ordinary shaver, but with the added benefit of lubrication that helps it to shave smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth, does notirritate your skin (which is extremely important for me after having experienced other shavers and razors) and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Fun!  </li>
            <li>As long as you rinse well after every use, you&#x27;re probably in great shape.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit itself utilizes three rotating wheels with a unique shaving gel dispenser that you press to ooze some out on the blades.  </li>
            <li>In closing, let me say that shaving with this Norelco is the first time ever I&#x27;ve enjoyed shaving with any razor, and I&#x27;ve used Braun and Panasonic too over the years.</li>
            <li>but at the same time, these are not only more affordable, but also probably the best FULLY WATERPROOF electric razors now.</li>
            <li>shaver has unique \\&quot;floating\\&quot; shaver heads.  </li>
            <li>have every shaver available , the 8040X is very light and does the job very well in the shower</li>
            <li>the new models 8020~8060 are just amazing.</li>
            <li>Each time I replaced the lotion, I would just remove the cartridge and clean it myself.  </li>
            <li>Well, it does the job feeling and smelling clean while shaving.  </li>
            <li>I have to be clean shaven for my job</li>
            <li>Here, it forces you to clean it.  </li>
            <li>He reports that he appreciates the convenience of being able to put the shaving cream directly into the shaver and of being able to use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I also have extremely sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t enjoy contact with any kind of chemical, especial alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I also have extremely sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t enjoy contact with any kind of chemical, especial alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I have used Norelco razors for several years, and this one is the best one by far.</li>
            <li>It cuts clean with no pulling on the hairs.</li>
            <li>Clean</li>
            <li>So, the 8040 it is; a nice middle ground and more streamlined.   </li>
            <li>Shaves better when wet or in shower but still not as good as a razor.</li>
            <li>B000050FDQ Braun 7526 Syncro Shaver System with Clean &amp; Charge Storage Stand]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that this can be used in the shower (wouldn&#x27;t try that with the old one --ZZZZT!)</li>
            <li>just right and is easy to grab.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizing system is quite easy and flexible, able to use as much or as little as you need with just an easy push of the handy</li>
            <li>First 2&#x27;s were very satisfying even though they were much older models than the coolskin one.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing part makes it a great and smooth shave, but you have roughly 4-5 weeks worth of cream in a bottle.</li>
            <li>Now along comes the Cool Skin 8040X</li>
            <li>It really does shave as close as the Trac blades and shaving gel system I love to use.</li>
            <li>so I opted to try the Rotary razor and have been very well pleased.  </li>
            <li>OVERALL ITS A GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li>(I do believe the moisturizing system works), and gave a good shave, but by the afternoon (initial shave around 5 AM)</li>
            <li>The only thing that is good in it is the LOOK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged in like my old one.</li>
            <li>I had the chance to try the Norelco Cool Skin 8040X</li>
            <li>and although it is not a comparison of equals, I now also have the Cool Skin 8040x.</li>
            <li>For the last month, I&#x27;ve alternated between this razor and the 1090x, and my impression is without reservation, the 8040x delivers a superior cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Charge time for a full charge is about four hours for 40 minutes of shave time.</li>
            <li>Charge time for a full charge is about four hours for 40 minutes of shave time.</li>
            <li>If you want to shave in the shower, Norelco wants to insure you keep purchasing more shave gel cartridges.</li>
            <li>Why couldn&#x27;t Norelco make a charger that automatically shuts off or goes to trickle charge when the battery is full?  </li>
            <li>-- that&#x27;s good enough for</li>
            <li>it was full of problems.</li>
            <li>Both the 8040 and 8060 have a battery full indication, which the 8020 lacks.</li>
            <li>I figure there are many factors that go into shaving, not just having a very close shave.</li>
            <li>It is so convenient, and the smoothest shave I have had in several years (as good as a Mach 3 shave that I stopped years ago).</li>
            <li>A nice no mess system ...</li>
            <li>It takes some experimenting to know how much moisturizer to use at first, but this was also very easy (see comment on reading instructions).</li>
            <li>but this one seemed pretty smooth although it didn&#x27;t provide as a good a shave as a regular razor.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for other beard/skin types, but if you don&#x27;t have a brillo pad for a beard, it does a GREAT job).</li>
            <li>I was very interested in the Cool Skin 8040X and gave it a shot...</li>
            <li>He liked the idea of the dispensing lotion but found he preferred his normal shaving gel and also didn&#x27;t think the dispenser held enough or that it was cost effective.</li>
            <li>I was sceptical of, but it provided a fresh clean scent.  </li>
            <li>Quick Charge: when the battery is depleted, the 8040X can be charged for 9 minutes to give you 3 minutes of shaving time.  </li>
            <li>The 3 flex-heads give a close, quick shave.  </li>
            <li>The 8040 and 8060 also offer a quick charge.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t claim it as a detracting factor however, with the water from the shower going, the lotion is foaming and rinsing away relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>Braun has been retired to back-up status under the sink, and the truth is, I&#x27;ll probably electric shave much more often than I did before now, because of the value and benefits this particular model brings.  </li>
            <li>I do not think the cost of moisturizer refills should be that high, but it would be better if Philips Norelco suggests additional moisturizer that can be used in place of the Nivea.</li>
            <li>I was very interested in shaving in the shower, the Norelco 8040x&#x27;s ability to dispense lotion, and it&#x27;s trial period guarantee.    </li>
            <li>So even though the shave isn&#x27;t as smooth as I was hoping for, its still a pretty descent shaver all things considered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was however impressed with the battery life (a full week on a single charge) and how quiet it is.  </li>
            <li>Philips-Norelco has proved that a new version of something does not have to be better...    </li>
            <li>I love the new way they&#x27;ve integrated the saving balm into the heads.</li>
            <li>In that time, I&#x27;ve had ups and downs with their products, but I&#x27;ve been mostly satisfied and keep purchasing new models</li>
            <li>I use this exclusively and it works great, and will be much, much cheaper over the long haul.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using Norelco dry electric shavers for years and has really loved them.</li>
            <li>Or, for those who prefer to view all events in a positive light, someone should be promoted.</li>
            <li>It also shaves pretty darn close!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate, guys, THIS one really does work!!</li>
            <li>ALSO REALLY MOISTURIZES YOUR FACE!!</li>
            <li>When it first came out, i thought i should give it a try, since Norelco razors never disappointed me, and when i was using non-electric razors, i always shaved in the shower.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of my first cordless razor from 1985!  </li>
            <li>The shave is slightly less smooth than a good razor shave.  </li>
            <li>The razor also has a nice rubber grip that makes it easy to hold when its wet.    </li>
            <li>Yet, for nearly $150 less than the top of the line model and superior shaving capability, I&#x27;ll figure out how to securely pack it.</li>
            <li>He found he got the best feeling and closest share only when he used a lot of shaving creme/gel &amp; had his face very well, making for quite a mess on the sink top.</li>
            <li>I can shave everyday with this and get a great shave.</li>
            <li>But, does not shave close enough which is the most important element with the shaver.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, it is capable of delivering a good shave, but it has too many drawbacks to recommend for everyday use.      </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s onlya month&#x27;s worth).  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, it works best when shaving wet, using a lot of the moisturizer, and taking a lot of time to do so.  </li>
            <li>But even if it was, it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>The head cover is a plastic cover to protect the blades; useful for traveling.    </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.y skin.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Now back to the most important function.</li>
            <li>I figured with all these additional features, the 8040X was worth the additional money.</li>
            <li>With the excellent coverage of the razor head, my shaving time has decreased significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Norelco 8040X is a good razor equal to all of the very well made ones norelco produces.  </li>
            <li>I still prefer a nice, wet, in-the-shower shave with this razor to my twin-blade manual razor, especially on the sensitive under-chin area, but that 7737 really did a great job!</li>
            <li>I found the comfort gel to be quite effective, but I couldn&#x27;t find replacements in my local stores.</li>
            <li>in that it requires several passes over an area to get a nice shave.  </li>
            <li>The flexible head design is amazing; it can really get that stubborn neck hair that my old shaver used to miss.  </li>
            <li>The shaver was as good as I expected.  </li>
            <li>There is a bladder that contains Nivea moisturizing lotion which make the shaver work extra nice.  </li>
            <li>I find that useful because I know when to remove my shaver from the charger, so as not to damage the battery by over-charging.</li>
            <li>Keep a standard razor handy.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback to the razor I could mention is that it is kind of a pain to change between the shaving head and the trimming head.</li>
            <li>VERY NICE ITEM FOR A REASONABLE PRICE, A BIT CHEAP LOOK AND MISSING A STRAP FOR HANGING.  </li>
            <li>There should be no unforgivable sins; your better qualities should always offer the hope that your failings, however profound, can be overcome.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;Yet, for nearly $150 less than the top of the line model and superior shaving capability, I&#x27;ll figure out how to securely pack it.oes not require anywhere near as much pressure to achieve a close cut on stubble as has been my experience with the top of the line model.</li>
            <li>I am ecstatic over my new Cool Skin 8040x!</li>
            <li>Also great for dry or sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>And so they were right.  </li>
            <li>Thats right, and it aint no lie.</li>
            <li>: My first shave was extremely comfortable, with zero irritation; thanks to the glide rings provided on each model.</li>
            <li>Then I saw this Norelco wet shaver on Amazon for an exceptional price, so I ordered one.</li>
            <li>No matter how much lotion I use, how many times I go over this area, how much I twist, turn and tug, this razor refuses to shave certain areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, this shaver is really light and easy to handle when shaving, especially tougher areas that require holding the shaver upright at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Waterproof</li>
            <li>It is a very sleek and cool looking razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not shaving a beard everyday or anything but the good news is that most of the stubble seems to stick near the plastic head.</li>
            <li>This is also when the Cool Skin moisturizer really shines -</li>
            <li>It is a great relief that I found a shaver that wont hold me hostage like that, save for a little bitof moisturizing lotion that goes in the shaver (you dont really need a lot if you shave in the shower or by the sink).</li>
            <li>Hence, I was in the market for a new shaver and thought I will research the shavers available since I was going to spend some money.    </li>
            <li>I keep new cheap razors in the drawer, as this razor just will NOT get everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin especially around adams apple area and thought this moisturizing shaver would be a good for me.  </li>
            <li>I had a 20% savings certificate from the local Bed, Bath and Beyond, and bought the 8040X at the same price I would have paid for the 8020X elsewhere, so I found a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I had the previous version of the CoolSkin razor, and really loved it.  </li>
            <li>I like the open head because it is easy to keep clean.    </li>
            <li>charge holds quite nice, and longer than I expected, even right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>What I have observed, however, is that the new model has no advantages, but one significant disadvantage.  </li>
            <li>I got a clean close shave that was way better than I expected.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated or dry, and the lubrication seems to help the shave to go more quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very little irritation and smooth effective shave.</li>
            <li>This was my first electric razor in 40 years.</li>
            <li>First impressions:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nevertheless, I will continue to use this shaver for several more weeks and will post an update at that time.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I will continue to use this shaver for several more weeks and will post an update at that time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger and cuts better.</li>
            <li>First off I must say this is my first electric razor that I have owned.  </li>
            <li>First I had to decide on a foil razor or rotary razor.  </li>
            <li>Solution to this is not to refill the lotion resovoir after depleting first fill.</li>
            <li>My shaving procedure is, after taking a shower, to first wash my face thoroughly with liquid soap and hot water, leaving the soap lather on my face.  </li>
            <li>I then apply a moderate amount of skin lotion (I use Dermalube, but most skin lotions will do) over my face evenly, and then proceed to shave without using any Nivea lotion.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I first started shaving I have always used a manual razor.  </li>
            <li>My review is actually pretty</li>
            <li>I applied a shaving gel to my face first then started shaving.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaved with it for the first time today</li>
            <li>head conforms to whatever surface I&#x27;m shaving pretty well, and just looks</li>
            <li>Still, I liked the convenience and the ease of the Syncro and the fact that it held up to rough use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the way the Floating Heads give a close shave, and the way the pop-up sideburn trimmer works crisply and efficiently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To begin shaving, you first press the on/off button on the shaver to turn it on and then press the conditioner release button.</li>
            <li>The 1090x is Philips/Norelco&#x27;s flagship razor and this one is more of a middle of the road competitively priced product so any comparison is unfair...for the 1090x.</li>
            <li>Just turn it on and wash the heads under hot running water.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor.</li>
            <li>At first i didnt like this razor but now that my face has \\&quot;adapted\\&quot; to it</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE FIRST TIME,</li>
            <li>I USE THE MORE EXPENSIVE{NIVERA} SHAVING CREAM, ABOVE MY UPPER{MUSTACHE AREA} LIP AREA &amp; MY NECK AREAS!!</li>
            <li>gave the Norelco 8040X a solid week of use, thinking that it might get better over time (as their manual suggests).  </li>
            <li>but it did shave pretty well on my chin/cheek though).</li>
            <li>lighter, smaller, yet sturdier, more convenient to refill the lotion.</li>
            <li>this is not only more convenient, but also cleaner/healthier</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t seem to be as smooth as I was with my old shaver, but Norelco recommends using the shaver for 21 days to become accustomed to it.</li>
            <li>First, let me tell you about the shavers I have had.    </li>
            <li>The shaver went into the shower for its first test run.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver is FAST!  </li>
            <li>Most recently, that role has been admirably served by a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I have used other electric razors without finding any that I liked</li>
            <li>I soon learned that I could get a really close shave [and a faster one] simply by using more pressure.  </li>
            <li>All my life I have hoped that technology would finally allow a electric shaver that would actually shave as good as a razer blade.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for years, but never a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; system, so I was quite interested to compare the Cool Skin 8040X to my old shaver.</li>
            <li>I have also noted that Norelco now supplies a flimsy plastic construction of the razor, whereas the older razor was much more rugged, a not surprising evolution of articles of this kind.    </li>
            <li>After my first use, I was used to the ergonomics (it is a completely different design from the Syncro), facial coverage was exceptional.</li>
            <li>The shave lotion also smells nicer, more like an aftershave, though it did burn a little; most likely the result of alcohol (which is used to create that nicer smell) though the burning quickly subsided.</li>
            <li>-- you need to use a special shaving cream bottle as the nossle needs to inject the cream directly into the shaving unit.  </li>
            <li>with most electric shavers on the market, you get convenience, simple charging, savings on consumable blades and cream, and a nice little gadget for your bathroom with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>But if you do not need or want a real close shave or if you&#x27;re a teenager first shaving, then I do believe the Philips Norelco 8040x is for you.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t skip more than a day of shaving with it, though, or the long hairs just won&#x27;t get cut.  </li>
            <li>By being bigger,the blades are further away from the body of the razor and easy to manipulate.    </li>
            <li>This was no problem following the easy to read instruction</li>
            <li>The shaver has enough capacity for maybe 4 uses and the shaver is easily refilled.    </li>
            <li>My previous Norelco&#x27;s all came with nice cases to travel with, but this is just some flimsy neoprene wrap...  </li>
            <li>Norelco 8040X is a nice idea, but it&#x27;s gimmicky and labor intensive, when all I want is a quick shave and then a quick rinse of the heads and the knowledge that my shaver will be ready and willing the next morning.</li>
            <li>Um.........     This Norelco 8040X is a nice idea, but it&#x27;s gimmicky and labor intensive, when all I want is a quick shave and then a quick rinse of the heads and the knowledge that my shaver will be ready and willing the next morning.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t grow a big or strong beard.</li>
            <li>It certainly won&#x27;t be the quickest shave that you&#x27;ve ever had, but if you take your time, you can get results that rival even a blade.        </li>
            <li>Also, going on leave, you can&#x27;t take things like razors, shaving cream in large bottles, aftershave lotion in large bottles, and the like.  </li>
            <li>certainly closer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>B00008DQJQ Factory Reconditioned Braun 7526 Syncro Smart Logic Shaver]]</li>
            <li>slimmer head lets you shave hard to reach areas more easily, blades don&#x27;t go into the head, but still flexible.</li>
            <li>That seemed fine, until this morning when I accidentally broke a piece of this fragile cartridge.  </li>
            <li>this razor handled the extra growth just fine.</li>
            <li>the price this seems a very high quality electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Another major difference between the 8060 and the lower models, is that the 8060 automatically refills the shaver&#x27;s bladder so the shaver is full of lotion every time you use it.</li>
            <li>This Item is almost very good ,only thing I want to say is that the speed is a bit slow.</li>
            <li>It shaved me but it seems I had to be doing too much work in ensuring that it is</li>
            <li>To be honest, the experience wasn&#x27;t really any different and took me the same amount of time.</li>
            <li>The charger uses regular cheap wire contacts for charging rather than induction like my Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>The company clearly wants to reap profits on consumables.  </li>
            <li>Used wet in the shower, its performance is much better.  </li>
            <li>Instead, the power light will begin to flash when the battery is getting low.  </li>
            <li>The 8040X Moisturizing Shave System promises too much.  </li>
            <li>When the razor needs to be charged, a red light comes on.</li>
            <li>it really lubricates    </li>
            <li>and it works very well and is smoother than the Nivea.    </li>
            <li>Gives shave that is very close to a razor even without the Nivea lotion.  </li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t quite as fast</li>
            <li>and I got a very close shave because of the  moisture system and would recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li>In short, if you only plan to use this razor in the shower this is a great choice, but if you need to use the razor outside of the shower as well, you may want to choose something else.</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well in the shower and eliminates the need to separately lather.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough  -</li>
            <li>razor&#x27;s tracking system follows facial contours (head in my case) quite efficiently and does not require anywhere near as much pressure to achieve a close cut on stubble as has been my experience with the top of the line model.</li>
            <li>If I bought the low-end shaver that charges in 8 hours, I&#x27;d charge it in the morning and it would be ready when I get home from work.  </li>
            <li>The only way I could get this smooth with a blade would&#x27;ve been with a ton of irritation.</li>
            <li>Really didnt work that well and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>And from what I can see it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li>Its also comfortable to hold and the smaller design makes it easier to travel with (as well as the fact that it includes a travel lock).</li>
            <li>and I must say it has absolutely blown me away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery is dying in this thing fast.  </li>
            <li>As he really likes Philips products he was looking forward to trying the Moisturizing Shaving</li>
            <li>you are considering changing to an electric razor, or have one but sometimes miss getting a really close shave, this system is highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>When you shave, it&#x27;s much easier to get to hard-to-reach areas of the face, since the body of the shaver creates no restrictions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the Braun has held up well, two aspects of the Philips Norelco 8040X really compelled me.  </li>
            <li>However even with the lotion (which is reasonably priced)</li>
            <li>For me a battery charge on this thing lasts between 15 and 20 days, when the red charge light comes on</li>
            <li>When the battery finally died in it, I purchases this one just because it was the next version of the razor I liked.  </li>
            <li>so I opted to buy the new model 8040X since, after all, the older model had really worked for me over a long period of time, and maybe the newer model would have some worthwhile advantages.    </li>
            <li>I used it right after a shower with my face still wet along with the nivea lotion and let me tell you, WOW!!!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I could grow on using this shaver except for the high upkeep costs and very high outlay cost of the unit itself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using various models of Philips Norelco shavers for the past 8 years and have always been happy with them.</li>
            <li>so now I have to clean the sink constantly...</li>
            <li>The open design makes it not that great for dry shaving as the hair gets everywhere, but I use it 98% of the time in the shower that that is not a big issue for me.      </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a comfortable shave... as long as it&#x27;s very lubricated.</li>
            <li>I do lube my face with shampoo, and only use the cream when I hit a dry spot, and so far so good.    </li>
            <li>I use it mainly for beard trimming and find  that it gives me greater control than other razors.</li>
            <li>Thirdly, I bought a 3oz bottle of Nivea (it is a special bottle)</li>
            <li>I suppose someone who wants to, can, with a little ingenuity and transparent mailing tape, take this Clamshell Package and create a travel container for their 8040x-- which might be a good idea, because the fabric travel pouch that Norelco supplies with this shaver only holds the shaver, and not the accessories -- unless you want to cram everything into the travel case and NOT close it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I still love this shaver, I buy the Nivia shaving creame and put it on my face at the begining of a shower and about half way though shave with the shaver and its absolutely equiviliant to a blade shave, except you have to replace the shaving heads</li>
            <li>- I already mentioned smooth, but LONG shave.  </li>
            <li>Also, the pump system that feeds the conditioner into the razor is proprietary, i.e. you can&#x27;t just fill it with any skin conditioner because only the Nivea Cool Skin fits the razor&#x27;s plug.  </li>
            <li>Wow it really works in the shower!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Putting the moisturizer into the shaver is a feat that involves pumping the cartridge manually and then cleaning up the excess moisturizer that suddenly splats out of the shaver when it is full.</li>
            <li>Putting the moisturizer into the shaver is a feat that involves pumping the cartridge manually and then cleaning up the excess moisturizer that suddenly splats out of the shaver when it is full.</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;ll start out by saying that I am 67 years old...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m coming from a Philishave Cool Skin, which is the same as the Norelco</li>
            <li>The whole idea of a electric is to speed up the process but between loading it with the conditioner, using it, adding more water, cleaning up the mess</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, particularly around my neck</li>
            <li>I would like to believe that its lightweight, comfortable form and good battery life could redeem it, but sadly, its transgression is too profound.</li>
            <li>just wet your face  - easy to use (</li>
            <li>The shaver is constructed well and is lighter and more compact than previous models.</li>
            <li>Each time I buy a bit more expensive model hoping I&#x27;ll save even more time each morning...</li>
            <li>This is particularly the case if you don&#x27;t use the shaver for a while, which allows the cream to solidify.  </li>
            <li>The pouch is a soft cloth and really doesn&#x27;t offer much protection.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go and pick up a different brand, or something unscented (as the alcohol in scented products burns my skin too, and this does to a mild degree).  </li>
            <li>You have to remove the shaving heads from the main shaft and attach the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>, it was more of a whim that I picked up the 8040x, to see the difference and see if maybe the ease of the electric would finally get me away from a standard razor for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Not as speedy as older models&lt;</li>
            <li>as speedy as older models  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s what he had to say about this product: I was afraid to use the lubricating gel, many things with fragrance of any kind</li>
            <li>There is a 9 minute quick charge capability that provides enough power for a three minute shave.</li>
            <li>There is a 9 minute quick charge capability that provides enough power for a three minute shave.</li>
            <li>almost solved all the existing problems with the older model.</li>
            <li>Decent electric</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something to be said for the ease and convenience of an electric razor, but for obvious reasons, they almost always lack the closeness of a true blade, and rarely leave your skin feeling quite as refreshed as the traditional route.  </li>
            <li>The instruction book is very thorough -- but the warnings interspersed throughout are in grey print -- how about bold black?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not over doing it here, and it is going quick!  </li>
            <li>I am more inclined to not clean those razors out</li>
            <li>So why 4 stars (I would say 3.5, a little better than the halfway mark)?</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the propriety Nivea shaving moisturizer; I just use a small dollop of Nivea&#x27;s regular shaving gel ($3 for a large canister available anywhere) and that works fine.  </li>
            <li>I still have a previous Norelco shaver (dry) and I will try that again, although it is not as good.  </li>
            <li>So when I shave my beard is a little bit longer than most men&#x27;s would normally be.</li>
            <li>For a unit that costs this much, this is a completely unacceptable practice.</li>
            <li>* Close, comfortable shave when used wet  </li>
            <li>To summarize:  Pros  - really smooth shave when used wet</li>
            <li>When used as a wet shaver and with the moisturizing cream, it does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>However in a normal working setting this may not be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually have fun using it and would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li>For more than a few years I had been using the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Then again, it is a waste of plastics made even more wasteful when you consider the price of petroleum nowadays, and the inability to recycle this type of plastic.</li>
            <li>Then you shave as you normally would with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The rotary heads can be replaced with fresh blades at a later date.  </li>
            <li>and so it also solves the soap scum problem if you want to use your own shaving foam/gel or even soap.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this in the shower, as you&#x27;ll waste more money in water bills than getting a close shave outta this</li>
            <li>The 8040 does a solid job and has adequate power for a beard that grows in pretty fully on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>My old Advantage gave me a much closer shave than the new Norelco 8040x.  </li>
            <li>The fact that I have no irritation or bleeding is a very acceptable trade-off for the slightly less smooth shave in my case.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to shave in about half the time as with my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but there are several downsides noticeable right off</li>
            <li>Yes, the wet shave function of this makes the time a little more intense, but I feel the trade off is worth it when it doesn&#x27;t eat up my skin.  </li>
            <li>However, it might not hold its charge as long or charge as quickly.  </li>
            <li>My first few shaves were okay, not terrific, even using the moisturizer provided.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Nivea and Norelco team up to produce a fragrance free version as this product does conflict with other scents the consumer might use.  </li>
            <li>I tried to buy a new lotion with cartridge at Target, and the lotion came without the cartridge, so I have to return it.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;Just picked up my new Norelco 8040X shaver yesterday from Target.  </li>
            <li>I decided to go with it as the new floating heads intrigued me.  </li>
            <li>I like my new shaver.</li>
            <li>The new design is easier to manipulate than the bulky models that preceded it.</li>
            <li>My new 8040X:</li>
            <li>Shaving Conditioner reservoir on the shaver itself has to be replaced each time you start a new bottle of Nevia Shaving Conditioner</li>
            <li>Also, the light signifiying that the unit is re-charging is muted (which is both good and bad)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable enough to use every day, though, especially when used in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Even with my old shaver, I would get some irritation; particularly on my neck.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I have to be selective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The little sideburn trimmer is unique, but I don&#x27;t really use it.  </li>
            <li>(It must have learned its lesson being in the garbage for nearly a week!)</li>
            <li>And unlike any blade I&#x27;ve used over nearly 30 years of shaving, these razors do not irritate my skin at all!</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package and set the shaver up, I had to not only charge the batteries but also fill the shaver with Nivea For Men shaving conditioner.</li>
            <li>Having used regular razors all my life, this was my first experience to an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>The booklet recommends giving it 3 weeks, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be able to talk him into that... wonder how this thing would work on my legs?</li>
            <li>Overall, I could grow on using this shaver except for the high upkeep costs and very high outlay cost of the unit itself.  </li>
            <li>It is an overall very simple and clean design;  there are two buttons (one for power and one to dispense lotion) and two recessed LED&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>i believe Norelco really closely reviewed all the downfalls of the older models and made big improvements by fixing them all.</li>
            <li>In summary, the new model 8040X provides the same comfortable wet shave experience as the older model, but don&#x27;t look for any improvements.</li>
            <li>find that the results of my shave are the same whether I use my old standard Norelco or this new Norelco Cool Skin 8040X, with one exception:</li>
            <li>I find that the results of my shave are the same whether I use my old standard Norelco or this new Norelco Cool Skin 8040X, with one exception:</li>
            <li>The open design of the heads also makes it easier to clean, but I just don&#x27;t understand why this razor would perform so much poorer than a similar model from several years ago.</li>
            <li>Slick, smooth, it is not irritating my neck as the old Advantage used to.</li>
            <li>After a couple of days shaving with my new 8040x, I realized (and my wife agreed) that it did not shave nearly as close as my old Norelco Advantage did.    </li>
            <li>In fact, after using it religiously for 2 weeks, I had more ingrown hairs and odd stubble than ever before.  </li>
            <li>My fiancé is probably my biggest critic when it comes to shaving and she actually prefers this model to my previous one b/c now I am shaving everyday and have greater periods of a smooth face instead of scruffy one.</li>
            <li>As long as its not banged around too much it would make for a decent travel razor.</li>
            <li>The main problem I find with this new design is that the heads/razors are floating and not encased as previous models and most other shavers.</li>
            <li>The overall quality is just as good as previous models and other Philips/Norelco products.   </li>
            <li>Once done shaving I rinse the lotion off my face with cold water and splash some after shave on and feel great.    </li>
            <li>Clearly it looks like they made this razor either for just an afternoon touch-up shave</li>
            <li>Clearly, the Syncro could not give me the close shave of the Sensor Excel.</li>
            <li>It works a lot better on a wet face with a wet shaver.  </li>
            <li>Given that I rarely/never use the old fashioned razor and shaving cream, it&#x27;s probably not a surprise.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the idea of guessing how much juice I have left.      </li>
            <li>Takes about 4 hours to completely charge.</li>
            <li>A green light in the handle  flashes while charging and stays lit when fully charged.</li>
            <li>I am 66 years old and have been shaving with Norelco electric shavers since I was 16 -- making me a 50 year user of Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li>The day before my scheduled garbage pick-up I rummaged through the garbage in my trash can and found my old Norelco Advantage.  </li>
            <li>After being in the trash can for nearly a week, I discovered that it would once again hold a battery charge.  </li>
            <li>You can use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;  This to me seemed very convenient as I could shave as I&#x27;m getting showering which in my eyes saved some time from having to do the traditional way.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I have owned and used an early model of this razor, known as the Norelco Advantage for perhaps eight or so years.  </li>
            <li>I can figure that out without paying extra money thank you very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t want to spend the extra for the fast charge</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t want to spend the extra for the fast charge</li>
            <li>I have been using the Norelco 8040X for about 6 weeks now and am very, pleasantly surprised.    </li>
            <li>I do it the old fashined way.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it everyday and even on 2-day growth, and it works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The heads on the 8040X DO flex, but the moisturizing cream/gel only comes through two of them when all three heads with moisturizer would work much better -- the heads also drag across my skin -- and in some instances gave me a bit of razor burn -- especially on my neck.</li>
            <li>Physically, the razor is much slimmer and lighter than the Norelco arcitec 1090.</li>
            <li>I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised by this electric shave - moisturizer system.  </li>
            <li>A pretty minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A pretty minor issue.    </li>
            <li>His face is smoother after using this probably because of its massaging action.</li>
            <li>This razor offers some additional features my old one lacked:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a huge issue for me because I have a light beard, but I thought these things were supposed to get faster with time, not</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a huge issue for me because I have a light beard, but I thought these things were supposed to get faster with time, not slower.    </li>
            <li>When I found myself going back over my face with a regular razor right after I used the 8040X, I knew this shaver had to go.</li>
            <li>Run hot water, hold the head under running water, tap on sink gently, dry off, and you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li>Again, I am NOT typically a fan of electric razors, and this razor happily surprised me with its performance.  </li>
            <li>My first usage was dry and without the application of the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>there is much less skin irritation with the Cool Skin.</li>
            <li>there is much less skin irritation with the Cool Skin.</li>
            <li>Over time, about a year, it dulled out to being less and less effective</li>
            <li>While one of the other Norelco models - Norelco 1090 costs upwards of $200, I can say that this model 8040x is a steal of the money - the moisturizer feature makes every penny worth.    </li>
            <li>No irritation and not much mess either.</li>
            <li>the only negative thing i gave the shaver is that it doesnt do good with long hairs..</li>
            <li>I gave this to my husband, hoping he would get hooked by even the novelty of it and use it everyday, I like a freshly clean shaven look on him</li>
            <li>Very satisified with first few uses of this shaver.  </li>
            <li>After spending numerous hours researching electric razors, I settled on this particular model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research</li>
            <li>But I decided to try again mainly after researching the product, noticing the \\&quot;send it back after trail\\&quot; guarantee.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older model Norelco wet/dry shaver that finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only three blades (as opposed to high end</li>
            <li>After the use, my face was smooth and soft and, unlike my efforts with the Syncro, very few missed</li>
            <li>The only way i could really get a great smooth shave with a blade was to shave AGAINST the growth, however, this gave me awful irritation and ingrown hairs.    </li>
            <li>On the other hand, the shaver has a lithium ion battery (not familiar with many models with this feature) that seems to last a long time and charge quickly when needed.    </li>
            <li>The overall shave is just a smidge less smooth than a quality shave from a razor.      </li>
            <li>Do find some minor irritation which goes away quickly, no worse than shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave, no more razor burn.     </li>
            <li>though I&#x27;ve never really saved much time!    </li>
            <li>Be sure to give it a few days before making final judgements as even though I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 20 years now, my skin and facial hair had to get used to this one.</li>
            <li>Works great, continues the less painful shaving tradition of the cool skin line.  </li>
            <li>more than once a year as the dull every 6 months with daily use and the quality of the shave declines.  </li>
            <li>This product did not come anywhere near my skin no matter how light or hard</li>
            <li>Since this model was distinctly different from the others I had purchased before, I thought it would be a revolutionary new experience shaving in the shower</li>
            <li>I applied a $10.00 coupon obtained from the Norelco web site so the total cost for my new razor was</li>
            <li>It only leaves the very bottom part of the beard on my neck slightly red</li>
            <li>It shaves close without chaffing my face, even the first time, unlike some of the other brands.  </li>
            <li>To me this is a major oversight and design flaw.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal Norelco user for decades, but after having two cool skin models fail on me recently (the first after 3 years, the second after only one), I decided to try another brand.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving nearly 30 years now and have tried electric shavers in no less than 3 different stints in my life (never Norelco before).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is something I also noticed with my past model, but it seems like Norelco shavers have for whatever reason gotten *less* effective and take longer to shave.  </li>
            <li>This is something I also noticed with my past model, but it seems like Norelco shavers have for whatever reason gotten *less* effective and take longer to shave.  </li>
            <li>though I still prefer a manual razor or even my older, similar Norelco which is basically the same</li>
            <li>My old Norelco provided a shave that was very smooth and comparable to a blade; with this model, there&#x27;s noticeable beard fuzz left behind immediately after I shave, and by the end of the day, I look like I forgot to shave at all that morning.</li>
            <li>It might be hard just finding this type of special cream, and will likely be very overpriced relative to its volume.  </li>
            <li>AT, DOLLAR GENERAL STORES OR</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so lazy that I would pay the extra $50 primarily to have the shaver refill itself.</li>
            <li>During my ownership of the Norelco Advantage razor I have had only one maintenance action, and that was the replacement of the battery about three years ago at a cost of about $43.    </li>
            <li>The old model could also run about a week with only a one hour charge.  </li>
            <li>Now to this shaver (I gave the info above just to compare a 10 year old shaver to the 8040).</li>
            <li>secondly, I have tried nearly every brand of electric razor that has ever been made, and I have given them all away because they all just tore my neck to pieces...</li>
            <li>But then, the one on my old Norelco is the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With the shower running, I could barely hear the motor.  </li>
            <li>This one, I can barely tolerate.  </li>
            <li>My old shaver did not have a base and was great for travel as the AC adapter plugged directly into the razor.    </li>
            <li>Kind of a shocker to see this on an expensive shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 100% satisfied with this razor---only one problem, the moisturizing cream is very expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Those aside, there were a few things that I liked, and a few things that bugged me about this specific</li>
            <li>I like my new shaver.en using the shaver, so occasionally I&#x27;ll get an extra, unneeded dose of conditioner.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a problem spending a little extra time shaving and shaving wet only - get it, it&#x27;s one of the most plesant experiences.</li>
            <li>but then the razor would quickly collect soap scum if you used regular shaving gel (which isn&#x27;t the razor&#x27;s fault but the new model solved this problem.</li>
            <li>The first, that it could be used in the shower -- my interest in this was less about convenience than it was how the water might change the way my skin feels after an electric shave.  </li>
            <li>I personally preferred their two blade ones not only because they were smaller and lighter, but also because it shaved better in those hard to reach areas (like under my nose).</li>
            <li>For the past several years I have been held hostage by the Braun company consumables (Clean and Charge solutions).</li>
            <li>For three days I shaved one side with my old Norelco Advantage and the other side with my new Norelco 8040x.  </li>
            <li>One other point which pertains to both the old and the new model -- there is no need to use the Nivea shaving lotion supplied by Norelco.  </li>
            <li>is a nice product, but is over-priced and difficult to find in stock locally (DFW metro area).  </li>
            <li>I have had this razor for about a month and a half now, and I really don&#x27;t have any major complaints.</li>
            <li>I was mostly interested in comfort, not speed, and you do have to be a little patient using these.    </li>
            <li>Suddenly that close, wet shave is looking pretty pricey in terms of time and money compared to simply going back to shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li>The same applies when using the Cool Skin, but with less irritation as it is now being done with skin conditioner in place instead of on dry</li>
            <li>While an electric shaver is much safer than a traditional razor, even an electric shaver can leave some burns on your skin and make it rough if you do not apply enough moisturizer.   </li>
            <li>They have always torn my skin up, left it burning on fire red, and full of bumps and never able to get close.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Seeing as how this was my first shave, I&#x27;ll reserve any additional comments until I&#x27;ve used the razor for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not amazing compared to other models, I wish they had skipped the lotion chamber and put three times as many batteries inside instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not amazing compared to other models, I wish they had skipped the lotion chamber and put three times as many batteries inside instead.    </li>
            <li>Really, the price needs to come down for this shaver to be competitive.  </li>
            <li>Really, the price needs to come down for this shaver to be competitive.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a very high quality one, but it did the trick and seemed less hassled than a blade.  </li>
            <li>I can do a relatively quick shave, maybe 7 minutes or so to get the desired results of at least a clean-cut appearance.  </li>
            <li>But this is the only way the razor could accommodate a trimmer due to the main shaft function that powers the three heads.  </li>
            <li>The only real fault with the Cool Skin is this trimmer which, frankly, is useless.</li>
            <li>I find this procedure to be both superior and much less expensive than using the Nivea lotion.    </li>
            <li>At age 66, I figure I have maybe 20 more years of shaving ahead of me, but if the shaving closeness of new Norelco&#x27;s is as bad as the 8040x, maybe I ought to buy a couple of the old Norelco Advantage shavers from e-bay or someplace and store them up to use for the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a little green flashing light that tells you when it needs charged, is charging, and done charging.  </li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s kind of like a little guessing game.  </li>
            <li>: Generally I shave every other day, though I probably should shave everyday, I stretch it to every other day without it being a huge problem.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I know Phillips-Norelco has excellent customer service, so I called to see if they could help me.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I have to say inbuilt moisturizer dispenser is the best feature   </li>
            <li> The best combination would be a SpeedXL used with Edge shaving lotion.  </li>
            <li> I am very impressed!  </li>
            <li> The gel/lotion that this puts out is wonderful and the blades just glide over the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I was quite impressed.  </li>
            <li> This is the best version of this shaver yet.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with a blade gave the best results however...</li>
            <li> Great razor...buy one!</li>
            <li> Both of these shavers give an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for the best electric razor on the market.</li>
            <li> It takes about 6 minutes to get an awesome shave with this.</li>
            <li> these might not be the world&#x27;s best electric razors.</li>
            <li> Head design is perfect for trimming beards.  </li>
            <li> Very happy to be an 8040X owner.</li>
            <li> If you are buying this to replace another electric shaver - this is a very good choice for the price.   </li>
            <li> This is a very good product , I am a Norelco fan</li>
            <li> Charging and battery life also seem to be very good.    </li>
            <li> Coupled with its compact size, I think that the \\&quot;weekend getaway (not for business)\\&quot; may be the ideal application of this razor.        </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because despite all the downfalls, it FELT GOOD!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d be happy.  </li>
            <li> Not to say, however, that they don&#x27;t contribute slightly to a great shave.    </li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I&#x27;ll still happily use this shaver.</li>
            <li> This, coupled with its lightweight, compact design, good battery life and travel lock make it ideal for weekend getaways.  </li>
            <li> The size of this unit is great it fits in my hand</li>
            <li> So I did some research and landed on this razor as a happy medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great if you shave twice a day.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work for my face, so I have to say, Great device, wouldn&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a great choice.  </li>
            <li> it works great</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li> Great features for the money.</li>
            <li> The stuff doesn&#x27;t smell too great either.  </li>
            <li> The stuff doesn&#x27;t smell too great either.  </li>
            <li> Happily surrendered my razor blades...</li>
            <li> so I decided to buy this great deal.  </li>
            <li> It worked great.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> PROBABLY GREAT FOR WOMENS&#x27; LEGS</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> and it works beyond amazing!.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First let me say that the most impressive feature to me is that it does NOT leave my face burning after using.  </li>
            <li> You can even use your own shaving cream in addition to or instead of the shaving gel in the razor!</li>
            <li> THE MOST COMFORTABLE &amp; CLOSEST SHAVE THAT I&#x27;VE EVER HAD!!!!</li>
            <li> It provides a smooth shave, probably the best shave I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  </li>
            <li> Good battery life   </li>
            <li> Good battery life    </li>
            <li> For years I had been looking for an electric razor that would come close to being as good as a blade for shaving with no luck.</li>
            <li> This made me give up my beloved Arcitec.</li>
            <li> - Feels good with the Nivea lotion...</li>
            <li> Found that I can get a good shave without the Nivea lotion by just wetting my face with water or a soapy solution.      </li>
            <li> It looks great and makes a nice ornament for my bathroom.</li>
            <li> If I wasn&#x27;t they have a return policy after the 21 day intro period that makes this fairly risk free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Good:  </li>
            <li> Not So Good:  </li>
            <li> I loved the 7737.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not as good.</li>
            <li> Charging the shaver in 4 hours sounds like a good idea, but the manual strictly admonishes against overcharging.  </li>
            <li> as good as the shaving conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good shaver for the price.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is very good and the recharger stand is easy.  </li>
            <li> This shaver has Li-Ion, the best kind of battery available, with no memory effect.  </li>
            <li> My wife was super impressed and to quote another review on this site....</li>
            <li> The unit was reliable, never having needed any change in parts, and did a pretty good job of giving the best approximation to a razor blade shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver might be great for getting rid of that preteen peach fuzz, but for most adults you can grow hair faster than this thing can cut it.</li>
            <li> the lotion smells really really good and does a amazing job on the face too.     </li>
            <li> It feels good and has a nice aftershave smell that my wife also likes</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was the greatest razor ever.  </li>
            <li> Boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> Stay tuned!ic, BUT the shaving cream mechanism did allow for a more pleasant shaving experience, but I think I would prefer just spreading some cream manually over my face instead.  </li>
            <li> The sideburns trimmer was easy to add to shaver and worked great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaving gel makes for a more pleasant shaving experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After charging the shaver for the recommended four hours (reading the instructions is also a good idea) using the cartridge of Nivea to fill the razor&#x27;s cartridge was surprisingly neat and easy to do.  </li>
            <li> This is a very light shaver (weight wise).  </li>
            <li> It gives an amazing close shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d recommend this shaver, it has some great features you&#x27;ll probably enjoy.  </li>
            <li> A closer shave would be nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A closer shave would be nice too.    </li>
            <li> I have never been an electric razor kind of guy.  </li>
            <li> And to be honest, I tried this electric shaver for close to a month.  </li>
            <li> Hi,  I own 8040 for 2.5 months now.    </li>
            <li> As I said I own the shaver for 2.5 months now.</li>
            <li> I used it in the shower, which was nice, but the time it took made me begin to worry about all that water wastage.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewers have aptly stated the deficiencies with ths scent</li>
            <li> On top of that, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do as good a job at shaving, either.</li>
            <li> but I realize it is a nice feature for those who may need the conditioner to avoid skin irritation.</li>
            <li> The travel locking feature is a nice touch but the travel case is a joke.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The travel locking feature is a nice touch but the travel case is a joke.    </li>
            <li> I decided to try this electric razor since i really liked the lotion dispensing feature.</li>
            <li> but it will be handy.    </li>
            <li> but i did liked it cause i could use shaving cream and in the shower with it.     </li>
            <li> It comes with a nice travel</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sideburn attachment is a nice thought, but there was no ear/nose trimmer which I have seen in $20 Norelco</li>
            <li> The lotion that comes along with the shaver is awesome and goes along really well with the Nivea after shave lotion that I was already used to.</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews that suggested the shaver worked perfectly well without it squirting glop everywhere, I was satisfied this was the right purchase.    </li>
            <li> i could not believe how great it shaved, the lotion helped the razor slide very very easily and smooth along my face and afterwards</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco customer for many years and up to this point I was always very pleased</li>
            <li> My Philishave is in perfect working condition, however required new blades; so I decided to take this opportunity to upgrade to the sleeker 8040X.   </li>
            <li> Some people say they&#x27;ve experienced success making their own concoction of lotion, but I haven&#x27;t tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m believing more and more that there is no substitute for the good ole faithful water/shaving creme/razor.  </li>
            <li> This was another seller point for me as my face dries out very easily</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric razor before and found the Norelco very easy touse</li>
            <li> product is well designed, it&#x27;s very sleek and cool to use, the battery life is good, and the travel bag is awesome.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco performed perfectly (yes I did replace the rechargeable batteries after 7 years of use).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the razor as a replacement for my old Norelco Advantage and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This shaver was used in the shower, so there was plenty of (acqua) moisture, in addition to gel moisturizer, available for a close shave, but the shave was not as good as it should have</li>

            <li> I bought the 8040x a couple of days ago and even I am surprised at how impressed I am with the shaver.</li>
            <li> It gives your a nice close shave, and it is shower safe, which saves me a lot of time.  </li>
            <li> To summarize: This is an excellent razor, but it is not worth the money or the hassle you have to go through to make it work effectively!      </li>
            <li> but honestly my Mach 3 has been good to me, so I never thought it worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do wish there was some kind of indicator on the unit that would let me know how much charge remains, but all in all I am quite happy with this.</li>
            <li> It gave me very smooth shave and each shave took about 3 min.</li>
            <li> His take: very comfortable to hold, the heads conform to his face well</li>
            <li> The Nivea lotion filling and dispensing was easy and really helped provide a smooth shave and a wonderful after-shave feeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;THe VERY first thing I DID NOT like (ZERO stars for this!!) was the plastic \\&quot;Clamshell</li>
            <li> OK,</li>
            <li> One truly outstanding feature of this shaver is an inbuilt moisturizer dispenser, which you can control while you shave.      </li>
            <li> This razor makes it so much more convinient to make this happen.    </li>
            <li> I have to spend quite a bit more time getting the shave that I need.  </li>
            <li> I have to spend quite a bit more time getting the shave that I need.  </li>
            <li> Compared to most closed-head designs, this makes for even more time that the razor requires with each use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than the one built into the Arcitec.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this appliance over some of the more costly ones.</li>
            <li> In retrospect, I think the SpeedXL was a much better shaver.</li>
            <li> Best razor ever in my opinion, even better than the massive 5-blade razor they have out now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is much more convenient to use this.</li>
            <li> You just stand 10 more minutes under water.</li>
            <li> If it saves time  than ok.    </li>
            <li> Interestingly, it noted there was a transition time.  </li>
            <li> the shaves were noticeably better and quicker.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m quite pleased now.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to work best as a daily shaver, rather than one to use with a couple day or more stubble on the face.  </li>
            <li> I love shaving in the shower - saves time,</li>
            <li> I am able to shave every day with out irritation.  </li>
            <li> I gave 5 stars because I am now able to shave every day with comfort and effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> This is an interesting gadget.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used too many electric razors</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that I shave a bit more surface area than he (I also shave my head,)</li>
            <li> Enjoy your shaving now with this one!</li>
            <li> The lather function also has an interesting refill tube that you twist to expose the pump.       </li>
            <li> I find it more appealing to the Norelco arcitec 1090.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver and will buy another when this one quits.</li>
            <li> Whomever led this product development team is making the top tier team look bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> As I said before I love the lotion feature.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> Every time you use this razor, the better the shave is,because your skn starts to adapt.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go more than 2 days without using it.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower every day and love it.  </li>
            <li> and i believe most people who buy these, they do because they need the waterproof/wet shaving feature.    </li>
            <li> My decision: I decided to go with the 8040 because I was comfortable with the 4 hour charge, though a 1.5 hour would be nice.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shaver and very well worth the money.     </li>
            <li> : I think his face looks better, the shave may not be as close</li>
            <li> looks better all around.</li>
            <li> I realized the need for a good electric fairly soon due to the length of time it takes to get a good manual shave.  </li>
            <li> Other than those two trivialities, I am extremely happy with the Philips Norelco 8040X shaver.am extremely happy with the Philips Norelco 8040X shaver.</li>
            <li> I was able to get good shaving results beginning with my first use.  </li>
            <li> A blade always wins on optimum closeness, but takes longer and is more \\&quot;dangerous\\&quot; to those of us with a not so fine touch.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and easy to use and gives the best shave for an electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the manufacturer decided it was a brilliant move to put the contents into a blister pack inside the package box.  </li>
            <li> I have heard that the Norelco brand is pretty good</li>
            <li> Also, I liked the idea of the battery full indicator.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li> The results were the best, smoothest and most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever seen from an electric razor - definitely comparable to using a razor blade without the nicks and cuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I welcome any shaving advice to help my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> very brefly, I am a 79 year old man and, after many electric razors mostly norelco, I have owned, this is he best one yet.    </li>
            <li> The most important thing is the shave.</li>
            <li> in all, the most important feature of a razor is how it performs.  </li>
            <li> It is fantastic to be able to shave in the shower.    </li>
            <li> But I was even more fortunate.</li>
            <li> Also, I always shave in the shower, as I&#x27;ve found I get the smoothest, most comfortable shave that way.</li>
            <li> It feels GREAT on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> JUST AS CLOSE AS A RAZOR &amp; WAY MORE COMFORTABLE WITH ZERO NICKS.</li>
            <li> OR SO, THAT YOUR SHAVES WILL GET CLOSER &amp; MORE COMFORTABLE.</li>
            <li> The best of both worlds.. electric shaving, wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 8040X provides the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> It resulted in a very sticky shave....not good at all.</li>
            <li> The new battery makes for a much more compact and lighter body which is good when traveling.  </li>
            <li> Other than that this was a great buy!</li>
            <li> package comes with a squeeze bottle full of a very pleasant smelling lotion, that you inject into the back of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> The unit does not shave very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The unit does not shave very quickly.  </li>
            <li> So if your looking for a good razor that will apply moisturizer as you shave, that you can use in the shower and ultimately if you want a razor that does an excellent job (in my experience just as good as a wet shave) this is the razor for you!!ower and ultimately if you want a razor that does an excellent job (in my experience just as good as a wet shave)</li>
            <li> The razor is easy to fill up with shaving gel.</li>
            <li> It cleans easily and is compact.</li>
            <li> Cleanup was also easy.</li>
            <li> dispensing the lotion into the shaver is really easy.     </li>
            <li> My fear was that the smell would be overly strong, but this was not the case in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all the good points:  - Sleek looking shaver - Also the blue looks good  - Interesting filling system for the Nivea lotion  </li>
            <li> I have used Norelco before but this was my first Moisturizing Shaving System but to be honest</li>
            <li> Other than those complaints, the razor shaves smoothly and closely, and I am VERY impressed with its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t claim to be getting significantly closer shaves with the Norelco, I can say that I enjoy the experience much more, and my skin feels happier for it.  </li>
            <li> but if you insist, any gel like Gillette&#x27;s Edge works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Well designed, light weight and easy to use   </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not close and at best it takes half capacity of the shaver&#x27;s conditioner tank.</li>
            <li> The 4 hour charge time is just fine for me</li>
            <li> The 4 hour charge time is just fine for me</li>
            <li> I used Nivea for Men shaving gel instead, applied by hand to the face before shaving, and that works just fine.    </li>
            <li> I may not be able to forgive it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to quick recharges on my Panasonic, but this unit took so many hours.</li>
            <li> for the shave itself, the results were lackluster -- Could not get the same close shave as my Panasonic, BUT the shaving cream mechanism did allow for a more pleasant shaving experience, but I think I would prefer just spreading some cream manually over my face instead.  </li>
            <li> Its shaving heads are very compact and pivot nicely so you can easily reach all contours of your face and hard-to-reach areas, e.g. under your nose.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The fact that you couldn&#x27;t get in contact with water or even in a shower used to be a huge disadvantage to electric razors.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d recommend this shaver, it has some great features you&#x27;ll probably enjoy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Notwithstanding bells and whistles, the primary function of any razor is to offer a smooth, comfortable shave and</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been just a huge fan of electric razors over the years.  </li>
            <li> In either case, it uses Nivea for Men shaving conditioner to smooth the razor over your face as you shave.  </li>
            <li> This has been, and still remains, a great razor if used properly.  </li>
            <li> Definitely great for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver is easy to clean and charge.  </li>
            <li> Shaver is easy to use, charge, clean.  </li>
            <li> Again, the results were fantastic.</li>
            <li> The shave is unbleivabley  smooth.  </li>
            <li> This shaver with accompanying moisturizer makes shaving a breeze and incredibly comfortable.</li>
            <li> The shape of it is pleasing and comfortable in the hand as you shave.  </li>
            <li> I wish the upscale model cleaned as efficiently, but then, as I facetiously stated in another review my primary use for that pricey unit is as a display item now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just pull off the tracker head and lightly press on the trimmer attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just pull off the tracker head and lightly press on the trimmer attachment.    </li>
            <li> for the moisturizing part, the lotion smelled nice but it didn&#x27;t really add to the experience.  </li>
            <li> Although it feels comfortable when I shave, it refuses to finish the job.  </li>
            <li> There are three models available in this series, the 8020, the 8040 and the 8060.</li>
            <li> it was part of the cell phone hands free law.</li>
            <li> Having used the \\&quot;old fashioned shaving creme and razor\\&quot; for years, I thought it would be good to try one of the newer electric shaving systems.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent and does leave the skin on your face feeling refreshed afterward (even if it&#x27;s also apparent that the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; is just from some alcohol in the formula).  </li>
            <li> The extendable trimmer isn&#x27;t very useful, but I&#x27;ve never seen a shaver where they are.  </li>
            <li> This is another excellent shaving product from Philips -- it cuts like an ordinary shaver, but with the added benefit of lubrication that helps it to shave smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth, does notirritate your skin (which is extremely important for me after having experienced other shavers and razors) and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Fun!  </li>
            <li> As long as you rinse well after every use, you&#x27;re probably in great shape.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit itself utilizes three rotating wheels with a unique shaving gel dispenser that you press to ooze some out on the blades.  </li>
            <li> In closing, let me say that shaving with this Norelco is the first time ever I&#x27;ve enjoyed shaving with any razor, and I&#x27;ve used Braun and Panasonic too over the years.</li>
            <li> but at the same time, these are not only more affordable, but also probably the best FULLY WATERPROOF electric razors now.</li>
            <li> shaver has unique \\&quot;floating\\&quot; shaver heads.  </li>
            <li> have every shaver available , the 8040X is very light and does the job very well in the shower</li>
            <li> the new models 8020~8060 are just amazing.</li>
            <li> Each time I replaced the lotion, I would just remove the cartridge and clean it myself.  </li>
            <li> Well, it does the job feeling and smelling clean while shaving.  </li>
            <li> I have to be clean shaven for my job</li>
            <li> Here, it forces you to clean it.  </li>
            <li> He reports that he appreciates the convenience of being able to put the shaving cream directly into the shaver and of being able to use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I also have extremely sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t enjoy contact with any kind of chemical, especial alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I also have extremely sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t enjoy contact with any kind of chemical, especial alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors for several years, and this one is the best one by far.</li>
            <li> It cuts clean with no pulling on the hairs.</li>
            <li> Clean</li>
            <li> So, the 8040 it is; a nice middle ground and more streamlined.   </li>
            <li> Shaves better when wet or in shower but still not as good as a razor.</li>
            <li> B000050FDQ Braun 7526 Syncro Shaver System with Clean &amp; Charge Storage Stand]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice that this can be used in the shower (wouldn&#x27;t try that with the old one --ZZZZT!)</li>
            <li> just right and is easy to grab.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizing system is quite easy and flexible, able to use as much or as little as you need with just an easy push of the handy</li>
            <li> First 2&#x27;s were very satisfying even though they were much older models than the coolskin one.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing part makes it a great and smooth shave, but you have roughly 4-5 weeks worth of cream in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Now along comes the Cool Skin 8040X</li>
            <li> It really does shave as close as the Trac blades and shaving gel system I love to use.</li>
            <li> so I opted to try the Rotary razor and have been very well pleased.  </li>
            <li> OVERALL ITS A GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> (I do believe the moisturizing system works), and gave a good shave, but by the afternoon (initial shave around 5 AM)</li>
            <li> The only thing that is good in it is the LOOK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged in like my old one.</li>
            <li> I had the chance to try the Norelco Cool Skin 8040X</li>
            <li> and although it is not a comparison of equals, I now also have the Cool Skin 8040x.</li>
            <li> For the last month, I&#x27;ve alternated between this razor and the 1090x, and my impression is without reservation, the 8040x delivers a superior cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Charge time for a full charge is about four hours for 40 minutes of shave time.</li>
            <li> Charge time for a full charge is about four hours for 40 minutes of shave time.</li>
            <li> If you want to shave in the shower, Norelco wants to insure you keep purchasing more shave gel cartridges.</li>
            <li> Why couldn&#x27;t Norelco make a charger that automatically shuts off or goes to trickle charge when the battery is full?  </li>
            <li> -- that&#x27;s good enough for</li>
            <li> it was full of problems.</li>
            <li> Both the 8040 and 8060 have a battery full indication, which the 8020 lacks.</li>
            <li> I figure there are many factors that go into shaving, not just having a very close shave.</li>
            <li> It is so convenient, and the smoothest shave I have had in several years (as good as a Mach 3 shave that I stopped years ago).</li>
            <li> A nice no mess system ...</li>
            <li> It takes some experimenting to know how much moisturizer to use at first, but this was also very easy (see comment on reading instructions).</li>
            <li> but this one seemed pretty smooth although it didn&#x27;t provide as a good a shave as a regular razor.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for other beard/skin types, but if you don&#x27;t have a brillo pad for a beard, it does a GREAT job).</li>
            <li> I was very interested in the Cool Skin 8040X and gave it a shot...</li>
            <li> He liked the idea of the dispensing lotion but found he preferred his normal shaving gel and also didn&#x27;t think the dispenser held enough or that it was cost effective.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical of, but it provided a fresh clean scent.  </li>
            <li> Quick Charge: when the battery is depleted, the 8040X can be charged for 9 minutes to give you 3 minutes of shaving time.  </li>
            <li> The 3 flex-heads give a close, quick shave.  </li>
            <li> The 8040 and 8060 also offer a quick charge.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t claim it as a detracting factor however, with the water from the shower going, the lotion is foaming and rinsing away relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> Braun has been retired to back-up status under the sink, and the truth is, I&#x27;ll probably electric shave much more often than I did before now, because of the value and benefits this particular model brings.  </li>
            <li> I do not think the cost of moisturizer refills should be that high, but it would be better if Philips Norelco suggests additional moisturizer that can be used in place of the Nivea.</li>
            <li> I was very interested in shaving in the shower, the Norelco 8040x&#x27;s ability to dispense lotion, and it&#x27;s trial period guarantee.    </li>
            <li> So even though the shave isn&#x27;t as smooth as I was hoping for, its still a pretty descent shaver all things considered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was however impressed with the battery life (a full week on a single charge) and how quiet it is.  </li>
            <li> Philips-Norelco has proved that a new version of something does not have to be better...    </li>
            <li> I love the new way they&#x27;ve integrated the saving balm into the heads.</li>
            <li> In that time, I&#x27;ve had ups and downs with their products, but I&#x27;ve been mostly satisfied and keep purchasing new models</li>
            <li> I use this exclusively and it works great, and will be much, much cheaper over the long haul.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Norelco dry electric shavers for years and has really loved them.</li>
            <li> Or, for those who prefer to view all events in a positive light, someone should be promoted.</li>
            <li> It also shaves pretty darn close!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate, guys, THIS one really does work!!</li>
            <li> ALSO REALLY MOISTURIZES YOUR FACE!!</li>
            <li> When it first came out, i thought i should give it a try, since Norelco razors never disappointed me, and when i was using non-electric razors, i always shaved in the shower.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of my first cordless razor from 1985!  </li>
            <li> The shave is slightly less smooth than a good razor shave.  </li>
            <li> The razor also has a nice rubber grip that makes it easy to hold when its wet.    </li>
            <li> Yet, for nearly $150 less than the top of the line model and superior shaving capability, I&#x27;ll figure out how to securely pack it.</li>
            <li> He found he got the best feeling and closest share only when he used a lot of shaving creme/gel &amp; had his face very well, making for quite a mess on the sink top.</li>
            <li> I can shave everyday with this and get a great shave.</li>
            <li> But, does not shave close enough which is the most important element with the shaver.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, it is capable of delivering a good shave, but it has too many drawbacks to recommend for everyday use.      </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s onlya month&#x27;s worth).  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, it works best when shaving wet, using a lot of the moisturizer, and taking a lot of time to do so.  </li>
            <li> But even if it was, it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> The head cover is a plastic cover to protect the blades; useful for traveling.    </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.y skin.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Now back to the most important function.</li>
            <li> I figured with all these additional features, the 8040X was worth the additional money.</li>
            <li> With the excellent coverage of the razor head, my shaving time has decreased significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Norelco 8040X is a good razor equal to all of the very well made ones norelco produces.  </li>
            <li> I still prefer a nice, wet, in-the-shower shave with this razor to my twin-blade manual razor, especially on the sensitive under-chin area, but that 7737 really did a great job!</li>
            <li> I found the comfort gel to be quite effective, but I couldn&#x27;t find replacements in my local stores.</li>
            <li> in that it requires several passes over an area to get a nice shave.  </li>
            <li> The flexible head design is amazing; it can really get that stubborn neck hair that my old shaver used to miss.  </li>
            <li> The shaver was as good as I expected.  </li>
            <li> There is a bladder that contains Nivea moisturizing lotion which make the shaver work extra nice.  </li>
            <li> I find that useful because I know when to remove my shaver from the charger, so as not to damage the battery by over-charging.</li>
            <li> Keep a standard razor handy.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback to the razor I could mention is that it is kind of a pain to change between the shaving head and the trimming head.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE ITEM FOR A REASONABLE PRICE, A BIT CHEAP LOOK AND MISSING A STRAP FOR HANGING.  </li>
            <li> There should be no unforgivable sins; your better qualities should always offer the hope that your failings, however profound, can be overcome.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;Yet, for nearly $150 less than the top of the line model and superior shaving capability, I&#x27;ll figure out how to securely pack it.oes not require anywhere near as much pressure to achieve a close cut on stubble as has been my experience with the top of the line model.</li>
            <li> I am ecstatic over my new Cool Skin 8040x!</li>
            <li> Also great for dry or sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> And so they were right.  </li>
            <li> Thats right, and it aint no lie.</li>
            <li> : My first shave was extremely comfortable, with zero irritation; thanks to the glide rings provided on each model.</li>
            <li> Then I saw this Norelco wet shaver on Amazon for an exceptional price, so I ordered one.</li>
            <li> No matter how much lotion I use, how many times I go over this area, how much I twist, turn and tug, this razor refuses to shave certain areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , this shaver is really light and easy to handle when shaving, especially tougher areas that require holding the shaver upright at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Waterproof</li>
            <li> It is a very sleek and cool looking razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not shaving a beard everyday or anything but the good news is that most of the stubble seems to stick near the plastic head.</li>
            <li> This is also when the Cool Skin moisturizer really shines -</li>
            <li> It is a great relief that I found a shaver that wont hold me hostage like that, save for a little bitof moisturizing lotion that goes in the shaver (you dont really need a lot if you shave in the shower or by the sink).</li>
            <li> Hence, I was in the market for a new shaver and thought I will research the shavers available since I was going to spend some money.    </li>
            <li> I keep new cheap razors in the drawer, as this razor just will NOT get everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin especially around adams apple area and thought this moisturizing shaver would be a good for me.  </li>
            <li> I had a 20% savings certificate from the local Bed, Bath and Beyond, and bought the 8040X at the same price I would have paid for the 8020X elsewhere, so I found a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I had the previous version of the CoolSkin razor, and really loved it.  </li>
            <li> I like the open head because it is easy to keep clean.    </li>
            <li> charge holds quite nice, and longer than I expected, even right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> What I have observed, however, is that the new model has no advantages, but one significant disadvantage.  </li>
            <li> I got a clean close shave that was way better than I expected.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated or dry, and the lubrication seems to help the shave to go more quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very little irritation and smooth effective shave.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric razor in 40 years.</li>
            <li> First impressions:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nevertheless, I will continue to use this shaver for several more weeks and will post an update at that time.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I will continue to use this shaver for several more weeks and will post an update at that time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger and cuts better.</li>
            <li> First off I must say this is my first electric razor that I have owned.  </li>
            <li> First I had to decide on a foil razor or rotary razor.  </li>
            <li> Solution to this is not to refill the lotion resovoir after depleting first fill.</li>
            <li> My shaving procedure is, after taking a shower, to first wash my face thoroughly with liquid soap and hot water, leaving the soap lather on my face.  </li>
            <li> I then apply a moderate amount of skin lotion (I use Dermalube, but most skin lotions will do) over my face evenly, and then proceed to shave without using any Nivea lotion.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I first started shaving I have always used a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> My review is actually pretty</li>
            <li> I applied a shaving gel to my face first then started shaving.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaved with it for the first time today</li>
            <li> head conforms to whatever surface I&#x27;m shaving pretty well, and just looks</li>
            <li> Still, I liked the convenience and the ease of the Syncro and the fact that it held up to rough use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the way the Floating Heads give a close shave, and the way the pop-up sideburn trimmer works crisply and efficiently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To begin shaving, you first press the on/off button on the shaver to turn it on and then press the conditioner release button.</li>
            <li> The 1090x is Philips/Norelco&#x27;s flagship razor and this one is more of a middle of the road competitively priced product so any comparison is unfair...for the 1090x.</li>
            <li> Just turn it on and wash the heads under hot running water.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor.</li>
            <li> At first i didnt like this razor but now that my face has \\&quot;adapted\\&quot; to it</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME,</li>
            <li> I USE THE MORE EXPENSIVE{NIVERA} SHAVING CREAM, ABOVE MY UPPER{MUSTACHE AREA} LIP AREA &amp; MY NECK AREAS!!</li>
            <li> gave the Norelco 8040X a solid week of use, thinking that it might get better over time (as their manual suggests).  </li>
            <li> but it did shave pretty well on my chin/cheek though).</li>
            <li> lighter, smaller, yet sturdier, more convenient to refill the lotion.</li>
            <li> this is not only more convenient, but also cleaner/healthier</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t seem to be as smooth as I was with my old shaver, but Norelco recommends using the shaver for 21 days to become accustomed to it.</li>
            <li> First, let me tell you about the shavers I have had.    </li>
            <li> The shaver went into the shower for its first test run.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver is FAST!  </li>
            <li> Most recently, that role has been admirably served by a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I have used other electric razors without finding any that I liked</li>
            <li> I soon learned that I could get a really close shave [and a faster one] simply by using more pressure.  </li>
            <li> All my life I have hoped that technology would finally allow a electric shaver that would actually shave as good as a razer blade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for years, but never a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; system, so I was quite interested to compare the Cool Skin 8040X to my old shaver.</li>
            <li> I have also noted that Norelco now supplies a flimsy plastic construction of the razor, whereas the older razor was much more rugged, a not surprising evolution of articles of this kind.    </li>
            <li> After my first use, I was used to the ergonomics (it is a completely different design from the Syncro), facial coverage was exceptional.</li>
            <li> The shave lotion also smells nicer, more like an aftershave, though it did burn a little; most likely the result of alcohol (which is used to create that nicer smell) though the burning quickly subsided.</li>
            <li> -- you need to use a special shaving cream bottle as the nossle needs to inject the cream directly into the shaving unit.  </li>
            <li> with most electric shavers on the market, you get convenience, simple charging, savings on consumable blades and cream, and a nice little gadget for your bathroom with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> But if you do not need or want a real close shave or if you&#x27;re a teenager first shaving, then I do believe the Philips Norelco 8040x is for you.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t skip more than a day of shaving with it, though, or the long hairs just won&#x27;t get cut.  </li>
            <li> By being bigger,the blades are further away from the body of the razor and easy to manipulate.    </li>
            <li> This was no problem following the easy to read instruction</li>
            <li> The shaver has enough capacity for maybe 4 uses and the shaver is easily refilled.    </li>
            <li> My previous Norelco&#x27;s all came with nice cases to travel with, but this is just some flimsy neoprene wrap...  </li>
            <li> Norelco 8040X is a nice idea, but it&#x27;s gimmicky and labor intensive, when all I want is a quick shave and then a quick rinse of the heads and the knowledge that my shaver will be ready and willing the next morning.</li>
            <li> Um.........     This Norelco 8040X is a nice idea, but it&#x27;s gimmicky and labor intensive, when all I want is a quick shave and then a quick rinse of the heads and the knowledge that my shaver will be ready and willing the next morning.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t grow a big or strong beard.</li>
            <li> It certainly won&#x27;t be the quickest shave that you&#x27;ve ever had, but if you take your time, you can get results that rival even a blade.        </li>
            <li> Also, going on leave, you can&#x27;t take things like razors, shaving cream in large bottles, aftershave lotion in large bottles, and the like.  </li>
            <li> certainly closer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> B00008DQJQ Factory Reconditioned Braun 7526 Syncro Smart Logic Shaver]]</li>
            <li> slimmer head lets you shave hard to reach areas more easily, blades don&#x27;t go into the head, but still flexible.</li>
            <li> That seemed fine, until this morning when I accidentally broke a piece of this fragile cartridge.  </li>
            <li> this razor handled the extra growth just fine.</li>
            <li> the price this seems a very high quality electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Another major difference between the 8060 and the lower models, is that the 8060 automatically refills the shaver&#x27;s bladder so the shaver is full of lotion every time you use it.</li>
            <li> This Item is almost very good ,only thing I want to say is that the speed is a bit slow.</li>
            <li> It shaved me but it seems I had to be doing too much work in ensuring that it is</li>
            <li> To be honest, the experience wasn&#x27;t really any different and took me the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> The charger uses regular cheap wire contacts for charging rather than induction like my Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> The company clearly wants to reap profits on consumables.  </li>
            <li> Used wet in the shower, its performance is much better.  </li>
            <li> Instead, the power light will begin to flash when the battery is getting low.  </li>
            <li> The 8040X Moisturizing Shave System promises too much.  </li>
            <li> When the razor needs to be charged, a red light comes on.</li>
            <li> it really lubricates    </li>
            <li> and it works very well and is smoother than the Nivea.    </li>
            <li> Gives shave that is very close to a razor even without the Nivea lotion.  </li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t quite as fast</li>
            <li> and I got a very close shave because of the  moisture system and would recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li> In short, if you only plan to use this razor in the shower this is a great choice, but if you need to use the razor outside of the shower as well, you may want to choose something else.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well in the shower and eliminates the need to separately lather.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough  -</li>
            <li> razor&#x27;s tracking system follows facial contours (head in my case) quite efficiently and does not require anywhere near as much pressure to achieve a close cut on stubble as has been my experience with the top of the line model.</li>
            <li> If I bought the low-end shaver that charges in 8 hours, I&#x27;d charge it in the morning and it would be ready when I get home from work.  </li>
            <li> The only way I could get this smooth with a blade would&#x27;ve been with a ton of irritation.</li>
            <li> Really didnt work that well and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> And from what I can see it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li> Its also comfortable to hold and the smaller design makes it easier to travel with (as well as the fact that it includes a travel lock).</li>
            <li> and I must say it has absolutely blown me away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery is dying in this thing fast.  </li>
            <li> As he really likes Philips products he was looking forward to trying the Moisturizing Shaving</li>
            <li> you are considering changing to an electric razor, or have one but sometimes miss getting a really close shave, this system is highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> When you shave, it&#x27;s much easier to get to hard-to-reach areas of the face, since the body of the shaver creates no restrictions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the Braun has held up well, two aspects of the Philips Norelco 8040X really compelled me.  </li>
            <li> However even with the lotion (which is reasonably priced)</li>
            <li> For me a battery charge on this thing lasts between 15 and 20 days, when the red charge light comes on</li>
            <li> When the battery finally died in it, I purchases this one just because it was the next version of the razor I liked.  </li>
            <li> so I opted to buy the new model 8040X since, after all, the older model had really worked for me over a long period of time, and maybe the newer model would have some worthwhile advantages.    </li>
            <li> I used it right after a shower with my face still wet along with the nivea lotion and let me tell you, WOW!!!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I could grow on using this shaver except for the high upkeep costs and very high outlay cost of the unit itself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various models of Philips Norelco shavers for the past 8 years and have always been happy with them.</li>
            <li> so now I have to clean the sink constantly...</li>
            <li> The open design makes it not that great for dry shaving as the hair gets everywhere, but I use it 98% of the time in the shower that that is not a big issue for me.      </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a comfortable shave... as long as it&#x27;s very lubricated.</li>
            <li> I do lube my face with shampoo, and only use the cream when I hit a dry spot, and so far so good.    </li>
            <li> I use it mainly for beard trimming and find  that it gives me greater control than other razors.</li>
            <li> Thirdly, I bought a 3oz bottle of Nivea (it is a special bottle)</li>
            <li> I suppose someone who wants to, can, with a little ingenuity and transparent mailing tape, take this Clamshell Package and create a travel container for their 8040x-- which might be a good idea, because the fabric travel pouch that Norelco supplies with this shaver only holds the shaver, and not the accessories -- unless you want to cram everything into the travel case and NOT close it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I still love this shaver, I buy the Nivia shaving creame and put it on my face at the begining of a shower and about half way though shave with the shaver and its absolutely equiviliant to a blade shave, except you have to replace the shaving heads</li>
            <li> - I already mentioned smooth, but LONG shave.  </li>
            <li> Also, the pump system that feeds the conditioner into the razor is proprietary, i.e. you can&#x27;t just fill it with any skin conditioner because only the Nivea Cool Skin fits the razor&#x27;s plug.  </li>
            <li> Wow it really works in the shower!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Putting the moisturizer into the shaver is a feat that involves pumping the cartridge manually and then cleaning up the excess moisturizer that suddenly splats out of the shaver when it is full.</li>
            <li> Putting the moisturizer into the shaver is a feat that involves pumping the cartridge manually and then cleaning up the excess moisturizer that suddenly splats out of the shaver when it is full.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ll start out by saying that I am 67 years old...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m coming from a Philishave Cool Skin, which is the same as the Norelco</li>
            <li> The whole idea of a electric is to speed up the process but between loading it with the conditioner, using it, adding more water, cleaning up the mess</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, particularly around my neck</li>
            <li> I would like to believe that its lightweight, comfortable form and good battery life could redeem it, but sadly, its transgression is too profound.</li>
            <li> just wet your face  - easy to use (</li>
            <li> The shaver is constructed well and is lighter and more compact than previous models.</li>
            <li> Each time I buy a bit more expensive model hoping I&#x27;ll save even more time each morning...</li>
            <li> This is particularly the case if you don&#x27;t use the shaver for a while, which allows the cream to solidify.  </li>
            <li> The pouch is a soft cloth and really doesn&#x27;t offer much protection.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go and pick up a different brand, or something unscented (as the alcohol in scented products burns my skin too, and this does to a mild degree).  </li>
            <li> You have to remove the shaving heads from the main shaft and attach the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> , it was more of a whim that I picked up the 8040x, to see the difference and see if maybe the ease of the electric would finally get me away from a standard razor for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Not as speedy as older models&lt;</li>
            <li> as speedy as older models  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what he had to say about this product: I was afraid to use the lubricating gel, many things with fragrance of any kind</li>
            <li> There is a 9 minute quick charge capability that provides enough power for a three minute shave.</li>
            <li> There is a 9 minute quick charge capability that provides enough power for a three minute shave.</li>
            <li> almost solved all the existing problems with the older model.</li>
            <li> Decent electric</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something to be said for the ease and convenience of an electric razor, but for obvious reasons, they almost always lack the closeness of a true blade, and rarely leave your skin feeling quite as refreshed as the traditional route.  </li>
            <li> The instruction book is very thorough -- but the warnings interspersed throughout are in grey print -- how about bold black?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not over doing it here, and it is going quick!  </li>
            <li> I am more inclined to not clean those razors out</li>
            <li> So why 4 stars (I would say 3.5, a little better than the halfway mark)?</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the propriety Nivea shaving moisturizer; I just use a small dollop of Nivea&#x27;s regular shaving gel ($3 for a large canister available anywhere) and that works fine.  </li>
            <li> I still have a previous Norelco shaver (dry) and I will try that again, although it is not as good.  </li>
            <li> So when I shave my beard is a little bit longer than most men&#x27;s would normally be.</li>
            <li> For a unit that costs this much, this is a completely unacceptable practice.</li>
            <li> * Close, comfortable shave when used wet  </li>
            <li> To summarize:  Pros  - really smooth shave when used wet</li>
            <li> When used as a wet shaver and with the moisturizing cream, it does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> However in a normal working setting this may not be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually have fun using it and would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> For more than a few years I had been using the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Then again, it is a waste of plastics made even more wasteful when you consider the price of petroleum nowadays, and the inability to recycle this type of plastic.</li>
            <li> Then you shave as you normally would with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The rotary heads can be replaced with fresh blades at a later date.  </li>
            <li> and so it also solves the soap scum problem if you want to use your own shaving foam/gel or even soap.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this in the shower, as you&#x27;ll waste more money in water bills than getting a close shave outta this</li>
            <li> The 8040 does a solid job and has adequate power for a beard that grows in pretty fully on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> My old Advantage gave me a much closer shave than the new Norelco 8040x.  </li>
            <li> The fact that I have no irritation or bleeding is a very acceptable trade-off for the slightly less smooth shave in my case.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to shave in about half the time as with my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but there are several downsides noticeable right off</li>
            <li> Yes, the wet shave function of this makes the time a little more intense, but I feel the trade off is worth it when it doesn&#x27;t eat up my skin.  </li>
            <li> However, it might not hold its charge as long or charge as quickly.  </li>
            <li> My first few shaves were okay, not terrific, even using the moisturizer provided.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Nivea and Norelco team up to produce a fragrance free version as this product does conflict with other scents the consumer might use.  </li>
            <li> I tried to buy a new lotion with cartridge at Target, and the lotion came without the cartridge, so I have to return it.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;Just picked up my new Norelco 8040X shaver yesterday from Target.  </li>
            <li> I decided to go with it as the new floating heads intrigued me.  </li>
            <li> I like my new shaver.</li>
            <li> The new design is easier to manipulate than the bulky models that preceded it.</li>
            <li> My new 8040X:</li>
            <li> Shaving Conditioner reservoir on the shaver itself has to be replaced each time you start a new bottle of Nevia Shaving Conditioner</li>
            <li> Also, the light signifiying that the unit is re-charging is muted (which is both good and bad)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable enough to use every day, though, especially when used in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Even with my old shaver, I would get some irritation; particularly on my neck.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I have to be selective.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The little sideburn trimmer is unique, but I don&#x27;t really use it.  </li>
            <li> (It must have learned its lesson being in the garbage for nearly a week!)</li>
            <li> And unlike any blade I&#x27;ve used over nearly 30 years of shaving, these razors do not irritate my skin at all!</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package and set the shaver up, I had to not only charge the batteries but also fill the shaver with Nivea For Men shaving conditioner.</li>
            <li> Having used regular razors all my life, this was my first experience to an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> The booklet recommends giving it 3 weeks, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be able to talk him into that... wonder how this thing would work on my legs?</li>
            <li> Overall, I could grow on using this shaver except for the high upkeep costs and very high outlay cost of the unit itself.  </li>
            <li> It is an overall very simple and clean design;  there are two buttons (one for power and one to dispense lotion) and two recessed LED&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> i believe Norelco really closely reviewed all the downfalls of the older models and made big improvements by fixing them all.</li>
            <li> In summary, the new model 8040X provides the same comfortable wet shave experience as the older model, but don&#x27;t look for any improvements.</li>
            <li> find that the results of my shave are the same whether I use my old standard Norelco or this new Norelco Cool Skin 8040X, with one exception:</li>
            <li> I find that the results of my shave are the same whether I use my old standard Norelco or this new Norelco Cool Skin 8040X, with one exception:</li>
            <li> The open design of the heads also makes it easier to clean, but I just don&#x27;t understand why this razor would perform so much poorer than a similar model from several years ago.</li>
            <li> Slick, smooth, it is not irritating my neck as the old Advantage used to.</li>
            <li> After a couple of days shaving with my new 8040x, I realized (and my wife agreed) that it did not shave nearly as close as my old Norelco Advantage did.    </li>
            <li> In fact, after using it religiously for 2 weeks, I had more ingrown hairs and odd stubble than ever before.  </li>
            <li> My fiancé is probably my biggest critic when it comes to shaving and she actually prefers this model to my previous one b/c now I am shaving everyday and have greater periods of a smooth face instead of scruffy one.</li>
            <li> As long as its not banged around too much it would make for a decent travel razor.</li>
            <li> The main problem I find with this new design is that the heads/razors are floating and not encased as previous models and most other shavers.</li>
            <li> The overall quality is just as good as previous models and other Philips/Norelco products.   </li>
            <li> Once done shaving I rinse the lotion off my face with cold water and splash some after shave on and feel great.    </li>
            <li> Clearly it looks like they made this razor either for just an afternoon touch-up shave</li>
            <li> Clearly, the Syncro could not give me the close shave of the Sensor Excel.</li>
            <li> It works a lot better on a wet face with a wet shaver.  </li>
            <li> Given that I rarely/never use the old fashioned razor and shaving cream, it&#x27;s probably not a surprise.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the idea of guessing how much juice I have left.      </li>
            <li> Takes about 4 hours to completely charge.</li>
            <li> A green light in the handle  flashes while charging and stays lit when fully charged.</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and have been shaving with Norelco electric shavers since I was 16 -- making me a 50 year user of Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li> The day before my scheduled garbage pick-up I rummaged through the garbage in my trash can and found my old Norelco Advantage.  </li>
            <li> After being in the trash can for nearly a week, I discovered that it would once again hold a battery charge.  </li>
            <li> You can use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;  This to me seemed very convenient as I could shave as I&#x27;m getting showering which in my eyes saved some time from having to do the traditional way.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I have owned and used an early model of this razor, known as the Norelco Advantage for perhaps eight or so years.  </li>
            <li> I can figure that out without paying extra money thank you very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t want to spend the extra for the fast charge</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t want to spend the extra for the fast charge</li>
            <li> I have been using the Norelco 8040X for about 6 weeks now and am very, pleasantly surprised.    </li>
            <li> I do it the old fashined way.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday and even on 2-day growth, and it works fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The heads on the 8040X DO flex, but the moisturizing cream/gel only comes through two of them when all three heads with moisturizer would work much better -- the heads also drag across my skin -- and in some instances gave me a bit of razor burn -- especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> Physically, the razor is much slimmer and lighter than the Norelco arcitec 1090.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised by this electric shave - moisturizer system.  </li>
            <li> A pretty minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A pretty minor issue.    </li>
            <li> His face is smoother after using this probably because of its massaging action.</li>
            <li> This razor offers some additional features my old one lacked:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge issue for me because I have a light beard, but I thought these things were supposed to get faster with time, not</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge issue for me because I have a light beard, but I thought these things were supposed to get faster with time, not slower.    </li>
            <li> When I found myself going back over my face with a regular razor right after I used the 8040X, I knew this shaver had to go.</li>
            <li> Run hot water, hold the head under running water, tap on sink gently, dry off, and you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li> Again, I am NOT typically a fan of electric razors, and this razor happily surprised me with its performance.  </li>
            <li> My first usage was dry and without the application of the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> there is much less skin irritation with the Cool Skin.</li>
            <li> there is much less skin irritation with the Cool Skin.</li>
            <li> Over time, about a year, it dulled out to being less and less effective</li>
            <li> While one of the other Norelco models - Norelco 1090 costs upwards of $200, I can say that this model 8040x is a steal of the money - the moisturizer feature makes every penny worth.    </li>
            <li> No irritation and not much mess either.</li>
            <li> the only negative thing i gave the shaver is that it doesnt do good with long hairs..</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband, hoping he would get hooked by even the novelty of it and use it everyday, I like a freshly clean shaven look on him</li>
            <li> Very satisified with first few uses of this shaver.  </li>
            <li> After spending numerous hours researching electric razors, I settled on this particular model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research</li>
            <li> But I decided to try again mainly after researching the product, noticing the \\&quot;send it back after trail\\&quot; guarantee.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older model Norelco wet/dry shaver that finally gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only three blades (as opposed to high end</li>
            <li> After the use, my face was smooth and soft and, unlike my efforts with the Syncro, very few missed</li>
            <li> The only way i could really get a great smooth shave with a blade was to shave AGAINST the growth, however, this gave me awful irritation and ingrown hairs.    </li>
            <li> On the other hand, the shaver has a lithium ion battery (not familiar with many models with this feature) that seems to last a long time and charge quickly when needed.    </li>
            <li> The overall shave is just a smidge less smooth than a quality shave from a razor.      </li>
            <li> Do find some minor irritation which goes away quickly, no worse than shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave, no more razor burn.     </li>
            <li> though I&#x27;ve never really saved much time!    </li>
            <li> Be sure to give it a few days before making final judgements as even though I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 20 years now, my skin and facial hair had to get used to this one.</li>
            <li> Works great, continues the less painful shaving tradition of the cool skin line.  </li>
            <li> more than once a year as the dull every 6 months with daily use and the quality of the shave declines.  </li>
            <li> This product did not come anywhere near my skin no matter how light or hard</li>
            <li> Since this model was distinctly different from the others I had purchased before, I thought it would be a revolutionary new experience shaving in the shower</li>
            <li> I applied a $10.00 coupon obtained from the Norelco web site so the total cost for my new razor was</li>
            <li> It only leaves the very bottom part of the beard on my neck slightly red</li>
            <li> It shaves close without chaffing my face, even the first time, unlike some of the other brands.  </li>
            <li> To me this is a major oversight and design flaw.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Norelco user for decades, but after having two cool skin models fail on me recently (the first after 3 years, the second after only one), I decided to try another brand.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving nearly 30 years now and have tried electric shavers in no less than 3 different stints in my life (never Norelco before).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is something I also noticed with my past model, but it seems like Norelco shavers have for whatever reason gotten *less* effective and take longer to shave.  </li>
            <li> This is something I also noticed with my past model, but it seems like Norelco shavers have for whatever reason gotten *less* effective and take longer to shave.  </li>
            <li> though I still prefer a manual razor or even my older, similar Norelco which is basically the same</li>
            <li> My old Norelco provided a shave that was very smooth and comparable to a blade; with this model, there&#x27;s noticeable beard fuzz left behind immediately after I shave, and by the end of the day, I look like I forgot to shave at all that morning.</li>
            <li> It might be hard just finding this type of special cream, and will likely be very overpriced relative to its volume.  </li>
            <li> AT, DOLLAR GENERAL STORES OR</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so lazy that I would pay the extra $50 primarily to have the shaver refill itself.</li>
            <li> During my ownership of the Norelco Advantage razor I have had only one maintenance action, and that was the replacement of the battery about three years ago at a cost of about $43.    </li>
            <li> The old model could also run about a week with only a one hour charge.  </li>
            <li> Now to this shaver (I gave the info above just to compare a 10 year old shaver to the 8040).</li>
            <li> secondly, I have tried nearly every brand of electric razor that has ever been made, and I have given them all away because they all just tore my neck to pieces...</li>
            <li> But then, the one on my old Norelco is the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With the shower running, I could barely hear the motor.  </li>
            <li> This one, I can barely tolerate.  </li>
            <li> My old shaver did not have a base and was great for travel as the AC adapter plugged directly into the razor.    </li>
            <li> Kind of a shocker to see this on an expensive shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied with this razor---only one problem, the moisturizing cream is very expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Those aside, there were a few things that I liked, and a few things that bugged me about this specific</li>
            <li> I like my new shaver.en using the shaver, so occasionally I&#x27;ll get an extra, unneeded dose of conditioner.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a problem spending a little extra time shaving and shaving wet only - get it, it&#x27;s one of the most plesant experiences.</li>
            <li> but then the razor would quickly collect soap scum if you used regular shaving gel (which isn&#x27;t the razor&#x27;s fault but the new model solved this problem.</li>
            <li> The first, that it could be used in the shower -- my interest in this was less about convenience than it was how the water might change the way my skin feels after an electric shave.  </li>
            <li> I personally preferred their two blade ones not only because they were smaller and lighter, but also because it shaved better in those hard to reach areas (like under my nose).</li>
            <li> For the past several years I have been held hostage by the Braun company consumables (Clean and Charge solutions).</li>
            <li> For three days I shaved one side with my old Norelco Advantage and the other side with my new Norelco 8040x.  </li>
            <li> One other point which pertains to both the old and the new model -- there is no need to use the Nivea shaving lotion supplied by Norelco.  </li>
            <li> is a nice product, but is over-priced and difficult to find in stock locally (DFW metro area).  </li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about a month and a half now, and I really don&#x27;t have any major complaints.</li>
            <li> I was mostly interested in comfort, not speed, and you do have to be a little patient using these.    </li>
            <li> Suddenly that close, wet shave is looking pretty pricey in terms of time and money compared to simply going back to shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li> The same applies when using the Cool Skin, but with less irritation as it is now being done with skin conditioner in place instead of on dry</li>
            <li> While an electric shaver is much safer than a traditional razor, even an electric shaver can leave some burns on your skin and make it rough if you do not apply enough moisturizer.   </li>
            <li> They have always torn my skin up, left it burning on fire red, and full of bumps and never able to get close.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seeing as how this was my first shave, I&#x27;ll reserve any additional comments until I&#x27;ve used the razor for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not amazing compared to other models, I wish they had skipped the lotion chamber and put three times as many batteries inside instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not amazing compared to other models, I wish they had skipped the lotion chamber and put three times as many batteries inside instead.    </li>
            <li> Really, the price needs to come down for this shaver to be competitive.  </li>
            <li> Really, the price needs to come down for this shaver to be competitive.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a very high quality one, but it did the trick and seemed less hassled than a blade.  </li>
            <li> I can do a relatively quick shave, maybe 7 minutes or so to get the desired results of at least a clean-cut appearance.  </li>
            <li> But this is the only way the razor could accommodate a trimmer due to the main shaft function that powers the three heads.  </li>
            <li> The only real fault with the Cool Skin is this trimmer which, frankly, is useless.</li>
            <li> I find this procedure to be both superior and much less expensive than using the Nivea lotion.    </li>
            <li> At age 66, I figure I have maybe 20 more years of shaving ahead of me, but if the shaving closeness of new Norelco&#x27;s is as bad as the 8040x, maybe I ought to buy a couple of the old Norelco Advantage shavers from e-bay or someplace and store them up to use for the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little green flashing light that tells you when it needs charged, is charging, and done charging.  </li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s kind of like a little guessing game.  </li>
            <li> : Generally I shave every other day, though I probably should shave everyday, I stretch it to every other day without it being a huge problem.</li>
            <li> The new model must be left on charge no more that four hours to prevent battery damage, whereas I could leave the old model on charge all day, which provided me with about two weeks of shaving before the next required charge.</li>
            <li> There is a separate button for dispensing the moisturizer, and the process seemed similar to putting on a little shaving cream, shaving a small area and then applying more when the razor started to drag.</li>
            <li> (i saw many other reviewers complaining about the head being broken soon) and the cushioned discs (blades) would sink into the head</li>
            <li> While I cannot attest or comment on previous Coolskin models, that I have never owned, I can say that I can live with the power and speed of this shaver for several reasons.</li>
            <li> While this is not as nice as the Arcitec&#x27;s LED that shows the remaining time left on the battery, this razor is smaller (and a lot less expensive) and there probably isn&#x27;t room for the display.    </li>
            <li> My past shavers: I have had a Braun Synchro (lost with luggage on an international trip), a Norelco Reflex that I absolutely hated (but still hung on to for emergencies) and a Braun Activator 8595 (with Clean N Charge station) that I had till recently and absolutely loved.</li>
            <li> As I was researching I came across the 8040X on Amazon and was intrigued by the idea of a wet shaver (having used only foil dry ones thus far).</li>
            <li> He also agrees with the other reviewers who said it&#x27;s just not a close enough shave, and that it takes far to long.</li>
            <li> In the instruction manual it actually says to wet your face before using it ultimately meaning it is not a dry shaver, but it does not take long to splash water on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first used an electric razor in my late teens.  </li>
            <li> Though, I&#x27;m not sure they are much quicker still than a blade nor</li>
            <li> But given its cost - both immediate and in the long run - this just isn&#x27;t enough return on your investment.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;My only two complaints (if they can be called complaints since they are so minor) are (1) the scent of the moistureizer and (2) the charger.</li>
            <li> The new head design is a single drive, instead of previous norelco units that drive all 3 heads independently.  </li>
            <li> With the older one, i used it with just regular shaving gel, coz it worked better for me, and those cartridges were just very inconvenient to replace after like every three shaves.</li>
            <li> And finally, the amount of cream stored onboard is so small that I have to inject new cream daily.  </li>
            <li> The fact that wife may have used the same razor on who knows what before I got to it also taints the whole experience since the blades would be too dull for words.</li>
            <li> Yes I miss a spot now and then, and you do have to lube your face with soap or the stuff in the pump on the razor, but that is no major problem for me.</li>
            <li> Being new to the world of electric shaving, I did get a few burns on my neck area.  </li>
            <li> It had been a few years since I bought a new unit when this item came up for sale.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, don&#x27;t even try to use it as a dry shaver.</li>
            <li> When I come to a spot that&#x27;s dry on my face, I push the button briefly and let go.  </li>
            <li> If you are going to partner with someone, make sure they are going to make enough product and don&#x27;t price the complementary item crazily.  </li>
            <li> It definitely gave a closer shave than a dry electric razor</li>
            <li> /&gt;My second usage was dry and with the use of the moistureizer and the unit was fully charged.</li>
            <li> I first started looking at an electric razor as wet shaving seemed a drag, a waste of time and just a pain.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco 8040X IMHO probably work just as well on dry skin as on wet -- but it&#x27;s nothing I would want to use on a regular basis.zor burn -- especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> Because of this, in recent years I&#x27;ve starting shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> It is a little slower than my old Norelco Advantage</li>
            <li> And, you really have to press the head hard against your skin.  </li>
            <li> So on average every 2.5 weeks I have to buy a new bottle and that&#x27;s with the fact that I shave every other day.</li>
            <li> It only misses a few hairs every other shave but usually gets them all quickly.</li>
            <li> This shaver is extremely comfortable, I finish each shave with almost no irritation, whereas my old shaver would often leave my neck red and could be quite painful.</li>
            <li> Charging the unit took a long time.  </li>
            <li> in fact, it&#x27;s downright necessary to get the heads to glide over your face when used wet.  </li>
            <li> Not really a pain per se, just different.  </li>
            <li> the last I used an electric shaver was a few years ago, and it left me with my skin a bit red</li>
            <li> I am not old </li>
            <li> third usage was wet (int he shower) and with the use of the moistureizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll forget I ever owned it before long.</li>
            <li> 8 hours just seems too long to fully charge my shaver.</li>
            <li> After using is for a short time I found that I never really got that close shave.</li>
            <li> Norelco has lost a long time customer with this piece of garbage razor.</li>
            <li> You might want to be aware of the cons I&#x27;ve noted, and keep in mind you can follow up on Norelco&#x27;s guarantee if you&#x27;re not happy with your individual shave.n electric razor is so you don&#x27;t have to keep paying for blades!  </li>
            <li> You might want to be aware of the cons I&#x27;ve noted, and keep in mind you can follow up on Norelco&#x27;s guarantee if you&#x27;re not happy with your individual shave.</li>
            <li> it will last only a month or may be month and half.    </li>
            <li> The Norelco 8040X IMHO probably work just as well on dry skin as on wet -- but it&#x27;s nothing I would want to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> My other complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near how long Norelco/Nivea says it is supposed to last.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was slightly disappointed at the whisker tugs and slight razor burn and the ergonomics but decided to give it another chance since my first usage did not use the moistureizer and the unit had not been completely charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not that its not smooth at all, its just seems a little less smooth than I was with my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> Unimpressive shave results when used dry  </li>
            <li> is that it does not do well as a dry razor.  </li>
            <li> Now it is a dry shaver and can be rinsed out.</li>
            <li> I just cringe when I see others shaving with an electric dry now.  </li>
            <li> Using it dry causes a lot of irratation.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T HAVE DRY SKIN ANYMORE EITHER.</li>
            <li> on the neck compare to dry razors.</li>
            <li> When it starts to feel like a dry shave, you press the button again and finish up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tear my neck up, and gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve EVER had... even my leathery old skin is as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind with the Nivea lotion dispensed by the razor as a lubricant.</li>
            <li> That means that average shave should take 3 min (and we&#x27;ll get to that later).</li>
            <li> NOT worth the extra $20 or so</li>
            <li> Cool Skin can also be used in the shower, but I have not tried this as I&#x27;m blind as a bat without my glasses</li>
            <li> The Cool Skin can also be used in the shower, but I have not tried this as I&#x27;m blind as a bat without my glasses on.    </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco 8040X electric shaver is a compact, lightweight unit that can be used dry or wet.  </li>
            <li> (no big deal... take less than a minute).</li>
            <li> this rechargeable gets the job done with aplomb, with or without utilization of the moisturizing system, whether employed as a wet or dry shaver.</li>
            <li> Also because it had only 2 blades, it caused less friction on your skin, so it was easier to move it around on my face.    </li>
            <li> Dry, rough, even abraded at times.  </li>
            <li> It is not my practice to use the conditioner every time I shave (every other day) but at my present rate, I would anticipate the initial conditioner supply will last at least six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some other people complained about the fact that the shaving heads are open on the back so the shaved hair falls out the back while you are shaving.</li>
            <li> I have a medium to thick beard and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have a relatively thick beard growth (not extreme but not light) combined with average to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> so I have been unhappily dragging a cheap twin blade across my face for years now.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have of the body itself is the charging prongs on the bottom back side of the razor stick out and can poke your hand while using the razor.  </li>
            <li> The fact that 4 hours charge give me about 2 weeks of shaving was expected because it was clearly stated in the specs that the battery sucks.</li>
            <li> As for the problems people have with charging these, I generally put it on the charger around dinner time, and take it off before bed, as I usually hit the bathroom at those times anyway</li>
            <li> The lotion adds an additional consumable requirement, and shaving in the shower seems such a waste of water.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is a wet system intrigued me.</li>
            <li> You wet your skin, press the button, and shave.  </li>
            <li> However, I have used it as a wet shaver with foam.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, just got to be careful</li>
            <li> I think I spent a $25 on my 550 TL brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The irritation from this razor is extremely minimal.</li>
            <li> In all a well spent pile of money.  </li>
            <li> I will try and refresh this review in the next few weeks.         </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not really a hassle.    </li>
            <li> I used my old Norelco Reflex for a week on a temporary basis till I bought a better model and absolutely hated it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my face and head, with and without moisturizer, wet and dry, and its shave is pretty lousy.</li>
            <li> The power just seem weak, it is just slower than my remington or the older norelco</li>
            <li> do wish it would have come with a hard case, or leather or something other than the soft cloth-like \\&quot;bag\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain of the model number, but you get the idea that its the predecessor of this model, which used the lotion cartridges.</li>
            <li> This high end (and expensive) razor finally got me to switch.</li>
            <li> Used dry, the 8040X is below average compared to other shavers that I&#x27;ve used (including my five-year-old Norelco which still shaves rings around this one).  </li>
            <li> , i use to go once every 3-4 days with my blade because it was the opposite, if i where to shave every other day with my blade it would irrate and burn me, but if i go every 3-4 days with the philips shaver it doesnt/has a hard time grabbing the long hairs, so i managed to do it every other day</li>
            <li> What he doesn&#x27;t like is that if his beard gets a little too long, he feels that the hair is being pulled from his face rather than being shaved off.</li>
            <li> and I noticed other people complain about</li>
            <li> My other fear about the lotion, is what happens when Nivea stops making this stuff?  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t pop out like on some other models.  </li>
            <li> Recently it fell and one of the small plates of one of the heads broke.</li>
            <li> The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is due to</li>
            <li> Heads manueuvered to face curves extremely well.</li>
            <li> so i have to use the razor once every other day</li>
            <li> if your into shopping for a wet shaver, this is the one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of shavers and this one seems to work the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it seems to work as well as any other shaver I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It comes fully recharged and after about two weeks of using it about every other day it is still working well -- I haven&#x27;t charged it yet.  </li>
            <li> My Braun Activator (which I had for the past 3 years) broke when it slipped from my hand last week.</li>
            <li> No more Clean and Charge Refills (boy are they expensive)    </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with rough, or thick, facial hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I have a tough beard, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It still works as well as ever, however, but the razor is now quite hard to close to its proper operating position</li>
            <li> I either was pressing too hard or didn&#x27;t apply enough of the Nivea shaving conditioner to the razor; or a combination of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nevia Shaving Conditioner is not only hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> On the contrary, the need to push an additional button during shaving is actually distracting, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> Each time with disappointing success.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the shaver is unsatisfactory in one way: it just doesn&#x27;t shave very well.</li>
            <li> Only reason for not giving 5 stars is because the trimmer that comes with it basically sucks.</li>
            <li> Indeed, my only complaint is that the Nivea lotion has &#x27;fragrance&#x27; as an ingredient.  </li>
            <li> You then need to use the clipper attachment (this is provided) to trim it down..    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit inconvenient, for travel usage, that you&#x27;ve got to carry around the charging dock/cradle and can&#x27;t plug the AC right into the shaver.</li>
            <li> What this means for me: Now I shave everyday to maintain a smoother face; I&#x27;d probably get too scruffy if I tried to stretch it to every other day.</li>
            <li> Like all of the other Norelcos out there, the new design makes it difficult to store the razor when it is not in the charging stand.  </li>
            <li> (really? - almost anything above $100 charges in less than an hour)  - BAD trade-off</li>
            <li> Give it some time - typically about 3-4 weeks for your skin to get used to it</li>
            <li> (at half the price).     </li>
            <li> and I hated after wet shaving take more time to apply aftershave so to have a system that applies it while I&#x27;m shaving seemed like a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wet shaving is the key to the secret.  </li>
            <li> NiCad&lt;br /&gt;One of the things that irked me about the last razor I bought was that it still contained a ridiculously obsolete NiCad battery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a lot cooler looking, and takes up less space on the countertop than just plugging into the wall and laying the shaver sideways to charge.  </li>
            <li> Losing the battery charge level indicator is less helpful.</li>
            <li> The whisker tugs and slight razor burn were gone.</li>
            <li> I also found that one push of the moistureizer button was sufficient for one half of my face.</li>
            <li> The razor head covers keep falling off, all it takes is a slight twist and</li>
            <li> It allows for a closer shave with less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those familiar with the pop-up trimmer on other Norelco models may be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> One thing to keep in mind is that unlike other Norelco&#x27;s, the shaver head does not catch the trimmings so it may be a little messy if you do not use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> it was taking him 2x as long to shave at least, and with less steller results.    </li>
            <li> mess and gives me a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> however, there is nothing to catch the whiskers once they&#x27;ve been cut, so they just fall on the counter and make a mess if I&#x27;m at the sink.</li>
            <li> This pumps a small amount of conditioner out of holes in the center of two of the three shaver heads.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers are a bit hard to like them if you are migrating from a traditional razor - usually because your skin will need some time to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I apply very little of the Nivea shaving GEL (not conditioner) and apply gently, do not lather up heavily.</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower, and where I live it is illegal to shave and drive</li>
            <li> I have no problems with the angles on my face, or the tight corners under my nose, it takes a little learning, but I do quite well on these spots now.</li>
            <li> The Nivea conditioner that is used with the shaver is expensive in the long run - about $6 for a can that will last about a month (don&#x27;t believe what the box says -</li>
            <li> I stopped bleeding no irritation at all, way less breakouts, &amp; i shave everyday.</li>
            <li> I kept at it for a few days then sat down to read the manual to see if I was missing something.  </li>
            <li> Seems a little too gimicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to wash my face afterwards as to get the little hairs off of my face that it has just cut.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> I experimented a little in that</li>
            <li> A little background on me</li>
            <li> I use the shaver with little or no conditioner and it works just as well either in the shower or at the sink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve passed the 21 day break in period and still that area takes a little bit of chewing up from the blades.</li>
            <li> The shaver comes with a small sample bottle of the lotion -- and I guess one drawback is that you have to keep buying the lotion, unless you want to use this like an ordinary dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> I suggest (as I did) buying a few extra bottles here on Amazon with the purchase of this razor, at least one!  </li>
            <li> You can wash the heads in the shower and store the razor there for a week of shaves, then recharge in a few hours.  </li>
            <li> When shaving, you press a button and a few drops of gel comes up through the heads.  </li>
            <li> Of course I could be putting it on heavy, but I don&#x27;t feel that I am.  </li>
            <li> I got a lot closer shave, but still a few burns on the neck area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to wait until I&#x27;ve used the razor for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Packaging\\&quot; -- which is a waste of plastic and time.</li>
            <li> But as it was, this was just a waste of plastic.</li>
            <li> No matter how often I go over the same area, it leaves alot of hair behind.  </li>
            <li> every few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> unboxing, I felt really frustrated right off the bat.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE WAY LESS ACNE &amp; NO BUMPS!</li>
            <li> * Expensive cost-to-operate due to (very necessary)</li>
            <li> Over the past few years I&#x27;ve used a Panasonic electric foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> Now, Cons  - horrible dry shave - don&#x27;t ever try it in the morning - it feels like it&#x27;s pulling hair, not cutting it, missing half of it anyhow  - 4 hr charge?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much lighter, holds a charge longer, and has a silly and totally unnecessary shave-goo-dispensing system built into it.</li>
            <li> Nivea moisturizer is a little hard to find.  </li>
            <li> (one was from the ealry 90&#x27;s or maybe even late 80&#x27;s and the other was from the late 90&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> Very little noise     - ves:   - The moisturizer dispenser should have been made automatic, instead of manual control   -</li>
            <li> first I was quite disappointed.  </li>
            <li> However, this isn&#x27;t quite as slick as using the auto dispenser which was one of the selling points.  </li>
            <li> This small wonder delivers everything it advertises and then some.</li>
            <li> I usually skip shaving Saturday and Sunday mornings.</li>
            <li> Suggestion for you all: instead of using the conditioner, which is expensive and has to be dispensed often when shaving, try using Nivea for Men shaving gel that you can buy in your local grocery store.</li>
            <li> so I will say no more.</li>
            <li> No more razor burn.</li>
            <li> not sure why I dumpped a benji on this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but they can&#x27;t be this bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it out in the shower for the past couple of days</li>
            <li> I then decided to try a small travel pack of Nivea shaving gel.... and believe it or not....</li>
            <li> I just wish I wouldn&#x27;t have gone past my \\&quot;you&#x27;ll like it or get your money back\\&quot; period.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product is a major disappointment.  </li>
            <li> i have very thick black beard.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s tried a few electric razors in the past but was never happy with them</li>
            <li> But this shaver fails in the single unforgivable way that an electronic device can: despite lots of bells and whistles, it doesn&#x27;t do the one thing you purchase it to do.     </li>
            <li> even refilling it with the lotion is not as hard as it seems)  - comes with detachable sideburn trimmer, which can be stored in the charging stand.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly feel it.</li>
            <li> I understand why a model like this has such a requirement, but it&#x27;s inconvenient when you&#x27;re all dressed</li>
            <li> Another downfall with this razor is that it does not have a tray to collect the hair as it cuts it so at least in my experience</li>
            <li> My complaint about the lotion is that it&#x27;s proprietary.  </li>
            <li> but, well, it was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.</li>
            <li> (so there is really no reason to complain about the price of the consumables which i don&#x27;t think is that expensive anyways.)    </li>
            <li> and he had been slacking lately using his fusion disposables.     </li>
            <li> Some people complained about the Moisturizing lotion and having to buy it, I don&#x27;t see their problem, you used to buy shaving cream</li>
            <li> My hair is too thick to get a close shave</li>
            <li> THAT INCLUDES YOU GUYS WITH THICK,&amp; COURSE BEARDS</li>
            <li> slow razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I mean, I didn&#x27;t feel a thing)  </li>
            <li> How did this ever get past product testing, I don&#x27;t know!</li>
            <li> It has been at least 5-6 weeks since I bought the shaver and not surprisingly</li>
            <li> Clamshell packages have sent numerous folks to the hospital with some nasty cuts inflicted while trying to open this sealed, thick plastic, stubborn packaging.</li>
            <li> Apply a very small amount and do not lather it up vigorously...</li>
            <li> The lotion is expensive, and to make things worse, it is nearly impossible to find, unless you are willing to spend lots of money and buy it online.  </li>
            <li> I have tried philips shavers dry shavers in the past months but none work, they shaved awful and let my face burning red and irrated to a point that it hurt.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience, you could probably go with the less expensive 8020X.  </li>
            <li> but because of that it&#x27;s just impossible to put enough pressure against your skin, and</li>
            <li> My bf loves it but the only bad thing is that there is no catcher</li>
            <li> I think in the end I may have to resort back to the painful manual razor shave.  </li>
            <li> My husband has complained about shaving irritating his skin, so when I saw this shaver I ordered one for him.</li>
            <li> I like the design and feel of this shaver, but the motor is so weak that it takes forever to shave.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s weak.</li>
            <li> For those moments when I decide to shave OUT of the shower, the fact that there is no place for the stubble (cut hairs) to go besides down on you is a bit inconvenient.</li>
            <li> About a week ago I accidentally knocked this older razor off its base and, unfortunately, the razor ended up on the bathroom tile floor.  </li>
            <li> The Nivea lotion is very expensive and difficult to find locally.  </li>
            <li> Nothing tough about that in the least!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worse when I travel I now have to worry about packing this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not happy about that.  </li>
            <li> The charger is your standard wall unit that plugs into a plastic base.</li>
            <li> My experience had been poor shaves and in-grown whiskers.    </li>
            <li> the hinge and the lock of the openable head soon got broken.</li>
            <li> just a thin film.    </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T PRESS TOO HARD!!</li>
            <li> Additionally, it is questionable whether the cream dispenser in the unit will clog over time.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the pressure injector may fail.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately once the razor becomes fully charged, you can&#x27;t leave it in the cradle without unplugging it - doing so can damage battery life.  </li>
            <li> - Tedious maintenance    </li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for over 8 years now and tried an electric razor once before and hated it.  </li>
            <li> As I had such a horrible experience with the foil razor the time before when I used it I decided I defiantly did not want that type</li>

            <li> This was my first electric razor in 40 years. I always shave in the shower so wanted something that would work in an aquatic environment. My first few shaves were okay, not terrific, even using the moisturizer provided. I soon learned that I could get a really close shave [and a faster one] simply by using more pressure.  I have a low pain threshold and it did not hurt to do this.  You don&#x27;t need any moisturizer at all but if you insist, any gel like Gillette&#x27;s Edge works just fine.  It is a tad slower than shaving with a blade but I can virtually guarantee you won&#x27;t have a nick.  I don&#x27;t even get red skin.  You can wash the heads in the shower and store the razor there for a week of shaves, then recharge in a few hours.  Pretty slick product IMHO.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was the greatest razor ever.  It provides a smooth shave, probably the best shave I&#x27;ve ever encountered.  I have very sensitive skin, so I have to be selective.  First impressions: It is a very sleek and cool looking razor.  It is so fancy, that I am afraid of breaking it every time I touch it.  The problem with this razor is not its performance, rather it is the maintenance.  The lotion is expensive, and to make things worse, it is nearly impossible to find, unless you are willing to spend lots of money and buy it online.  But, the razor works, so I stuck it out.      Next problem: Norelco suggests that you replace the cartridge for sanitary reasons each time you refill the lotion.  OK, but when I ordered the lotion (which is supposed to come with the cartridge), THERE WAS NO CARTRIDGE!  So, I decided to stick it out anyway.  Each time I replaced the lotion, I would just remove the cartridge and clean it myself.  That seemed fine, until this morning when I accidentally broke a piece of this fragile cartridge.  Now, I can&#x27;t get the lotion to come out, so the razor is ineffective.  I tried to buy a new lotion with cartridge at Target, and the lotion came without the cartridge, so I have to return it.      I know Phillips-Norelco has excellent customer service, so I called to see if they could help me.  It turns out that the lotion does not always come with the cartridge (although it is advertised that way and I was told that it came with the cartridge by a customer service rep before I bought the razor).  So, it&#x27;s kind of like a little guessing game.  Where can I find the lotion and cartridge together?  Fun!  I asked if they could just send me some cartridges, no lotion, just cartridges and I&#x27;d be happy.  But they could not do that, so I am going to return this razor and get my money back.      I still have a previous Norelco shaver (dry) and I will try that again, although it is not as good.  I think in the end I may have to resort back to the painful manual razor shave.  I have been a Norelco customer for many years and up to this point I was always very pleased, this is disappointing.      To summarize: This is an excellent razor, but it is not worth the money or the hassle you have to go through to make it work effectively!      I welcome any shaving advice to help my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin especially around adams apple area and thought this moisturizing shaver would be a good for me.  Well, it does the job feeling and smelling clean while shaving.  But, does not shave close enough which is the most important element with the shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco before but this was my first Moisturizing Shaving System but to be honest I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with it. It shaved me but it seems I had to be doing too much work in ensuring that it is fill all the time with the conditioner. Worse when I travel I now have to worry about packing this moisturizer. The power just seem weak, it is just slower than my remington or the older norelco I have. I tried using it without the moisturrizer and it inflamed my skin, guess I won&#x27;t be trying that again.</li>
            <li> One truly outstanding feature of this shaver is an inbuilt moisturizer dispenser, which you can control while you shave.      While an electric shaver is much safer than a traditional razor, even an electric shaver can leave some burns on your skin and make it rough if you do not apply enough moisturizer.   This razor makes it so much more convinient to make this happen.    Electric shavers are a bit hard to like them if you are migrating from a traditional razor - usually because your skin will need some time to get used to it.  Give it some time - typically about 3-4 weeks for your skin to get used to it and then you will like it.    If you are buying this to replace another electric shaver - this is a very good choice for the price.   While one of the other Norelco models - Norelco 1090 costs upwards of $200, I can say that this model 8040x is a steal of the money - the moisturizer feature makes every penny worth.    + ves:   + I have to say inbuilt moisturizer dispenser is the best feature   + Well designed, light weight and easy to use   + Good battery life   + Very little noise     - ves:   - The moisturizer dispenser should have been made automatic, instead of manual control   - I do not think the cost of moisturizer refills should be that high, but it would be better if Philips Norelco suggests additional moisturizer that can be used in place of the Nivea. (nothing against Nivea, but trying to look for cheapter alternatives)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various models of Philips Norelco shavers for the past 8 years and have always been happy with them. Each time I buy a bit more expensive model hoping I&#x27;ll save even more time each morning...though I&#x27;ve never really saved much time!    Since this model was distinctly different from the others I had purchased before, I thought it would be a revolutionary new experience shaving in the shower and/or with moisturizing lotion. To be honest, the experience wasn&#x27;t really any different and took me the same amount of time. The lotion adds an additional consumable requirement, and shaving in the shower seems such a waste of water. Not to say, however, that they don&#x27;t contribute slightly to a great shave.    For those moments when I decide to shave OUT of the shower, the fact that there is no place for the stubble (cut hairs) to go besides down on you is a bit inconvenient. I understand why a model like this has such a requirement, but it&#x27;s inconvenient when you&#x27;re all dressed and you&#x27;ve got to watch for anything that might be on your shirt. I&#x27;m not shaving a beard everyday or anything but the good news is that most of the stubble seems to stick near the plastic head. As long as you rinse well after every use, you&#x27;re probably in great shape.    It&#x27;s a bit inconvenient, for travel usage, that you&#x27;ve got to carry around the charging dock/cradle and can&#x27;t plug the AC right into the shaver. On the other hand, the shaver has a lithium ion battery (not familiar with many models with this feature) that seems to last a long time and charge quickly when needed.    Nonetheless, I&#x27;ll still happily use this shaver. It does its job well, it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m not the target market for all the fancy wet/lotion features inside. Given that I rarely/never use the old fashioned razor and shaving cream, it&#x27;s probably not a surprise. I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;m not the market Norelco targets this model towards.</li>
            <li> Over the past few years I&#x27;ve used a Panasonic electric foil shaver.  The unit was reliable, never having needed any change in parts, and did a pretty good job of giving the best approximation to a razor blade shave. Therefore, I hold the Panasonic to my standard here.  I do not use regular razor blades as they tend to give me razor burn on my rather thicker facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon unboxing, I felt really frustrated right off the bat.  Apparently, the manufacturer decided it was a brilliant move to put the contents into a blister pack inside the package box.  This meant getting risk of injury just taking everything out.  For a unit that costs this much, this is a completely unacceptable practice. Charging the unit took a long time.  I&#x27;m used to quick recharges on my Panasonic, but this unit took so many hours. The charger uses regular cheap wire contacts for charging rather than induction like my Panasonic.  Kind of a shocker to see this on an expensive shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself utilizes three rotating wheels with a unique shaving gel dispenser that you press to ooze some out on the blades.  This seems like an ingenius idea but there are several downsides noticeable right off -- you need to use a special shaving cream bottle as the nossle needs to inject the cream directly into the shaving unit.  It might be hard just finding this type of special cream, and will likely be very overpriced relative to its volume.  Not happy about that.  The company clearly wants to reap profits on consumables.  Additionally, it is questionable whether the cream dispenser in the unit will clog over time.  This is particularly the case if you don&#x27;t use the shaver for a while, which allows the cream to solidify.  Additionally, the pressure injector may fail.  And finally, the amount of cream stored onboard is so small that I have to inject new cream daily.  Seems a little too gimicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shave itself, the results were lackluster -- Could not get the same close shave as my Panasonic, BUT the shaving cream mechanism did allow for a more pleasant shaving experience, but I think I would prefer just spreading some cream manually over my face instead.  The unit does not shave very quickly.  I have to spend quite a bit more time getting the shave that I need.  Additionally, my face is rather curved so getting the hairs at the top of my neck often failed so I have to touch up with a razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I could grow on using this shaver except for the high upkeep costs and very high outlay cost of the unit itself.  Really, the price needs to come down for this shaver to be competitive.  A closer shave would be nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I will continue to use this shaver for several more weeks and will post an update at that time. Stay tuned!ic, BUT the shaving cream mechanism did allow for a more pleasant shaving experience, but I think I would prefer just spreading some cream manually over my face instead.

            <li> The Philips Norelco 8040X electric shaver is a compact, lightweight unit that can be used dry or wet.  In either case, it uses Nivea for Men shaving conditioner to smooth the razor over your face as you shave.  Ultimately, it is capable of delivering a good shave, but it has too many drawbacks to recommend for everyday use.      SHAVING PERFORMANCE    Used dry, the 8040X is below average compared to other shavers that I&#x27;ve used (including my five-year-old Norelco which still shaves rings around this one).  Its shaving heads are very compact and pivot nicely so you can easily reach all contours of your face and hard-to-reach areas, e.g. under your nose.  However, the blades themselves don&#x27;t do provide a close shave at all.  I have a beard that&#x27;s only moderately thick/stiff, and the 8040X left me feeling like I would have a five-o&#x27;clock shadow in minutes.      Used wet in the shower, its performance is much better.  This is also when the Cool Skin moisturizer really shines - in fact, it&#x27;s downright necessary to get the heads to glide over your face when used wet.  It has a pleasant scent and does leave the skin on your face feeling refreshed afterward (even if it&#x27;s also apparent that the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; is just from some alcohol in the formula).  It certainly won&#x27;t be the quickest shave that you&#x27;ve ever had, but if you take your time, you can get results that rival even a blade.        USE &amp; MAINTENANCE    The 8040X comes with a cradle for storing it upright and also for charging it.  Unfortunately once the razor becomes fully charged, you can&#x27;t leave it in the cradle without unplugging it - doing so can damage battery life.  Plus, the plug for the cradle is gigantic and ugly, so you won&#x27;t want to leave the cradle on display anyway.  I would have preferred a simple direct-cord charge design instead.      The Nivea conditioner that is used with the shaver is expensive in the long run - about $6 for a can that will last about a month (don&#x27;t believe what the box says - it&#x27;s onlya month&#x27;s worth).  Suddenly that close, wet shave is looking pretty pricey in terms of time and money compared to simply going back to shaving with a blade.  Also, the pump system that feeds the conditioner into the razor is proprietary, i.e. you can&#x27;t just fill it with any skin conditioner because only the Nivea Cool Skin fits the razor&#x27;s plug.  So, you&#x27;re out of luck if you don&#x27;t like the scent or feel of the Nivea product.  Also, the razor would lose just about all usefulness if/when they stop making those cans.      There is no readout to display the remaining battery life.  Instead, the power light will begin to flash when the battery is getting low.  Given the cost of this razor, this seems like a cut corner.  I don&#x27;t like the idea of guessing how much juice I have left.      The razor needs to be cleaned after each shave.  Compared to most closed-head designs, this makes for even more time that the razor requires with each use.  You also need to regularly check that the tubes which deliver the moisturizer haven&#x27;t become clogged.      It does have a travel lock feature which will prevent the razor from accidentally turning on while you have it packed away.  Coupled with its compact size, I think that the \\&quot;weekend getaway (not for business)\\&quot; may be the ideal application of this razor.        CONCLUSION    The 8040X Moisturizing Shave System promises too much.  Ultimately, it works best when shaving wet, using a lot of the moisturizer, and taking a lot of time to do so.  This, coupled with its lightweight, compact design, good battery life and travel lock make it ideal for weekend getaways.  But given its cost - both immediate and in the long run - this just isn&#x27;t enough return on your investment.      PROS  * Close, comfortable shave when used wet  * Compact and lightweight  * Travel lock prevents accidents while razor is packed  * Good battery life    CONS  * Unimpressive shave results when used dry  * Expensive cost-to-operate due to (very necessary) moisturizer  * Demanding upkeep/maintenance requirements  * Lack of battery gauge</li>
            <li> For years I had been looking for an electric razor that would come close to being as good as a blade for shaving with no luck. About a year ago, my wife got me the Norelco Arcitec razor. This high end (and expensive) razor finally got me to switch. Now along comes the Cool Skin 8040X (at half the price).     The fact that it is a wet system intrigued me. It uses Nivea shaving conditioner, which is injected into the back of the razor.  A nice no mess system ... a spout on the conditioner bottle fits in the razor and injects the conditioner.  When shaving, you press a button and a few drops of gel comes up through the heads.  You wet your skin, press the button, and shave.  I found that I press the button about 8 times during shaving. This means I end up refilling the razor about once or twice a week (no big deal... take less than a minute). The razor also has a nice rubber grip that makes it easy to hold when its wet.    The razor comes with the charger, a cloth pouch, a sideburn trimmer attachment, head cover, and a trial size can of conditioner.      The charger is your standard wall unit that plugs into a plastic base. The razor sits in the base. Takes about 4 hours to completely charge. A green light in the handle  flashes while charging and stays lit when fully charged. You should not leave it plugged in all of the time.  When the razor needs to be charged, a red light comes on. While this is not as nice as the Arcitec&#x27;s LED that shows the remaining time left on the battery, this razor is smaller (and a lot less expensive) and there probably isn&#x27;t room for the display.    The pouch is a soft cloth and really doesn&#x27;t offer much protection. I don&#x27;t use it.    The sideburn trimmer is not built in to the razor.  Instead, you pop off the blade assembly and snap this in it&#x27;s place. I thought this would be a pain but its not. But even if it was, it would be worth it. It&#x27;s so much better than the one built into the Arcitec.  It&#x27;s bigger and cuts better. By being bigger,the blades are further away from the body of the razor and easy to manipulate.    The head cover is a plastic cover to protect the blades; useful for traveling.    The conditioner goes along way (still some left after 2 weeks of use and this is a tiny can).      The most important thing is the shave. As I said before, the Arcitec made me switch from blades.  This made me give up my beloved Arcitec. It really does shave as close as the Trac blades and shaving gel system I love to use.</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and have been shaving with Norelco electric shavers since I was 16 -- making me a 50 year user of Norelco shavers.  When my 9 or 10 year old Norelco Advantage stopped holding a battery charge last month, I bought a Norelco 8040x, the next generation of wet-drive shavers...and threw my old Norelco Advantage in the waste basket.  After a couple of days shaving with my new 8040x, I realized (and my wife agreed) that it did not shave nearly as close as my old Norelco Advantage did.    The day before my scheduled garbage pick-up I rummaged through the garbage in my trash can and found my old Norelco Advantage.  After being in the trash can for nearly a week, I discovered that it would once again hold a battery charge.  (It must have learned its lesson being in the garbage for nearly a week!) For three days I shaved one side with my old Norelco Advantage and the other side with my new Norelco 8040x.  There was no comparison.  My old Advantage gave me a much closer shave than the new Norelco 8040x.  I telephoned the Norelco 800 number to get an authorization for returning it under their 30 days satisfaction guarantee, and they are going to send me a return authorization and will refund me my purchase price.  At age 66, I figure I have maybe 20 more years of shaving ahead of me, but if the shaving closeness of new Norelco&#x27;s is as bad as the 8040x, maybe I ought to buy a couple of the old Norelco Advantage shavers from e-bay or someplace and store them up to use for the rest of my life.  Paul D.D.</li>
            <li> I got to use one of these recently. To summarize:  Pros  - really smooth shave when used wet (I mean, I didn&#x27;t feel a thing)  - can be used with Nivea lotion (supplied), lather, foam or just wet your face  - easy to use (even refilling it with the lotion is not as hard as it seems)  - comes with detachable sideburn trimmer, which can be stored in the charging stand.  Now, Cons  - horrible dry shave - don&#x27;t ever try it in the morning - it feels like it&#x27;s pulling hair, not cutting it, missing half of it anyhow  - 4 hr charge? (really? - almost anything above $100 charges in less than an hour)  - BAD trade-off: you can take it in the shower, it&#x27;s fully water-proof, but the blades are rudimentary - it&#x27;s only three blades (as opposed to high end Norelco 9-bladed ones w/3 blades on each head) and it has slots only (no holes like in 8000 Norelco). Hence, the crappy shave.  - I already mentioned smooth, but LONG shave.  - Tedious maintenance    P.S. If you don&#x27;t have a problem spending a little extra time shaving and shaving wet only - get it, it&#x27;s one of the most plesant experiences. Nivea lotion rocks. I gave it four stars because despite all the downfalls, it FELT GOOD!</li>
            <li> First off I must say this is my first electric razor that I have owned.  I have been wet shaving for over 8 years now and tried an electric razor once before and hated it.  I first started looking at an electric razor as wet shaving seemed a drag, a waste of time and just a pain.  I have to be clean shaven for my job so I have to shave.  First I had to decide on a foil razor or rotary razor.  As I had such a horrible experience with the foil razor the time before when I used it I decided I defiantly did not want that type so I opted to try the Rotary razor and have been very well pleased.  Some things that drew me to purchase this razor were&lt;br /&gt; 1.  You can use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;  This to me seemed very convenient as I could shave as I&#x27;m getting showering which in my eyes saved some time from having to do the traditional way.&lt;br /&gt;2. Applies Moisturizer while shaving&lt;br /&gt;  This was another seller point for me as my face dries out very easily and I hated after wet shaving take more time to apply aftershave so to have a system that applies it while I&#x27;m shaving seemed like a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The size of this unit is great it fits in my hand just right and is easy to grab.  The only complaint I have of the body itself is the charging prongs on the bottom back side of the razor stick out and can poke your hand while using the razor.  Another downfall with this razor is that it does not have a tray to collect the hair as it cuts it so at least in my experience I have to wash my face afterwards as to get the little hairs off of my face that it has just cut.&lt;br /&gt;  One thing about this razor and I noticed other people complain about is that it does not do well as a dry razor.  In the instruction manual it actually says to wet your face before using it ultimately meaning it is not a dry shaver, but it does not take long to splash water on your face.&lt;br /&gt;  So if your looking for a good razor that will apply moisturizer as you shave, that you can use in the shower and ultimately if you want a razor that does an excellent job (in my experience just as good as a wet shave) this is the razor for you!!ower and ultimately if you want a razor that does an excellent job (in my experience just as good as a wet shave) this is the razor for you!!</li>
            <li> This razor has been a delight to use.  It shaves close without chaffing my face, even the first time, unlike some of the other brands.  Cleaning is a snap.  I would recommend this appliance over some of the more costly ones.</li>
            <li> Philips-Norelco has proved that a new version of something does not have to be better...    First of all the good points:  - Sleek looking shaver - Also the blue looks good  - Interesting filling system for the Nivea lotion  - Feels good with the Nivea lotion...it really lubricates    But, hold your breath....  Clearly it looks like they made this razor either for just an afternoon touch-up shave or they made it for women.  With this one I spend twice the amount of time I used spend shaving with my Philips-Norelco SpeedXL shaver. And, you really have to press the head hard against your skin.  Secondly, don&#x27;t even try to use it as a dry shaver. If you do, guess what, the shaver heads are open from the back. So, whatever comes off your face falls through the opening in the back on your hand or shirt.  Again, comparing to the SpeedXL, that one had a chamber where all the hair stubs get collected. You then open and dump it out after every shave.  Thirdly, I bought a 3oz bottle of Nivea (it is a special bottle)...it says three months supply. Don&#x27;t believe them...it will last only a month or may be month and half.    In retrospect, I think the SpeedXL was a much better shaver. Now it is a dry shaver and can be rinsed out. However, I have used it as a wet shaver with foam.  The best combination would be a SpeedXL used with Edge shaving lotion.  I used Edge with this one as well and it works very well and is smoother than the Nivea.    I am still using this shaver because my SpeedXL cutter heads got blunt.</li>
            <li> Very satisified with first few uses of this shaver.  Gives shave that is very close to a razor even without the Nivea lotion.  Also does well after not shaving for several days.  Found that I can get a good shave without the Nivea lotion by just wetting my face with water or a soapy solution.      Philips Norelco advises to give the shaver thirty days for one&#x27;s face to get used to it.  Do find some minor irritation which goes away quickly, no worse than shaving with a blade.  Philips claims this will go away after a month and if not, they will refund the purchase within fourty five days.  This says alot about their customer satisfaction.    Only problem I have with shaver is that I accidentally hit the button to dispense the Nivea lotion when shaving when I do not want it.  Solution to this is not to refill the lotion resovoir after depleting first fill.</li>
            <li> I have owned and used an early model of this razor, known as the Norelco Advantage for perhaps eight or so years.  This has been, and still remains, a great razor if used properly.  During my ownership of the Norelco Advantage razor I have had only one maintenance action, and that was the replacement of the battery about three years ago at a cost of about $43.    About a week ago I accidentally knocked this older razor off its base and, unfortunately, the razor ended up on the bathroom tile floor.  It still works as well as ever, however, but the razor is now quite hard to close to its proper operating position so I opted to buy the new model 8040X since, after all, the older model had really worked for me over a long period of time, and maybe the newer model would have some worthwhile advantages.    What I have observed, however, is that the new model has no advantages, but one significant disadvantage.  The new model must be left on charge no more that four hours to prevent battery damage, whereas I could leave the old model on charge all day, which provided me with about two weeks of shaving before the next required charge. The old model could also run about a week with only a one hour charge.  I have also noted that Norelco now supplies a flimsy plastic construction of the razor, whereas the older razor was much more rugged, a not surprising evolution of articles of this kind.    One other point which pertains to both the old and the new model -- there is no need to use the Nivea shaving lotion supplied by Norelco.  On the contrary, the need to push an additional button during shaving is actually distracting, at least for me.  My shaving procedure is, after taking a shower, to first wash my face thoroughly with liquid soap and hot water, leaving the soap lather on my face.  I then apply a moderate amount of skin lotion (I use Dermalube, but most skin lotions will do) over my face evenly, and then proceed to shave without using any Nivea lotion.  I find this procedure to be both superior and much less expensive than using the Nivea lotion.    In summary, the new model 8040X provides the same comfortable wet shave experience as the older model, but don&#x27;t look for any improvements.</li>
            <li> My norelco moisturizing shaving system is as follows by LV, Torrance California.     very brefly, I am a 79 year old man and, after many electric razors mostly norelco, I have owned, this is he best one yet.    Smooth shave, no more razor burn.     I am 100% satisfied with this razor---only one problem, the moisturizing cream is very expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have never been an electric razor kind of guy.  Ever since I first started shaving I have always used a manual razor.  I currently use the Mach3 Turbo from Gillette.  Best razor ever in my opinion, even better than the massive 5-blade razor they have out now.  Anyway, back to the Norelco.  I say all that to give you reference that I&#x27;m not a pro when it comes to rating electric razors.  They have always torn my skin up, left it burning on fire red, and full of bumps and never able to get close.  I have joined the Army fairly recently and find myself deployed now.  I realized the need for a good electric fairly soon due to the length of time it takes to get a good manual shave.  Also, going on leave, you can&#x27;t take things like razors, shaving cream in large bottles, aftershave lotion in large bottles, and the like.  So I did some research and landed on this razor as a happy medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me say that the most impressive feature to me is that it does NOT leave my face burning after using.  It also shaves pretty darn close!  I am very impressed!  The wet shaving is the key to the secret.  I just cringe when I see others shaving with an electric dry now.  The gel/lotion that this puts out is wonderful and the blades just glide over the skin.  My complaint about the lotion is that it&#x27;s proprietary.  You can&#x27;t go and pick up a different brand, or something unscented (as the alcohol in scented products burns my skin too, and this does to a mild degree).  My other fear about the lotion, is what happens when Nivea stops making this stuff?  Some people say they&#x27;ve experienced success making their own concoction of lotion, but I haven&#x27;t tried.  My other complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last anywhere near how long Norelco/Nivea says it is supposed to last.  Of course I could be putting it on heavy, but I don&#x27;t feel that I am.  I am just putting it on as needed.  When I come to a spot that&#x27;s dry on my face, I push the button briefly and let go.  I&#x27;m really not over doing it here, and it is going quick!  I suggest (as I did) buying a few extra bottles here on Amazon with the purchase of this razor, at least one!  Other than those complaints, the razor shaves smoothly and closely, and I am VERY impressed with its performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind that there&#x27;s no digital read out on it, I saved money by not buying the next step on purpose.  There&#x27;s a little green flashing light that tells you when it needs charged, is charging, and done charging.  I can figure that out without paying extra money thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind that there&#x27;s no receptacle for the hair to get caught.  I am more inclined to not clean those razors out that have those because of that fact.  Here, it forces you to clean it.  And that is a breeze anyway.  Run hot water, hold the head under running water, tap on sink gently, dry off, and you&#x27;re done.  Nothing tough about that in the least!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little sideburn trimmer is unique, but I don&#x27;t really use it.  It isn&#x27;t pop out like on some other models.  You have to remove the shaving heads from the main shaft and attach the trimmer.  Not really a pain per se, just different.  But this is the only way the razor could accommodate a trimmer due to the main shaft function that powers the three heads.  If you use this feature a lot on your current razor, I&#x27;d suggest just buying a sideburn trimmer separate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it would have come with a hard case, or leather or something other than the soft cloth-like \\&quot;bag\\&quot; this comes with.  It does have a feature on it for travel so the thing doesn&#x27;t turn on in your bag, but I fear it may get damaged without a proper case.  Oh well, just got to be careful I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the most important feature of a razor is how it performs.  Again, I am NOT typically a fan of electric razors, and this razor happily surprised me with its performance.  Yes, the wet shave function of this makes the time a little more intense, but I feel the trade off is worth it when it doesn&#x27;t eat up my skin.  I highly recommend this razor.  Well worth the money.y skin.  I highly recommend this razor.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product , I am a Norelco fan have every shaver available , the 8040X is very light and does the job very well in the shower</li>
            <li> I have had this one for a week now.  Works great if you shave twice a day.  Once a day is definitely not sufficient for me.    The moisturizing part makes it a great and smooth shave, but you have roughly 4-5 weeks worth of cream in a bottle. This leads to $3 a week in consumable.  I did not have to recharge it in a week of use.  It is fantastic to be able to shave in the shower.    This model has a travel lock, which is the only reason to purchase this one instead of the 8020X.</li>
            <li> My review is actually pretty succinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is well designed, it&#x27;s very sleek and cool to use, the battery life is good, and the travel bag is awesome.  In fact, I can think of nothing I don&#x27;t like about it, except that it is an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a norelco (I think) commercial with the motto: Shaves as close as a blade.  No it doesn&#x27;t.  In fact, after using it religiously for 2 weeks, I had more ingrown hairs and odd stubble than ever before.  It just doesn&#x27;t work for my face, so I have to say, Great device, wouldn&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like electric razors, it&#x27;s a great choice.  I just don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> (Edit: 07-24-09)&lt;br /&gt;My second day of shaving was about the same.  I experimented a little in that I applied a shaving gel to my face first then started shaving.  As the shaving gel came off, I applied the Nivea lotion.  I got a lot closer shave, but still a few burns on the neck area.  Can&#x27;t explain it.  I&#x27;ll have to wait until I&#x27;ve used the razor for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just picked up my new Norelco 8040X shaver yesterday from Target.  After spending numerous hours researching electric razors, I settled on this particular model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research showed price ranges from $89.99 to $129.99.  Target had it (on the shelf) for $74.99.  I applied a $10.00 coupon obtained from the Norelco web site so the total cost for my new razor was $64.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaved with it for the first time today and I was quite impressed.  Being new to the world of electric shaving, I did get a few burns on my neck area.  I either was pressing too hard or didn&#x27;t apply enough of the Nivea shaving conditioner to the razor; or a combination of the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing as how this was my first shave, I&#x27;ll reserve any additional comments until I&#x27;ve used the razor for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE ITEM FOR A REASONABLE PRICE, A BIT CHEAP LOOK AND MISSING A STRAP FOR HANGING.  OVERALL ITS A GOOD PRODUCT THAT I USED IT ON A DAILY BASIS.  I WILL RANK IT 8 OUT OF 10.</li>
            <li> Having used the \\&quot;old fashioned shaving creme and razor\\&quot; for years, I thought it would be good to try one of the newer electric shaving systems.  And to be honest, I tried this electric shaver for close to a month.  And for two weeks while using it I was away at a para-military  camp where while we were in uniform during the day we were not allowed \\&quot;any sight of facial hair\\&quot; so you needed a close shave or you&#x27;d be pushing (push-ups).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the last I used an electric shaver was a few years ago, and it left me with my skin a bit red and I had to pull my skin a bit while shaving to get it close.  So then I went back to the razor which has been giving me a close shave that lasts the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving system did not make my skin red (I do believe the moisturizing system works), and gave a good shave, but by the afternoon (initial shave around 5 AM) I had to use the shaver again.  However in a normal working setting this may not be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much more convenient to use this. The battery lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m believing more and more that there is no substitute for the good ole faithful water/shaving creme/razor.  But if you do not need or want a real close shave or if you&#x27;re a teenager first shaving, then I do believe the Philips Norelco 8040x is for you.</li>
            <li> Hi,  I own 8040 for 2.5 months now.    I am not old  so my only shaver was Norelco... I owned it for 10 years. Recently it fell and one of the small plates of one of the heads broke. You can still use it but I cut myself once. My old Norelco performed perfectly (yes I did replace the rechargeable batteries after 7 years of use). It gave me very smooth shave and each shave took about 3 min. Every 40min charge gave me about 4-5 weeks of shaving.     Now to this shaver (I gave the info above just to compare a 10 year old shaver to the 8040). The only thing that is good in it is the LOOK. It looks great and makes a nice ornament for my bathroom. The fact that 4 hours charge give me about 2 weeks of shaving was expected because it was clearly stated in the specs that the battery sucks. Therefore I did not reduce the rating for that. Now, what was also stated is that every 2.5 OZ. bottle will last for 3 month. That means that average shave should take 3 min (and we&#x27;ll get to that later). So 90*3 is 270 min - 4.5 hours. That&#x27;s total BULL. Each shave takes me about 10 min, it&#x27;s not close and at best it takes half capacity of the shaver&#x27;s conditioner tank. So on average every 2.5 weeks I have to buy a new bottle and that&#x27;s with the fact that I shave every other day. That means A LOT OF MONEY!  Now back to the most important function. The shave. As I said I own the shaver for 2.5 months now. So all \\&quot;break in\\&quot; (what the hack is that? Are these shoes we are talking about?) periods are over. I still have to go over one area 10 times to get fear shave. And still here and there I find hair. This goes both in the shower shave and out of the shower shave. About the time that you supposed to save shaving in the shower well I don&#x27;t know. You just stand 10 more minutes under water. If it saves time  than ok.    Summary:  Bad battery life - stated in the advertisement so no complains.  Bad conditioner usage  BAD SHAVE!    Save your money on this toy and buy something like Norelco 9160XL</li>
            <li> I got this razor for my son, who has been using an electric razor on his face without any shaving cream.  He reports that he appreciates the convenience of being able to put the shaving cream directly into the shaver and of being able to use it in the shower.  What he doesn&#x27;t like is that if his beard gets a little too long, he feels that the hair is being pulled from his face rather than being shaved off.</li>
            <li> I first used an electric razor in my late teens.  It wasn&#x27;t a very high quality one, but it did the trick and seemed less hassled than a blade.  Over time, about a year, it dulled out to being less and less effective and I switched back to a blade.  Over the years I thought of switching back but honestly my Mach 3 has been good to me, so I never thought it worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it was more of a whim that I picked up the 8040x, to see the difference and see if maybe the ease of the electric would finally get me away from a standard razor for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was quite disappointed.  It was a longer process and resulted in a splotchy shave.  I used it in the shower, which was nice, but the time it took made me begin to worry about all that water wastage.  I kept at it for a few days then sat down to read the manual to see if I was missing something.  Interestingly, it noted there was a transition time.  They suggest trying it for 3 weeks to let the skin adjust.  I was encouraged to keep at it.  And so they were right.  After a couple of weeks the shaves were noticeably better and quicker.  Though, I&#x27;m not sure they are much quicker still than a blade nor certainly closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge holds quite nice, and longer than I expected, even right out of the box.  The moisturizing system is quite easy and flexible, able to use as much or as little as you need with just an easy push of the handy button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m quite pleased now.  If I wasn&#x27;t they have a return policy after the 21 day intro period that makes this fairly risk free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price this seems a very high quality electric razor.  It does seem to work best as a daily shaver, rather than one to use with a couple day or more stubble on the face.  It also isn&#x27;t quite as fast as I might like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works great and I&#x27;m happy.  Definitely great for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a note, the difference between this, the 8040x, and the 8020x and the 8060x are charging times. This takes 4 hours to charge fully, the 8020x takes 8 hours, and the 8060x takes 1.5 hours.  The 4 hour charge time is just fine for me and I wouldn&#x27;t want to spend the extra for the fast charge I can&#x27;t imagine ever needing.ully, the 8020x takes 8 hours, and the 8060x takes 1.5 hours.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shaving systems for a number of years now.  I love shaving in the shower - saves time, mess and gives me a closer shave.  It had been a few years since I bought a new unit when this item came up for sale.  I decided to go with it as the new floating heads intrigued me.  This is the best version of this shaver yet.  It gives an amazing close shave.  I love the new way they&#x27;ve integrated the saving balm into the heads. Be sure to give it a few days before making final judgements as even though I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for 20 years now, my skin and facial hair had to get used to this one.</li>
            <li> Ok.  I have been using the Norelco 8040X for about 6 weeks now and am very, pleasantly surprised.    Background.  I have been shaving nearly 30 years now and have tried electric shavers in no less than 3 different stints in my life (never Norelco before).  Each time with disappointing success.  But I decided to try again mainly after researching the product, noticing the \\&quot;send it back after trail\\&quot; guarantee.  I was skeptical.  My experience had been poor shaves and in-grown whiskers.    I have a relatively thick beard growth (not extreme but not light) combined with average to sensitive skin.  Shaving with a blade gave the best results however... shaving every day left my neck irritated and bleeding.  My solution was to shave every 2 or 3 days.  I thought that was going to be my shaving lot-in-life.    Again, I was drawn to the electric market.  My last attempt was 5-10 years ago.  I was very interested in shaving in the shower, the Norelco 8040x&#x27;s ability to dispense lotion, and it&#x27;s trial period guarantee.    The Good:  &gt;&gt; I was able to get good shaving results beginning with my first use.  The manual stated to give it some time and stick with it.  However, I did not have this issue.  &gt;&gt; The Nivea lotion filling and dispensing was easy and really helped provide a smooth shave and a wonderful after-shave feeling.  &gt;&gt; The shaver is easy to clean and charge.  Shaving every day, it holds enough charge for about a week&#x27;s use.  &gt;&gt; I am able to shave every day with out irritation.  Not nicks, no bleeding.    The Not So Good:  &gt;&gt;  The Nivea lotion is very expensive and difficult to find locally.  Checking the Philips website it was out of stock there when I checked.  This may be a blessing in disguise.  I find that I can use a standard hand lotion/body cream, apply it by hand, and shave just as affectively. (Did I just void my warranty?  Who knows.)  However, this isn&#x27;t quite as slick as using the auto dispenser which was one of the selling points.  Note to Norelco.  Geta clue.  If you are going to partner with someone, make sure they are going to make enough product and don&#x27;t price the complementary item crazily.  &gt;&gt; The overall shave is just a smidge less smooth than a quality shave from a razor.      Conclusions:  &gt;&gt;  The shave is slightly less smooth than a good razor shave.  &gt;&gt;  The fact that I have no irritation or bleeding is a very acceptable trade-off for the slightly less smooth shave in my case.  &gt;&gt;  The Nivea shave conditioner is a nice product, but is over-priced and difficult to find in stock locally (DFW metro area).  &gt;&gt;  Shaver is easy to use, charge, clean.  &gt;&gt;  I find that using shaving cream does not work as well as skin lotion.  &gt;&gt;  I gave 5 stars because I am now able to shave every day with comfort and effectiveness.  &gt;&gt;  Based on my experience, you could probably go with the less expensive 8020X.  However, it might not hold its charge as long or charge as quickly.  I don&#x27;t see any need to purchase the more expensive 8060X.  However, your individial experience may require otherwise.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting gadget. It adds a lubricating pump to an electric razor.  I haven&#x27;t used too many electric razors but this one seemed pretty smooth although it didn&#x27;t provide as a good a shave as a regular razor. No irritation and not much mess either. The razor element seems a bit flimsy, even with the protective cover. As long as its not banged around too much it would make for a decent travel razor.</li>
            <li> I am ecstatic over my new Cool Skin 8040x! This small wonder delivers everything it advertises and then some. I have used other electric razors without finding any that I liked so I have been unhappily dragging a cheap twin blade across my face for years now. The fact that wife may have used the same razor on who knows what before I got to it also taints the whole experience since the blades would be too dull for words. I did some searching for an electric solution and happened across the Philips Norelco line of products and I took a chance on this one after reading reviews on this site. I felt I had to write a report as well. Great razor...buy one! Ciao</li>
            <li> I used blades for 5 years, but I needed the convenience of an electric.  The 8040 does a solid job and has adequate power for a beard that grows in pretty fully on a daily basis.  I can&#x27;t skip more than a day of shaving with it, though, or the long hairs just won&#x27;t get cut.  It&#x27;s comfortable enough to use every day, though, especially when used in the shower.  Great features for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers since I began shaving.  I briefly tried both another brand and bladed shaving, and didn&#x27;t like either.  I tried this out as a replacement to my 8140XL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most electric shavers on the market, you get convenience, simple charging, savings on consumable blades and cream, and a nice little gadget for your bathroom with this shaver.  A blade always wins on optimum closeness, but takes longer and is more \\&quot;dangerous\\&quot; to those of us with a not so fine touch.  Those aside, there were a few things that I liked, and a few things that bugged me about this specific shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Wow, this shaver is really light and easy to handle when shaving, especially tougher areas that require holding the shaver upright at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;The fact that you couldn&#x27;t get in contact with water or even in a shower used to be a huge disadvantage to electric razors.  This unit is fully waterproof, which also makes it easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Uses Li-ion batteries instead of NiCad&lt;br /&gt;One of the things that irked me about the last razor I bought was that it still contained a ridiculously obsolete NiCad battery.  NiCad cells suffer from the \\&quot;memory effect\\&quot;, which means they can hold a smaller and smaller amount of charge over time.  This shaver has Li-Ion, the best kind of battery available, with no memory effect.  This means it will continue to hold the same charge for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cool Charger base&lt;br /&gt;This is a lot cooler looking, and takes up less space on the countertop than just plugging into the wall and laying the shaver sideways to charge.  It also keeps track of the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Flex Tracker System&lt;br /&gt;The head conforms to whatever surface I&#x27;m shaving pretty well, and just looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: (these won&#x27;t apply to everyone, and are my opinion only)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Built in lotion dispenser&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never wanted this feature.  It&#x27;s simply another way for them to continue to charge for refills of the product, when part of the reason for having an electric razor is so you don&#x27;t have to keep paying for blades!  I also have extremely sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t enjoy contact with any kind of chemical, especial alcohol.  The stuff doesn&#x27;t smell too great either.  You don&#x27;t need this goop to use the shaver, so I would skip it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Not as speedy as older models&lt;br /&gt;This is something I also noticed with my past model, but it seems like Norelco shavers have for whatever reason gotten *less* effective and take longer to shave.  It&#x27;s not a huge issue for me because I have a light beard, but I thought these things were supposed to get faster with time, not slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-40 minutes of charge time&lt;br /&gt;This is not amazing compared to other models, I wish they had skipped the lotion chamber and put three times as many batteries inside instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d recommend this shaver, it has some great features you&#x27;ll probably enjoy.  You might want to be aware of the cons I&#x27;ve noted, and keep in mind you can follow up on Norelco&#x27;s guarantee if you&#x27;re not happy with your individual shave.n electric razor is so you don&#x27;t have to keep paying for blades!

            <li> Wow it really works in the shower! I got a clean close shave that was way better than I expected. You can even use your own shaving cream in addition to or instead of the shaving gel in the razor! All this and it just washes off with water. I usually skip shaving Saturday and Sunday mornings. Come Monday this razor handled the extra growth just fine. It definitely gave a closer shave than a dry electric razor and it is faster than a standard blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Items to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The razor is easy to fill up with shaving gel. I found a refill at a local big box store and it was inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;- When shaving just hold it under the water from time to time to wash away the clippings. There isn&#x27;t a reservoir to empty.&lt;br /&gt;- I actually have fun using it and would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> This is a review by proxy; I got this razor for my partner Trent. He uses electric. Despite the fact that I shave a bit more surface area than he (I also shave my head,) I do it the old fashined way.    Here&#x27;s what he had to say about this product: I was afraid to use the lubricating gel, many things with fragrance of any kind cause a reaction especially on my face. So I used it as a regular electric razor.     It&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged in like my old one. It&#x27;s also nice that this can be used in the shower (wouldn&#x27;t try that with the old one --ZZZZT!) It works as well as any electric razor I&#x27;ve used...however, there is nothing to catch the whiskers once they&#x27;ve been cut, so they just fall on the counter and make a mess if I&#x27;m at the sink. I am going to keep using this rather than return to the old one which I&#x27;ve had for years; I&#x27;ll just have to be careful to get the hairs in the sink--or use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Works great, continues the less painful shaving tradition of the cool skin line.  The new battery makes for a much more compact and lighter body which is good when traveling.  Losing the battery charge level indicator is less helpful.</li>
            <li> When used as a wet shaver and with the moisturizing cream, it does a fantastic job. Happily surrendered my razor blades...</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric razor before and found the Norelco very easy touse and I got a very close shave because of the  moisture system and would recommend this to anyone.  I also use this to shave my head now for the bald look.</li>
            <li> This is the third of Norelco&#x27;s waterproof series that I have owned.  The overall quality is just as good as previous models and other Philips/Norelco products.   The shaver is constructed well and is lighter and more compact than previous models. Charging and battery life also seem to be very good.    The main problem I find with this new design is that the heads/razors are floating and not encased as previous models and most other shavers. When using this shaver in the shower this is not a problem. However, when you use this shaver outside of the shower, the lack of casing around the hears means that as you shave, all of the hair pieces fall from the shaver to the counter or wherever else you may be (I would not recommend using this shaver in the car unless you don&#x27;t mind getting yourself and your car covered with hair pieces). To me this is a major oversight and design flaw.  In short, if you only plan to use this razor in the shower this is a great choice, but if you need to use the razor outside of the shower as well, you may want to choose something else.</li>
            <li> I recently \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; from the 8020X to the 8040X. Since the razor and shave are the same, I chose the 8040X for the following reasons:  - Shorter Charge Time: the 8040X fully charges in 4 hours versus 8 hours for the 8020X, and the 8040X indicates when fully charged.  - Longer Shaving Time: the 8040X fully charged shaves for 40 minutes, the 8020X for 30 minutes.  - Quick Charge: when the battery is depleted, the 8040X can be charged for 9 minutes to give you 3 minutes of shaving time.  - Travel Lock: the 8040X has it, the 8020X doesn&#x27;t.  - Pop on Trimmer: the 8040X has it, the 8020X doesn&#x27;t.  I figured with all these additional features, the 8040X was worth the additional money. But I was even more fortunate. I had a 20% savings certificate from the local Bed, Bath and Beyond, and bought the 8040X at the same price I would have paid for the 8020X elsewhere, so I found a great deal.  Both of these shavers give an excellent shave. For me, just as close as a blade without irritation (Yes, it is just as close for me. I can&#x27;t speak for other beard/skin types, but if you don&#x27;t have a brillo pad for a beard, it does a GREAT job). And unlike any blade I&#x27;ve used over nearly 30 years of shaving, these razors do not irritate my skin at all! I&#x27;ve used it everyday and even on 2-day growth, and it works fantastic.  Suggestion for you all: instead of using the conditioner, which is expensive and has to be dispensed often when shaving, try using Nivea for Men shaving gel that you can buy in your local grocery store. I use this exclusively and it works great, and will be much, much cheaper over the long haul. Also, I always shave in the shower, as I&#x27;ve found I get the smoothest, most comfortable shave that way. However, I have shaved over the sink on two occasions, and that works well too if that&#x27;s your choice.  In closing, let me say that shaving with this Norelco is the first time ever I&#x27;ve enjoyed shaving with any razor, and I&#x27;ve used Braun and Panasonic too over the years. Enjoy your shaving now with this one!</li>
            <li> I bought this item on Amazon&#x27;s Daily Deals page because I have been shoping for an electric shaver for a couple months now.  I have heard that the Norelco brand is pretty good so I decided to buy this great deal.  After using this shaver four, or five, times I have decided that electric razors are not compatible with my facial hair texture.  My hair is too thick to get a close shave no matter how often I shave.  This razor has led me back to using standard four/five-blade shavers.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with rough, or thick, facial hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the razor as a replacement for my old Norelco Advantage and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Slick, smooth, it is not irritating my neck as the old Advantage used to.</li>
            <li> For more than a few years I had been using the [[ASIN:B00008DQJQ Factory Reconditioned Braun 7526 Syncro Smart Logic Shaver]] I purchased on Amazon. Prior to the Syncro, I had used a [[ASIN:B000GCQF4M Gillette Sensor Excel Razor For Men - 1 ea]]. Clearly, the Syncro could not give me the close shave of the Sensor Excel. Still, I liked the convenience and the ease of the Syncro and the fact that it held up to rough use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to try the Philips Norelco 8040X and have been blown away. My first usage was dry and without the application of the moisturizer. At first, I was slightly disappointed at the whisker tugs and slight razor burn and the ergonomics but decided to give it another chance since my first usage did not use the moistureizer and the unit had not been completely charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second usage was dry and with the use of the moistureizer and the unit was fully charged. The whisker tugs and slight razor burn were gone. After my first use, I was used to the ergonomics (it is a completely different design from the Syncro), facial coverage was exceptional. I also found that one push of the moistureizer button was sufficient for one half of my face. After the use, my face was smooth and soft and, unlike my efforts with the Syncro, very few missed hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My third usage was wet (int he shower) and with the use of the moistureizer. Again, the results were fantastic. With the excellent coverage of the razor head, my shaving time has decreased significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only two complaints (if they can be called complaints since they are so minor) are (1) the scent of the moistureizer and (2) the charger. Another reviewers have aptly stated the deficiencies with ths scent so I will say no more. As for the charger, you have to place the razor in with some care so that it makes contact with the recharging points. Also, the light signifiying that the unit is re-charging is muted (which is both good and bad) so be alert. Other than those two trivialities, I am extremely happy with the Philips Norelco 8040X shaver.am extremely happy with the Philips Norelco 8040X shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Norelco user for decades, but after having two cool skin models fail on me recently (the first after 3 years, the second after only one), I decided to try another brand. Boy am I glad I did! The Panasonic ES 8243 shaves way closer than the Norelco in a fraction of the time.</li>
            <li> I bought a Norelco 550 TL about 17 years ago and I still have it. I like the way the Floating Heads give a close shave, and the way the pop-up sideburn trimmer works crisply and efficiently. It cleans easily and is compact. I think I spent a $25 on my 550 TL brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I had the chance to try the Norelco Cool Skin 8040X, I looked forward to putting this Norelco newbie through its paces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THe VERY first thing I DID NOT like (ZERO stars for this!!) was the plastic \\&quot;Clamshell Packaging\\&quot; -- which is a waste of plastic and time. IF Norelco had decided to incorporate a Travel Case into this Clamshell packaging with re-usable features, then I would have been content. But as it was, this was just a waste of plastic. Clamshell packages have sent numerous folks to the hospital with some nasty cuts inflicted while trying to open this sealed, thick plastic, stubborn packaging. Then again, it is a waste of plastics made even more wasteful when you consider the price of petroleum nowadays, and the inability to recycle this type of plastic. I suppose someone who wants to, can, with a little ingenuity and transparent mailing tape, take this Clamshell Package and create a travel container for their 8040x-- which might be a good idea, because the fabric travel pouch that Norelco supplies with this shaver only holds the shaver, and not the accessories -- unless you want to cram everything into the travel case and NOT close it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well.... now -- about the shaver itself. The instruction book is very thorough -- but the warnings interspersed throughout are in grey print -- how about bold black?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself is nothing I would want to use all the time -- in fact, after trying it, I still prefer my 550 TL. The heads on the 8040X DO flex, but the moisturizing cream/gel only comes through two of them when all three heads with moisturizer would work much better -- the heads also drag across my skin -- and in some instances gave me a bit of razor burn -- especially on my neck. This shaver was used in the shower, so there was plenty of (acqua) moisture, in addition to gel moisturizer, available for a close shave, but the shave was not as good as it should have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting the moisturizer into the shaver is a feat that involves pumping the cartridge manually and then cleaning up the excess moisturizer that suddenly splats out of the shaver when it is full. Um.........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco 8040X is a nice idea, but it&#x27;s gimmicky and labor intensive, when all I want is a quick shave and then a quick rinse of the heads and the knowledge that my shaver will be ready and willing the next morning. The Norelco 8040X IMHO probably work just as well on dry skin as on wet -- but it&#x27;s nothing I would want to use on a regular basis.zor burn -- especially on my neck.

            <li> The Norelco 8040X is a good razor equal to all of the very well made ones norelco produces.  The two distinguishing features is that it is water resistant so you can use it in the shower and it has a built in lotion dispenser.  It works very well in the shower and eliminates the need to separately lather.  The lather function also has an interesting refill tube that you twist to expose the pump.       Physically, the razor is much slimmer and lighter than the Norelco arcitec 1090. It is an overall very simple and clean design;  there are two buttons (one for power and one to dispense lotion) and two recessed LED&#x27;s.  I find it more appealing to the Norelco arcitec 1090.  One thing to keep in mind is that unlike other Norelco&#x27;s, the shaver head does not catch the trimmings so it may be a little messy if you do not use it in the shower.  It does have a trimmer, but it is not built in--instead it is an attachment that otherwise docks on the back of the charger.  you have to pop off the shaver head and swap it out to use the trimmer.     Over all, I like this shaver because it is smaller and simpler.  The one thing I wished they would include is a stand or holder that we can use in the shower.  Like all of the other Norelcos out there, the new design makes it difficult to store the razor when it is not in the charging stand.  Overall, it is a quality product that I would recommend for anyone looking for an electric shaver for the shower.</li>
            <li> All my life I have hoped that technology would finally allow a electric shaver that would actually shave as good as a razer blade.  Well, that day has arrived.  This shaver is used in the shower and has lotion inside the shaver that you push a button and it despenses the lotion. The shave is unbleivabley  smooth.  When I get out of the shower and rinse my face, it feels absolutley equiveniant to a shave with a blade.. end of story  6 months later update...I still love this shaver, I buy the Nivia shaving creame and put it on my face at the begining of a shower and about half way though shave with the shaver and its absolutely equiviliant to a blade shave, except you have to replace the shaving heads more than once a year as the dull every 6 months with daily use and the quality of the shave declines.  But, you DONT have to buy the expensive Niva refills as the shaving cream actually works much better.  I love this shaver and will buy another when this one quits.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted an electric shaver I could use in the shower, but they always irritated my neck.  This shaver with accompanying moisturizer makes shaving a breeze and incredibly comfortable. It is not as close as a razor, but plenty close enough and when used daily keeps the beard well in hand.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the design and feel of this shaver, but the motor is so weak that it takes forever to shave. I have to sit in the shower and shave for 20 minutes and I don&#x27;t grow a big or strong beard. The 8 hour charge for 30 minute use just magnifies my frustration. This shaver might be great for getting rid of that preteen peach fuzz, but for most adults you can grow hair faster than this thing can cut it. How did this ever get past product testing, I don&#x27;t know!</li>
            <li> I would like to recomend this product as it has been one of the bests I&#x27;ve used ever.&lt;br /&gt;Excelent results obtained!</li>
            <li> I received this shaver as a warranty replacement for the Norelco 7737. I loved the 7737. It held a charge for a month at a time or longer, and I shave every day, in the shower.    The 8040X doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as well. On top of that, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do as good a job at shaving, either. I still prefer a nice, wet, in-the-shower shave with this razor to my twin-blade manual razor, especially on the sensitive under-chin area, but that 7737 really did a great job! I was mostly interested in comfort, not speed, and you do have to be a little patient using these.    I found the comfort gel to be quite effective, but I couldn&#x27;t find replacements in my local stores. I used Nivea for Men shaving gel instead, applied by hand to the face before shaving, and that works just fine.    I&#x27;m sad my 7737 went away, and I got this instead. It&#x27;s just not as good.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ll start out by saying that I am 67 years old... secondly, I have tried nearly every brand of electric razor that has ever been made, and I have given them all away because they all just tore my neck to pieces... and I&#x27;ve always gone back to a blade to get a close shave without making my neck look like hamburger. Then I saw this Norelco wet shaver on Amazon for an exceptional price, so I ordered one. I am 100% sold on this one! It doesn&#x27;t tear my neck up, and gives me the closest shave I&#x27;ve EVER had... even my leathery old skin is as soft as a baby&#x27;s behind with the Nivea lotion dispensed by the razor as a lubricant. Don&#x27;t hesitate, guys, THIS one really does work!!</li>
            <li> This is a very light shaver (weight wise).  It works a lot better on a wet face with a wet shaver.  Using it dry causes a lot of irratation.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors for several years, and this one is the best one by far. It&#x27;s simple and easy to use and gives the best shave for an electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had. I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for the best electric razor on the market.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised by this electric shave - moisturizer system.  The shape of it is pleasing and comfortable in the hand as you shave.  The 3 flex-heads give a close, quick shave.  The Nivea for Met I was sceptical of, but it provided a fresh clean scent.  My fear was that the smell would be overly strong, but this was not the case in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is in the box:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor with flex-head&lt;br /&gt;Flex-head protector&lt;br /&gt;1 bottle of Nivea for men shaving conditioner (.95 FL. OZ or 28ML)&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer head&lt;br /&gt;charging stand and cord&lt;br /&gt;brush</li>
            <li> My husband has complained about shaving irritating his skin, so when I saw this shaver I ordered one for him. Here is what he had to say after using it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for years, but never a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; system, so I was quite interested to compare the Cool Skin 8040X to my old shaver. When I first opened the package and set the shaver up, I had to not only charge the batteries but also fill the shaver with Nivea For Men shaving conditioner. This was no problem following the easy to read instruction manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin shaving, you first press the on/off button on the shaver to turn it on and then press the conditioner release button. This pumps a small amount of conditioner out of holes in the center of two of the three shaver heads. Then you shave as you normally would with an electric shaver. I found that I use three pumps of conditioner while shaving: one for each side of my face and one for my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I have a tough beard, I have sensitive skin. Because of this, in recent years I&#x27;ve starting shaving every other day. So when I shave my beard is a little bit longer than most men&#x27;s would normally be. The shaver has no problem coping with this. It cuts clean with no pulling on the hairs. However, it begins to have problems with three days of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a mustache and goatee, which has always caused me to use a razor to shave along its edge. The same applies when using the Cool Skin, but with less irritation as it is now being done with skin conditioner in place instead of on dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver also comes with a beard trimming device. Just snap off the triple shave head and replace it with the trimmer. (Conditioner cannot be used when the trimmer is installed.) The only real fault with the Cool Skin is this trimmer which, frankly, is useless. It just doesn&#x27;t want to cut any hairs. But then, the one on my old Norelco is the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find the conditioner application button is in a position that I want to place my fingers when using the shaver, so occasionally I&#x27;ll get an extra, unneeded dose of conditioner. A pretty minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cool Skin can also be used in the shower, but I have not tried this as I&#x27;m blind as a bat without my glasses on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the results of my shave are the same whether I use my old standard Norelco or this new Norelco Cool Skin 8040X, with one exception: ­ there is much less skin irritation with the Cool Skin.

            <li> Or, for those who prefer to view all events in a positive light, someone should be promoted. I was fortunate enough  - or so I thought -  to receive the [[ASIN:B001A0GDQE Philips Norelco Arcitec 1090 Rechargeable Cordless Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] last year and although it is not a comparison of equals, I now also have the Cool Skin 8040x. The 1090x is Philips/Norelco&#x27;s flagship razor and this one is more of a middle of the road competitively priced product so any comparison is unfair...for the 1090x. For the last month, I&#x27;ve alternated between this razor and the 1090x, and my impression is without reservation, the 8040x delivers a superior cut. I&#x27;ve finally found a cordless that eliminates the need to keep some manual razors in reserve. Whomever led this product development team is making the top tier team look bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notwithstanding bells and whistles, the primary function of any razor is to offer a smooth, comfortable shave and this rechargeable gets the job done with aplomb, with or without utilization of the moisturizing system, whether employed as a wet or dry shaver. I&#x27;m not a real big fan of products that obligate additional expenditures for consumables like the Nivea Conditioner but I realize it is a nice feature for those who may need the conditioner to avoid skin irritation. I would recommend Nivea and Norelco team up to produce a fragrance free version as this product does conflict with other scents the consumer might use.  It is not my practice to use the conditioner every time I shave (every other day) but at my present rate, I would anticipate the initial conditioner supply will last at least six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the shaver is a snap. Just turn it on and wash the heads under hot running water. I wish the upscale model cleaned as efficiently, but then, as I facetiously stated in another review my primary use for that pricey unit is as a display item now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor&#x27;s tracking system follows facial contours (head in my case) quite efficiently and does not require anywhere near as much pressure to achieve a close cut on stubble as has been my experience with the top of the line model. Additionally, the relatively compact size and shape is easier to manipulate. The 8040x also has a detachable trim head that can be used for close grooming and you can actually see what you&#x27;re doing, another advantage over the premium model. Just pull off the tracker head and lightly press on the trimmer attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charge time for a full charge is about four hours for 40 minutes of shave time. There is a 9 minute quick charge capability that provides enough power for a three minute shave. The charging stand has a reasonably small footprint although for convenience and my take on durability, the charging cord has to be unplugged but remain attached to the base. The inexpensive plastic retainer does not look as though it would withstand multiple rotations.  The travel locking feature is a nice touch but the travel case is a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, for nearly $150 less than the top of the line model and superior shaving capability, I&#x27;ll figure out how to securely pack it.oes not require anywhere near as much pressure to achieve a close cut on stubble as has been my experience with the top of the line model.

            <li> Hubby wanted this for the office to dry-shave his 3 o&#x27;clock shadow. It worked great. His face is smoother after using this probably because of its massaging action. We never bothered with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My bf loves it but the only bad thing is that there is no catcher so now I have to clean the sink constantly...grrrr</li>
            <li> I want to believe in a world in which redemption is always possible. There should be no unforgivable sins; your better qualities should always offer the hope that your failings, however profound, can be overcome.     But this shaver fails in the single unforgivable way that an electronic device can: despite lots of bells and whistles, it doesn&#x27;t do the one thing you purchase it to do.     I bought this to replace an older model Norelco wet/dry shaver that finally gave up the ghost. This razor offers some additional features my old one lacked: it&#x27;s much lighter, holds a charge longer, and has a silly and totally unnecessary shave-goo-dispensing system built into it. I tried to find a wet/dry Norelco shaver with no \\&quot;moisturizing system,\\&quot; but to no avail. If you want to shave in the shower, Norelco wants to insure you keep purchasing more shave gel cartridges. After reading some reviews that suggested the shaver worked perfectly well without it squirting glop everywhere, I was satisfied this was the right purchase.    Unfortunately, the shaver is unsatisfactory in one way: it just doesn&#x27;t shave very well. I&#x27;ve used it on my face and head, with and without moisturizer, wet and dry, and its shave is pretty lousy. My old Norelco provided a shave that was very smooth and comparable to a blade; with this model, there&#x27;s noticeable beard fuzz left behind immediately after I shave, and by the end of the day, I look like I forgot to shave at all that morning. When I found myself going back over my face with a regular razor right after I used the 8040X, I knew this shaver had to go. I would like to believe that its lightweight, comfortable form and good battery life could redeem it, but sadly, its transgression is too profound. I may not be able to forgive it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll forget I ever owned it before long.</li>
            <li> I love shaving in the shower. This shaver works great for that purpose.  I don&#x27;t use the propriety Nivea shaving moisturizer; I just use a small dollop of Nivea&#x27;s regular shaving gel ($3 for a large canister available anywhere) and that works fine.  It is a little slower than my old Norelco Advantage in that it requires several passes over an area to get a nice shave.  The flexible head design is amazing; it can really get that stubborn neck hair that my old shaver used to miss.  The open design makes it not that great for dry shaving as the hair gets everywhere, but I use it 98% of the time in the shower that that is not a big issue for me.      The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is due to it&#x27;s charging mechanism.  Charging the shaver in 4 hours sounds like a good idea, but the manual strictly admonishes against overcharging.  Hence, it is actually a bit of a pain. If I bought the low-end shaver that charges in 8 hours, I&#x27;d charge it in the morning and it would be ready when I get home from work.  If I bought the high-end shaver that charges in 2 hours, I can plug it in whenever I feel like and unplug it 2 hours later.  A 4 hour charging time requires a larger block of time for me to have to remember to charge the thing.  Why couldn&#x27;t Norelco make a charger that automatically shuts off or goes to trickle charge when the battery is full?  Also, why the need for a base?  It takes up counter space in my bathroom and is bulky for traveling.  My old shaver did not have a base and was great for travel as the AC adapter plugged directly into the razor.    If I had to do it all over again, I&#x27;d probably buy the 8020x and save myself $25.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor. I have always shaved with either disposable or a schick quatro. I have a medium to thick beard and have very sensitive skin. The only way i could really get a great smooth shave with a blade was to shave AGAINST the growth, however, this gave me awful irritation and ingrown hairs.    I decided to try this electric razor since i really liked the lotion dispensing feature. At first i didnt like this razor but now that my face has \\&quot;adapted\\&quot; to it I love it. I can shave everyday with this and get a great shave. It shaves even smoother than a blade for me. The only way I could get this smooth with a blade would&#x27;ve been with a ton of irritation. The irritation from this razor is extremely minimal. I can hardly feel it. It only leaves the very bottom part of the beard on my neck slightly red and it is only noticeable if you actually look for it in the mirror. It only misses a few hairs every other shave but usually gets them all quickly. As I said before I love the lotion feature. It feels GREAT on my sensitive skin. It takes about 6 minutes to get an awesome shave with this. Once done shaving I rinse the lotion off my face with cold water and splash some after shave on and feel great.    Only reason for not giving 5 stars is because the trimmer that comes with it basically sucks. It trims hair ok but it&#x27;s weak. Also the \\&quot;travel case\\&quot; is just a stupid neoprene like wrap.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME, THAT I&#x27;VE EVER LEFT A COMMENT ON AMAZON.COM,BUT JUST HAD TO!! THIS RAZOR IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST COMFORTABLE &amp; CLOSEST SHAVE THAT I&#x27;VE EVER HAD!!!! JUST AS CLOSE AS A RAZOR &amp; WAY MORE COMFORTABLE WITH ZERO NICKS. TAKES ABOUT 2 WEEKS FOR YOUR SKIN TO GET USE TO CHANGING FROM A BLADE TO AN ELECTRIC RAZOR. YOU&#x27;LL NOTICE THAT AFTER 2 WEEKS OR SO, THAT YOUR SHAVES WILL GET CLOSER &amp; MORE COMFORTABLE. I DON&#x27;T HAVE DRY SKIN ANYMORE EITHER. NO NEED FOR AFTER SHAVE THAT CAN BREAK YOUR SKIN OUT! I&#x27;ve NOTICED THAT I HAVE WAY LESS ACNE &amp; NO BUMPS! I RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR FOR EVERYONE!!! THAT INCLUDES YOU GUYS WITH THICK,&amp; COURSE BEARDS LIKE I HAVE!! PROBABLY GREAT FOR WOMENS&#x27; LEGS AS WELL!! ALSO REALLY MOISTURIZES YOUR FACE!!

THE NOXEMA CREAM COMES IN A BLUE, ORANGE &amp; WHITE BOTTLE!! SAW IT AT, DOLLAR GENERAL STORES OR FIND ONLINE!!*****</li>
            <li> The shaver was as good as I expected.  Clean / close shave everytime. Heads manueuvered to face curves extremely well. The shave cream was dispensed with one push of button delivered the correct amount of cream everytime.  Cleanup was also easy. Just run razor onder cold running water. The sideburns trimmer was easy to add to shaver and worked great.  Charge time was only 4 hours. Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a 3 head rotary.  You can use it in the shower or outside the shower using a rinse in the faucet.  There is a bladder that contains Nivea moisturizing lotion which make the shaver work extra nice.  No razor burn!  The shaver has enough capacity for maybe 4 uses and the shaver is easily refilled.    Two lessons learner...    Nivea moisturizer is a little hard to find.  I get mine at Walmart.  Don&#x27;t go more than 2 days without using it.  Extra growth will hinder it.  You then need to use the clipper attachment (this is provided) to trim it down..    Battery life is very good and the recharger stand is easy.  Just drop it in.    The rotary heads can be replaced with fresh blades at a later date.  Haven&#x27;t needed it but it will be handy.    In all a well spent pile of money.  I use it in the shower every day and love it.  No more razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have never been a big fan of electric razors. not sure why I dumpped a benji on this. Really didnt work that well and irritated my skin. But I guess its different for everyone</li>
            <li> Thats right, and it aint no lie. The last time i used a electric shaver was over 10yrs ago when i was in highschool, it was a wet/dry panasonic foil razor, i cant remember anything about it but i did liked it cause i could use shaving cream and in the shower with it.     since then i have used the Gillette Mach 3 blades(then the turbo, then the Fusion) but they are expensive and i go through blades alot cause i have very thick black beard. I have tried philips shavers dry shavers in the past months but none work, they shaved awful and let my face burning red and irrated to a point that it hurt. I was very interested in the Cool Skin 8040X and gave it a shot... I used it right after a shower with my face still wet along with the nivea lotion and let me tell you, WOW!!!!!! i could not believe how great it shaved, the lotion helped the razor slide very very easily and smooth along my face and afterwards, i could NOT believe the shave i had.. \\&quot;It literally was as close if not closer then my Gillette Mach 3 blades\\&quot;.! ..     the only negative thing i gave the shaver is that it doesnt do good with long hairs.. so i have to use the razor once every other day, i use to go once every 3-4 days with my blade because it was the opposite, if i where to shave every other day with my blade it would irrate and burn me, but if i go every 3-4 days with the philips shaver it doesnt/has a hard time grabbing the long hairs, so i managed to do it every other day and it works beyond amazing!. takes me about the same time as using the blade(5-7mins). the lotion smells really really good and does a amazing job on the face too.     if your into shopping for a wet shaver, this is the one! without a doubt!.  it took me about 4 shaves with the razor to fully know how to shave with it. and let me mention too, it does a hell of a job! on the neck compare to dry razors.</li>
            <li> This is another excellent shaving product from Philips -- it cuts like an ordinary shaver, but with the added benefit of lubrication that helps it to shave smoothly.  My skin doesn&#x27;t get irritated or dry, and the lubrication seems to help the shave to go more quickly.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands of shavers and this one seems to work the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package comes with a squeeze bottle full of a very pleasant smelling lotion, that you inject into the back of the shaver.  Then, when you are shaving, you just press a button and it releases enough lotion to lubricate about one third of the face.  When it starts to feel like a dry shave, you press the button again and finish up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the amount of lotion you can inject into the shaver is enough for about 5 to 6 shaves.  The shaver comes with a small sample bottle of the lotion -- and I guess one drawback is that you have to keep buying the lotion, unless you want to use this like an ordinary dry shaver.  I&#x27;ve tried that too and it seems to work as well as any other shaver I&#x27;ve tried.  I prefer, though, to use the lotion.  It feels good and has a nice aftershave smell that my wife also likes -- that&#x27;s good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the system is water resistant, you can shave in the shower, and you can wash it off in water when you are finished.  The extendable trimmer isn&#x27;t very useful, but I&#x27;ve never seen a shaver where they are.  It comes fully recharged and after about two weeks of using it about every other day it is still working well -- I haven&#x27;t charged it yet.  I do wish there was some kind of indicator on the unit that would let me know how much charge remains, but all in all I am quite happy with this.</li>
            <li> Having used regular razors all my life, this was my first experience to an electric razor.  I was quite disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the Norelco 8040X a solid week of use, thinking that it might get better over time (as their manual suggests).  It did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning after shaving I had to manually touch-up using a $2 Bic razor.  This product did not come anywhere near my skin no matter how light or hard I pressed it against me.  Maybe that&#x27;s just how electric shavers are?  I&#x27;m not sure, but they can&#x27;t be this bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was however impressed with the battery life (a full week on a single charge) and how quiet it is.  With the shower running, I could barely hear the motor.  It&#x27;s waterproof, so I can use it in the shower.  It comes with a nice travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sideburn attachment is a nice thought, but there was no ear/nose trimmer which I have seen in $20 Norelco sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the moisturizing part, the lotion smelled nice but it didn&#x27;t really add to the experience.  And from what I can see it&#x27;s very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s back to my $2 razors for me.</li>
            <li> i have been using electric razors on and off in my life. But the ones i owned were all Norelco&#x27;s (or Philips). I have owned two of 2-blade ones (they used to make those) and one coolskin (the predecessor of this one, which you had to use those Nivea pouch&#x27;s). First 2&#x27;s were very satisfying even though they were much older models than the coolskin one. (one was from the ealry 90&#x27;s or maybe even late 80&#x27;s and the other was from the late 90&#x27;s). I personally preferred their two blade ones not only because they were smaller and lighter, but also because it shaved better in those hard to reach areas (like under my nose). Also because it had only 2 blades, it caused less friction on your skin, so it was easier to move it around on my face.    anyway, so after my last 2-blade razor&#x27;s blades were discontinued i haven&#x27;t used electric razor, until the coolskin one. When it first came out, i thought i should give it a try, since Norelco razors never disappointed me, and when i was using non-electric razors, i always shaved in the shower. so i gave it a shot.. but, well, it was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. it was full of problems. the hinge and the lock of the openable head soon got broken. so i had to like hold the head while i am shaving to prevent it from opening. (i saw many other reviewers complaining about the head being broken soon) and the cushioned discs (blades) would sink into the head (they were designed that way to give you safer/comfortable shave) but because of that it&#x27;s just impossible to put enough pressure against your skin, and so it just won&#x27;t shave under my nose. (also because of its bulky head. but it did shave pretty well on my chin/cheek though). With the older one, i used it with just regular shaving gel, coz it worked better for me, and those cartridges were just very inconvenient to replace after like every three shaves. but then the razor would quickly collect soap scum if you used regular shaving gel (which isn&#x27;t the razor&#x27;s fault but the new model solved this problem. i will explain later)    the new models 8020~8060 are just amazing. big improvement. almost solved all the existing problems with the older model. lighter, smaller, yet sturdier, more convenient to refill the lotion. slimmer head lets you shave hard to reach areas more easily, blades don&#x27;t go into the head, but still flexible. and when you change the blades for these models, you don&#x27;t just change the blades, you change the entire head. this is not only more convenient, but also cleaner/healthier and so it also solves the soap scum problem if you want to use your own shaving foam/gel or even soap. (so there is really no reason to complain about the price of the consumables which i don&#x27;t think is that expensive anyways.)    these might not be the world&#x27;s best electric razors. there are way more expensive models from Norelco and Braun. They might give you even closer shave and automatic cleaning/lubricating and all that luxurious features. but at the same time, these are not only more affordable, but also probably the best FULLY WATERPROOF electric razors now. and i believe most people who buy these, they do because they need the waterproof/wet shaving feature.    i believe Norelco really closely reviewed all the downfalls of the older models and made big improvements by fixing them all.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco Advantage 6705 that served me well for the last five years until recently when it lost its ability to hold a charge.  I replaced it with this razor because it is the updated version of the advantage.  I thought it would perform the same as the advantage, but it doesn&#x27;t.         It seems underpowered compared to the Advantage.  Although it feels comfortable when I shave, it refuses to finish the job.  No matter how often I go over the same area, it leaves alot of hair behind.  I am so frustrated with this razor that I may switch to a manual.       I do like the narrower shape that makes this razor easier to hold.  The open design of the heads also makes it easier to clean, but I just don&#x27;t understand why this razor would perform so much poorer than a similar model from several years ago.</li>
            <li> A little background on me so you can understand where I am coming from with this review: Generally I shave every other day, though I probably should shave everyday, I stretch it to every other day without it being a huge problem. I&#x27;m coming from a Philishave Cool Skin, which is the same as the Norelco but I believe it is the brand sold outside the US. I&#x27;m not certain of the model number, but you get the idea that its the predecessor of this model, which used the lotion cartridges. I&#x27;ve owned that shaver for about 4 years and have replaced the blades a couple times. My Philishave is in perfect working condition, however required new blades; so I decided to take this opportunity to upgrade to the sleeker 8040X.   My choices. I have pretty sensitive skin, particularly around my neck so I wanted to go with a wet/dry shaver with lotion. So I chose the Norelco 8000 series. There are three models available in this series, the 8020, the 8040 and the 8060. Each of these models will give you the same shave, but the price difference comes from the additional features related to each model. The 8020 requires a longer charge time at 8 hours and gives 30 minutes of shave time, the 8040 requires 4 hours of charge time providing 40 minutes of shave time, the 8060 requires 1.5 hours and also gives 40 minutes of shave time. The 8040 and 8060 also offer a quick charge. Another major difference between the 8060 and the lower models, is that the 8060 automatically refills the shaver&#x27;s bladder so the shaver is full of lotion every time you use it. Both the 8040 and 8060 have a battery full indication, which the 8020 lacks. I find that useful because I know when to remove my shaver from the charger, so as not to damage the battery by over-charging. So the big differences are in the battery and the charge stand.   My decision: I decided to go with the 8040 because I was comfortable with the 4 hour charge, though a 1.5 hour would be nice. 8 hours just seems too long to fully charge my shaver. Also, I liked the idea of the battery full indicator. So that left me between the 8040 and 8060. The big turn-off of the 8060 was the bulkier charge stand. I&#x27;m not so lazy that I would pay the extra $50 primarily to have the shaver refill itself. So, the 8040 it is; a nice middle ground and more streamlined.   Initial impressions: My first shave was extremely comfortable, with zero irritation; thanks to the glide rings provided on each model. Even with my old shaver, I would get some irritation; particularly on my neck. The new design is easier to manipulate than the bulky models that preceded it. The shave lotion also smells nicer, more like an aftershave, though it did burn a little; most likely the result of alcohol (which is used to create that nicer smell) though the burning quickly subsided. I didn&#x27;t seem to be as smooth as I was with my old shaver, but Norelco recommends using the shaver for 21 days to become accustomed to it. After using is for a short time I found that I never really got that close shave. Not that its not smooth at all, its just seems a little less smooth than I was with my previous shaver. What this means for me: Now I shave everyday to maintain a smoother face; I&#x27;d probably get too scruffy if I tried to stretch it to every other day. My fiancé is probably my biggest critic when it comes to shaving and she actually prefers this model to my previous one b/c now I am shaving everyday and have greater periods of a smooth face instead of scruffy one. I can do a relatively quick shave, maybe 7 minutes or so to get the desired results of at least a clean-cut appearance.  So why 4 stars (I would say 3.5, a little better than the halfway mark)? I figure there are many factors that go into shaving, not just having a very close shave. This shaver is extremely comfortable, I finish each shave with almost no irritation, whereas my old shaver would often leave my neck red and could be quite painful. Its also comfortable to hold and the smaller design makes it easier to travel with (as well as the fact that it includes a travel lock). So even though the shave isn&#x27;t as smooth as I was hoping for, its still a pretty descent shaver all things considered.</li>
            <li> I bought the 8040x a couple of days ago and even I am surprised at how impressed I am with the shaver. I have always been a reader of reviews on Amazon and this is but my second review. This product makes me want to recommend it to everyone I see. Wow!! First, let me tell you about the shavers I have had.    My past shavers: I have had a Braun Synchro (lost with luggage on an international trip), a Norelco Reflex that I absolutely hated (but still hung on to for emergencies) and a Braun Activator 8595 (with Clean N Charge station) that I had till recently and absolutely loved. My Braun Activator (which I had for the past 3 years) broke when it slipped from my hand last week. Hence, I was in the market for a new shaver and thought I will research the shavers available since I was going to spend some money.    My new 8040X: I used my old Norelco Reflex for a week on a temporary basis till I bought a better model and absolutely hated it. It made my skin all red. As I was researching I came across the 8040X on Amazon and was intrigued by the idea of a wet shaver (having used only foil dry ones thus far). I tried it out in the shower for the past couple of days and I must say it has absolutely blown me away. It is so convenient, and the smoothest shave I have had in several years (as good as a Mach 3 shave that I stopped years ago). My wife was super impressed and to quote another review on this site....my cheeks AND I MUST EMPHASIZE even my neck, chin feel like \\&quot;Baby&#x27;s bottoms\\&quot;. The lotion that comes along with the shaver is awesome and goes along really well with the Nivea after shave lotion that I was already used to. Cleaning is a breeze...just hold it under water and run the motor for 30 secs. No more Clean and Charge Refills (boy are they expensive)    For the past several years I have been held hostage by the Braun company consumables (Clean and Charge solutions). It is a great relief that I found a shaver that wont hold me hostage like that, save for a little bitof moisturizing lotion that goes in the shaver (you dont really need a lot if you shave in the shower or by the sink). I am planning on buying one each for both my brothers as well as my father in law. Wonderful shaver and very well worth the money.     I have no intention of returning this shaver (I bought it thinking that I will try it for 3 weeks). Go out and buy this model, save your money and do not buy the 8060...dispensing the lotion into the shaver is really easy.     I will try and refresh this review in the next few weeks.         AS PROMISED ---- UPDATED APRIL 2008 --- AFTER 6 WEEKS OF USE    It has been at least 5-6 weeks since I bought the shaver and not surprisingly, I have not returned it to Philips. This is a great shaver. I have tried using it in the shower as well at the sink.    After having read complaints about the cost of consumables that come with this shaver, I decided to put it to the test. I began by trying Edge shaving gel prior to shaving with terrible results. It resulted in a very sticky shave....not good at all. I then decided to try a small travel pack of Nivea shaving gel.... and believe it or not....it worked like a charm....as good as the shaving conditioner. Apply a very small amount and do not lather it up vigorously...just a thin film.    Here is what I do nowadays..... I apply very little of the Nivea shaving GEL (not conditioner) and apply gently, do not lather up heavily. I use the shaver with little or no conditioner and it works just as well either in the shower or at the sink. Very little irritation and smooth effective shave. Also, applying the gel on your face prior to shaving prevents spraying of debris on and around your basin.     If there is anything I do not like about this shaver, it is the power and speed of the motor. While I cannot attest or comment on previous Coolskin models, that I have never owned, I can say that I can live with the power and speed of this shaver for several reasons. It is smooth, does notirritate your skin (which is extremely important for me after having experienced other shavers and razors) and easy to use. Go get one and if possible try getting it at one of your local stores like Bed Bath Beyond or Linens n things with a 20% off coupon.</li>
            <li> #1)  I bought this instead of the cheaper version because this had the Travel Case with it.  What a JOKE.  It&#x27;s a wrap.  My previous Norelco&#x27;s all came with nice cases to travel with, but this is just some flimsy neoprene wrap...  NOT worth the extra $20 or so that this cost over the basic model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2)  I had the previous version of the CoolSkin razor, and really loved it.  When the battery finally died in it, I purchases this one just because it was the next version of the razor I liked.  This one, I can barely tolerate.  Since I passed my \\&quot;try it or money back\\&quot; period, I&#x27;m stuck with this thing till I can find something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3)  This is obviously a razor that is put out just for it&#x27;s funky look.  Not how well it performs.  The razor head covers keep falling off, all it takes is a slight twist and the head unit falls apart.  The new head design is a single drive, instead of previous norelco units that drive all 3 heads independently.  This razor is SLLLLOOOOWW!  It reminds me of my first cordless razor from 1985!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this in the shower, as you&#x27;ll waste more money in water bills than getting a close shave outta this slow razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4)  Keep a standard razor handy.  You&#x27;re going to need it for the areas that this razor just REFUSES to shave.  No matter how much lotion I use, how many times I go over this area, how much I twist, turn and tug, this razor refuses to shave certain areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is a major disappointment.  I would not recommend this to any of my friends.  I just wish I wouldn&#x27;t have gone past my \\&quot;you&#x27;ll like it or get your money back\\&quot; period.  I&#x27;m out $100 for this turkey of a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 8 months later&lt;br /&gt;Battery is dying in this thing fast.  8 months in, and it no longer hold a maximum charge.  I keep new cheap razors in the drawer, as this razor just will NOT get everywhere.  Norelco has lost a long time customer with this piece of garbage razor.</li>
            <li> This Item is almost very good ,only thing I want to say is that the speed is a bit slow.Otherwise it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li> Pros: The best of both worlds.. electric shaving, wet shaving.  Head design is perfect for trimming beards.  Automatic application of shaving conditioner eliminates \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot;.  Bargin price compared to Norelco&#x27;s \\&quot;dry\\&quot; razor.    Cons: Sideburn trimmer requires removal of shaving head, this is inconvenient.  Nevia Shaving Conditioner is not only hard to find in stores but when  you do locate it it is very expensive.  Shaving Conditioner reservoir on the shaver itself has to be replaced each time you start a new bottle of Nevia Shaving Conditioner and I feel this is just a wasteful use of plastic.      Summary:  The Philips Norelco 8040X provides the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I use it mainly for beard trimming and find  that it gives me greater control than other razors.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Norelco dry electric shavers for years and has really loved them. As he really likes Philips products he was looking forward to trying the Moisturizing Shaving system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After charging the shaver for the recommended four hours (reading the instructions is also a good idea) using the cartridge of Nivea to fill the razor&#x27;s cartridge was surprisingly neat and easy to do.  The shaver went into the shower for its first test run. It takes some experimenting to know how much moisturizer to use at first, but this was also very easy (see comment on reading instructions). There is a separate button for dispensing the moisturizer, and the process seemed similar to putting on a little shaving cream, shaving a small area and then applying more when the razor started to drag. The results were the best, smoothest and most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever seen from an electric razor - definitely comparable to using a razor blade without the nicks and cuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering changing to an electric razor, or have one but sometimes miss getting a really close shave, this system is highly recommended!  Also great for dry or sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband, hoping he would get hooked by even the novelty of it and use it everyday, I like a freshly clean shaven look on him and he had been slacking lately using his fusion disposables.     He&#x27;s tried a few electric razors in the past but was never happy with them so has stuck to using the upper end disposables.     His take: very comfortable to hold, the heads conform to his face well and it&#x27;s a comfortable shave... as long as it&#x27;s very lubricated. He found he got the best feeling and closest share only when he used a lot of shaving creme/gel &amp; had his face very well, making for quite a mess on the sink top. He liked the idea of the dispensing lotion but found he preferred his normal shaving gel and also didn&#x27;t think the dispenser held enough or that it was cost effective. On the upside this is water proof so I&#x27;ll get him to try it in the shower next. He also agrees with the other reviewers who said it&#x27;s just not a close enough shave, and that it takes far to long. The whole idea of a electric is to speed up the process but between loading it with the conditioner, using it, adding more water, cleaning up the mess etc it was taking him 2x as long to shave at least, and with less steller results.    My take: I think his face looks better, the shave may not be as close however there are no knicks or aggrivation and his skin looks better all around. Of course I see his point on the time consuming aspect.     The booklet recommends giving it 3 weeks, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be able to talk him into that... wonder how this thing would work on my legs? ;)</li>
            <li> Decent electric though I still prefer a manual razor or even my older, similar Norelco which is basically the same but without the shaving conditioner. Shaves better when wet or in shower but still not as good as a razor. What I dont like is having the extra step of using the conditioner but still not getting a close shave, not to mention having to buy refills.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco shaver user for about 15 years.  In that time, I&#x27;ve had ups and downs with their products, but I&#x27;ve been mostly satisfied and keep purchasing new models every few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has unique \\&quot;floating\\&quot; shaver heads.  When you shave, it&#x27;s much easier to get to hard-to-reach areas of the face, since the body of the shaver creates no restrictions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving gel makes for a more pleasant shaving experience. It allows for a closer shave with less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is FAST!  I&#x27;m able to shave in about half the time as with my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the charging station which cradles the shaver (as opposed to just plugging in the razor and setting it on the counter to charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer for sideburns and beards is separate and needs to be installed and removed for each use.  Those familiar with the pop-up trimmer on other Norelco models may be disappointed.  (I&#x27;m just going to use a personal trimmer and not bother with this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the shaver is faster, there&#x27;s a moderately complicated cleaning process recommended after each use and this eats up time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good shaver for the price.  I think the pros outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been just a huge fan of electric razors over the years.  There&#x27;s something to be said for the ease and convenience of an electric razor, but for obvious reasons, they almost always lack the closeness of a true blade, and rarely leave your skin feeling quite as refreshed as the traditional route.  So despite favoring the performance and feel of blades, I&#x27;ve always kept an electric for moments when speed or apathy take priority.  Most recently, that role has been admirably served by a [[ASIN:B000050FDQ Braun 7526 Syncro Shaver System with Clean &amp; Charge Storage Stand]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Braun has held up well, two aspects of the Philips Norelco 8040X really compelled me.  The first, that it could be used in the shower -- my interest in this was less about convenience than it was how the water might change the way my skin feels after an electric shave.  The second, the lotion dispenser.  Again, one of my two chief complaints with electrics was how it left my skin feeling.  Dry, rough, even abraded at times.  My hope was that the Nivea lotion included would address that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In both cases, my hopes were well met.  While I can&#x27;t claim to be getting significantly closer shaves with the Norelco, I can say that I enjoy the experience much more, and my skin feels happier for it.  Indeed, my only complaint is that the Nivea lotion has &#x27;fragrance&#x27; as an ingredient.  While this doesn&#x27;t matter to the majority of the population, fragrance is toxic, and for a number of people (like myself) it can cause some problems.  I can&#x27;t claim it as a detracting factor however, with the water from the shower going, the lotion is foaming and rinsing away relatively quickly.  Obviously I could choose not to use the lotion, if I so desired, but even with the fragrance issue, I think it&#x27;s a valuable part of the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun has been retired to back-up status under the sink, and the truth is, I&#x27;ll probably electric shave much more often than I did before now, because of the value and benefits this particular model brings.  Very happy to be an 8040X owner.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver.  It gives your a nice close shave, and it is shower safe, which saves me a lot of time.  However even with the lotion (which is reasonably priced) it does a number on around the base of your neck.  I&#x27;ve passed the 21 day break in period and still that area takes a little bit of chewing up from the blades.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about a month and a half now, and I really don&#x27;t have any major complaints. I use it daily in the shower with no problem. Yes I miss a spot now and then, and you do have to lube your face with soap or the stuff in the pump on the razor, but that is no major problem for me. I used to shave with a Gillette sensor excel, I won&#x27;t say that the Norelco gets every bit as close, but it is almost there. I have no problems with the angles on my face, or the tight corners under my nose, it takes a little learning, but I do quite well on these spots now. Some people complained about the Moisturizing lotion and having to buy it, I don&#x27;t see their problem, you used to buy shaving cream didn&#x27;t you? I do lube my face with shampoo, and only use the cream when I hit a dry spot, and so far so good.    For me a battery charge on this thing lasts between 15 and 20 days, when the red charge light comes on I have plenty enough charge to finish shaving. As for the problems people have with charging these, I generally put it on the charger around dinner time, and take it off before bed, as I usually hit the bathroom at those times anyway it&#x27;s not really a hassle.    Some other people complained about the fact that the shaving heads are open on the back so the shaved hair falls out the back while you are shaving. This can be a hassle if you shave after you get dressed. I shave in the shower, and where I live it is illegal to shave and drive it was part of the cell phone hands free law. I like the open head because it is easy to keep clean.    The only drawback to the razor I could mention is that it is kind of a pain to change between the shaving head and the trimming head. That and the fact that I can&#x27;t just drop this thing on the charger and forget it lost it that fifth star. Other than that this was a great buy!</li>
