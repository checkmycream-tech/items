            <li>The price is great</li>
            <li>Even the price is great</li>
            <li>Great conditioner~~  Not just for horses.  </li>
            <li>but I found my hair to be extremely fly away and snarled.</li>
            <li>It smelled very nice.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner - not oily - excellent price - rinsing smooth - helps with detangling</li>
            <li>overpriced but good product</li>
            <li>and I must say that it as good as I remember it to be.</li>
            <li>This is a good conditioner after using the shampoo.</li>
            <li>love this on my hair... great conditioner and detangler</li>
            <li>Great product for relaxed ladies for sure.</li>
            <li>But I have to admit, my hair is shiny, smooth and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and for the price, you just can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT ITSELF!!!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited about trying this product because I heard many great things about it!</li>
            <li>I loved the slip and feeling of my hair, very smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has excellent slip and works very well for a wash and go, as a leave in and moisturizing</li>
            <li>Nice smell.  </li>
            <li>In fact, if I could post a picture here, regarding the condition that it arrived in, I&#x27;m sure you guys won&#x27;t be pleased with it, either!</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s perfect for my hair type since I&#x27;m a bit protein sensitive.</li>
            <li>Best conditioner ever to keep hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li>if it can be delivered to China directly, that will be perfect</li>
            <li>, it can only make it feel better !:D</li>
            <li>i love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Whenever I have over-treated my hair with coloring or a heated appliance, nothing works better.</li>
            <li>love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Every Mane n Tail item just makes my hair feel kinda OK but leaves me with dandruff...</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>sure hope that they never stop making this product or change the ingredients</li>
            <li>I Use it on my bouvier, I love the scent</li>
            <li>However I also have sometimes hay hair for the top.</li>
            <li>Who knew this horse shampoo &amp; conditioner would be so wonderful on human hair.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is why it no longer makes my hair feel thicker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s interesting.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li>my hair is 60 % better.  </li>
            <li>I love the insant results.</li>
            <li>Mane n Tail Conditioner has always been a favorite of mine..</li>
            <li>I love all mane &#x27;n tail products in my hair.</li>
            <li>She told me that my hair was in excellent condition and asked if I ever blow dry, straighten or color my hair.</li>
            <li>smells great and leaves your hair so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair was very manageable after the first use and incredibly tangle free.  </li>
            <li>I immediately noticed the slip, and could easily finger comb my hair.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair and was looking for a product that would take care of my hair, the minute I saw this I bought it, because I know Main n Tail is a very good product!!!!</li>
            <li>then i got my sister hooked on it (she has fine greasy hair that looks fantastic now)</li>
            <li>it sure makes my hair soft, more manageable and healthy.</li>
            <li>dont let the fact that it is cheap scare you.</li>
            <li>but this felt and smelled like one of the cheap conditioners that are found in every store.</li>
            <li>There is no mention of any kind of protein on the (new) bottles that I have.</li>
            <li>If you want a product that makes your hair look like it belongs in a Science Channel special on the Neanderthals, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>But your mane alternative is here, my friends:this product is a true thoroughbred in its minimalist packaging and generous quantity, making it lead the race.</li>
            <li>She couldn&#x27;t believe my hair could be in such good condition with all that being done to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved MNT products, and recently I&#x27;ve started using it as a leave in.  </li>
            <li>Mane N Tail is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>love the scent and it really does detangle my hair well.</li>
            <li>I also use it as a leave in for a quick style and go.  </li>
            <li>It is much more affordable and effective than other shampoos and conditioners out there.  </li>
            <li>Not a good lid to travel with, but conditioner is great!</li>
            <li>If you have hair that is basically healthy and easy to comb this is for you, but if you have hair a bit dry and hard to detangle, this is not the best stuff as it did nothing to detangle my hair.  </li>
            <li>(I use in conjunction with matching shampoo) seems to clean my hair well, smells good, hair feels softer, but my naturally curly hair is so so soooo much more frizzier with this product than any other shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>And if youre someone with dry-curly hair like mine but thicker, then you can also use this as a LEAVE-IN (it tells you on the back of the container it can be used as a leave in)...getting to the point, this stuff is seriously amazing</li>
            <li>you will get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive and works very well for a healthy hair routine.</li>
            <li>My favorite way to use it is as a leave-in conditioning balm that eliminated fizzing and encourages my hair into soft, ringlet curls.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it feels during treatment and after rinse out - never heavy or oily...</li>
            <li>Still I might as well try the conditioner right?</li>
            <li>Now, I haven&#x27;t used that many conditioners, but I must say, this conditioner is like no other one I&#x27;ve ever tried...</li>
            <li>Normally when I remove the rollers, my hair is smooth and bouncy</li>
            <li>It gives my hair more slip and I can tame it better.</li>
            <li>after this first time of using it, i&#x27;ve been buying it ever since.</li>
            <li>When you need a soft, silky conditioner to keep your hair looking fabulous, you would probably instinctively reach for a salon brand.</li>
            <li>When I first get in the shower, I shampoo my hair and apply the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I decided yo give Mane &amp; Tale a try first time i used it was as a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>but I noticed it worked better for my hair when I mixed it with my Sillicone Bamboo conditioner/ treatment.</li>
            <li>Okay, so now I just looked on the Mane &#x27;n Tail website, which showed \\&quot;Hydrolyzed Protein\\&quot; in the ingredients for this exact same product, yet that ingredient is listed nowhere in the ingredients list on the bottle that I have.</li>
            <li>My whole family loves this conditioner!</li>
            <li>This product keeps it soft, straight, and frizz free all day.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my hair so soft and full of body.</li>
            <li>so I can use as much as I want)I leave it soaking in my hair the duration of my shower</li>
            <li>and then I rinse it very well.</li>
            <li>I have very curly &amp;#34;Halfrican&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I am really into hair care and</li>
            <li>so it is very needed to have a conditioner to give a lot of slip.</li>
            <li>detangle  it (instead of using the wide toothed comb)  because there were so many</li>
            <li>Even if i just use conditioner without shampoo my hair gets very frizzy.</li>
            <li>It was light and put the texture and volume back in my hair.</li>
            <li>I used my regular dandruff shampoo, which dries your hair more, then i applied my Mane N Tale conditioner and left it on for said 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>it does I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical of this conditioner but the reviews were SO great that I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I have tried the spectrum of products for curly hair over the years and spent $$ on some products, but still return to this old favorite that is CHEAP -- less than $10 for 32 oz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair that ranges from fine to coarse and is more straight in the front and curly everywhere else.  </li>
            <li>Crazy Good!</li>
            <li>From my experience, your hair becomes very soft after using it.</li>
            <li>&quot; (I wasn&#x27;t aware that they&#x27;re the same thing).</li>
            <li>I only just used this for the first time today -</li>
            <li>The consistency of this condish is very light, almost liquidy, and oddly enough, though I tend to lean toward the thicker conditioners (I feel like they actually penetrate better than thin ones), this conditioner seems to completely hydrate my hair!</li>
            <li>I have been using Mane and Tail conditioner for many years, probably at least 10.</li>
            <li>Idk if the ingredients have been changed, but this product has no slip to me &amp; it did not leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li>For me, this conditioner is a MUST if I wear my hair naturally curly.  </li>
            <li>I also use it as a conditioner on my two Labrador Retrievers and it makes their hair so soft and shiny after a shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised-</li>
            <li>Thankfully I had some of my old conditioner on hand, which immediately fixed that dryness</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a transitioner from relaxed to natural</li>
            <li>Conditions hair and makes it feel soft</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and detangled it as well.</li>
            <li>this stuff arrived a day earlier than it was supposed to which was totally appreciated.</li>
            <li>I mainly got this for my beard which had patches of ghost white splitting hairs.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it came highly recommended by several people on a community forum as a anti frizz conditioner of sorts.</li>
            <li>I like to use allot and totally saturate my hair (its such a large bottle and so inexpensive</li>
            <li>if anyone gives negative remarks about this stuff they are full of it!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t like super silky and heavy..</li>
            <li>I use this once per week as a deep conditioner after my shampoo and it leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>is bouncy and extra baby soft.</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m old enough to say that, actually...!)</li>
            <li>I normally condition my hair and wet set it on rollers and that&#x27;s what I did with this product.</li>
            <li>Hair itself seems ok and has its curl and feels soft, but against my scalp is horrible; theres no way i can use this without adding product to my hair; and i dont want to add product as it will create more frizz and ruin my hair.</li>
            <li>I have no more shininess, no less frizz, my hair is in the exact same condition as it was using any conditioner I bought in the store.</li>
            <li>year ago it turned VERY dry and developed split ends.  </li>
            <li>I needed a conditioner because my hair has been so dry from coloring it then with the humidity my hair was a hot frizzy mess.</li>

            <li> It gives my hair more slip and I can tame it better.</li>
            <li> after this first time of using it, i&#x27;ve been buying it ever since.</li>
            <li> When you need a soft, silky conditioner to keep your hair looking fabulous, you would probably instinctively reach for a salon brand.</li>
            <li> When I first get in the shower, I shampoo my hair and apply the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I decided yo give Mane &amp; Tale a try first time i used it was as a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> but I noticed it worked better for my hair when I mixed it with my Sillicone Bamboo conditioner/ treatment.</li>
            <li> Okay, so now I just looked on the Mane &#x27;n Tail website, which showed \\&quot;Hydrolyzed Protein\\&quot; in the ingredients for this exact same product, yet that ingredient is listed nowhere in the ingredients list on the bottle that I have.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this conditioner!</li>
            <li> This product keeps it soft, straight, and frizz free all day.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my hair so soft and full of body.</li>
            <li> so I can use as much as I want)I leave it soaking in my hair the duration of my shower</li>
            <li> and then I rinse it very well.</li>
            <li> I have very curly &amp;#34;Halfrican&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I am really into hair care and</li>
            <li> so it is very needed to have a conditioner to give a lot of slip.</li>
            <li> detangle  it (instead of using the wide toothed comb)  because there were so many</li>
            <li> Even if i just use conditioner without shampoo my hair gets very frizzy.</li>
            <li> It was light and put the texture and volume back in my hair.</li>
            <li> I used my regular dandruff shampoo, which dries your hair more, then i applied my Mane N Tale conditioner and left it on for said 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> it does I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this conditioner but the reviews were SO great that I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have tried the spectrum of products for curly hair over the years and spent $$ on some products, but still return to this old favorite that is CHEAP -- less than $10 for 32 oz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that ranges from fine to coarse and is more straight in the front and curly everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> Crazy Good!</li>
            <li> From my experience, your hair becomes very soft after using it.</li>
            <li> &quot; (I wasn&#x27;t aware that they&#x27;re the same thing).</li>
            <li> I only just used this for the first time today -</li>
            <li> The consistency of this condish is very light, almost liquidy, and oddly enough, though I tend to lean toward the thicker conditioners (I feel like they actually penetrate better than thin ones), this conditioner seems to completely hydrate my hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using Mane and Tail conditioner for many years, probably at least 10.</li>
            <li> Idk if the ingredients have been changed, but this product has no slip to me &amp; it did not leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li> For me, this conditioner is a MUST if I wear my hair naturally curly.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as a conditioner on my two Labrador Retrievers and it makes their hair so soft and shiny after a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised-</li>
            <li> Thankfully I had some of my old conditioner on hand, which immediately fixed that dryness</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a transitioner from relaxed to natural</li>
            <li> Conditions hair and makes it feel soft</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and detangled it as well.</li>
            <li> this stuff arrived a day earlier than it was supposed to which was totally appreciated.</li>
            <li> I mainly got this for my beard which had patches of ghost white splitting hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it came highly recommended by several people on a community forum as a anti frizz conditioner of sorts.</li>
            <li> I like to use allot and totally saturate my hair (its such a large bottle and so inexpensive</li>
            <li> if anyone gives negative remarks about this stuff they are full of it!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t like super silky and heavy..</li>
            <li> I use this once per week as a deep conditioner after my shampoo and it leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> is bouncy and extra baby soft.</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m old enough to say that, actually...!)</li>
            <li> I normally condition my hair and wet set it on rollers and that&#x27;s what I did with this product.</li>
            <li> Hair itself seems ok and has its curl and feels soft, but against my scalp is horrible; theres no way i can use this without adding product to my hair; and i dont want to add product as it will create more frizz and ruin my hair.</li>
            <li> I have no more shininess, no less frizz, my hair is in the exact same condition as it was using any conditioner I bought in the store.</li>
            <li> year ago it turned VERY dry and developed split ends.  </li>
            <li> I needed a conditioner because my hair has been so dry from coloring it then with the humidity my hair was a hot frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> My hair went from a little below ear length to full neck length in a month and a half!</li>
            <li> I then take a small amount and lightly coat my hair, very little on the roots and liberally on the ends and keep it in as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> So today I decided to check the ingredients on a few new bottles that I have, and I see that it no longer contains a protein, as it once did.</li>
            <li> And I have EXTREMELY dry, thin, curly, more or less DAMAGED hair...</li>
            <li> When i got out, i let my hair air dry &amp; noticed less breakage &amp; my hair was very very soft.</li>
            <li> I found out after recently purchasing this item that I could get it at my local grocery store for about 10 dollars less or a third of the price!..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mane and Tail shampoo and conditioner for a long time.</li>
            <li> I had to wet hands, comb and hair prior to brushing.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any shedding and this is the longest that I have every stretched my relaxers.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years as a leave-in conditioner, because I have very thin, fine hair and this use to make my hair feel a lot thicker.</li>
            <li> Right before i washed it, it was brittle, breaking, thin, and oily.</li>
            <li> but since I don&#x27;t use any other products in my hair currently, I doubt that.</li>
            <li> This has been around for a very long time</li>
            <li> Very strange.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to help prevent dry skin and to prevent my beard from drying out and tangling.  </li>
            <li> But now that it&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s softer than its been in years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve saved my dry damaged hair for this for a week.</li>
            <li> , then i got 2 of my friends to fall in love with it, and finally my very skeptical posh mother succumbed...  </li>
            <li> I am african american with hair just past my shoulders</li>
            <li> However, I will use less next time.</li>
            <li> Im a black woman who started taking my hair seriously back in 2010.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known about this con a long time but was so nervous to try it due to the itty bit of protein listed towards the bottom of the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> When it was drying, it felt weird and coarse, like a horse&#x27;s tail, haha.</li>
            <li> use this in the shower as a detangler -- it helps me comb out some gnarly knots if I wet my hair and apply the conditioner and let it set.  </li>
            <li> I left it on for a few minutes then rinsed.</li>
            <li> My hair had a lot of slip to it when applied to my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I told her that I blow dry and straighten daily and usually color my hair a couple times a year.</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend this product for anyone with very thin, fragile hair.</li>
            <li> Please read my other reviews for my method of use including an olive oil conditioner which I incorporated with this product.  </li>
            <li> i hope it helps my hair grow longer as i have read from other reviewstbat</li>
            <li> So I think the reason it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as well is due to a difference in my hair rather than a difference in the product itself.</li>
            <li> I have tried Aveda, and other Salon conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Unlike gels or curl creams that make hair sticky and hard to comb out, I can apply a generous amount of the conditioner as a leave-in product (to wet, damp or even dry hair) and it doesn&#x27;t get sticky.  </li>
            <li> will see a difference in your hair after a few washes!&lt;br /&gt;Makes the hair thick and silky at the same time.</li>
            <li> &gt; All in all, my experience was less than stellar.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff is so thin I can barely spread it through my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and can be a pain to wash, brush and keep conditioned since it is curly and thick.  </li>
            <li> My hair is managable and it may be just me, but it looks like it has grown a little.</li>
            <li> Just let it sit for a few minutes then rinse and muah</li>
            <li> It may have worked out then, but now, it dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> I used it as a co-wash, and it dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner alone a few times</li>
            <li> am going to use the rest of the bottle because I don&#x27;t want to waste money.</li>
            <li> It made a few strands of hair - I&#x27;d say 10-20, fall out, but that might&#x27;ve been because of the shampoo I was using, Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> i first bought them for myself, it helped me to stop the hair loss after bad perm.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say anything bad about the product.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to use multiple expensive products.</li>
            <li> but I just started again and anxious to see results again.</li>
            <li> if you aren&#x27;t using this product you are missing out on A LOT!</li>
            <li> I notice an immediate negative difference in my hair after using it.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> OMG I cant beleive how thick and shineymy hair was</li>
            <li> I used to use Pantene conditioner, and that made 10-15 strands fall out every time, so it might just be my hair, which is really thick and probably can&#x27;t do without shedding.</li>
            <li> I have very thick voluminous relaxed hair which is past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Tried various very expensive shampoos and products.</li>
            <li> Not good if you have dandruff either.</li>
            <li> I almost got cheated out of trying this horse stuff because of random negative remarks about It</li>
            <li> I am addicted to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am SO disappointed I wasted my money on this conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> When i rinsed it out, i was skeptical.</li>
            <li> It is a bit difficult to rinse out of my dogs coat, so I now mix it with water before bathing time.</li>
            <li> and she was shocked.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> However, I was severely disappointed with the condition that it arrived in.</li>
            <li> very disappointing!</li>
            <li> WORST CONDITIONER EVER</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i love this conditioner. after this first time of using it, i&#x27;ve been buying it ever since. smells great and leaves your hair so soft.</li>
            <li> WORST CONDITIONER EVER&lt;br /&gt;MADE MY HAIR FALL OUT IN CLUMPS AND HAS NO MOISTURIZING PROPERTIES</li>
            <li> overpriced but good product</li>
            <li> My Mom has always used this product on our hair and I am always being complemented on it.</li>
            <li> This is the third item I&#x27;ve purchased months ago from the M-n-T line that I&#x27;m content with. For a 32 oz. bottle that runs between four and six bucks you will get your money&#x27;s worth. I tend use it when my hair is thirsty for some protein. I know it&#x27;s perfect for my hair type since I&#x27;m a bit protein sensitive. I also use it as a leave in for a quick style and go.  I do like the smell and how manageable my hair response to this product.</li>
            <li> I love the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;But amazon is way over priced, You can get both the shampoo and conditioner now at walmart.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this conditioner but the reviews were SO great that I thought it was worth a try. I should have stuck with my gut reaction. This stuff is so thin I can barely spread it through my hair. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair at all. I have shoulder length, thick, curly hair and I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with this product. I have no more shininess, no less frizz, my hair is in the exact same condition as it was using any conditioner I bought in the store. I am SO disappointed I wasted my money on this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It does not make you hair grow faster.  This was not as moisturizing and detangling as I need so I will not be buying it.  If you have hair that is basically healthy and easy to comb this is for you, but if you have hair a bit dry and hard to detangle, this is not the best stuff as it did nothing to detangle my hair.  I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> When you need a soft, silky conditioner to keep your hair looking fabulous, you would probably instinctively reach for a salon brand. But your mane alternative is here, my friends:this product is a true thoroughbred in its minimalist packaging and generous quantity, making it lead the race. No horsing around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the Mane N Tail Set for my frizzy-dry type 3b/c hair.  My hair was very manageable after the first use and incredibly tangle free.  I will definitely recommend this to anyone who asks.  Please read my other reviews for my method of use including an olive oil conditioner which I incorporated with this product.  Cheers.</li>
            <li> I think this products well and lives up to how it is advertised. From my experience, your hair becomes very soft after using it. It also shipped on time for me, so I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about it. Leaves hair tangled.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mane and Tail conditioner for many years, probably at least 10. Whenever I have over-treated my hair with coloring or a heated appliance, nothing works better. I once went into a salon to get a haircut and I mentioned to the stylist that I had not had a cut or even a trim in 6-8 months and she was shocked. She told me that my hair was in excellent condition and asked if I ever blow dry, straighten or color my hair. I told her that I blow dry and straighten daily and usually color my hair a couple times a year. She couldn&#x27;t believe my hair could be in such good condition with all that being done to it. When I first get in the shower, I shampoo my hair and apply the conditioner. I like to use allot and totally saturate my hair (its such a large bottle and so inexpensive so I can use as much as I want)I leave it soaking in my hair the duration of my shower and then I rinse it very well. I then take a small amount and lightly coat my hair, very little on the roots and liberally on the ends and keep it in as a leave-in conditioner. I&#x27;m not saying that it will work for everyone,(quite possibly though)but it sure makes my hair soft, more manageable and healthy. I believe it even makes my hair grow faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sitting under my dryer &amp; reading these great reviews on this product. Idk if the ingredients have been changed, but this product has no slip to me &amp; it did not leave my hair soft. I&#x27;m using this solely for the protein &amp; it does make the hair feel stronger. I recommend using a moisturizing conditioner after this is rinsed out just to balance the protein &amp; moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like another review said, it is a bit difficult to rinse out, so make sure you take your time to rinse it out before you apply your deep moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Helps limit the tangles in my dogs hair (a Lhasa/Terrier cross) that were a problem for both of us.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever to keep hair soft and managable. Just let it sit for a few minutes then rinse and muah</li>
            <li> both shampoo and conditioner are awesome. i first bought them for myself, it helped me to stop the hair loss after bad perm. then i got my sister hooked on it (she has fine greasy hair that looks fantastic now), then i got 2 of my friends to fall in love with it, and finally my very skeptical posh mother succumbed...  dont let the fact that it is cheap scare you. it is a quality product.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;ve always loved MNT products, and recently I&#x27;ve started using it as a leave in.  I have relaxed 4b Af-Am hair that tends to poof.  This product keeps it soft, straight, and frizz free all day.  It is much more affordable and effective than other shampoos and conditioners out there.  I no longer have to use multiple expensive products.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products on the market for men and women ...Thumbs up for Mane N Tail .</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to help prevent dry skin and to prevent my beard from drying out and tangling.  This product does both.  In fact it makes my beard fuller.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair which craves moisture but also loves protein. This provides it with both. I use this once per week as a deep conditioner after my shampoo and it leaves my hair so soft. It also smells so yummy! There&#x27;s protein in this conditioner, but just enough to strengthen the hair over time, so there&#x27;s no need to worry about dryness. The price is great and so is the product.</li>
            <li> This has been around for a very long time and I still use it now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an excellent moisturizing conditioner with protein! That makes it excellent for growth and length retention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has excellent slip and works very well for a wash and go, as a leave in and moisturizing treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this conditioner. It&#x27;s very inexpensive and works very well for a healthy hair routine.</li>
            <li> Awful. I used this once, in tandem with the shampoo, and NEVER will again. It made my hair coarse, brittle and tangly to a degree I never thought possible. I could literally (no, not figuratively, LITERALLY literally) put a brush in my hair and let go and it would stick in place, caught by all the knotting. If you want a product that makes your hair look like it belongs in a Science Channel special on the Neanderthals, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> love this on my hair... great conditioner and detangler</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mane and Tail shampoo and conditioner for a long time. I don&#x27;t know if something in the formula changed but this felt and smelled like one of the cheap conditioners that are found in every store.</li>
            <li> This product does not agree with my hair. I don&#x27;t know if its something to do with my hair or skin type- I have very curly &amp;#34;Halfrican&amp;#34; American hair and combination skin (dunno how it works for the scalp aspect, but I thought I would throw that in there). Every Mane n Tail item just makes my hair feel kinda OK but leaves me with dandruff... Could be something else causing it, but since I don&#x27;t use any other products in my hair currently, I doubt that.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 20 years (I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m old enough to say that, actually...!) and I love it.  I have very thick hair that ranges from fine to coarse and is more straight in the front and curly everywhere else.  My hair is long and can be a pain to wash, brush and keep conditioned since it is curly and thick.  For me, this conditioner is a MUST if I wear my hair naturally curly.  I use this instead of curl creams, gels, leave-in conditioners, etc.  I have tried the spectrum of products for curly hair over the years and spent $$ on some products, but still return to this old favorite that is CHEAP -- less than $10 for 32 oz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in the shower as a detangler -- it helps me comb out some gnarly knots if I wet my hair and apply the conditioner and let it set.  I also use it as a conditioner after I shampoo.  My favorite way to use it is as a leave-in conditioning balm that eliminated fizzing and encourages my hair into soft, ringlet curls.  Unlike gels or curl creams that make hair sticky and hard to comb out, I can apply a generous amount of the conditioner as a leave-in product (to wet, damp or even dry hair) and it doesn&#x27;t get sticky.  It eliminates frizz in my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sure hope that they never stop making this product or change the ingredients -- it is wonderful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  I also use it as a conditioner on my two Labrador Retrievers and it makes their hair so soft and shiny after a shampoo.</li>
            <li> if it can be delivered to China directly, that will be perfect</li>
            <li> I had this problem for several years now- electrifying hair - I couldn&#x27;t even comb them properly- I had to wet hands, comb and hair prior to brushing. Tried various very expensive shampoos and products. Nothing helped. Got this conditioner as a set from amazon, initially used shampoo and didn&#x27;t even pay attention to conditioner. Then one day decided to give it a try. I was so surprised- my battle with my eleceltrifying hair finished finally!</li>
            <li> I Use it on my bouvier, I love the scent</li>
            <li> Not for me. I don&#x27;t get what all the rave is about. I notice an immediate negative difference in my hair after using it.</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo and conditioner before years ago but got away from it(probably to try something else as I am a product junkie). I just recently, about a month ago, started using it again and I must say that it as good as I remember it to be. I am african american with hair just past my shoulders and it makes my hair so soft and full of body. I really can&#x27;t say anything bad about the product. Even the price is great but I would pay anything for a product that works. My hair is managable and it may be just me, but it looks like it has grown a little. I am really into hair care and Mane N Tail is my absolute favorite. Just try it! It works!</li>
            <li> I actually ordered shampoo and everything until recently said shampoo. Yeah I&#x27;m miffed. Still I might as well try the conditioner right? I mainly got this for my beard which had patches of ghost white splitting hairs. However I also have sometimes hay hair for the top. Well this doesn&#x27;t work for either. Not good if you have dandruff either. You can&#x27;t use it. Not for the beard and not for the hair. Even if you use dandruff shampoo and this as conditioner. Still flakey..</li>
            <li> Not a good lid to travel with, but conditioner is great!</li>
            <li> I needed a conditioner because my hair has been so dry from coloring it then with the humidity my hair was a hot frizzy mess. I decided yo give Mane &amp; Tale a try first time i used it was as a leave in conditioner OMG I cant beleive how thick and shineymy hair was i dont even neef to use any styling products i am so impressed i hope it helps my hair grow longer as i have read from other reviewstbat it does I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Who knew this horse shampoo &amp; conditioner would be so wonderful on human hair.  A friend of mine told me about it and I was a bit skeptical.  But I have to admit, my hair is shiny, smooth and beautiful.  I love this stuff, and for the price, you just can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a difference in hair growth, but I like the conditioner and the scent.  I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> I currently relax my hair and I used to use this when I was a kid before I had a relaxer (my hair was between 3c/4a). Omg. It may have worked out then, but now, it dried out my hair. I used it as a co-wash, and it dried out my hair. Thankfully I had some of my old conditioner on hand, which immediately fixed that dryness up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you relax your hair, this may not be the best conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner alone a few times but I noticed it worked better for my hair when I mixed it with my Sillicone Bamboo conditioner/ treatment. It gives my hair more slip and I can tame it better. I&#x27;m a transitioner from relaxed to natural so it is very needed to have a conditioner to give a lot of slip. Will be ordering more soon, I finish this bottle within days.</li>
            <li> This wonderful product used after the Mane N tail shampoo is amamzing:&lt;br /&gt;You will see a difference in your hair after a few washes!&lt;br /&gt;Makes the hair thick and silky at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years as a leave-in conditioner, because I have very thin, fine hair and this use to make my hair feel a lot thicker. However, I began to recently notice that it no longer has the effect on my hair that it use to. So today I decided to check the ingredients on a few new bottles that I have, and I see that it no longer contains a protein, as it once did. I&#x27;m sure this is why it no longer makes my hair feel thicker. Okay, so now I just looked on the Mane &#x27;n Tail website, which showed \\&quot;Hydrolyzed Protein\\&quot; in the ingredients for this exact same product, yet that ingredient is listed nowhere in the ingredients list on the bottle that I have. There is no mention of any kind of protein on the (new) bottles that I have. Very strange. I&#x27;m going to e-mail the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I have contacted the company, and they told me that they have not changed the formula. They have only changed the wording in the ingredients list so that \\&quot;hydrolyzed protein\\&quot; is now worded as \\&quot;hydrolyzed collagen.\\&quot; (I wasn&#x27;t aware that they&#x27;re the same thing). This product does still make my hair feel a lot thicker, when used as a leave-in. So I think the reason it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as well is due to a difference in my hair rather than a difference in the product itself. I do highly recommend this product for anyone with very thin, fragile hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known about this con a long time but was so nervous to try it due to the itty bit of protein listed towards the bottom of the ingredient list. I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try. I used a lot and slathered all over my hair and ends. I immediately noticed the slip, and could easily finger comb my hair. I left it on for a few minutes then rinsed. I loved the slip and feeling of my hair, very smooth.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and was looking for a product that would take care of my hair, the minute I saw this I bought it, because I know Main n Tail is a very good product!!!!</li>
            <li> I found out after recently purchasing this item that I could get it at my local grocery store for about 10 dollars less or a third of the price!.. very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Conditions hair and makes it feel soft and it grows longer.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner~~  Not just for horses.  I actually have never used it on my horse.  My whole family loves this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I have very thick voluminous relaxed hair which is past my shoulders. I normally condition my hair and wet set it on rollers and that&#x27;s what I did with this product.My hair had a lot of slip to it when applied to my wet hair. It smelled very nice. I ran into a problem the next morning when I removed the rollers and tried to style it. Normally when I remove the rollers, my hair is smooth and bouncy but I found my hair to be extremely fly away and snarled. After wearing it all day, it was so tangled that I had to finger detangle  it (instead of using the wide toothed comb)  because there were so many snarls.&lt;br /&gt; All in all, my experience was less than stellar.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to use the rest of the bottle because I don&#x27;t want to waste money.However, I will use less next time. Some of it may be user error. I will come back again and weigh in on this conditioner again later. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Im a black woman who started taking my hair seriously back in 2010. The only thing I would do to my hair after I relaxed was shampoo 1x a week and condition afterward using the M&amp;T shampoo and conditioner and wrap my hair nightly. My hair went from a little below ear length to full neck length in a month and a half! No joke. However I did stray away from thay routine but I just started again and anxious to see results again. Great product for relaxed ladies for sure.</li>
            <li> love the scent and it really does detangle my hair well. I am wondering if the shampoo will work just as well as this did</li>
            <li> I have relaxed bra strap length hair and currently 18 weeks post relaxer. I pre-pooed my hair with this conditioner and added coconut oil and castor oil. I did not experience any shedding and this is the longest that I have every stretched my relaxers. This conditioner detangled my hair with amazement. I recommend this product for all women especially those who are stretching their relaxers.</li>
            <li> Crazy Good! Love the way it feels during treatment and after rinse out - never heavy or oily... if you aren&#x27;t using this product you are missing out on A LOT!</li>
            <li> My Yorkie &amp; I think this is the best and it&#x27;s a size that makes it cheaper to use!</li>
            <li> I only just used this for the first time today - it&#x27;s interesting. It made a few strands of hair - I&#x27;d say 10-20, fall out, but that might&#x27;ve been because of the shampoo I was using, Head and Shoulders. I used to use Pantene conditioner, and that made 10-15 strands fall out every time, so it might just be my hair, which is really thick and probably can&#x27;t do without shedding. When it was drying, it felt weird and coarse, like a horse&#x27;s tail, haha. But now that it&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s softer than its been in years. I can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li> (I use in conjunction with matching shampoo) seems to clean my hair well, smells good, hair feels softer, but my naturally curly hair is so so soooo much more frizzier with this product than any other shampoo/conditioner. I bought this product because it came highly recommended by several people on a community forum as a anti frizz conditioner of sorts. Even if i just use conditioner without shampoo my hair gets very frizzy. Hair itself seems ok and has its curl and feels soft, but against my scalp is horrible; theres no way i can use this without adding product to my hair; and i dont want to add product as it will create more frizz and ruin my hair. I switched to this product to specifically address this issue and it multiplied the issue x10</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner after using the shampoo. It makes my hair feel soft and detangled it as well.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be shiny, wavy, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year ago it turned VERY dry and developed split ends.  Nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of using Mane &amp; Tail my hair is 60 % better.  Think if &amp;#34;you don&#x27;t use it, you lose it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have tried Aveda, and other Salon conditioners.  Even big name advertiser conditioners.  This is the best conditioner that I have ever used.  This conditioner does not burn my scalp.</li>
            <li> **NOTICE: THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE PACKAGING, NOT THE PRODUCT ITSELF!!!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited about trying this product because I heard many great things about it! In fact, I got it in the mail today (along with the shampoo) and I was eager to try it out ASAP. However, I was severely disappointed with the condition that it arrived in. In fact, if I could post a picture here, regarding the condition that it arrived in, I&#x27;m sure you guys won&#x27;t be pleased with it, either! As soon as I return it, I will just be marching up to one of the local drugstores here and buying it in person, in order to save myself from further disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I still am eager to try out the product.</li>
            <li> I just recieved my Mane N Tale today after waiting almost 2 weeks to get it from Amazon which ships only 2 states away because i grouped my items. I&#x27;ve saved my dry damaged hair for this for a week. Right before i washed it, it was brittle, breaking, thin, and oily. I used my regular dandruff shampoo, which dries your hair more, then i applied my Mane N Tale conditioner and left it on for said 2 minutes. When i rinsed it out, i was skeptical. i ran my fingers through my hair and it felt a texture i never did after i washed my hair before. It wasn&#x27;t like super silky and heavy.. It was light and put the texture and volume back in my hair. When i got out, i let my hair air dry &amp; noticed less breakage &amp; my hair was very very soft. I love the insant results. We will see if i continue to get the same results each times i use this product, but for now.. i recommend this!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner - not oily - excellent price - rinsing smooth - helps with detangling</li>
            <li> Mane n Tail Conditioner has always been a favorite of mine.. Now, I haven&#x27;t used that many conditioners, but I must say, this conditioner is like no other one I&#x27;ve ever tried...The consistency of this condish is very light, almost liquidy, and oddly enough, though I tend to lean toward the thicker conditioners (I feel like they actually penetrate better than thin ones), this conditioner seems to completely hydrate my hair! And I have EXTREMELY dry, thin, curly, more or less DAMAGED hair...And if youre someone with dry-curly hair like mine but thicker, then you can also use this as a LEAVE-IN (it tells you on the back of the container it can be used as a leave in)...getting to the point, this stuff is seriously amazing and I&#x27;ve never had ANY problems with it, like my hair feeling like &#x27;straw&#x27; or whatever...but anyways give it a try I promise it wont do any harm to your hair, it can only make it feel better !:D plus its a great price- 2 lbs for 10$ !</li>
            <li> if anyone gives negative remarks about this stuff they are full of it! I love all mane &#x27;n tail products in my hair. It is wonderful! I&#x27;ve been using the hair dressing, conditioner and hoofmaker lotion and my hair has grown an inch in two weeks, is bouncy and extra baby soft. I almost got cheated out of trying this horse stuff because of random negative remarks about It I was getting from people here and there, but this stuff is the cure to all of my hair issues. I am addicted to it.&lt;br /&gt;p.s this stuff arrived a day earlier than it was supposed to which was totally appreciated.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.  It is a bit difficult to rinse out of my dogs coat, so I now mix it with water before bathing time.</li>
