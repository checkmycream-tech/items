            <li> The color was much darker than what I had expected.  </li>
            <li> and before i could even send the hair back to them i recieved an email stating that they would refund me a total of $15.00 after i paid $76.00 and that would be the extent of the refund case closed..</li>
            <li> I received this hair and noticed that it was not packaged as the picture shows it looked like it was half the amount.  </li>
            <li> Bad product,  I´m very dissapointed  about this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already starting to look like dirty barbie doll hair.</li>
            <li> Well lets begin with the remy hair i ordered the remy hair i recieved was spelled (REMI)the hair was a bad knockoff it didnt look or feel like the real deal, it was shorter than the length i ordered and thats because it was fake and stringy, then to make matters worse</li>
            <li> got 14 to 16 inch so thin at the ends</li>
            <li> and this is by far the worst hair I have used.</li>

            <li> ESTE CABELLO MUY BUENO, SOLO UN POCO MUY FINO, EN CUANTO A CALIDAD PASO LA PRUEBA DEL FOSFORO, EL BLOWER EN SECO Y MOJADO.</li>
            <li> I paid almost $90 at a beauty supply place for virtually the same thing.  Bought for my wedding to pump up the volume of my own hair.  Worked very well, the sylist only needed to use 1 of the 3 pieces.  Nice quality, real hair.  This color is a reddish-brown.</li>
            <li> The hair wasn&#x27;t Remy it was Remi BIG difference I asked for 18 inch got 14 to 16 inch so thin at the ends you could read the newspaper through it looked NOTHING like the picture buyer beware!!</li>
            <li> The colour was much lighter than I expected but the quality was excellent. I also received my item before the schedule date, so I did not have to wait at all for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> excelente marca muy bueno sedoso y fácil de manejar lo recomiendo aqui en mi pais son muy costosos  y dificil de conseguir</li>
            <li> Save your money. I have had extensions for years and this is by far the worst hair I have used. There is no way this is human hair. After one wash it matted and I don’t think you can even call it shedding when it comes off in clumps. Save the time, aggravation, and the pain of trying to get the mats out.</li>
            <li> Bad product,  I´m very dissapointed  about this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing! there were wonderful. super quality. soft and gentle like my own hair. can straighten or curl and the texture lasts! will be buying from again in the future! thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent hair but I have had my extensions fir 2.5 weeks and it&#x27;s already starting to look like dirty barbie doll hair. Once I use my heat protectant and lots and lots of conditioner it seems to be ok but it&#x27;s a lot of work.</li>
            <li> Well lets begin with the remy hair i ordered the remy hair i recieved was spelled (REMI)the hair was a bad knockoff it didnt look or feel like the real deal, it was shorter than the length i ordered and thats because it was fake and stringy, then to make matters worse i demanded a refund and before i could even send the hair back to them i recieved an email stating that they would refund me a total of $15.00 after i paid $76.00 and that would be the extent of the refund case closed..what a scam that is</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair about a year and a half ago and have found way better hair since then. It was okay when I first received it but then it started to tangle and mat up within a month, definitely wouldn&#x27;t purchase this hair ever again.</li>
            <li> the product did not meet my expectivas , it seems natural hair and is not packaged properly, these products were purchased for sale, but now can not be sold because of its presentation</li>
            <li> I received this hair and noticed that it was not packaged as the picture shows it looked like it was half the amount.  This hair only lasted about a week or so before it started shedding.  The color was much darker than what I had expected.  For the price they charged could have gotten a lot more hair and the right color.</li>
            <li> the item was shipped in time&lt;br /&gt;and products are as they described on website .shipment was fast on this product</li>
            <li> excellent item.. thnsk for selling. i hope make new shopping soon.. I recive yor note , i like your way to interactive with the clients. good luck.</li>
