            <li>Nice&#x27;n easy.</li>
            <li>I have been using Nice N Easy for years and love the product</li>
            <li>Love the color.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to blend product in well on hairlines and get all my strands and pull it all up toward the top like a bun.  </li>
            <li>I love this color, but I cannot seem to be able to find this color in the stores and have to order it on-line.</li>
            <li>What more can I woman ask for...  :)</li>
            <li>Fantastic conditioner which you wish you could buy a vat of!  </li>
            <li>Makes for more even saturation.  </li>
            <li>This is a more liquid formula...FYI.</li>
            <li>I just LOVE</li>
            <li>They have so many colors to choose from, so I am always changing it up.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased to have been able to buy the hair color I love.  </li>
            <li>love the color.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more.</li>
            <li>And even even more of clairol haircolor.</li>
            <li>I love this color</li>
            <li>Love the conditional that comes with the product.</li>
            <li>easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Now I have to find a dark brown of something else and hope for the best.  </li>
            <li>going to try loreal light amber brown now.</li>
            <li>, it was a lovely shade of red, and I would probably have loved it</li>
            <li>Really pretty color, nice &#x27;n easy always offers a quality product that covers well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I waited the full 25 minutes and rinsed then conditioned.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful color but still prefer my light ash brown color that is hard to get right now</li>
            <li>This color covers grey beautifully &amp; looks terrific.</li>
            <li>The only hair that turned reddish (bright light auburn) was my grey hair.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s delivery of this product was very fast, and everything arrived intact, so that was a plus!--however,</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Caramel, NATURAL light brown should NOT turn hair orange.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>And this is a good brand usually too.</li>
            <li>So please if you want light brown stay away from this color, but if you want red this is it.</li>
            <li>I ordered TWO Boxes, did my whole head of hair.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and got this before time</li>
            <li>I had a deep suspicion why this product wasn&#x27;t available in stores</li>
            <li>This obviously had nice red highlights.</li>
            <li>I wish I have read the reviews before buying, but like many other I have been dying my hair for years and know what I am doing.  </li>
            <li>It is shipped in a decent time</li>
            <li>when I used this particular shade of Clairol, I was expecting to have it turn my hair</li>
            <li>and I love that I can only get it here on Amazon since I can&#x27;t find it at my local Target anymore.</li>
            <li>Luckily my regular color totally covered the &amp;#34;Natural Light Caramel Brown&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>Covers grey perfectly, stays long, very hard to find in store</li>
            <li>Very natural looking color.</li>
            <li>The rest of my hair is the exact same color pictured on the box</li>
            <li>so I am forever trying to guess which color will look most like my former favorite and I failed this time.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how long it last, because I use Wen or a sulfate free shampoo, but I also color every 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>When dry, was light red.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my roots started to show a little bit and thought it was time to color my hair to light brown.  </li>
            <li>This hair color is my favorite color and is hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>no where near the color on the box.</li>
            <li>It came out a VERY redish brownish strange color...especially the new growth that didn&#x27;t have any existing dye on it.</li>
            <li>When I couldn&#x27;t get the Light Brown color I usually use from Amazon...</li>
            <li>It certainly has red in it which if not obvious from the name</li>
            <li>For a red color it lasts pretty long too.</li>
            <li>I just turned 50 years old and have a medium amount of gray hair  in the front only.  </li>
            <li>The red is actually a pretty red, but if I wanted red, I would have bought red.</li>
            <li>, I think is apparent from the picture.  </li>
            <li>If you are a natural redhead, it will have some red tones.</li>
            <li>I have naturally drab, medium brown hair with quite a bit of gray and this turns me into a red head.</li>
            <li>Very strong smell while coloring, so vent and fan, but other then that, same as usual.  </li>
            <li>but I still want to tone down the red a little more.</li>
            <li>and I have known that for years, but nowhere in my history of dying my hair has light caramel brown mean RED!!!!  </li>
            <li>Looks pretty but not a light brown color at all.</li>
            <li>way too red!--I could not believe my eyes!--I have some pictures of just how red it was, because I had to attend a memorial service and monument dedication in a township near us here, in honor of our son, who was killed while serving in Afghanistan, and my photo was taken for the local newspaper--and, having my hair that too-red of a shade was very upsetting to me!--oh</li>
            <li>The only difference was that where I had no grey looked red.</li>

            <li> after 2 weeks, it return to grey.</li>
            <li> My hair looked exactly as grey as it did the day before.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this color to someone that does not have grey hair at all and is just looking for a reddish hue, almost like a semi permanent or henna...</li>
            <li> I am approx 15% grey</li>
            <li> so we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> Comes out as color on package and stay for a long time.</li>
            <li> I will use this all the time as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> and I wanted a lighter brown that covered the grey.  </li>
            <li> I got mixes of orange, mahogany and dark blonde.</li>
            <li> Ash usually turns my hair a red color</li>
            <li> Lastly, I have just past shoulder length hair and used 2 boxes.  </li>
            <li> After a few washes the red isn&#x27;t so harsh</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown</li>
            <li> and I get less sun</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair</li>
            <li> yes RED, and an ugly color of red at that.  </li>
            <li> , it usually lightens up a lot in the summer</li>
            <li> I am handicapped and did not want to drive in the snow to get my usual color.  </li>
            <li> not very good.</li>
            <li> and I found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in the stores here.</li>
            <li> ; when I was younger, and I&#x27;d never met with a disappointment from those Clairol hair color products as I did with this one--I can&#x27;t understand what went wrong, either</li>
            <li> HATE they grey to show!</li>
            <li> My roots (WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN DYED) turned this awful gingery red color!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> But these are dull and boring.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s how bad the color is for me.  </li>
            <li> I hate my hair color, so</li>
            <li> BAD IDEA!  </li>
            <li> This is awful!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> not very good. after 2 weeks, it return to grey.</li>
            <li> When I couldn&#x27;t get the Light Brown color I usually use from Amazon...I thought I&#x27;d try this one.  BAD IDEA!  It came out a VERY redish brownish strange color...especially the new growth that didn&#x27;t have any existing dye on it. I have been coloring my hair by myself for over 30 years, so I know what I&#x27;m doing + I followed the instructions to the letter.  I had to go to town (no easy task since I live in the mountains, which is why I depend on Amazon) and find my regular color.  Luckily my regular color totally covered the &amp;#34;Natural Light Caramel Brown&amp;#34;...there was nothing &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; about that color!</li>
            <li> Love the color.  I get numerous compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I wish I have read the reviews before buying, but like many other I have been dying my hair for years and know what I am doing.  Ash usually turns my hair a red color and I have known that for years, but nowhere in my history of dying my hair has light caramel brown mean RED!!!!  I hate my hair color, so know I am reading the web on the best way to fix this terrible color.  I will not be walking around with this color and waiting for it to grow out, that&#x27;s how bad the color is for me.  So please if you want light brown stay away from this color, but if you want red this is it.</li>
            <li> Clairol ias always is great.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color but still prefer my light ash brown color that is hard to get right now but this is close</li>
            <li> It was a great way to get what I know works for my hair by ordering online. It is shipped in a decent time and I could order two so now I can just use it when I need to. Great!</li>
            <li> I bought this color since my hair gets a lot darker once the weather gets cooler and I get less sun, it usually lightens up a lot in the summer and I keep it blondish red.  I noticed my roots started to show a little bit and thought it was time to color my hair to light brown.  Directions and product VERY easy, put on gloves, twist cap off 2, add in 1.  Save 3 for conditioner, which was very good quality and felt great.  I made sure to blend product in well on hairlines and get all my strands and pull it all up toward the top like a bun.  I noticed after about 5 minutes the color looked very red.  I waited the full 25 minutes and rinsed then conditioned.  My hair was darker but still had a lot of red overtones.  When dry, was light red.  Looks pretty but not a light brown color at all.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s delivery of this product was very fast, and everything arrived intact, so that was a plus!--however, when I used this particular shade of Clairol, I was expecting to have it turn my hair the shade that was shown on the box--instead, my hair came out way, way too red!--I could not believe my eyes!--I have some pictures of just how red it was, because I had to attend a memorial service and monument dedication in a township near us here, in honor of our son, who was killed while serving in Afghanistan, and my photo was taken for the local newspaper--and, having my hair that too-red of a shade was very upsetting to me!--oh, it was a lovely shade of red, and I would probably have loved it IF I&#x27;d wanted my hair to be RED!--but, I&#x27;d hoped for what the box stated it was supposed to be--Caramel Brown!--needless to say, as soon as possible, I used a competitor&#x27;s brand, and changed my hair color!--I used to consider myself a regular &amp;#34;Lady Clairol Junkie&amp;#34; when I was younger, and I&#x27;d never met with a disappointment from those Clairol hair color products as I did with this one--I can&#x27;t understand what went wrong, either--I hadn&#x27;t used any coloring on my hair for a couple of years before I used this one, so I thought everything would turn out great--when it didn&#x27;t, I was non-plussed to the max!</li>
            <li> This color covers grey beautifully &amp; looks terrific. For a red color it lasts pretty long too. If you&#x27;re looking for some red tones, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Really pretty color, nice &#x27;n easy always offers a quality product that covers well and is easy to use. Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> I love this color, but I cannot seem to be able to find this color in the stores and have to order it on-line.</li>
            <li> This hair color is my favorite color and is hard to find in stores.  I color my hair about every 5 - 6 weeks because the grays grow out.  I just turned 50 years old and have a medium amount of gray hair  in the front only.  Great price! Great color! Fast shipping!  What more can I woman ask for...  :)</li>
            <li> My hair looked exactly as grey as it did the day before. The only difference was that where I had no grey looked red. The red is actually a pretty red, but if I wanted red, I would have bought red. The box said specifically that it covers grays for up to 8 weeks or something like that which is why I chose that one and it didn&#x27;t even cover the grays for 8 hours. I would recommend this color to someone that does not have grey hair at all and is just looking for a reddish hue, almost like a semi permanent or henna...going to try loreal light amber brown now.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the color.  It certainly has red in it which if not obvious from the name, I think is apparent from the picture.  Very strong smell while coloring, so vent and fan, but other then that, same as usual.  Fantastic conditioner which you wish you could buy a vat of!  I am approx 15% grey and I just colored so we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.  I use a coconut cowash (so no color stripping sulfates).  I have curly hair and have been coloring forever.  I did use a separate porosity spray before coloring.  Makes for more even saturation.  Will buy again!  Lastly, I have just past shoulder length hair and used 2 boxes.  This is a more liquid formula...FYI.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about how it was too reddish and decided to try it anyway. The only hair that turned reddish (bright light auburn) was my grey hair. The rest of my hair is the exact same color pictured on the box and it is gorgeous! It highlighted just like it stated. Overall I am satisfied. After a few washes the red isn&#x27;t so harsh but I still want to tone down the red a little more.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE Nice&#x27;n easy. My hair always has a nice tone and highlights.  They have so many colors to choose from, so I am always changing it up. This obviously had nice red highlights. It has great gray coverage as well. I can&#x27;t say how long it last, because I use Wen or a sulfate free shampoo, but I also color every 3-4 weeks. HATE they grey to show!</li>
            <li> This is awful! I ordered TWO Boxes, did my whole head of hair. My roots (WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN DYED) turned this awful gingery red color! Caramel, NATURAL light brown should NOT turn hair orange. This is the worst product. If I wanted orange hair I would&#x27;ve bought the orange hair dye.</li>
            <li> Not brown ... yes RED, and an ugly color of red at that.  All my 1&amp;#34; 1/2&amp;#34; of roots are red.  I am handicapped and did not want to drive in the snow to get my usual color.  Now I have to looking like a Lucy Zebra.</li>
            <li> Comes out as color on package and stay for a long time.I will use this all the time as long as I can get it. Fast shipping and got this before time</li>
            <li> I had a deep suspicion why this product wasn&#x27;t available in stores and I found out the hard way. Basically, my hair came no where near the color on the box. I got mixes of orange, mahogany and dark blonde. Needless to say, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased to have been able to buy the hair color I love.  It is hard to find in the stores here. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t find my hair color in the stores around me. love that i found it here! love the color. easy to apply.</li>
            <li> nice..but getting too red and dark..not the same color</li>
            <li> Very natural looking color. If you are a natural redhead, it will have some red tones. It is a very nice color. This product comes in set of three boxes. I have very thick and long hair so I need to use 2 boxes.</li>
            <li> Will purchase more. And even even more of clairol haircolor. Covers grey perfectly, stays long, very hard to find in store</li>
            <li> I have been using Nice N Easy for years and love the product but they keep changing the names and colors so I am forever trying to guess which color will look most like my former favorite and I failed this time.  This has way too much red for me.  I have naturally drab, medium brown hair with quite a bit of gray and this turns me into a red head.</li>
            <li> I love this color and I love that I can only get it here on Amazon since I can&#x27;t find it at my local Target anymore. I signed up for the subscription and I get it at my door monthly which works out great and I get a good deal on it! Win Win!!!</li>
            <li> This product \\&quot;Nice &amp; Easy\\&quot; is offered at a great price.  As the name tells Clairol - It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I never know what number of stars to give, when a product isn&#x27;t good but the seller is. The three stars are for this product. It used to be the most delicious caramel. cinnamon/auburn combination of colors. And this is a good brand usually too. They discontinued the &amp;#34;Caramel&amp;#34; colors, and must have had enough complaints to bring them back. But these are dull and boring. I thought maybe the colors were just off in the photo. Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was good to work with though. Thanks!</li>
            <li> WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE DELIVERY TIME  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Love the conditional that comes with the product.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown and I wanted a lighter brown that covered the grey.  I got RED!  Now I have to find a dark brown of something else and hope for the best.  My hair is NOT naturally red.  The color on the box does NOT show the actual results.  BEWARE!!!</li>
