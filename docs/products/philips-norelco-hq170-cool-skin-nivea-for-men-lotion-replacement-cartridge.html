            <li>I have a Philips Norelco Razor since many years and always bought the cartridges from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The bottle will allow for many refills of the cartridge.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>found a better solution: Since Nivea makes the lotion that goes into the Norelco cartridges, just buy the Nivea 16.9 fl.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly, and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Give a nice clean &amp; close shave.  </li>
            <li>nothin worked the charge light would not come on no matter how many times i tried .</li>
            <li>it never dissapoints me, makes my skin feel smooth as I shave.</li>
            <li>Allows for a smooth, irritation free shave.</li>
            <li>the charge light would not come on</li>
            <li>i went to use the razor &amp; the charge light</li>
            <li>This as a great deal and well worth it, they shipped super fast with the super saver shipping.</li>
            <li>When I found them on amazon, and saw they had a recurring purchase option with free shipping man did I sign up quick.</li>
            <li>i perfore the lotion for clean close shave</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco Cool Skin Nivea Mens Lotion in my Norelco razors for years.   </li>
            <li>I have two Cool Skin Razors, that I order this lotion for.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this stuff for his Norelco Cool Skin shaver.  </li>
            <li>Great product, as is other Nivea products.</li>
            <li>Could not believe how quickly the order was received.  </li>
            <li>Easy &amp; fast transaction.</li>
            <li>You are better off buying one bottle  of &amp;#34;Philips Norelco HS8000 Nivea for Men Shaving Conditioner Refill Pack &amp;#34;, which is available for the next Generation of Norelco razors.  </li>
            <li>With new heads and a fresh supply of Cool Skin Nivea I can now enjoy shaving again....</li>
            <li>My razor is pretty old, but I love the shave it gives.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a brand new razor and the delivery of the Nivea makes the shave so smooth.</li>
            <li>Easy to install and no mess.  </li>
            <li>It leave your skin soft and makes the razor flow so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time purchased from this site.  </li>
            <li>And his skin is so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>a very necessary part of shaving with the cool skin shaver, and now getting scarce because Norelco and Nivea no longer make this stuff!</li>
            <li>Thanks for being there for me when I needed you.</li>
            <li>I gave it as a gift along with a Norelco razor and it was very well received.  </li>
            <li>so i put the razor back in the charger &amp; the light came on</li>
            <li>I did not know how much I was going to like it till I used it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Now I get a delivery every few months with the option of postponing a shipment without any kind penalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensative skin, but my face feels much better than the other razors that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I ordered the cartridges with new blades for my older Norelco Razor.</li>
            <li>Smooth Sensation Body Lotion (for less than $10)</li>
            <li>I got used to the pain of shaving with my old Norelco razor.  </li>
            <li>Just &amp;#34;mimic&amp;#34; the action of the (.4 fl oz.) cartridge which released a small amount of lotion out of a tiny hole in the top of the Norelco (Coolskin) 7775X razor.  </li>
            <li>I have being using this product for quite some time now and love it, it work well for the shaver that i use, however i notice the price has gone through the roof recently, and wonder why, it use to be $5-7 per five pack cartridge, now it&#x27;s $37.00 ridiculous.</li>

            <li> You can pump the liquid from the bottle into an empty cartridge and then use that as before in your razor.  </li>
            <li> but it was really messy since you can&#x27;t squeeze a cylinder of lotion into what&#x27;s essentially a &amp;#34;sucked dry&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If you still have a few cartridges don&#x27;t through them away but keep them for being refilled...</li>
            <li> Round off 16.9 oz.</li>
            <li> These replacement cartridges are extremely difficult to find in stores in my area and can only be purchased online.</li>
            <li> Now that Philips discontinued this product, some people in France and Japan try to sell their remaining stock for ridiculous prices.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these Nivea cartridges are almost impossible to find in stores in my area these days.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m currently using in Colombia .. excellent product .. I recommend .....I do not irritate the skin .. I am very happy ..</li>
            <li> This Norelco razor is the best I have ever used, and I have had many during my 60+ years.  The HQ170 Cool Skin Nivea for Men Lotion is the greatest to be used with this razor.

            <li> This is the first time purchased from this site.  Could not believe how quickly the order was received.  Very impressed.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product locally, the stores quit stocking it. I turned to Amazon.com and they came through.  The product came quickly, and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> just ran out of lotion and couldn&#x27;t find any locally and than tried you guys and you came through. Thanks for being there for me when I needed you.</li>
            <li> this poroduct/lotion is great on my skin. it never dissapoints me, makes my skin feel smooth as I shave. thank God for Amazon which is where buy it from.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Allows for a smooth, irritation free shave. I have used this lotion for years. I have watched as they have stopped producing the shavers that use this lotion; is the lotion next? I hope not! It&#x27;s a winner. You can seemingly only find this lotion on line. Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
            <li> This Nivea lotion is excellent.  I gave it as a gift along with a Norelco razor and it was very well received.  I&#x27;m told this lotion is great for soothing skin.  Wonderful for preventing razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have two Cool Skin Razors, that I order this lotion for. I have very sensative skin, but my face feels much better than the other razors that I have tried.</li>
            <li> When i received the razor i press the start button and the razor started &amp; ran for a couple of seconds so i put it in the charger the charge light would not come on so i tried another circut &amp; it still didnt come on so i thought i would leave it on ,The next morning i tryed to turn it on &amp; nothing worked so i put the razor back in the charger &amp; the light came on so i left it in the charger all day when i came home i went to use the razor &amp; the charge light was off so i thought the razor was charged but when i pushed the start button nothing happened so i put therazor back in the charger but nothin worked the charge light would not come on no matter how many times i tried . I will be returning this product</li>
            <li> I have used this for yearswith Norelco electic razor Ihave.  I order because I can no longer find it locally I guess the don&#x27;t produce it any loner.</li>
            <li> Works really nicely with the compatible Norelco razor.  Wish the cartridges would last longer, but fairly low volume.  One cartridge will last about 5 shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had the hardest time finding these in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very light beard, and even in my 50&#x27;s now I don&#x27;t have to shave every day. One package of these Nivea cartridges could last me months. I would constantly run out, and then spend weeks or months trying to find them in a store. When I found them on amazon, and saw they had a recurring purchase option with free shipping man did I sign up quick. Now I get a delivery every few months with the option of postponing a shipment without any kind penalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that they ship for free is a really nice deal. Nothing deters me from shopping online like shipping costs running from 50% to 100% of the cost of the item purchased.</li>
            <li> a very necessary part of shaving with the cool skin shaver, and now getting scarce because Norelco and Nivea no longer make this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for probably seven years, maybe closer to 10. I have a tough beard and sensitive skin, so using a regular electric razor is not satisfactory for me. Unfortunately, these Nivea cartridges are almost impossible to find in stores in my area these days. I&#x27;m so glad that I could find them  on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I need this or you cannot use this razor like one without this cream. It does feel good when you use it.</li>
            <li> I have being using this product for quite some time now and love it, it work well for the shaver that i use, however i notice the price has gone through the roof recently, and wonder why, it use to be $5-7 per five pack cartridge, now it&#x27;s $37.00 ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I have a Philips Norelco Razor since many years and always bought the cartridges from Amazon. Now that Philips discontinued this product, some people in France and Japan try to sell their remaining stock for ridiculous prices.  You are better off buying one bottle  of &amp;#34;Philips Norelco HS8000 Nivea for Men Shaving Conditioner Refill Pack &amp;#34;, which is available for the next Generation of Norelco razors.  You can pump the liquid from the bottle into an empty cartridge and then use that as before in your razor.  The bottle will allow for many refills of the cartridge.  If you still have a few cartridges don&#x27;t through them away but keep them for being refilled...</li>
            <li> I choose it because I have the correct razor that its for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job and was in good condition. So there was no dislike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considered for anyone with the correct norelco shaving matching.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this in his shaver and loves it! He doesn&#x27;t have to use anything else to shave when he uses this. He likes the way it feels on his skin and the nice shave he gets.</li>
            <li> I did not know how much I was going to like it till I used it. very happy. I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> My razor is pretty old, but I love the shave it gives. Your price and service was excellent. Hopefully you will have this item in the future for me to order. Thanks</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff for his Norelco Cool Skin shaver.  And his skin is so smooth and soft, I love it too!  :)</li>
            <li> best shave when using the lotion i have been shaving with this or without  i perfore the lotion for clean close shave</li>
            <li> Agree w/others who asked what happened to paying $5/pkg but now $37/pkg.?? (see 6/13 review)  Today, 4/15/16, it&#x27;s  $45/pkg. + S/H!  Another reviewer commented you can buy Norelco Cream bottles and refill the used cartridges.  I tried this but it was really messy since you can&#x27;t squeeze a cylinder of lotion into what&#x27;s essentially a &amp;#34;sucked dry&amp;#34; foil shaving cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a better solution: Since Nivea makes the lotion that goes into the Norelco cartridges, just buy the Nivea 16.9 fl. oz. Smooth Sensation Body Lotion (for less than $10) and it lasts forever!  Just &amp;#34;mimic&amp;#34; the action of the (.4 fl oz.) cartridge which released a small amount of lotion out of a tiny hole in the top of the Norelco (Coolskin) 7775X razor.  Works like a charm for a fraction of the price (5 pack of cartridges x .4 &#x3D; 2 oz., now $50 SH inc., that&#x27;s $25/oz.!)  Round off 16.9 oz. to 17oz. for $10; that&#x27;s $0.59 per oz.!!!</li>
