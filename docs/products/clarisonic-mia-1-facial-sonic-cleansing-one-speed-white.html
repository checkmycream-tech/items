            <li>This is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The lady was nice, but told me no.  </li>
            <li>Best of the sonic cleaner tools on the market to REALLY get all the dirt and make up removed in one wash.</li>
            <li>very good cleaning product gentle on the face cannot over scrub cuts off on its own</li>
            <li>More gentle than I thought it would be, which is probably for the best.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product cleans better than a face towel</li>
            <li>I bought it for a friend, she seems pleased</li>
            <li>If I use more twice a day as directed my face feels tender</li>
            <li>In the evening I use the head that is Aqua/white color to thoeoughly remove makeup, thereby, allowing your skin products to absorb so much better.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The Mia is okay.  </li>
            <li>Really love how the Clarisonic has made my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li>Her skin looks a million times better.</li>
            <li>Love this tool.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Love the tool.</li>
            <li>So much quality and does great job.</li>
            <li>Love it &amp; my husband is using it now too</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on smoother and more uniformly.  </li>
            <li>It does a very effective and gentle exfoliating and cleaning of the skin.</li>
            <li>This compact, easy to use cleansing system does a fabulous job of cleaning my face!  </li>
            <li>Worth trying and keeping up with, for sure!</li>
            <li>it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your clean face!</li>
            <li>Mine is three years old and still working great.</li>
            <li>, my moisturizer seems to sink in better rather than sit on top, and a light (light but still noticeable to me) fading of hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li>I loved this so much I even bought one for my 13-year-old daughter who has severe acne -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results and feel good putting one less layer of product on my skin- or rolling around in my cabinet.</li>
            <li>EASY TO TRAVEL WITH</li>
            <li>and I can happily say I am enjoying the overall experience, but I do agree with others that you have to be continuous with your use.</li>
            <li>Overall, my skin has greatly improved.  </li>
            <li>This makes skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>I would never normally make this purchase, but I did because I saw 10 people with beautiful skin who swore by it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>TO KEEP SKIN FRESH AND CLEAN!</li>
            <li>Blemishes have reduced significantly and I will continue to use my Clarisonic, hoping to see the ongoing benefits.</li>
            <li>(I thought) before using this system but the Clarisonic significantly out performs a manual cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am able to use this with the cleanser of my choice 2x day.  </li>
            <li>feels more sensitive.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>At 39 and throwing everything I have at a natural whole food and whole healing life, this lady still wants a darn good exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I definitely see a huge difference in my skin (even w/ fine lines and wrinkles) after using the Claraisonic Mia.  </li>
            <li>was overly excited to use my new device once purchasing it, after I had saved money to afford one.</li>
            <li>It feels so much cleaner and smoother now!</li>
            <li>From the first use I can feel softer skin</li>
            <li>There was one review that commented she must be the only person who wasn&#x27;t in love with this product.</li>
            <li>First one lasted about 3-4 years.</li>
            <li>This little gadget helps provide you with a consistent, gentle, refreshing wash that is adequate in both cleaning the skin and mild exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>I experience fewer, less intense breakouts and my makeup goes on much more smoothly.  </li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks of using this i started getting complements left and right about how smooth my face looked.</li>
            <li>I use my own face cleanser, but other than that I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li>I never was sure how to dry the brush.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and oily skin</li>
            <li>Makes washing my face at night so much easier since I just have to add the soap and press the button.  </li>
            <li>I no longer require eye makeup remover because the brush is so gentle that I can run it over my eyelids and lashes to remove eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t recommend this product and won&#x27;t buy another Clarisonic again.</li>
            <li>The Mia 2 offers two speed settings but do you really need a deep exfoliation more than once a day?</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing much.</li>
            <li>Well, really a skin changer.</li>
            <li>Using this brush makes your skin so smooth and pores much smaller.</li>
            <li>I may start to reduce the usage to using it once a day at nighttime instead of twice because I have noticed my skin becoming dry.</li>
            <li>CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS!  </li>
            <li>I have been started using it now for more than a year and a half.  </li>
            <li>One of the main reasons I wanted to put the effort into trying the Clarisonic is for the sake of my skin.</li>
            <li>&gt;  Many facial scrubs, lotions and facial cleansing routines have benefited me</li>
            <li>I stored it safely under the bathroom sink and recently charged it back up.  </li>
            <li>I called the same team back and was told that info was not correct information and the product now has been improved with a better battery.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend anyone get this.</li>
            <li>The cleanser it comes with is okay; a little drying.</li>
            <li>the brush head clean, I wash it after every use with antibacterial soap, and allow it to air dry</li>
            <li>I just make sure I wash my face with my fingers for a long enough time to thoroughly cleanse.</li>
            <li>but I always like to try new possibilities and products that have been introduced onto the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was told to be consistent with the use of the product because the final outcome will be promising.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All the results I heard were positive thoughts towards the Clarisonic and how their overall outcome was.</li>
            <li>Customer service is okay- they will at least send me a new one each time</li>
            <li>Instead of more products (natural or not), I just have this simple little tool.</li>
            <li>One (for Sensitive Skin)</li>
            <li>I do not even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and my aesthetician highly recommended the Clarisonic to maintain my skin after receiving facial peel treatments.</li>
            <li>They offered $25 off a new product but this experience has been quite enough for me.</li>
            <li>But after the fourth time of going through the hassle of sending it back, talking with customer service, and etc, I finally asked if they could upgrade me since I know exactly what is going to happen</li>
            <li>Buy it, trust me, no regrets.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty poor compared to other battery-operated personal care products I&#x27;ve had that have lasted ten or more years.</li>
            <li>once you start using the product you may notice a fast deduction in your appearance due to the fact the Clarisonic brings out the dirt which is deep within your face.</li>
            <li>The brush head is pretty stiff, so I had to replace it with a softer head.</li>

            <li> The brush head is pretty stiff, so I had to replace it with a softer head.</li>
            <li> The sensitive brush is EXTREMELY abrasive.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run as long as the regular Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have just spent the money and got the larger one.</li>
            <li> I no longer have any flakes from dry skin (even in this winter weather) and my face is &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> The other part is I have a very, very tiny bathroom and no where to put the Clarisonic out of sight while it dried.</li>
            <li> My complexion is very unpredictable seeming as its dry in some areas but also oily in others.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I have rather thin, semi sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It always felt a little damp</li>
            <li> and I will just be talking with them in a few months.  </li>
            <li> And like the other reviewer, I do not have anything negative to say; it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Small, compact, portable.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, you wash your face too hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s next to impossible to change the rechargeable batteries despite what the Youtube videos show.  </li>
            <li> of make up and pollution from the day, I have seen dramatic changes in my skin in under 30 days.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Buyer beware - the battery charge on this product is bad.  </li>
            <li> Stopped working after 5 months :(</li>
            <li> Like the Clarisonic, hated the accompanying cleanser which resulted in an alergic reaction.</li>
            <li> This was the worst product I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic is horrible to deal with.</li>
    </ol>

I no longer require eye makeup remover because the brush is so gentle that I can run it over my eyelids and lashes to remove eye makeup.  Overall, my skin has greatly improved.  I experience fewer, less intense breakouts and my makeup goes on much more smoothly.  I waited two years before finally investing but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product does NOT last.  I have gone through FOUR Clarisonic Mia&#x27;s in 13 months.  My $6.00 Walgreens automatic toothbrush has lasted longer than my $100 Mia(s).  Customer service is okay- they will at least send me a new one each time it just quits working.  But after the fourth time of going through the hassle of sending it back, talking with customer service, and etc, I finally asked if they could upgrade me since I know exactly what is going to happen and I will just be talking with them in a few months.  The lady was nice, but told me no.  I really can&#x27;t recommend this product and won&#x27;t buy another Clarisonic again.</li>
            <li> very good cleaning product gentle on the face cannot over scrub cuts off on its own I recommend this product cleans better than a face towel</li>
            <li> Item was given as a gift and the recipient was very pleased.</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing ever since I started using the Mia!  Getting tons of compliments on my beautiful skin.  It feels so much cleaner and smoother now!</li>
            <li> I bought it for a friend, she seems pleased</li>
            <li> CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS!  EASY TO TRAVEL WITH AND A MUST TO KEEP SKIN FRESH AND CLEAN!</li>
            <li> I bought this about two years ago and got 1 1/2 years use out of it.  It stopped holding the battery charge and then wouldn&#x27;t re-charge at all.  It&#x27;s next to impossible to change the rechargeable batteries despite what the Youtube videos show.  What a disappointment.  I&#x27;m not buying another one (from Clarisonic).  This product is pretty poor compared to other battery-operated personal care products I&#x27;ve had that have lasted ten or more years.</li>
            <li> From the first use I can feel softer skin</li>
            <li> A friend recommended the Mia and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> At 39 and throwing everything I have at a natural whole food and whole healing life, this lady still wants a darn good exfoliation. I love my Mia! Instead of more products (natural or not), I just have this simple little tool. I have rather thin, semi sensitive skin. Using it only once a day, in the evening to remove all traces (all!) of make up and pollution from the day, I have seen dramatic changes in my skin in under 30 days. Smaller pores, brighter glow, my moisturizer seems to sink in better rather than sit on top, and a light (light but still noticeable to me) fading of hyper pigmentation. If I use more twice a day as directed my face feels tender so I don&#x27;t . The Mia 2 offers two speed settings but do you really need a deep exfoliation more than once a day? I&#x27;m happy with the results and feel good putting one less layer of product on my skin- or rolling around in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> This is for my granddaughter, who is 14.  I have two. One (for Sensitive Skin) I use in the morning. In the evening I use the head that is Aqua/white color to thoeoughly remove makeup, thereby, allowing your skin products to absorb so much better.</li>
            <li> feels good.  don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing much.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and my aesthetician highly recommended the Clarisonic to maintain my skin after receiving facial peel treatments. There was one review that commented she must be the only person who wasn&#x27;t in love with this product. Well, now there are two. And like the other reviewer, I do not have anything negative to say; it just wasn&#x27;t for me. Using the Clarisonic did make my skin softer and I did notice it was brighter. So what did I not like? 1. The noise of the batteries.  And, 2. I never was sure how to dry the brush. It always felt a little damp and I just didn&#x27;t care for the feeling that the brush head had sat out all day in a damp state. The other part is I have a very, very tiny bathroom and no where to put the Clarisonic out of sight while it dried. I didn&#x27;t like leaving it out on the sink. So if you have concerns like mine, this product won&#x27;t be for you either. I just make sure I wash my face with my fingers for a long enough time to thoroughly cleanse. If these concerns aren&#x27;t bothersome to you, then this product is great and you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Best of the sonic cleaner tools on the market to REALLY get all the dirt and make up removed in one wash. Mine is three years old and still working great.</li>
            <li> This makes skin feel so smooth. Recommending to everyone.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 5 months :( otherwise very good)</li>
            <li> This was the worst product I have ever purchased. Clarisonic is horrible to deal with. The mia damaged my forehead. It took chunks off of my face. I do not even have sensitive skin. I used it twice and it was the biggest mistake i&#x27;ve ever made. It has been months ans while the wound has healed my skin feels more sensitive. It hurts to wash my face or itch. I notice the damaged skin in the mirror. The sensitive brush is EXTREMELY abrasive. you wouldn&#x27;t use sandpaper on your face, so why use this? It is no miracle worker.</li>
            <li> This is great for cleansing and for acne control. Love it</li>
            <li> The Mia is okay.  It doesn&#x27;t run as long as the regular Clarisonic.  You have to keep restarting it.  I wish I would have just spent the money and got the larger one.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! I would never normally make this purchase, but I did because I saw 10 people with beautiful skin who swore by it. I definitely see a huge difference in my skin (even w/ fine lines and wrinkles) after using the Claraisonic Mia.  I use my own face cleanser, but other than that I&#x27;m a fan! Worth trying and keeping up with, for sure!</li>
            <li> Really love how the Clarisonic has made my skin look and feel. I have large pores and oily skin and I feel it&#x27;s made my pores appear smaller and definitely reduces blackheads. I loved this so much I even bought one for my 13-year-old daughter who has severe acne - but I got her the acne formula and acne brush. Her skin looks a million times better.</li>
            <li> Love this tool. I already see a difference in my skin texture and pore size in just a couple days. I highly recommend anyone get this.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean and smooth after using it. Love the product. Small, compact, portable. Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Love mia !!!!I used to break out regularly and I heard good things about it  so I decided to give it a try.  I did notice that I don&#x27;t break out regularly anymore.  And my skin is softer and smoother.  I have been started using it now for more than a year and a half.  I would recommend to people who are suffering from acne oily skin Break out !&#x27;!</li>
            <li> Feels good and makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li> arrived as indicated. Love the tool. Great vendor</li>
            <li> Great for exfoliating skin</li>
            <li> Great way to cleanse at the end of the day. The brush head is pretty stiff, so I had to replace it with a softer head. The cleanser it comes with is okay; a little drying.</li>
            <li> I wish I had purchased this sooner.  It does a very effective and gentle exfoliating and cleaning of the skin.</li>
            <li> A life changer. Well, really a skin changer. My face instantly felt smoother and my skin glows!</li>
            <li> Like the Clarisonic, hated the accompanying cleanser which resulted in an alergic reaction. Ingredients may have been listed somewhere, but not on the cleanser itself.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  So much quality and does great job. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I bought the &#x27;Clarisonic Mia&#x27; facial cleansing product just over three weeks ago. One of the main reasons I wanted to put the effort into trying the Clarisonic is for the sake of my skin. I moved to a different environment and I feel the humidity and dryness throughout the seasons has been affecting my skin making it prone to breaking out. My complexion is very unpredictable seeming as its dry in some areas but also oily in others.&lt;br /&gt;  Many facial scrubs, lotions and facial cleansing routines have benefited me but I always like to try new possibilities and products that have been introduced onto the market.&lt;br /&gt; I had seen this product being sold in places I shopped and I had discussions with the locations which sold it and my friends and relatives that had bought it. All the results I heard were positive thoughts towards the Clarisonic and how their overall outcome was. I did happen to hear that once you start using the product you may notice a fast deduction in your appearance due to the fact the Clarisonic brings out the dirt which is deep within your face. I was told to be consistent with the use of the product because the final outcome will be promising.&lt;br /&gt;I was overly excited to use my new device once purchasing it, after I had saved money to afford one. Now I am on week three of the trail and I can happily say I am enjoying the overall experience, but I do agree with others that you have to be continuous with your use. I may start to reduce the usage to using it once a day at nighttime instead of twice because I have noticed my skin becoming dry. I would pick to continue the night use because you gain an incredible feeling and freshness before hitting the sheets to sleep. It truly cleanses the skin deep. My skin has already become noticeably smoother, brighter and I believe it is well nourished. Blemishes have reduced significantly and I will continue to use my Clarisonic, hoping to see the ongoing benefits.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected. Works great!</li>
            <li> On my second one. First one lasted about 3-4 years. Love it!</li>
            <li> If you are like me, you wash your face too hard. This little gadget helps provide you with a consistent, gentle, refreshing wash that is adequate in both cleaning the skin and mild exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Keep the brush head clean, I wash it after every use with antibacterial soap, and allow it to air dry or else it will stay damp all the time and get funky.&lt;br /&gt;Charge it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your clean face!</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks of using this i started getting complements left and right about how smooth my face looked. I began to feel a difference after about the 5th time i used it, i use it twice a day morning and night, it takes of all the dirt that u did&#x27;nt even know was there, i had no breakout whatsoever. Buy it, trust me, no regrets.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware - the battery charge on this product is bad.  I only used the product for a couple weeks and then my dermatologist instructed me to hold off for a while.  I stored it safely under the bathroom sink and recently charged it back up.  It will not hold the charge now. I called Clarisonic warranty customer service and was told that the proper maintenance is to charge it every 3 months of use.  I then checked their website and that detail is not there.  I called the same team back and was told that info was not correct information and the product now has been improved with a better battery.  I was not given a replacement since it is no longer under warranty period but it seems to me that the battery had issues to begin with. They offered $25 off a new product but this experience has been quite enough for me.</li>
            <li> Love it &amp; my husband is using it now too and he loves it as well!!</li>
            <li> THE BEST brush ever. I wish I had had this back in my teenage years! I went a week without it when I had my wisdom teeth removed because my jaw was so sore and I could tell a difference in my skin. Using this brush makes your skin so smooth and pores much smaller.</li>
            <li> This compact, easy to use cleansing system does a fabulous job of cleaning my face!  I no longer have any flakes from dry skin (even in this winter weather) and my face is &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;.  My makeup goes on smoother and more uniformly.  I scrubbed my face well (I thought) before using this system but the Clarisonic significantly out performs a manual cleansing.  Love it!</li>
