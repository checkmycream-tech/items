            <li>What dabs you get out actually smell good.</li>
            <li>am still glad I got this because there is 2 that my dad really likes</li>
            <li>By mistake I ordered the mini set, I did not read well and thought it was the set of full size</li>
            <li>the product is good, the mistake was mine, but these models will serve you only for decoration because they end up in a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>It is manly and not too sweet.  </li>
            <li>The scents were amazing, but the size was a lot smaller than I thought.  </li>
            <li>I bought this set without ever smelling them just for fun.  </li>
            <li>but it clearly my fault but i was able to use as part of a stocking stuff.thanks</li>
            <li>so that is my fault for not reading right.</li>
            <li>is better than only &amp;#34;.&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>It is better to buy a perfume 3.4 oz about the same price.</li>
            <li>small size and not in a good scent smell.</li>
            <li>The variety is nice, but the set is super small!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really read as I should have.  </li>
            <li>So very mini it looks like a sample.</li>
            <li>Very mis-leading description, never purchase again.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>

            <li>I bought this set for my husband and he really loves the smell.</li>
            <li>Its very confuse when you writte .17</li>
            <li>Each scent is different and unique.</li>
            <li>like theses due to the lack of fragrance you would be better off buying the larger cigar bottles to get the true fragrance.</li>
            <li>They definitely have their own scent profile and as expected there is a tobacco scent.  </li>
            <li>Super last minute gift for the husband from the kids.</li>

            <li>They are just big enough for you to test out to see which Cuba smell you would like to purchase in full volume.</li>
            <li>The only reason why they got 3 stars is because I got it delivered so fast</li>
            <li>These containers are only 3\\&quot; high.</li>
            <li>One of the scents I can&#x27;t stand, but the other ones are pleasing and unusual.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this set without ever smelling them just for fun.  One of the scents I can&#x27;t stand, but the other ones are pleasing and unusual.  They definitely have their own scent profile and as expected there is a tobacco scent.  (Unburnt tobacco, of course.  Could you imagine a scent that smelled like cigarette smoke?).</li>
            <li> Great stuff and has the hint of cigars</li>
            <li> I thought this would have been bigger but it clearly my fault but i was able to use as part of a stocking stuff.thanks</li>
            <li> The scents were amazing, but the size was a lot smaller than I thought.  They are about the size of a toothpick.</li>
            <li> i bought this thinking it was ganna be an ok size . i gave all my colognes away thinkin ima have more and better cologne ...... they are small!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> lack enough description, mislead buyer, NOT Cigar, don&#x27;t let me return from amazon.</li>
            <li> Cute if you collect the cigar colongnes, But Not favorible in the scent department.I did&#x27;nt like theses due to the lack of fragrance you would be better off buying the larger cigar bottles to get the true fragrance.</li>
            <li> I need a bigger bottle of gold</li>
            <li> Son unas simples muestras.</li>
            <li> I rate!! Because you used .7, so I can&#x27;t see only &amp;#34;.&amp;#34; and I thought &amp;#34;0.7&amp;#34; is better than only &amp;#34;.&amp;#34; . Your price isn&#x27;t so god for this piece. I already bought at box normal for this price.</li>
            <li> Same as other buyers, I thought these were regular size as I had before, this ones looks like testers, extremaly small, even it was my fault ordering without making sure about the size, still feel disappointed. I suggest vendors to include not only the size in ounces but also in inches. These containers are only 3\\&quot; high.</li>
            <li> Smells good....and travels well.</li>
            <li> They are small!!! For the price is crap! I did not see the Mini description before buying them. I will still give them as a gift but I am so disappointed. The only reason why they got 3 stars is because I got it delivered so fast and they do smell good but now I have to go and find something else to give with this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and absolutely love it. All of the Cuban Cigar fragrances are purely delicious. They don&#x27;t smell cheap. I wont wear anything else.</li>
            <li> I am quite the aficionado when it comes to parfums and colognes. All four of these samples smell great, but the blue one is what we liked best. We even ordered the 3.3 oz of the blue and gold. They are very, very nice smells.</li>
            <li> very nice and very fast shipping great price yet smaller than i expected</li>
            <li> This does not smell anything like the one I bought from the store and it was extremely small I&#x27;m not at all satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> it is not worth buying because I expected something but i got something! small size and not in a good scent smell.</li>
            <li> INFORMATION TO DESCRIBE THIS ITEM WAS NOT DETAILED ENOUGH.  IT WAS A MISTAKE TO PURCHASE IT.  WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AND WILL GO NOWHERE.</li>
            <li> Product scams. they are smaller than my fingers ... !!! It is better to buy a perfume 3.4 oz about the same price.</li>
            <li> Got taken.  Didn&#x27;t really read as I should have.  If I had, would have noticed the word MINI.....more like minature.</li>
            <li> It was not what I was expecting. The scents are very strong. The novelty of the cigar theme helped to make it a bit better as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;Do not expect life size cigars. They are about the size of a fat crayon. Also the lids are stoppers and be careful not to splash when you open.</li>
            <li> es un bello detalle para regalar. aunque confieso que esperaba algo mas grande tambien he de confesar que el error fue mio por no consultar las onzas de resto todo perfecto.</li>
            <li> The variety is nice, but the set is super small! I bought it as a gift but definitely had to include something else.</li>
            <li> So very mini it looks like a sample.</li>
            <li> Happy with Product, price and delivery</li>
            <li> I didnt realize that it was so small</li>
            <li> Small, but very good fragances!! &#x3D;P</li>
            <li> Very mis-leading description, never purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> My male companions loves this. I had to find more. I bought this for them several years ago. It is a unique scent and they loves it!!!!</li>
            <li> This set arrived safe &amp; sound in its packaging. It was used in gift baskets for the holiday in addition with other products. I couldn&#x27;t be any happier for the quality &amp; price of these little colognes. Thanks :)</li>
            <li> I thought that this product was the bigger tubes again this was a fault on my part. Shipped on time. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> This concept are very practic to use ,so i think my self i will use again those Cuba Variety for man .</li>
            <li> Stings the nostrils and is too potent smelling.</li>
            <li> Before I buy this product, I thought it was cigar. Because I search the item \\&quot;cigar\\&quot;, then I found it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s still good.</li>
            <li> They were broken and now I can&#x27;t get a refund or replacement. What a total waste of money!!! They are sample bottles (.17 oz). Spend the extra cash and get the 1.17 oz set.  They smell good, so I would give it 4 stars, but can&#x27;t wear them so I gave it a 1 star.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells very nice but you must take carefull with the information because IS REALLY REALLY SMALL as one half of a pen. So I think that is not enough for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my husband and he really loves the smell. I love to smell it on him. He calls it &amp;#34;sex in a bottle&amp;#34; lol</li>
            <li> She thought she was buying actual Cuban cigars.  Instead I got four tiny vials of perfume.  What dabs you get out actually smell good.</li>
            <li> Hubby smells soo good.  But read the print these are mini ones.</li>
            <li> because you lie in size. Its very confuse when you writte .17, it would better if you writte 0.17, there we can see than it is a miniature</li>
            <li> wow all box and its to small not what i expected or wanted a waste of money. Not recommended for the price.</li>
            <li> I am only giving it 4 stars because they are very, very small for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I am still glad I got this because there is 2 that my dad really likes but the big once are on sale for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason I didn&#x27;t see that these are mini variety so that is my fault for not reading right.</li>
            <li> One was open and leaked everwhere</li>
            <li> Super last minute gift for the husband from the kids. Each scent is different and unique.</li>
            <li> I was expecting these to be small ones But when i saw the box, they looked like testers or samplers. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this. Though the fragrance is good. I&#x27;d recommend you buy a big one instead.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my fiance. He loves this smell...</li>
            <li> The bottles in this set are small but it will do for anyone that buys it. They are just big enough for you to test out to see which Cuba smell you would like to purchase in full volume.</li>
            <li> By mistake I ordered the mini set, I did not read well and thought it was the set of full size was just saying how much me angry to see the ridiculous size of these thumbnails. the product is good, the mistake was mine, but these models will serve you only for decoration because they end up in a couple of uses. From now on you put more atencio the description.</li>
            <li> This variety pack of scents is great for anyone who travels or might find themselves on the move in a hurry.</li>
            <li> are too small I thought they were bigger but I was wrong to people who likes to carry a perfume in the portfolio are great but do not last</li>
            <li> Love CUBANO.  These are small sized colognes you can take anywhere.  I love the scent as do others.  It is manly and not too sweet.  Just remember when they state mini, they mean mini.</li>
