            <li>While those are ok, this is the best.</li>
            <li>I hope this is as good as the reviews I have seen on this.  </li>
            <li>However, it does a really good job of sticking around.  </li>
            <li>I saw a good deal on it, and I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Aquaphor is so good for cracked hands, tattoos and diaper rashes.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time with Prime delivery, and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Then we started applying aquaphor on top of cera ve and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>Super product, works great!</li>
            <li>I love the size too - great for carrying in your purse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great as most folks have said before me.  </li>
            <li>m very glad she did.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love Aquaphor!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It comes out like liquid Vaseline, but is great - soaks in and is smooth - not</li>
            <li>It stays effective even after washing hands after application.</li>
            <li>She had been using some kind of chap</li>
            <li>It soothes and feels nice going on.</li>
            <li>We learned about Aquaphor when we had grandbabies coming over all the time, and now we just like having it for our own selves.</li>
            <li>This is a handy size for Aquaphor.  </li>
            <li>The tub, while quantity-wise is nice, you gotta dip fingers or a spatula in (if you&#x27;re that mindful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li>works great and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit of a lip-product fiend, and this is by far the best lip gloss (better than Softlips, Blistex, Vaseline, Carmex, Rose balm, Kiehl&#x27;s, MAC lipglass, Lancome Juicy tubes, etc.).  </li>
            <li>So, I bought Aquaphor Healing ointment and tried and found out it is super!!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I find it works better than Neosporan.</li>
            <li>My sons skin often feels like sand paper,  amd most lotions burn him...</li>
            <li>I had tried everything - balms, sticks, creams, lotions, vitamin sticks, Vaseline, Blistex, Chapstick, and so many more</li>
            <li>More as needed.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and have a subscription to it to keep them coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it worked better</li>
            <li>picked up a tube and found it has a many uses.</li>
            <li>In addition to softening lips (which I use in rotation with another favorite Carmex)</li>
            <li>Customer Service could have been more understanding.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>but this is way better.</li>
            <li>so one may find it a better product to use at night before you go to bed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be sure to follow usage instructions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this I kept buying</li>
            <li>and it really is healing, everything turned out great Glory to God thanks for the product at a great price.</li>
            <li>I like this type because it&#x27;s more hygienic than the tub</li>
            <li>The tube is a better delivery method, keeps it hygienic.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I tried but kept forgetting to reapply chap-stick many time a day.</li>
            <li>If I am out door I will reapply the ointment one more time during a day.</li>
            <li>I tried this one and was so glad to find that in 3 days his skin started improving.</li>
            <li>Better than the prescription stuff the doctor recommended.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for my lips.</li>
            <li>I was at a Walgreens looking to purchase more, and chose the store brand over the Eucerin Brand.</li>
            <li>After a week of application, my toes were much better.</li>
            <li>This product is very useful for Skin healing, and you cannot beat the price!  </li>
            <li>, it works wonderfully on my husband&#x27;s extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Best ointment for really dry lips and skin.</li>
            <li>Aquaphor is excellent in the winter for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I needed something that would work quickly and effectively on my hands.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially nice to use before bed on areas that can dry and crack in the winter, like hands and lips.</li>
            <li>This is the very best for dry chapped lips!</li>
            <li>I have a leg in which I had a large blood clot, so the skin doesn&#x27;t get good blood flow, and the Aquaphor helps, a lot.</li>
            <li>it shows in instructions, can heal very quickly and easily/</li>
            <li>My dermatologist strongly recommends [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Very good for dry, cracked and irritated skin.</li>
            <li>Right away, my lips felt much better and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>It works very effectively but a major side effect is \\&quot;hand and foot</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is greasy, there&#x27;s no doubt about it, but it&#x27;s the most effective thing I&#x27;ve found, and the greasy element wears off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>so she changed - and her lips have been fine ever since.</li>
            <li>But I came across this in my drawer and tried it, and within a couple days, I was healed up and fine.  </li>
            <li>but this does super well in avoiding diaper rashes!</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim after reading a few reviews and I am so HAPPY I did!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the way they felt on my skin, and honestly, they weren&#x27;t doing much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best thing about this product is I don&#x27;t have to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>had to buy this in quantity for any kind of reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I found a tube of Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing ointment in the medicine cupboard that I&#x27;d gotten for the skin that cracks on my fingers when winter comes and thought I&#x27;d try it on the lips.</li>
            <li>It is marketed as good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I just started to use it  so far so good</li>
            <li>Aquaphor is an absolute miracle!!!</li>
            <li>I use this product  on both my hands and lips, and it&#x27;s spectacular with healing - particularly with the lips.</li>
            <li>would use this buyer again, as it was easy an quick</li>
            <li>Excellent product , works very well for my dry and sometimes cracked finger tips, while nothing else worked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t care too much about your appearance, it is a perfect solution for your dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is mild enough for him and this size is great for the travel bag or to send to daycare</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Aquaphor is great for atopic dermatitis and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Great for any dry skin.</li>
            <li>Also great for dry skin and  to help heal a burn.</li>
            <li>It is great on really dry skin, too.</li>
            <li>and it works great for dry cracked skin from&lt;br /&gt;Michigan</li>
            <li>Great product for Dry skin</li>
            <li>Works great for my baby&#x27;s diaper rash and dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great remedy for dry, cracked lips.</li>
            <li>I do live in a dry area of the US and it is perfect</li>
            <li>It takes a good five minutes to rub it in enough to not get it all over your clothes or things you touch.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe, gentle, and dermatologist  recommended.</li>
            <li>I started using it from a sample I received in the mail when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>Auqaphore works wonders, and almost immediately,  on chapped lips, though not so quick on chapped hands.</li>
            <li>Best to clear up rough and damaged skin from scratches and  </li>
            <li>Take $0.50 worth of Petroleum Jelly, throw in $0.02 cents worth of mineral oil and glycerin, and tout it as \\&quot;Advanced Therapy\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>cheaper price than in stores, and it came quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Be sure to check labels before you buy store brand to make sure it really is similar to the name brand</li>
            <li>I bought this ointment after becoming VERY sunburned on the lips from a trip to Vietnam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within a week or so eczema significantly reduced and my baby&#x27;s skin started remaining very moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>I first tried this from my friend and had the immediate reaction of *ek, it is greasy and oily!</li>
            <li>I should have read &amp;#34;ointment&amp;#34; more clearly!  </li>
            <li>This is definitely the very best dry hands, heels, etc.</li>
            <li>This is the top lotion for kids &amp; adult with eczema.  </li>
            <li>I asked everyone I knew for recommendations without success.  </li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff is greater than vaseline.  </li>
            <li>Love it it made my skin so soft</li>
            <li>then you know what I&#x27;m dealing with right now and</li>
            <li>Try it and prove me right.</li>
            <li>Excellent for minor burns, scrapes and especially dry skin and lips.  </li>
            <li>Oh, did I mention that the price is very reasonable?</li>
            <li>In all the year&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon, this is the first issue I&#x27;ve ever had like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still on the first bottle after using it practically every day for a month.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, I could actually kiss my husband again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is definitely the most moisturizing.</li>
            <li>When I contacted their customer service department, the person I spoke to did not at first understand what my problem was.  </li>
            <li>That seems to be working out pretty well for</li>
            <li>They were looking human again! :)</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years, initially recommended to me by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You might want to be aware that the key ingredient is petroleum jelly, and this product also contains mineral oil, both of which many people who are seeking out \\&quot;natural\\&quot; skin-care products try to avoid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, I bought it cause</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It does the job very well!  </li>
            <li>It keeps the skin hydrated and soft, and it is also odor free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different things.</li>
            <li>it works very well!</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this brand and it is the standard-bearer of great goop for kids, all over... cleared up minor facial eczema after one treatment.</li>
            <li>For the first time ever I ended up with chapped lips this winter.</li>
            <li>This was the only ointment that was able to heal up my cracked bleeding hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Consistently works.  </li>
            <li>This product has greatly improved the dry, cracked, and patchy appearance that my hands had prior.</li>
            <li>It does such a great job healing my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is great for lips -- you will never use the ridiculous Carmex or the serviceable Chap-stick again.  </li>
            <li>This is good Healing Ointment, I buy this is only because my friends personal recommendation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It didnt seem to absorbed into the skin as well as other top brand lotions or Cetaphil -</li>
            <li>Good small size for people who needs a lot of usage thru the day.  </li>
            <li>application is easy and the relief was almost instant.</li>
            <li>I buy several bottles of Aquaphor Ointment every winter, because it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li>But I strongly recommend application at bedtime because that is the longest period of uninterrupted use</li>
            <li>Lately a large part of the time on my lips.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, even healed my husband’s hard working hands that were extremely dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>awakening this morning, I nearly forgot how dry and parched they had been because they feel so nice and</li>
            <li>Great little product, big results.</li>
            <li>really like this ointment</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>I really do like this product.  </li>
            <li>also tried this as a nighttime eye moisturizer and it works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very disapointed with Amazon&#x27;s Shipping and Customer Service Department.</li>
            <li>I have been using it and dont see too much difference yet</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know much about Aquaphor at the time.</li>
            <li>I tried it and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>My skin stays moisturized for the whole day.</li>
            <li>Only the skin around my eyes was affected, but the reaction was so severe, I was strongly attentive when my dermatologist suggested this product for use around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Excellent ointment for healing cracked skin on fingers from winter cold, and lips.  </li>
            <li>I cannot use straight Vaseline or petroleum jelly -  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very conveniently sized tube that meets TSA guidelines</li>
            <li>This works really well.  </li>
            <li>it works wonders as an all-around ointment.</li>
            <li>Very greasy though.  </li>
            <li>Very healing.</li>
            <li>Heals FAST</li>
            <li>I would def buy again thanks.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>My friend said she reapplies chap-stick a few times per hour or every two hours and keeps chap-sticks handy everywhere at her house and in the purses, So, she can keep her lips moisturized all the time.</li>
            <li>Price was right, i use it mainly for the healing period after receiving a new tattoo...can be used like Triple Antibiotic Ointment..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a cream like eucerine (which sucks when the tattoo starts to peel BTW ) and honestly brings out color if used when its still super new .</li>
            <li>It worked like magic, unlike other treatments, including Vaseline.</li>
            <li>The other 60% inactive ingredients seem to work magic that petrolatum alone doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It healed mine a lot faster than the normal healing process , so if any of you guys end up using this don&#x27;t  freak out about it peeling so soon !</li>
            <li>Even thought the tubes are small, it doesn&#x27;t take much, and they&#x27;re great to tuck in a desk drawer, purse, gym bag, or all of the above.</li>
            <li>My hands are very problematic for me, particularly during the winter.</li>
            <li>My lips get dry really easily</li>
            <li>/&gt;Locks in the moisture&lt;br /&gt;Keeps the dryness out &amp; leaves your skin smooth &amp; silky all day long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a real improvement in my cuticles since I have been using this with my normal hand cream.</li>
            <li>I tend to buy more natural products, but after trying many different products for my cracked, split and dry hands I have found that this stuff is the only thing that works.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li>But my lips are impossibly dry so a normal person could probably be fine at 2 maybe 3 times a day.  </li>
            <li>But I found that it quickly replaced my regular Petroleum Jelly.</li>
            <li>But this stuff makes them so soft and smooth instantly.</li>
            <li>Aquaphor Healing Ointment took take of my hands as I needed; particularly during the winter months.</li>
            <li>It is not as gooey as similar products, absorbs quickly and is odorless.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had tried so many porducts with little help.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how long it will last me - maybe years.  :-)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s one of those simple, useful items for a medicine cabinet and purse.</li>
            <li>Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
            <li>I went to my local drugstore, bought a tube of it, and put it on right there in the store after purchasing.</li>
            <li>Use this on my hands, feet, elbows, lips, nose and even on my face when I get super dry spots.</li>
            <li>Your hands will be BABY soft!</li>
            <li>It pretty much instantly cures chapped lips, knuckles, and elbows.  </li>
            <li>If you have chapped lips put this on them before going to bed and in the morning you will have brand new soft lips.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and stays on the skin and does not dry up.  </li>
            <li>Aquaphor is wonderful for dry heels, chapped hands, dry elbows, chapped lips, you can even use a thin layer on your eyelids.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning: for a product marketed to people with sensitive skin, I&#x27;m not sure why the manufacturer included lanolin in it, which is a substance many people are allergic to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stuff didn&#x27;t dry out, and the next morning, my skin was smooth.</li>
            <li>cracked skin  or minor wounds---far better than lotion or other creams</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s B.S. folks - pure and simple.  </li>
            <li>I had recently found out that I have a certain type of psoriasis on my hands and didn&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hard to love the greasiness.</li>
            <li>She received samples of the ointment it worked extreemly well to heal cracked and dry skin better than any other product she or I have ever used in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves your lips soft and shiny, but not sticky.  </li>
            <li>have a box of hand lotiona and creams and last evening applied this one just before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;It helped very much.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>It has completely changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use this for my 7 year old who has eczema.  </li>
            <li>I just knew it was something my doctor had once suggested for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(I think it&#x27;s a common problem that many people have).</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when you apply it, it looks and feels very greacy for some time -</li>
            <li>I thought it was natural because I got used to it, but wondered why my friend does not have the problem.</li>
            <li>Upon further research I found a few interesting facts...</li>
            <li>They became soft and smooth without peeling or cracking -- and no more bleeding.  </li>
            <li>hands have been used with different chemicals leaving my skin very dry and rough, I&#x27;ve used this many times, usually at night and in the morning my skin is so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My heels were becoming very dry and I tried endless creams &amp; treatments, but nothing seemed to provide permanent relief.</li>
            <li>I put it on my lips and within a day the chapped, peeling lips were back to normal.</li>
            <li>Pure Vaseline, various hand and body lotions, Vaseline creamy formula, hydrocortisone 1%, every brand/type of lip balm I had on hand (about 8 different types), Lubriderm, Eucerin, plus a homemade exfoliating mixture of Vaseline, olive oil and sugar.</li>
            <li>I first used it when my son was 3 or 4 weeks old when he started having that shinny red, dry cheeks and rash around his mouth.  </li>
            <li>Lip balms almost always do the trick for dry lips, but about once or twice a year, summer or winter (doesn&#x27;t matter), I get a case of very severe chapped lips where lip balms are ineffective.</li>
            <li>This product really works on dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>I have discovered that many less expensive products are as good as, and often better, than the very expensive creams sold by cosmetic companies.</li>
            <li>and I wake up the next morning with soft, repaired skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very good for any skin issues where you can cover it since it has a vaseline type base.</li>
            <li>It also provides a protective barrier on your hands, especially if you wash frequently.</li>
            <li>Within 3 days - after THREE months of no relief and daily bleeding - the lips were completely healed.  </li>
            <li>This thick, rich product soothed her lips and the dryness and cracking were gone within a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado, where it is incredibly dry.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and I am only sorry I never knew about this before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The extra ingredients have some way of promoting healing and smooth skin in a way nothing else I have tried does (at least for chapped lips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The ointment has been a success for him, it takes a very little amount and we put it on before we got to sleep.</li>
            <li>I apply a small amount to my dry, bleeding and cracked cuticles at night, and they&#x27;re smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li>other more greasy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li>first thing in the morning, after each meal and a heavy layer at bedtime to allow healing over the night.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smooth the roughest skin, but an extra boost is to put a thick layer on at bed &amp; wear gloves.</li>
            <li>My 4-yr old son has been having dry skin and rashes every since he was born.</li>
            <li>It is really goopy tho so a little dab will do.</li>

            <li> Perfect for pocket or purse, and much better for my lips than menthol / camphor.  </li>
            <li> While those are ok, this is the best.</li>
            <li> I hope this is as good as the reviews I have seen on this.  </li>
            <li> However, it does a really good job of sticking around.  </li>
            <li> I saw a good deal on it, and I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is so good for cracked hands, tattoos and diaper rashes.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time with Prime delivery, and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> Then we started applying aquaphor on top of cera ve and it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> Super product, works great!</li>
            <li> I love the size too - great for carrying in your purse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great as most folks have said before me.  </li>
            <li> m very glad she did.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I love Aquaphor!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It comes out like liquid Vaseline, but is great - soaks in and is smooth - not</li>
            <li> It stays effective even after washing hands after application.</li>
            <li> She had been using some kind of chap</li>
            <li> It soothes and feels nice going on.</li>
            <li> We learned about Aquaphor when we had grandbabies coming over all the time, and now we just like having it for our own selves.</li>
            <li> This is a handy size for Aquaphor.  </li>
            <li> The tub, while quantity-wise is nice, you gotta dip fingers or a spatula in (if you&#x27;re that mindful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li> works great and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a lip-product fiend, and this is by far the best lip gloss (better than Softlips, Blistex, Vaseline, Carmex, Rose balm, Kiehl&#x27;s, MAC lipglass, Lancome Juicy tubes, etc.).  </li>
            <li> So, I bought Aquaphor Healing ointment and tried and found out it is super!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I find it works better than Neosporan.</li>
            <li> My sons skin often feels like sand paper,  amd most lotions burn him...</li>
            <li> I had tried everything - balms, sticks, creams, lotions, vitamin sticks, Vaseline, Blistex, Chapstick, and so many more</li>
            <li> More as needed.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have a subscription to it to keep them coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it worked better</li>
            <li> picked up a tube and found it has a many uses.</li>
            <li> In addition to softening lips (which I use in rotation with another favorite Carmex)</li>
            <li> Customer Service could have been more understanding.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> but this is way better.</li>
            <li> so one may find it a better product to use at night before you go to bed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be sure to follow usage instructions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this I kept buying</li>
            <li> and it really is healing, everything turned out great Glory to God thanks for the product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I like this type because it&#x27;s more hygienic than the tub</li>
            <li> The tube is a better delivery method, keeps it hygienic.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I tried but kept forgetting to reapply chap-stick many time a day.</li>
            <li> If I am out door I will reapply the ointment one more time during a day.</li>
            <li> I tried this one and was so glad to find that in 3 days his skin started improving.</li>
            <li> Better than the prescription stuff the doctor recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it for my lips.</li>
            <li> I was at a Walgreens looking to purchase more, and chose the store brand over the Eucerin Brand.</li>
            <li> After a week of application, my toes were much better.</li>
            <li> This product is very useful for Skin healing, and you cannot beat the price!  </li>
            <li> , it works wonderfully on my husband&#x27;s extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Best ointment for really dry lips and skin.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is excellent in the winter for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would work quickly and effectively on my hands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially nice to use before bed on areas that can dry and crack in the winter, like hands and lips.</li>
            <li> This is the very best for dry chapped lips!</li>
            <li> I have a leg in which I had a large blood clot, so the skin doesn&#x27;t get good blood flow, and the Aquaphor helps, a lot.</li>
            <li> it shows in instructions, can heal very quickly and easily/</li>
            <li> My dermatologist strongly recommends [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Very good for dry, cracked and irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Right away, my lips felt much better and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It works very effectively but a major side effect is \\&quot;hand and foot</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is greasy, there&#x27;s no doubt about it, but it&#x27;s the most effective thing I&#x27;ve found, and the greasy element wears off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> so she changed - and her lips have been fine ever since.</li>
            <li> But I came across this in my drawer and tried it, and within a couple days, I was healed up and fine.  </li>
            <li> but this does super well in avoiding diaper rashes!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after reading a few reviews and I am so HAPPY I did!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way they felt on my skin, and honestly, they weren&#x27;t doing much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is I don&#x27;t have to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> had to buy this in quantity for any kind of reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I found a tube of Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing ointment in the medicine cupboard that I&#x27;d gotten for the skin that cracks on my fingers when winter comes and thought I&#x27;d try it on the lips.</li>
            <li> It is marketed as good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just started to use it  so far so good</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is an absolute miracle!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product  on both my hands and lips, and it&#x27;s spectacular with healing - particularly with the lips.</li>
            <li> would use this buyer again, as it was easy an quick</li>
            <li> Excellent product , works very well for my dry and sometimes cracked finger tips, while nothing else worked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t care too much about your appearance, it is a perfect solution for your dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is mild enough for him and this size is great for the travel bag or to send to daycare</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is great for atopic dermatitis and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Great for any dry skin.</li>
            <li> Also great for dry skin and  to help heal a burn.</li>
            <li> It is great on really dry skin, too.</li>
            <li> and it works great for dry cracked skin from&lt;br /&gt;Michigan</li>
            <li> Great product for Dry skin</li>
            <li> Works great for my baby&#x27;s diaper rash and dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great remedy for dry, cracked lips.</li>
            <li> I do live in a dry area of the US and it is perfect</li>
            <li> It takes a good five minutes to rub it in enough to not get it all over your clothes or things you touch.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe, gentle, and dermatologist  recommended.</li>
            <li> I started using it from a sample I received in the mail when I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> Auqaphore works wonders, and almost immediately,  on chapped lips, though not so quick on chapped hands.</li>
            <li> Best to clear up rough and damaged skin from scratches and  </li>
            <li> Take $0.50 worth of Petroleum Jelly, throw in $0.02 cents worth of mineral oil and glycerin, and tout it as \\&quot;Advanced Therapy\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> cheaper price than in stores, and it came quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be sure to check labels before you buy store brand to make sure it really is similar to the name brand</li>
            <li> I bought this ointment after becoming VERY sunburned on the lips from a trip to Vietnam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a week or so eczema significantly reduced and my baby&#x27;s skin started remaining very moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> I first tried this from my friend and had the immediate reaction of *ek, it is greasy and oily!</li>
            <li> I should have read &amp;#34;ointment&amp;#34; more clearly!  </li>
            <li> This is definitely the very best dry hands, heels, etc.</li>
            <li> This is the top lotion for kids &amp; adult with eczema.  </li>
            <li> I asked everyone I knew for recommendations without success.  </li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is greater than vaseline.  </li>
            <li> Love it it made my skin so soft</li>
            <li> then you know what I&#x27;m dealing with right now and</li>
            <li> Try it and prove me right.</li>
            <li> Excellent for minor burns, scrapes and especially dry skin and lips.  </li>
            <li> Oh, did I mention that the price is very reasonable?</li>
            <li> In all the year&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon, this is the first issue I&#x27;ve ever had like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still on the first bottle after using it practically every day for a month.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, I could actually kiss my husband again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is definitely the most moisturizing.</li>
            <li> When I contacted their customer service department, the person I spoke to did not at first understand what my problem was.  </li>
            <li> That seems to be working out pretty well for</li>
            <li> They were looking human again! :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years, initially recommended to me by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You might want to be aware that the key ingredient is petroleum jelly, and this product also contains mineral oil, both of which many people who are seeking out \\&quot;natural\\&quot; skin-care products try to avoid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, I bought it cause</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It does the job very well!  </li>
            <li> It keeps the skin hydrated and soft, and it is also odor free.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different things.</li>
            <li> it works very well!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this brand and it is the standard-bearer of great goop for kids, all over... cleared up minor facial eczema after one treatment.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever I ended up with chapped lips this winter.</li>
            <li> This was the only ointment that was able to heal up my cracked bleeding hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Consistently works.  </li>
            <li> This product has greatly improved the dry, cracked, and patchy appearance that my hands had prior.</li>
            <li> It does such a great job healing my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is great for lips -- you will never use the ridiculous Carmex or the serviceable Chap-stick again.  </li>
            <li> This is good Healing Ointment, I buy this is only because my friends personal recommendation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didnt seem to absorbed into the skin as well as other top brand lotions or Cetaphil -</li>
            <li> Good small size for people who needs a lot of usage thru the day.  </li>
            <li> application is easy and the relief was almost instant.</li>
            <li> I buy several bottles of Aquaphor Ointment every winter, because it&#x27;s so easy to use</li>
            <li> But I strongly recommend application at bedtime because that is the longest period of uninterrupted use</li>
            <li> Lately a large part of the time on my lips.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, even healed my husband’s hard working hands that were extremely dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> awakening this morning, I nearly forgot how dry and parched they had been because they feel so nice and</li>
            <li> Great little product, big results.</li>
            <li> really like this ointment</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> I really do like this product.  </li>
            <li> also tried this as a nighttime eye moisturizer and it works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very disapointed with Amazon&#x27;s Shipping and Customer Service Department.</li>
            <li> I have been using it and dont see too much difference yet</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know much about Aquaphor at the time.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> My skin stays moisturized for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Only the skin around my eyes was affected, but the reaction was so severe, I was strongly attentive when my dermatologist suggested this product for use around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Excellent ointment for healing cracked skin on fingers from winter cold, and lips.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use straight Vaseline or petroleum jelly -  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very conveniently sized tube that meets TSA guidelines</li>
            <li> This works really well.  </li>
            <li> it works wonders as an all-around ointment.</li>
            <li> Very greasy though.  </li>
            <li> Very healing.</li>
            <li> Heals FAST</li>
            <li> I would def buy again thanks.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> My friend said she reapplies chap-stick a few times per hour or every two hours and keeps chap-sticks handy everywhere at her house and in the purses, So, she can keep her lips moisturized all the time.</li>
            <li> Price was right, i use it mainly for the healing period after receiving a new tattoo...can be used like Triple Antibiotic Ointment..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cream like eucerine (which sucks when the tattoo starts to peel BTW ) and honestly brings out color if used when its still super new .</li>
            <li> It worked like magic, unlike other treatments, including Vaseline.</li>
            <li> The other 60% inactive ingredients seem to work magic that petrolatum alone doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It healed mine a lot faster than the normal healing process , so if any of you guys end up using this don&#x27;t  freak out about it peeling so soon !</li>
            <li> Even thought the tubes are small, it doesn&#x27;t take much, and they&#x27;re great to tuck in a desk drawer, purse, gym bag, or all of the above.</li>
            <li> My hands are very problematic for me, particularly during the winter.</li>
            <li> My lips get dry really easily</li>
            <li> /&gt;Locks in the moisture&lt;br /&gt;Keeps the dryness out &amp; leaves your skin smooth &amp; silky all day long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a real improvement in my cuticles since I have been using this with my normal hand cream.</li>
            <li> I tend to buy more natural products, but after trying many different products for my cracked, split and dry hands I have found that this stuff is the only thing that works.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li> But my lips are impossibly dry so a normal person could probably be fine at 2 maybe 3 times a day.  </li>
            <li> But I found that it quickly replaced my regular Petroleum Jelly.</li>
            <li> But this stuff makes them so soft and smooth instantly.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor Healing Ointment took take of my hands as I needed; particularly during the winter months.</li>
            <li> It is not as gooey as similar products, absorbs quickly and is odorless.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had tried so many porducts with little help.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how long it will last me - maybe years.  :-)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s one of those simple, useful items for a medicine cabinet and purse.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
            <li> I went to my local drugstore, bought a tube of it, and put it on right there in the store after purchasing.</li>
            <li> Use this on my hands, feet, elbows, lips, nose and even on my face when I get super dry spots.</li>
            <li> Your hands will be BABY soft!</li>
            <li> It pretty much instantly cures chapped lips, knuckles, and elbows.  </li>
            <li> If you have chapped lips put this on them before going to bed and in the morning you will have brand new soft lips.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and stays on the skin and does not dry up.  </li>
            <li> Aquaphor is wonderful for dry heels, chapped hands, dry elbows, chapped lips, you can even use a thin layer on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning: for a product marketed to people with sensitive skin, I&#x27;m not sure why the manufacturer included lanolin in it, which is a substance many people are allergic to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stuff didn&#x27;t dry out, and the next morning, my skin was smooth.</li>
            <li> cracked skin  or minor wounds---far better than lotion or other creams</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s B.S. folks - pure and simple.  </li>
            <li> I had recently found out that I have a certain type of psoriasis on my hands and didn&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to love the greasiness.</li>
            <li> She received samples of the ointment it worked extreemly well to heal cracked and dry skin better than any other product she or I have ever used in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves your lips soft and shiny, but not sticky.  </li>
            <li> have a box of hand lotiona and creams and last evening applied this one just before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;It helped very much.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> It has completely changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use this for my 7 year old who has eczema.  </li>
            <li> I just knew it was something my doctor had once suggested for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (I think it&#x27;s a common problem that many people have).</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when you apply it, it looks and feels very greacy for some time -</li>
            <li> I thought it was natural because I got used to it, but wondered why my friend does not have the problem.</li>
            <li> Upon further research I found a few interesting facts...</li>
            <li> They became soft and smooth without peeling or cracking -- and no more bleeding.  </li>
            <li> hands have been used with different chemicals leaving my skin very dry and rough, I&#x27;ve used this many times, usually at night and in the morning my skin is so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My heels were becoming very dry and I tried endless creams &amp; treatments, but nothing seemed to provide permanent relief.</li>
            <li> I put it on my lips and within a day the chapped, peeling lips were back to normal.</li>
            <li> Pure Vaseline, various hand and body lotions, Vaseline creamy formula, hydrocortisone 1%, every brand/type of lip balm I had on hand (about 8 different types), Lubriderm, Eucerin, plus a homemade exfoliating mixture of Vaseline, olive oil and sugar.</li>
            <li> I first used it when my son was 3 or 4 weeks old when he started having that shinny red, dry cheeks and rash around his mouth.  </li>
            <li> Lip balms almost always do the trick for dry lips, but about once or twice a year, summer or winter (doesn&#x27;t matter), I get a case of very severe chapped lips where lip balms are ineffective.</li>
            <li> This product really works on dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I have discovered that many less expensive products are as good as, and often better, than the very expensive creams sold by cosmetic companies.</li>
            <li> and I wake up the next morning with soft, repaired skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very good for any skin issues where you can cover it since it has a vaseline type base.</li>
            <li> It also provides a protective barrier on your hands, especially if you wash frequently.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days - after THREE months of no relief and daily bleeding - the lips were completely healed.  </li>
            <li> This thick, rich product soothed her lips and the dryness and cracking were gone within a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado, where it is incredibly dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and I am only sorry I never knew about this before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The extra ingredients have some way of promoting healing and smooth skin in a way nothing else I have tried does (at least for chapped lips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The ointment has been a success for him, it takes a very little amount and we put it on before we got to sleep.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount to my dry, bleeding and cracked cuticles at night, and they&#x27;re smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li> other more greasy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> first thing in the morning, after each meal and a heavy layer at bedtime to allow healing over the night.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smooth the roughest skin, but an extra boost is to put a thick layer on at bed &amp; wear gloves.</li>
            <li> My 4-yr old son has been having dry skin and rashes every since he was born.</li>
            <li> It is really goopy tho so a little dab will do.</li>
            <li> It soothes dry skin and seems to have the staying power that no other product has.</li>
            <li> &quot; This means that your hands and feet get dark, somewhat swollen, but mostly very sore and tender and dry.</li>
            <li> I like how its not harsh on my skin like other lotions</li>
            <li> My lips were not only dry, they cracked until they bled and broke open several times a day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; and milder than vaseline, and when I worked in the health office at an elementary school, this was one of the few things I was allowed to use on the little ones for their lips, or even Eczema.</li>
            <li> The area around my cheekbones used to be red, dry, and irritated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was amazed on how it healed and moisturized the dry patches on my face because my facial oil couldn&#x27;t do that!</li>
            <li> course, Aquaphor isn&#x27;t only for dry, cracked hands.</li>
            <li> I am constantly washing my hands throughout the hand which created problems with my hands; extremely dry and scaled.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily on her dry patches &amp; it clears it up.  </li>
            <li> So if you want to spent $6.00 on this vs. $1.50 on a Vasoline, please don&#x27;t let me stop you, but I&#x27;m simply telling you basic science.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant since the main ingredient is petroleum jelly, which I&#x27;d already tried without success, but I was desperate, and now here I am.  </li>
            <li> To say that we are shocked is an understatement, particularly when we read the ingredients, which appear to be primarily mineral oil and petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> Although it is a little greasy, use only a very little amount at first to get used to it and rub it in well.  </li>
            <li> It can be used on feet, chapped lips, minor scrapes, and diaper rash.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I developed a severe allergy to a cosmetic cream containing Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too - look into Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save Program for this item -&gt;**MIRRACLE</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Now, I know chapped lips every day are not a natural sign.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product to help heal my skin after being in the hospital for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Applied thick and gently dabbed it off.</li>
            <li> Especially in the winter with my rough, dry, cracking hands.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use this in two ways: around my hairline when I henna my hair, and also in delicate areas that chafe on long runs.</li>
            <li> I can only attribute the benefits to the combination of the other ingredients with the petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> Healed my seriously dry cracked skin issue....</li>
            <li> My husband has problems with severe dry hands in the winter.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well on my extremely dry and cracked hands.  </li>
            <li> I always have dry lips and am a lip balm junkie as a result.</li>
            <li> She was in misery because her lips were so dry.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor can be used on dry knees, elbows and heels.</li>
            <li> use it on my cuts, cuticles, and dry patches on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For example, I&#x27;d put on CeraVe lotion and within 15 minutes, my hands would still be dry.  </li>
            <li> The stuff didn&#x27;t dry out，my skin was smooth。</li>
            <li> my lips were severly dry &amp; chapped; when I have rash on dry skin area (could be on face, too)I would put Aquaphore.</li>
            <li> use this for our baby on his face and dry spots.</li>
            <li> I had severe dry lips for decades, and the lip skin was pilled off every day.</li>
            <li> My hands also get dry in winter</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my chronically dry lips.  </li>
            <li> i use aquaphor for literally everthing - dry skin, diaper cream, lip balm...</li>
            <li> we put it on his scrapes, dry skin, if he has a splinter (since he won&#x27;t let us remove them),</li>
            <li> I put in on my toes after they got really dry from applying foot fungus medicine.</li>
            <li> left packaging feedback regarding the missing tube and hope someone gets back to me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled like me by looking at the ingredients and seeing that the only active ingredient is petrolatum (i.e. vaseline).</li>
            <li> recommend buying this product in small tubes like these if you aren&#x27;t using it on large areas of your body, because a little goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have chapped or simply dry hands as I do from mainly not wearing gloves while doing dishes, this cram is for you.  </li>
            <li> Helped me heal a pretty serious burn!</li>
            <li> but hey, I think that&#x27;s why it soothes extremely dry skin so well!</li>
            <li> applied it 10-15 times a day for the first few days, slowly decreasing as my lips improved.  </li>
            <li> My baby has very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My baby started having eczema (very dry, scaly skin).</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of different moisturizers, and all of them dried out after 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had trouble for years, and this was the only thing that worked, and I even got a prescription for my Doctor.</li>
            <li> I stick to what I like, and this product absolutely never disappoints!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Applying a little to nasal passages (especially during cooler months), will prevent nosebleeds due to drying and chapping, for both children and adults.</li>
            <li> My cuticles get incredibly dry and crack, which is so painful, but started using this every night around my nails and have noticed a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> Initially I thought $5 seemed a lot for a small bottle (which is comparable to other retailers), but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m throwing out all of my other moisturizers and sticking with this one.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle in a tube, and we are not going to use any other chapped lip products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the other $100 jars of worthlessness, and believe me, this stuff will moisturize even the driest of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We used to buy the giant tubs of aquaphor, but the smaller tubes are not only convenient, but they are unlikely to get contaminated.  </li>
            <li> I use Aquaphor like hand lotion at night, but I only use a small amount.</li>
            <li> However, the Aquaphor brand contains other Inactive Ingredients listed as: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin and Bisabolol.</li>
            <li> My hands with dry Winter air and harsh indoor heating have become crinkled, cracked and rough.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> wonder, however, since the active ingredient in this ointment is petrolatum, wouldn&#x27;t it be cheaper to just use petroleum jelly instead?</li>
            <li> when I open the lid of this item ,I think how thick it is .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and found it actually seems to slow the aging process around the mouth as well.</li>
            <li> My lips would flake and feel sore, uncomfortable, and dry, and it could take up to two weeks to heal completely.</li>
            <li> hands down.</li>
            <li> You will still see a slight sheen after washing.</li>
            <li> At less than 1/3 the price.  </li>
            <li> I live in a cold climate and my hands get very dry during the winter.</li>
            <li> I squeezed every bit I could out of this little tube.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy-looking but does the trick.</li>
            <li> Take the little ones everywhere you go</li>
            <li> I have tried eveything out there for dry and cracked hands, and if your serious about healing your hands, please buy this product,.</li>
            <li> I have spend and wasted lots of money on hand creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> thing to note is that if the tubes get too old, it tends to liquefy and become useless.  </li>
            <li> few weeks ago, my boyfriend found out about Aquaphor and gave me a bottle.</li>
            <li> how you&#x27;re not suppose to use any harsh products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aquaphor for a few years now.</li>
            <li> : I like how it stays on even after few washes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> within few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Could this be why the store brand is such poor quality as compared to the Eucerin brand?</li>
            <li> , otherwise you might find that you&#x27;ve saved a $1 on something that turns out to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but the 1.75 ounce tube lasts a very long time, and goes a really long way.</li>
            <li> It is much less expensive to buy online than in local stores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product for a little price!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and when the weather gets dry and cold, my skin keeps coming off like a snake</li>
            <li> If I happen to forget to use it before a run (and I usually discover this when I hit the shower...</li>
            <li> We use it twice a day now and no more eczema!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I bought some cotton gloves to wear at night after putting on a small dab of Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> But I after awhile it usually drys up me.</li>
            <li> I seriously recommend this over tattoo Goo just for healing times, bringing out color, and even just the size are just a few reasons !</li>
            <li> I applied it before going to sleep and remember thinking how thick it was, but I immediately saw and felt the difference.</li>
            <li> The product is really thick and can be quite greasy.  </li>
            <li> I moved to a cold and dry climate and needed something for my knuckles, which were drying out, and this did the trick.</li>
            <li> I would say this product is a must in the winter months for anyone that suffers from dry, cracked hands.</li>
            <li> Marathon training can be brutal, but Aquaphor really helps save my skin.</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t stop the skin on the pads of my fingers from splitting during the cold dry weather I do find it soothes the cuts that seem to appear!</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s a little expensive</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to use this product throughout the day, being that it is a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> My doctor suggested this product for a problem on my leg caused by my Diabetes, not a sore just raised bumps, red and ugly.</li>
            <li> it keeps my lips supple, even in harsh windy cold conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Folks, the \\&quot;active ingredient\\&quot; in this crap is Petrolatum - basically</li>
            <li> So basically those tubes were useless, and I couldn&#x27;t return them.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does make it rather greasy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s pricy</li>
            <li> i just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> But this summer, I was having horrible dry chapped lips, I tried everything, burtsbees, chapstick, everything I could get my hands on.</li>
            <li> I have dry, cracked hands in the winter; so bad they bleed!!</li>
            <li> &#x27;s cold winters.</li>
            <li> but I was very wrong.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I couldn&#x27;t kiss my husband without my lips</li>
            <li> and I have a bad habit of biting my lips.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I have a bad habit of biting my lips.</li>
            <li> This lotion is water base lotion (not alcohol base); therefore, it does not sting the skins when applied.  </li>
            <li> It was so annoying and distracting.</li>
            <li> The difference is quite shocking.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff. I live in Colorado, where it is incredibly dry. Use this on my hands, feet, elbows, lips, nose and even on my face when I get super dry spots. My cuticles get incredibly dry and crack, which is so painful, but started using this every night around my nails and have noticed a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I find it works better than Neosporan. Healed my seriously dry cracked skin issue....Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Years ago my physician told me to use this salve for hemorrhoids.  It works well.  It&#x27;s also very good for any skin issues where you can cover it since it has a vaseline type base.</li>
            <li> My sons skin often feels like sand paper,  amd most lotions burn him...so he avoids them. This is one he will seek out to use.</li>
            <li> My husband has problems with severe dry hands in the winter. I have spend and wasted lots of money on hand creams and lotions. I saw the Healing Ointment on Amazons deals and deceived to try it. The ointment has been a success for him, it takes a very little amount and we put it on before we got to sleep. Great product and we will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the top lotion for kids &amp; adult with eczema.  This lotion is water base lotion (not alcohol base); therefore, it does not sting the skins when applied.  It is much less expensive to buy online than in local stores.  Good small size for people who needs a lot of usage thru the day.  Recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a lip-product fiend, and this is by far the best lip gloss (better than Softlips, Blistex, Vaseline, Carmex, Rose balm, Kiehl&#x27;s, MAC lipglass, Lancome Juicy tubes, etc.).  It leaves your lips soft and shiny, but not sticky.  Great for hands, too!</li>
            <li> I bought this ointment after becoming VERY sunburned on the lips from a trip to Vietnam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended it but after I healed; I continue to use it and not just on the lip but on hands as well as elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Use it on my ankles during the winter and it seems to help prevent dryness.</li>
            <li> ...whoever packed my order made a mistake and only shipped 5 tubes instead of 6.  In all the year&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon, this is the first issue I&#x27;ve ever had like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really like this ointment, it works wonderfully on my husband&#x27;s extremely dry skin.  It has no scent, which is great, and is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left packaging feedback regarding the missing tube and hope someone gets back to me.</li>
            <li> This is the best for everything! Helped me heal a pretty serious burn!</li>
            <li> Great travel size and price!  Aquaphor is great for atopic dermatitis and dry skin.  Love it!  I recommended this product</li>
            <li> With my washing machine not working, I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of hand laundering, as well as washing dishes. (no dish washer either) My hands with dry Winter air and harsh indoor heating have become crinkled, cracked and rough.&lt;br /&gt;I have a box of hand lotiona and creams and last evening applied this one just before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;It helped very much.&lt;br /&gt;Upon awakening this morning, I nearly forgot how dry and parched they had been because they feel so nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using this every night before bed until my skin heals.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product for chapped, cracked hands.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after reading a few reviews and I am so HAPPY I did! My heels were becoming very dry and I tried endless creams &amp; treatments, but nothing seemed to provide permanent relief. After using Aquaphor for a month now, the difference in softness &amp; appearance is amazing! Although the texture is similar to Vaseline which I had also tried, it is not the same. Whatever formula Eucerin uses, it definitely works. It also provides a protective barrier on your hands, especially if you wash frequently. You will still see a slight sheen after washing. Initially I thought $5 seemed a lot for a small bottle (which is comparable to other retailers), but a little goes a long way. I am still on the first bottle after using it practically every day for a month. I truly believe this is a MUST HAVE staple. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> My lips were not only dry, they cracked until they bled and broke open several times a day! I had tried everything - balms, sticks, creams, lotions, vitamin sticks, Vaseline, Blistex, Chapstick, and so many more I can&#x27;t even remember them all. I asked everyone I knew for recommendations without success.  It was so bad that I couldn&#x27;t kiss my husband without my lips bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my sister said that she heard about something from a friend called Aquaphor. And that it couldn&#x27;t hurt. I was hesitant since the main ingredient is petroleum jelly, which I&#x27;d already tried without success, but I was desperate, and now here I am.  It has completely changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it 10-15 times a day for the first few days, slowly decreasing as my lips improved.  They became soft and smooth without peeling or cracking -- and no more bleeding.  What&#x27;s more, I could actually kiss my husband again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use this about 4-5 times daily: first thing in the morning, after each meal and a heavy layer at bedtime to allow healing over the night. More as needed.  But my lips are impossibly dry so a normal person could probably be fine at 2 maybe 3 times a day.  But I strongly recommend application at bedtime because that is the longest period of uninterrupted use so it has maximum effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carry a lipstick size one in each purse; I travel with it, keep one in each room in my house.  There is Aquaphor all over my house.  I love this stuff and have a subscription to it to keep them coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that if the tubes get too old, it tends to liquefy and become useless.  Even working the tube with a massage is ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product enough. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I tend to buy more natural products, but after trying many different products for my cracked, split and dry hands I have found that this stuff is the only thing that works.</li>
            <li> Lotion works great for severe dryness on hands. It stays effective even after washing hands after application. I work in a biotech facility where we have to use alcohol based cleaners on our hands every time we enter the manufacturing facilities. This lotion saves my hands from the alcohol damage to my skin. without it, my knuckles and fingers would crack open and bleed from the dryness.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product.  I started using it from a sample I received in the mail when I was pregnant. I squeezed every bit I could out of this little tube. I first used it when my son was 3 or 4 weeks old when he started having that shinny red, dry cheeks and rash around his mouth.  Applied thick and gently dabbed it off. Overnight I could see the difference in his face.  I also use this for my 7 year old who has eczema.  Great for any dry skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I mainly use this in two ways: around my hairline when I henna my hair, and also in delicate areas that chafe on long runs. Marathon training can be brutal, but Aquaphor really helps save my skin. If I happen to forget to use it before a run (and I usually discover this when I hit the shower... ouch) I use it after to help speed the recovery. I&#x27;d be lost without this stuff.</li>
            <li> The product was excellent in preventing radiation treatment burns.&lt;br /&gt;The application is easy and the relief was almost instant. I highly recomend this product&lt;br /&gt;over other more greasy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s lips were burning and turning red and so she went to a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;It was contact dermatitis. She had been using some kind of chap stick.&lt;br /&gt;The Doctor told her to start using Aquaphor - so she changed - and her lips have been fine ever since.</li>
            <li> I agree with all of the reviewers. I am a lupus patient and suffer from the butterfly rash. The area around my cheekbones used to be red, dry, and irritated. I tried a lot of different moisturizers, and all of them dried out after 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago, my boyfriend found out about Aquaphor and gave me a bottle. I applied it before going to sleep and remember thinking how thick it was, but I immediately saw and felt the difference. The stuff didn&#x27;t dry out, and the next morning, my skin was smooth. It was incredible. I&#x27;m throwing out all of my other moisturizers and sticking with this one.</li>
            <li> Auqaphore works wonders, and almost immediately,  on chapped lips, though not so quick on chapped hands. A wonderful product.  Have just bought 24 packs to send to a friend back home in London, where you cannot purchase these. I don&#x27;t think there is an item even similar to this on the market.</li>
            <li> I work with food and must wash my hands often throughout the day.  This stuff works well on my extremely dry and cracked hands.  Keep in mind, though, this product is an ointment, therefore it&#x27;s greasy and doesn&#x27;t absorb like lotions do.  If using it on hands, it will smear on everything you touch.  I only use it at night, and with cotton gloves.  During the day I use [[ASIN:B001699TI8 Eucerin Plus Intensive Repair Hand Creme]], which also works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder, however, since the active ingredient in this ointment is petrolatum, wouldn&#x27;t it be cheaper to just use petroleum jelly instead?</li>
            <li> I always have dry lips and am a lip balm junkie as a result. Lip balms almost always do the trick for dry lips, but about once or twice a year, summer or winter (doesn&#x27;t matter), I get a case of very severe chapped lips where lip balms are ineffective. My lips would flake and feel sore, uncomfortable, and dry, and it could take up to two weeks to heal completely. It was so annoying and distracting. No matter what I would be doing (working, cooking, reading etc) I would be constantly distracted by the discomfort of my chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem cropped up recently, and I tried everything this time -- Pure Vaseline, various hand and body lotions, Vaseline creamy formula, hydrocortisone 1%, every brand/type of lip balm I had on hand (about 8 different types), Lubriderm, Eucerin, plus a homemade exfoliating mixture of Vaseline, olive oil and sugar. None of these things worked. Dryness and discomfort would return in short order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I googled for remedies and kept seeing recommendations for Aquapfor. I went to my local drugstore, bought a tube of it, and put it on right there in the store after purchasing. Right away, my lips felt much better and more comfortable. I kept applying periodically, and by the next morning my lips were almost all healed. In about 24 hours my lips were essentially healed. This stuff is amazing and I am only sorry I never knew about this before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petrolatum is 41% of the ingredients, but NO, this is not at all like Vaseline even though it may look and feel like it. I had tried both Vaseline and creamy Vaseline for my severely chapped lips, and neither made a difference. Aquaphor did. So don&#x27;t believe the reviewers who say it is the same. The extra ingredients have some way of promoting healing and smooth skin in a way nothing else I have tried does (at least for chapped lips).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried this as a nighttime eye moisturizer and it works very well. It&#x27;s too greasy to use in the daytime though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now a big lifetime fan of this ointment/cream. It&#x27;s amazing.is ointment/cream. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> A family member had been suffering with lips so severely chapped that they would crack and bleed on a daily basis - the bottom lip looked like it was splitting in two.  This went on for several months.  After reading about this product, I purchased a tube:  within 24 hours, the pain was gone and the skin was starting to heal over.  Within 3 days - after THREE months of no relief and daily bleeding - the lips were completely healed.  To say that we are shocked is an understatement, particularly when we read the ingredients, which appear to be primarily mineral oil and petroleum jelly.  This is a miracle in a tube, and we are not going to use any other chapped lip products.  Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I got this several years ago to use while going through cancer radiation treatments, which I might mention was also helpful for those. But this summer, I was having horrible dry chapped lips, I tried everything, burtsbees, chapstick, everything I could get my hands on. But I came across this in my drawer and tried it, and within a couple days, I was healed up and fine.  Coincidence, maybe, but I will use it again if I get chapped lips again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice until after I had opened the package that 2 of the 6 tubes can&#x27;t be opened- the companies didn&#x27;t separate the plastic lid from the rest of the cap!  So basically those tubes were useless, and I couldn&#x27;t return them.  Buy your Aquaphor somewhere else.</li>
            <li> To receive the goods, like, use is also very good, everyone in the family is like, after opportunity will buy, thank you.</li>
            <li> Best to clear up rough and damaged skin from scratches and  cracked skin  or minor wounds---far better than lotion or other creams</li>
            <li> This is definitely the very best dry hands, heels, etc. ointment around. However, it is an ointment and it&#x27;s hard to love the greasiness. It takes a good five minutes to rub it in enough to not get it all over your clothes or things you touch.</li>
            <li> Recommended by radiation oncologist.  This product really works on dry itchy skin.  It soothes and feels nice going on.</li>
            <li> This is good Healing Ointment, I buy this is only because my friends personal recommendation. \&lt;br /&gt;as it shows in instructions, can heal very quickly and easily/</li>
            <li> Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000052XOY Aquaphor Healing Ointment, 1.75 Oz (50 G), (Pack Of 6)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Stage IV breast cancer and recently switched to Xeloda chemotherapy. It works very effectively but a major side effect is \\&quot;hand and foot syndrome.\\&quot; This means that your hands and feet get dark, somewhat swollen, but mostly very sore and tender and dry. They can crack if you don&#x27;t keep them well moisturized. I have tried all kinds of ointments (including one a friend brought back from Bulgaria). This is definitely the most moisturizing. I put it on my feet and then put socks over them. At night, I put it on my hands and then wear cotton gloves to sleep so I won&#x27;t get my bedding greasy.  In the process of reordering it, I just read all the reviews and saw that it works wonders for chapped lips (which I have always had) and just put some on my lips. Feels great! Based on another review, I will try it under my eyes tonight. I have discovered that many less expensive products are as good as, and often better, than the very expensive creams sold by cosmetic companies. You just need to know which. Two thumbs up for Aquaphor Healing Ointment.</li>
            <li> Truly the best hydrating cream-eye cream - lip balm that I&#x27;ve ever used!  I&#x27;m on Retin-A, and if you know the side effects to using Retin-A then you know what I&#x27;m dealing with right now and how you&#x27;re not suppose to use any harsh products. Retin-A is making me peel and have some redness and irritation from the use but this product soothed my skin when even Cetaphil cream couldnt.  I&#x27;ve used the other $100 jars of worthlessness, and believe me, this stuff will moisturize even the driest of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, some things you do need to consider before buying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is quite greasy, therefor I wouldnt suggest you use this during the day or with make-up.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion tends to get on your bedding&#x27;s....&lt;br /&gt;It didnt seem to absorbed into the skin as well as other top brand lotions or Cetaphil - but it worked better so I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> I discovered Aquaphor when a dear friend went on Accutane. She was in misery because her lips were so dry. Her doctor gave her some Aquaphor samples. I had thought it was only for body skin but I was very wrong. This thick, rich product soothed her lips and the dryness and cracking were gone within a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up a tube and found it has a many uses. In addition to softening lips (which I use in rotation with another favorite Carmex) Aquaphor can be used on dry knees, elbows and heels. A tiny bit works well as an eye moisturizer and it also softens cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a little price!</li>
            <li> I became aquainted with Aquaphor Healing Ointment when my wife was a patient at the Christinana Hospital in Newark, DE.  She received samples of the ointment it worked extreemly well to heal cracked and dry skin better than any other product she or I have ever used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disapointed with Amazon&#x27;s Shipping and Customer Service Department. My problem was when I ordered the Aquaphor Healing Ointment, 1.75 Oz (50 G), (Pack Of 6).  Instead of the \\&quot;6 Pack\\&quot;, I only received one (1) 1.75 oz tube but was billed for the entire 6 pack.  When I contacted their customer service department, the person I spoke to did not at first understand what my problem was.  Finally, she did understand and credited my account.  The shipping department should have informed me that they were out of the 6 pack and asked if they could alter my order.  Customer Service could have been more understanding.  I had a feeling when takling to the Customer Service Department that was another outsourced/offsure opperation.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my son, we go through this stuff like water</li>
            <li> Great product.  This cream is excellent for any scrap or burn.  We used is for my husband after he had chemotherapy.  It was wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Been using this for years for myself and on my boy since he was a baby.</li>
            <li> I buy several bottles of Aquaphor Ointment every winter, because it&#x27;s so easy to use (in that it isn&#x27;t a process, or a long-term thing) and because I know multiple nurses who use it on their family and patients.&lt;br /&gt;It is greasy, there&#x27;s no doubt about it, but it&#x27;s the most effective thing I&#x27;ve found, and the greasy element wears off pretty quickly. One of the pros is also that it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything and people have even used it as lip balm, it&#x27;s so inoffensive.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough. Get some.</li>
            <li> I love Aquaphor! I used it on my face while I was on acutane, I use it on my lips, my hands, my feet and even the inside of my nose when it gets chapped. My dermatologist recommends it and I don&#x27;t use anything else. This supply should last me a looong time.</li>
            <li> We used to buy the giant tubs of aquaphor, but the smaller tubes are not only convenient, but they are unlikely to get contaminated.  We can put one in various places in the house so that they are always convenient.  We learned about Aquaphor when we had grandbabies coming over all the time, and now we just like having it for our own selves.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is greater than vaseline.  Lips stay moist for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it....</li>
            <li> I had no idea this would be so sticky. Like Vaseline. But I suppose it works.</li>
            <li> Tried it as soon as it arrived and I LOVE IT.  It comes out like liquid Vaseline, but is great - soaks in and is smooth - not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;The last produce I tried left my hands feeling tacky.  This does not do this.  I love the size too - great for carrying in your purse.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Aquaphor for a great product.</li>
            <li> This is the very best for dry chapped lips! I had tried so many porducts with little help. I used to be a big Carmex fan but this is way better. Also great for dry skin and  to help heal a burn.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist for my cracked lips.  It worked like magic, unlike other treatments, including Vaseline. Try it and prove me right.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. I&#x27;ve repurchased it over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it overnight on my lips - it keeps my lips supple, even in harsh windy cold conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my cuts, cuticles, and dry patches on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed on how it healed and moisturized the dry patches on my face because my facial oil couldn&#x27;t do that!</li>
            <li> I hope this is as good as the reviews I have seen on this.  I have been using it and dont see too much difference yet</li>
            <li> The product is really thick and can be quite greasy.  However, it does a really good job of sticking around.  For example, I&#x27;d put on CeraVe lotion and within 15 minutes, my hands would still be dry.  This product doesn&#x27;t have that problem.  Unfortunately, it does make it rather greasy so one may find it a better product to use at night before you go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I&#x27;ve been doing is mixing this with the CeraVe lotion.  That seems to be working out pretty well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect that when I run out, I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
            <li> when I open the lid of this item ,I think how thick it is . But I try to used  it before going to sleep ，and the next morning， I immediately saw and felt the difference. The stuff didn&#x27;t dry out，my skin was smooth。</li>
            <li> Excellent product , works very well for my dry and sometimes cracked finger tips, while nothing else worked.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it to any one with similar problem!</li>
            <li> I have dry, cracked hands in the winter; so bad they bleed!! Aquaphor is an absolute miracle!!! Not only does it smooth the roughest skin, but an extra boost is to put a thick layer on at bed &amp; wear gloves. Your hands will be BABY soft! I can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li> I purchased a six-pack of 1.75-ounce Aquaphor tubes as a lightning deal during December 2014. I didn&#x27;t know much about Aquaphor at the time. I just knew it was something my doctor had once suggested for my sensitive skin. I saw a good deal on it, and I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not realize that Aquaphor is an ointment. I can&#x27;t stand ointments. I have a collection of prescription ointments that I&#x27;ve stopped using. I didn&#x27;t like the way they felt on my skin, and honestly, they weren&#x27;t doing much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquaphor is different. It still feels like an ointment, but it actually makes my skin look and feel healthier. My hands are very problematic for me, particularly during the winter. I use Aquaphor like hand lotion at night, but I only use a small amount. After about one week of nightly use, I was amazed at how great my hands looked. They were looking human again! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, Aquaphor isn&#x27;t only for dry, cracked hands. It can be used on feet, chapped lips, minor scrapes, and diaper rash. Just be sure to follow usage instructions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one ointment that I will keep around and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years, initially recommended to me by my dermatologist.  It is great for lips -- you will never use the ridiculous Carmex or the serviceable Chap-stick again.  This is the best for lips.  I keep one in my purse and one in my bathroom.  It is great on really dry skin, too.</li>
            <li> Best ointment for really dry lips and skin. I recommend it highly. I do live in a dry area of the US and it is perfect</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have tried eveything out there for dry and cracked hands, and if your serious about healing your hands, please buy this product,. I have had trouble for years, and this was the only thing that worked, and I even got a prescription for my Doctor. This was a excellent buy, and I would reccomned anyone purchase it,</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and when the weather gets dry and cold, my skin keeps coming off like a snake (I think it&#x27;s a common problem that many people have). Before I used Olay Moisturizer + Sun Block and it worked. However, for some reasons, it stopped working for me. My doctor recommend this to me. I tried it and it worked really well. My skin stays moisturized for the whole day. The best thing about this product is I don&#x27;t have to use it everyday. I apply it on my face in the morning, wash it off by the afternoon, and my skin stays moisturize for the next 3-5 days. The only draw back is the product is waxy. When I apply it on my face, it looks like I just cover it with oil. Yes, shine, oily looking. However, if you don&#x27;t care too much about your appearance, it is a perfect solution for your dry skin. Oh, did I mention that the price is very reasonable?</li>
            <li> Folks, the \\&quot;active ingredient\\&quot; in this crap is Petrolatum - basically, that&#x27;s Vaseline Petroleum Jelly.  And this junk contains 41% of it.  Regular Vasoline Petroleum Jelly contains 100%.  At less than 1/3 the price.  So if you want to spent $6.00 on this vs. $1.50 on a Vasoline, please don&#x27;t let me stop you, but I&#x27;m simply telling you basic science.  The \\&quot;inactive\\&quot; ingredients include mineral oil and glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;This concoction is why pharmaceutical companies are despised around the world.  Take $0.50 worth of Petroleum Jelly, throw in $0.02 cents worth of mineral oil and glycerin, and tout it as \\&quot;Advanced Therapy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s B.S. folks - pure and simple.  Junk.&lt;br /&gt;Save yourselves some money and do yourselves a favor - but the cheapest Petroleum Jelly you can find; Vaseline or store brand.</li>
            <li> Love this I kept buying</li>
            <li> It does the job as it is advertised. Very good for dry, cracked and irritated skin. I bought the six pack and put it everywhere, on my night table, in my office drawer, and in the car ...</li>
            <li> My baby has very dry skin. We started using cera ve moisturizer on out doctors recommendation but that did not address the dryness. My baby started having eczema (very dry, scaly skin). Then we started applying aquaphor on top of cera ve and it worked beautifully. Within a week or so eczema significantly reduced and my baby&#x27;s skin started remaining very moisturized and smooth. We use it twice a day now and no more eczema!&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when you apply it, it looks and feels very greacy for some time - but hey, I think that&#x27;s why it soothes extremely dry skin so well!</li>
            <li> A few years ago I developed a severe allergy to a cosmetic cream containing Vitamin E. Only the skin around my eyes was affected, but the reaction was so severe, I was strongly attentive when my dermatologist suggested this product for use around my eyes. It is marketed as good for sensitive skin. I have used it ever since with no allergic reaction. The doctor further recommended applying it with a Q-tip for the extra protection of avoiding any possibility of germs from under my fingernails getting in my eyes, causing an eye infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: for a product marketed to people with sensitive skin, I&#x27;m not sure why the manufacturer included lanolin in it, which is a substance many people are allergic to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might want to be aware that the key ingredient is petroleum jelly, and this product also contains mineral oil, both of which many people who are seeking out \\&quot;natural\\&quot; skin-care products try to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying this product in small tubes like these if you aren&#x27;t using it on large areas of your body, because a little goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol.</li>
            <li> had to buy this in quantity for any kind of reasonable price.  don&#x27;t know how long it will last me - maybe years.  :-)  Aquaphor is excellent in the winter for dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you have chapped or simply dry hands as I do from mainly not wearing gloves while doing dishes, this cram is for you.  It does the trick. I bought some cotton gloves to wear at night after putting on a small dab of Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> The best ointment with healing power. I used aquaphore when I was taking accutane for acne bcs my lips were severly dry &amp; chapped; when I have rash on dry skin area (could be on face, too)I would put Aquaphore.</li>
            <li> I moved to a cold and dry climate and needed something for my knuckles, which were drying out, and this did the trick. It&#x27;s a little greasy-looking but does the trick.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is so good for cracked hands, tattoos and diaper rashes.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s pricy but this does super well in avoiding diaper rashes!</li>
            <li> This is a handy size for Aquaphor.  I have a leg in which I had a large blood clot, so the skin doesn&#x27;t get good blood flow, and the Aquaphor helps, a lot.</li>
            <li> My wife had a face lift and her doctor said to use this on her face for the next two weeks and it really is healing, everything turned out great Glory to God thanks for the product at a great price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically Vaseline.  I used this on my hands and was greasy for hours and had to use a lot of soap to get it off.  Imagine rubbing Vaseline your hands and then using a computer, holding your phone...YUK!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aquaphor for a few years now. At first, I bought it cause I was having some rash/eczema issues. But I found that it quickly replaced my regular Petroleum Jelly. I like this type because it&#x27;s more hygienic than the tub and it&#x27;s convenient from travel. I keep a 3 oz jar in my bathroom. I routinely use Aquaphor on my lips and around nostrils before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have a cold/flu, I keep one in the living room or by the bed to apply constantly to the raw-prone parts (lips, above lips, nose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of those simple, useful items for a medicine cabinet and purse. Can use on scrapes after disinfecting. Can use to groom eyebrows (mine aren&#x27;t bushy anymore, but, ya know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this a lot. Convenient. The tube is a better delivery method, keeps it hygienic. The tub, while quantity-wise is nice, you gotta dip fingers or a spatula in (if you&#x27;re that mindful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay well...</li>
            <li> My dermatologist strongly recommends [[ASIN:B000052XOY Aquaphor Healing Ointment, 1.75 Oz (50 G), (Pack Of 6)]] BIG time and so do I!!  Use it on anything from chapped lips to burns!!  Take the little ones everywhere you go and now there&#x27;s one for babies!!  Cosmetic Hint: Excellent to use under eyes in lieu of antiaging products now and then and this was also recommended by my dermatologist too!!  Lasts a long time too - look into Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save Program for this item -&gt;**MIRRACLE STUFF!!**</li>
            <li> Excellent ointment for healing cracked skin on fingers from winter cold, and lips.  Great value pack of 6 tubes.  Arrived on time with Prime delivery, and in good condition.  All tubes had a safety seal around the cap.</li>
            <li> Super product, works great! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;Locks in the moisture&lt;br /&gt;Keeps the dryness out &amp; leaves your skin smooth &amp; silky all day long</li>
            <li> Perfect for pocket or purse, and much better for my lips than menthol / camphor.  Also like that there&#x27;s no scent (as you&#x27;d expect)!</li>
            <li> My lips get dry really easily and I have a bad habit of biting my lips. But this stuff makes them so soft and smooth instantly. If you have chapped lips put this on them before going to bed and in the morning you will have brand new soft lips. A miracle worker. It is really goopy tho so a little dab will do. It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> For those who wonder if this is just the same a Vaseline or petroleum jelly....in my experience, it is not.  I cannot use straight Vaseline or petroleum jelly -  I break out and chapped skin gets drier, cracked and red when I use them.  I do not have that problem with Aquaphor Ointment.  It heals instead.  I can only attribute the benefits to the combination of the other ingredients with the petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> Amazing and perfect packaging to put in your purse/diaper bag.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> This ointment was recommended by my oncologist to sooth the radiation burn from my recent radiation therapy.  It does the job very well!  It is very soothing and stays on the skin and does not dry up.  Love it.  I have a tube in every bathroom of the house.</li>
            <li> I first tried this from my friend and had the immediate reaction of *ek, it is greasy and oily!*, but it soaks in, doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily and greasy and does the job of sealing cracks and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> works great and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> My doctor suggested this product for a problem on my leg caused by my Diabetes, not a sore just raised bumps, red and ugly.</li>
            <li> Excellent for minor burns, scrapes and especially dry skin and lips.  excellent value in the package.</li>
            <li> use this for our baby on his face and dry spots. It is mild enough for him and this size is great for the travel bag or to send to daycare</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a Nurse that works for a Dermotoligist  and it works great for dry cracked skin from&lt;br /&gt;Michigan&#x27;s cold winters.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not pocket size it&#x27;s a very conveniently sized tube that meets TSA guidelines and so is great for traveling. I use Aquaphor daily for my chapped lips at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I live in a cold climate and my hands get very dry during the winter. Furthermore, I have a bad habit of biting my lips. I use this product  on both my hands and lips, and it&#x27;s spectacular with healing - particularly with the lips.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would work quickly and effectively on my hands.  I am constantly washing my hands throughout the hand which created problems with my hands; extremely dry and scaled.  Aquaphor Healing Ointment took take of my hands as I needed; particularly during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Best emollient for wind burn or chapped skin!</li>
            <li> Great product for Dry skin</li>
            <li> This product was suggested by my family doctor for my infant&#x27;s eczema.  I use it daily on her dry patches &amp; it clears it up.  Though it&#x27;s a little expensive it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I had severe dry lips for decades, and the lip skin was pilled off every day. I thought it was natural because I got used to it, but wondered why my friend does not have the problem. She told me she uses lipstick and chap-stick. I used those sometime also, but it did not work. My friend said she reapplies chap-stick a few times per hour or every two hours and keeps chap-sticks handy everywhere at her house and in the purses, So, she can keep her lips moisturized all the time. I tried but kept forgetting to reapply chap-stick many time a day. So, I bought Aquaphor Healing ointment and tried and found out it is super!! I use it once in the morning and once before going to bed. If I am out door I will reapply the ointment one more time during a day. It has been over a month; my lip skin have not been cracked and pilled since. Now, I know chapped lips every day are not a natural sign.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great as most folks have said before me.  I got it from my sister and I&#x27;ve now got my brother using it. I think this is one purchase that will continue to use for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Price was right, i use it mainly for the healing period after receiving a new tattoo...can be used like Triple Antibiotic Ointment..shipping was on time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product</li>
            <li> I buy this for our patients for post op lasers.  It keeps the skin hydrated and soft, and it is also odor free.  Just don&#x27;t get it in your hair...</li>
            <li> a great product and life saver as we go thru radiation of the lip works great</li>
            <li> My 4-yr old son has been having dry skin and rashes every since he was born. I had been using Aveeno baby lotion, but the skin condition did not improve. I tried this one and was so glad to find that in 3 days his skin started improving. My hands also get dry in winter and I use this lotion to prevent itching and redness. It takes 2 to 3 days, but it works. Don&#x27;t be fooled like me by looking at the ingredients and seeing that the only active ingredient is petrolatum (i.e. vaseline). The other 60% inactive ingredients seem to work magic that petrolatum alone doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product to help heal my skin after being in the hospital for a long time.  Better than the prescription stuff the doctor recommended.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my chronically dry lips.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and found it actually seems to slow the aging process around the mouth as well.</li>
            <li> I have eczema. Lately a large part of the time on my lips. A doctor at school gave me some samples. I&#x27;ve used so many different things. blistex, lipgloss, the gloss part on a two part lipstick. While those are ok, this is the best. hands down.</li>
            <li> This product worked, and is still working quite well for me. I had recently found out that I have a certain type of psoriasis on my hands and didn&#x27;t know what to do. My dermatologist recommended Aquaphor and im very glad she did. It is a little difficult to use this product throughout the day, being that it is a bit greasy. However, I use it at night and wear cotton gloves so it stays on and absorbs fully. This product has greatly improved the dry, cracked, and patchy appearance that my hands had prior. I would say this product is a must in the winter months for anyone that suffers from dry, cracked hands.</li>
            <li> This stuff is sooooooo amazing for tattoos !!!!! It&#x27;s not a cream like eucerine (which sucks when the tattoo starts to peel BTW ) and honestly brings out color if used when its still super new . It healed mine a lot faster than the normal healing process , so if any of you guys end up using this don&#x27;t  freak out about it peeling so soon ! I seriously recommend this over tattoo Goo just for healing times, bringing out color, and even just the size are just a few reasons !</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is not as gooey as similar products, absorbs quickly and is odorless. Best of all....it works very well!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this brand and it is the standard-bearer of great goop for kids, all over... cleared up minor facial eczema after one treatment.</li>
            <li> This works really well.  I use it all the time.  Gave a couple of tubes to my daughter for herself and her children.  She loves it, too,</li>
            <li> This product is very useful for Skin healing, and you cannot beat the price!  Will definitely come back and buy again!</li>
            <li> For the first time ever I ended up with chapped lips this winter. I tried chapsticks, oils (from Vitamin E to Jojoba) and vaseline. Nothing worked. I found a tube of Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing ointment in the medicine cupboard that I&#x27;d gotten for the skin that cracks on my fingers when winter comes and thought I&#x27;d try it on the lips. Worked beautifully. I put it on my lips and within a day the chapped, peeling lips were back to normal. Although it doesn&#x27;t stop the skin on the pads of my fingers from splitting during the cold dry weather I do find it soothes the cuts that seem to appear! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i use aquaphor for literally everthing - dry skin, diaper cream, lip balm...it works wonders as an all-around ointment. i just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I once worked for a dermatologist and this was one of the products that he recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands have been used with different chemicals leaving my skin very dry and rough, I&#x27;ve used this many times, usually at night and in the morning my skin is so soft and smooth.  My hands don&#x27;t look or feel like they are 47 yrs old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquaphor is a wonderful product, it might feel like it&#x27;s greasy or leaves a residue after rubbing it in but it does work wonders.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Works great for my baby&#x27;s diaper rash and dry skin.</li>
            <li> This was the only ointment that was able to heal up my cracked bleeding hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I like how it stays on even after few washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I like how its not harsh on my skin like other lotions have been&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I like how it doesn&#x27;t take alot to apply to the areas needed and clears up within few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Like others have said its 41% petrolatum and its slimy. But I after awhile it usually drys up me.</li>
            <li> if we could only take one tube of &amp;#34;something&amp;#34; with us for our son, it would definitely be aquaphor. we put it on his scrapes, dry skin, if he has a splinter (since he won&#x27;t let us remove them), chapped lips/nose and</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It does such a great job healing my dry skin. I put it on my hands and feet every night (especially in winter) and I wake up the next morning with soft, repaired skin!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Especially in the winter with my rough, dry, cracking hands.  Very greasy though.  Still I would recommend this product.  Very healing.</li>
            <li> Great healing ointment.</li>
            <li> cheaper price than in stores, and it came quickly.  would use this buyer again, as it was easy an quick</li>
            <li> Great for my son&#x27;s eczema!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Consistently works.  Great deal!</li>
            <li> It does what it says. I mostly use it for my lips. Heals FAST</li>
            <li> Great little product, big results. Aquaphor is wonderful for dry heels, chapped hands, dry elbows, chapped lips, you can even use a thin layer on your eyelids. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; and milder than vaseline, and when I worked in the health office at an elementary school, this was one of the few things I was allowed to use on the little ones for their lips, or even Eczema.</li>
            <li> I have been using and carrying around this product with me for years. It&#x27;s safe, gentle, and dermatologist  recommended. I&#x27;ve used it on my infant daughter&#x27;s diaper rash when anything containing Zinc Oxide made her bottom bleed (she&#x27;s allergic to that), and it cleared up overnight. She&#x27;s 2 now, and we both still use it. I apply a small amount to my dry, bleeding and cracked cuticles at night, and they&#x27;re smooth in the morning. It&#x27;s also a great remedy for dry, cracked lips. I always keep a tube on me. It&#x27;s expensive, but the 1.75 ounce tube lasts a very long time, and goes a really long way. I stick to what I like, and this product absolutely never disappoints!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one mistake I made recently I thought I&#x27;d share. I was at a Walgreens looking to purchase more, and chose the store brand over the Eucerin Brand. Big mistake!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The store brand product immediately liquefied in a sort of filmy, slimy liquified version of something that&#x27;s meant to soothe and coat your lips with moisture. Upon further research I found a few interesting facts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, both products do contain the key ingredient of Petroleum (41%). However, the Aquaphor brand contains other Inactive Ingredients listed as: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin and Bisabolol. The \\&quot;Store Brand\\&quot; lacks the last three I&#x27;ve listed in the Aquaphor Brand. The difference is quite shocking. Could this be why the store brand is such poor quality as compared to the Eucerin brand? I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;ll never buy store brand for this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to check labels before you buy store brand to make sure it really is similar to the name brand, otherwise you might find that you&#x27;ve saved a $1 on something that turns out to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love it it made my skin so soft I would def buy again thanks. I will tell all my friends</li>
            <li> Not a fan.  Like putting Vaseline on your hands.  I should have read &amp;#34;ointment&amp;#34; more clearly!  Also, it has not helped my cracking hands.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked really well for me. I put in on my toes after they got really dry from applying foot fungus medicine. After a week of application, my toes were much better.</li>
            <li> For your baby to use.</li>
            <li> Just had surgery and was told about the product for my scare. I just started to use it  so far so good</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  It pretty much instantly cures chapped lips, knuckles, and elbows.  Even thought the tubes are small, it doesn&#x27;t take much, and they&#x27;re great to tuck in a desk drawer, purse, gym bag, or all of the above.</li>
            <li> Although it is a little greasy, use only a very little amount at first to get used to it and rub it in well.  I&#x27;ve noticed a real improvement in my cuticles since I have been using this with my normal hand cream.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, even healed my husband’s hard working hands that were extremely dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I believe I&#x27;ve become an Aquaphor convert! It soothes dry skin and seems to have the staying power that no other product has. The tube keeps each application sanitary, as opposed to Aquaphor in a jar. It&#x27;s especially nice to use before bed on areas that can dry and crack in the winter, like hands and lips. Applying a little to nasal passages (especially during cooler months), will prevent nosebleeds due to drying and chapping, for both children and adults. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on facial skin because it will likely clog pours. Overall, Aquaphor is an essential in our home.</li>
