            <li>Love this shower gel.  </li>
            <li>THAT really SMELLS GREAT ALSO.</li>
            <li>This is just ok.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It does not lather well, better used with a puff scrub.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product, this review is for the lavender.</li>
            <li>This group, the Lavendar herbal one, among Avalon&#x27;s products is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, our whole family washes with this, including the dogs :)</li>
            <li>It leathers ok</li>
            <li>Lavendar is my most favorite scent, so when Avalon came out with their Bath and Shower Gel in lavendar, of course I had to have some.</li>
            <li>I love bubble baths.</li>
            <li>Love the product, been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smelling.</li>
            <li>or so we have used it, lemon lavendery (more lavendery).</li>
            <li>Does a great job and has real oil of lavender in it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve ordered more for</li>
            <li>I love the product and the timely manner in which it arrived.</li>
            <li>Would love if the manufacturer could figure out the issue and fix this problem.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have the lemon scented gel and love it.</li>
            <li>have it on subscribe and save :)</li>
            <li>I would like more lavender fragrance, but for the low price, this was an excellent choice.</li>
            <li>I love the lather, the fragrance, and couldn&#x27;t pass up a discount.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the price and the fact that the gel suds well.</li>
            <li>Love the foaming and smell.</li>
            <li>great product fast shipping</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, good and simple ingredient list.</li>
            <li>Seems gentler on my skin than most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the scent of the product, its friendly packaging (break resistant and easy to dispense with the pump) and the value.  </li>
            <li>But it has pretty good feel when using it.</li>
            <li>Though Avalon does have suds it is the closes product, unless you make your own soap, to natural good for your skin and environment product.</li>
            <li>My kids have very sensitive skin, this is great in the bath or shower.  </li>
            <li>The shower/bath gel works great, wonderful scent and doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Good if you don&#x27;t need a really sudsy wash, or if you need that &#x27;squeaky-clean&#x27; feeling.</li>
            <li>Rinses off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or sticky.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and does the job.</li>
            <li>Smell is a bit too strong.</li>
            <li>This bottle is HUGE; be forewarned.</li>
            <li>, it is light and not overpowering in any way.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy the use of this soap for shower use.</li>
            <li>It lathers up well with a buff puff, smells divine, washes well, makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Not that fresh light lavender scent that I love. . . .</li>
            <li>I love the lavender scent - its just right.  </li>
            <li>it is also very economical.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>natural, smells good and leaves the skin smooth, fresh and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very light and refreshing natural body and bath shower gel.</li>
            <li>Clean with a lavender after aroma.</li>
            <li>I feel clean after using it in the shower or bath.  </li>
            <li>There is a belief that in order to feel clean there must be suds.</li>
            <li>As others have said it doesnt have as much lavender as i thought I might want, but the mixture is refreshing, invigorating and i feel sort of squeaky clean, as opposed to perfumed clean...</li>
            <li>The soap itself kind of reminds me of that natural casteel soap by Dr. Bonner.</li>
            <li>big bottle, smells good.</li>
            <li>I love Avalon products so much.  </li>
            <li>It does the job and has a true lemon scent.</li>
            <li>Our whole family love it very much !</li>
            <li>and it is just as special every night as it was the very first time.</li>
            <li>I am still using this gel due to the great price, and would have given it 5 stars if the scent was not changed.</li>
            <li>and I always feel clean and fresh after showering with this.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of it and that it is chemical -free as well as nearly 100% organic.</li>
            <li>I love this shower gel, however the most recent delivery was leaking.</li>
            <li>Love the high volume size.</li>
            <li>The lavender is sweet and fresh.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is a natural option.</li>
            <li>I wanted to go more natural with my body products and I like Avalon products.</li>
            <li>AND IT&#x27;S AN ECONOMICAL BUY.</li>
            <li>I have tried several fragrance free body washes and they all worked better than this.</li>
            <li>I like to use organic and natural products and am pleased that this shower soap is available on Amazon for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I love this Bath Gel...very natural lavender fragerance.</li>
            <li>I do have a highly sensitive reaction to smells, so perhaps for many</li>
            <li>Be sure to TEST the bottles you get right away so as to have a simple and free exchange experience</li>
            <li>After scrubbing up with this, especially the bottoms of my feet, then rinsing, I felt totally clean and fresh, but most of all I felt relaxed and refreshed and smelling like a field of lavender on a sunny day, the feeling you get at a spa.  </li>
            <li>I will be switching back to alaffia products, which are actually organic and smell good!</li>
            <li>- so it clearly moved around in transit and clearly the pump nozzle is not designed for that kind of ride and shocks.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of Lavender in this body wash, it smells natural and strong enough so that the smell relaxes you as you shower.</li>
            <li>First of all, when I received this product it was leaking all over the place.</li>
            <li>Would love to get a replacement, but the only option was return - so be it.</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Pretty much everything I could ask for in a body wash.</li>
            <li>Love how it feels on my skin and does not leave it dry.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit undesirably strong, but only when using.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is quite pure.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice but slightly medicine smell, the lavender is really smelling the way is w/o the perfumes covering the smell.</li>
            <li>This product is just right for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Finding an SLS free bubble bath that works and smells good is hard but necessary for my skin.</li>
            <li>A significant part had leaked into the box and made a huge mess.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this gel</li>
            <li>Is gentle and not drying to my skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really survive the post workout shower test.  </li>
            <li>Avalon is a brand I really like.</li>
            <li>I really like this shower gel.</li>
            <li>I use this shower gel at night before bed and the whole bath becomes an experience that relaxes and allows you to drift off to sleep.</li>
            <li>Delivers fast</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but after shaving it makes me itch.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>I suggest you really research this product before buying it if you have allergies.</li>
            <li>Smells like real lavender but the product leaked out of the container all over the packaging.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 2 years because I like it so much.</li>
            <li>Quantity good for at least 2 months per bottle.</li>
            <li>They make clear which ingredients are organic and which aren&#x27;t right on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my new shower gel from here on out!</li>
            <li>my daughter thinks it is like regular shampoo but larger and more expensive!It should be cheaper.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I like this so much that when it goes on sale I buy several of the large size</li>
            <li>Note I don&#x27;t live in the</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser, so you won&#x27;t get much suds out of it, but i think it works well enough for me.</li>
            <li>I really like the updated packaging of the product, the old 32 ounce was an opaque container that you could not see into to estimate how much product was left.</li>
            <li>the only thing i would add is for Amazon to use a little more TLC on packaging.  </li>
            <li>Great scent but the product cold be improved by the addition of some moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I use this bath gel for my daughter who has extremely sensitive skin and eczema, as a bubble bath.</li>
            <li>I saw 32oz on the ordering page (and 32oz arrived), so it looks like they fixed it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten use to the almost heavily lemon like smell that cuts into the lavender scent (it has a hint of the Mr. Clean brand smell I grew up with - yikes).</li>
            <li>This large bottle goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>The new packaging is still green but clear making it much easier to estimate when you need to reorder.</li>
            <li>I do get more compliments when I use the cheaper shampoos and soaps because they are perfumed, but I prefer to not have a perfume that has unhealthy ingredients.  </li>
            <li>If the nozzle was more robust and made of tougher plastic, it might not have broken during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only problem was the packaging, as some of the liquid had leaked out, not too much but still, you could wish not to loose any by the time it reaches your place.</li>
            <li>Hard to feel clean without any bubbles.</li>
            <li>We use this for our kids in the bath and it cleans well as well as not dry out their skin.  </li>
            <li>I guess with natural products, the scent does not linger as long.  </li>
            <li>Great product, been using it daily for a natural mosquito repellent since mosquitoes apparently don&#x27;t like lavender.</li>
            <li>It is good and bad</li>
            <li>: good because there are no preservatives; bad because it is wasteful if it &#x27;expires&#x27;</li>

            <li> So now I&#x27;m placing my own order for this product, which has become my favorite shower gel.  </li>
            <li> Gets you clean, smells good and does not give me dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I love this shower gel, nice fragrance, lovely feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly, suds nicely and rinses easily.</li>
            <li> I love the Avalon Lemon and Lavendar products.</li>
            <li> I love lavender, but this version is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this shower gel.  </li>
            <li> THAT really SMELLS GREAT ALSO.</li>
            <li> This is just ok.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It does not lather well, better used with a puff scrub.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, this review is for the lavender.</li>
            <li> This group, the Lavendar herbal one, among Avalon&#x27;s products is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, our whole family washes with this, including the dogs :)</li>
            <li> It leathers ok</li>
            <li> Lavendar is my most favorite scent, so when Avalon came out with their Bath and Shower Gel in lavendar, of course I had to have some.</li>
            <li> I love bubble baths.</li>
            <li> Love the product, been using it for years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smelling.</li>
            <li> or so we have used it, lemon lavendery (more lavendery).</li>
            <li> Does a great job and has real oil of lavender in it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve ordered more for</li>
            <li> I love the product and the timely manner in which it arrived.</li>
            <li> Would love if the manufacturer could figure out the issue and fix this problem.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have the lemon scented gel and love it.</li>
            <li> have it on subscribe and save :)</li>
            <li> I would like more lavender fragrance, but for the low price, this was an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> I love the lather, the fragrance, and couldn&#x27;t pass up a discount.  </li>
            <li> I was so pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the price and the fact that the gel suds well.</li>
            <li> Love the foaming and smell.</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, good and simple ingredient list.</li>
            <li> Seems gentler on my skin than most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the scent of the product, its friendly packaging (break resistant and easy to dispense with the pump) and the value.  </li>
            <li> But it has pretty good feel when using it.</li>
            <li> Though Avalon does have suds it is the closes product, unless you make your own soap, to natural good for your skin and environment product.</li>
            <li> My kids have very sensitive skin, this is great in the bath or shower.  </li>
            <li> The shower/bath gel works great, wonderful scent and doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good if you don&#x27;t need a really sudsy wash, or if you need that &#x27;squeaky-clean&#x27; feeling.</li>
            <li> Rinses off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or sticky.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily and does the job.</li>
            <li> Smell is a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> This bottle is HUGE; be forewarned.</li>
            <li> , it is light and not overpowering in any way.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the use of this soap for shower use.</li>
            <li> It lathers up well with a buff puff, smells divine, washes well, makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Not that fresh light lavender scent that I love. . . .</li>
            <li> I love the lavender scent - its just right.  </li>
            <li> it is also very economical.</li>
            <li> Very fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> natural, smells good and leaves the skin smooth, fresh and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very light and refreshing natural body and bath shower gel.</li>
            <li> Clean with a lavender after aroma.</li>
            <li> I feel clean after using it in the shower or bath.  </li>
            <li> There is a belief that in order to feel clean there must be suds.</li>
            <li> As others have said it doesnt have as much lavender as i thought I might want, but the mixture is refreshing, invigorating and i feel sort of squeaky clean, as opposed to perfumed clean...</li>
            <li> The soap itself kind of reminds me of that natural casteel soap by Dr. Bonner.</li>
            <li> big bottle, smells good.</li>
            <li> I love Avalon products so much.  </li>
            <li> It does the job and has a true lemon scent.</li>
            <li> Our whole family love it very much !</li>
            <li> and it is just as special every night as it was the very first time.</li>
            <li> I am still using this gel due to the great price, and would have given it 5 stars if the scent was not changed.</li>
            <li> and I always feel clean and fresh after showering with this.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it and that it is chemical -free as well as nearly 100% organic.</li>
            <li> I love this shower gel, however the most recent delivery was leaking.</li>
            <li> Love the high volume size.</li>
            <li> The lavender is sweet and fresh.</li>
            <li> and I love that it is a natural option.</li>
            <li> I wanted to go more natural with my body products and I like Avalon products.</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S AN ECONOMICAL BUY.</li>
            <li> I have tried several fragrance free body washes and they all worked better than this.</li>
            <li> I like to use organic and natural products and am pleased that this shower soap is available on Amazon for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I love this Bath Gel...very natural lavender fragerance.</li>
            <li> I do have a highly sensitive reaction to smells, so perhaps for many</li>
            <li> Be sure to TEST the bottles you get right away so as to have a simple and free exchange experience</li>
            <li> After scrubbing up with this, especially the bottoms of my feet, then rinsing, I felt totally clean and fresh, but most of all I felt relaxed and refreshed and smelling like a field of lavender on a sunny day, the feeling you get at a spa.  </li>
            <li> I will be switching back to alaffia products, which are actually organic and smell good!</li>
            <li> - so it clearly moved around in transit and clearly the pump nozzle is not designed for that kind of ride and shocks.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of Lavender in this body wash, it smells natural and strong enough so that the smell relaxes you as you shower.</li>
            <li> First of all, when I received this product it was leaking all over the place.</li>
            <li> Would love to get a replacement, but the only option was return - so be it.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Pretty much everything I could ask for in a body wash.</li>
            <li> Love how it feels on my skin and does not leave it dry.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit undesirably strong, but only when using.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is quite pure.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice but slightly medicine smell, the lavender is really smelling the way is w/o the perfumes covering the smell.</li>
            <li> This product is just right for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Finding an SLS free bubble bath that works and smells good is hard but necessary for my skin.</li>
            <li> A significant part had leaked into the box and made a huge mess.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this gel</li>
            <li> Is gentle and not drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really survive the post workout shower test.  </li>
            <li> Avalon is a brand I really like.</li>
            <li> I really like this shower gel.</li>
            <li> I use this shower gel at night before bed and the whole bath becomes an experience that relaxes and allows you to drift off to sleep.</li>
            <li> Delivers fast</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but after shaving it makes me itch.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> I suggest you really research this product before buying it if you have allergies.</li>
            <li> Smells like real lavender but the product leaked out of the container all over the packaging.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 years because I like it so much.</li>
            <li> Quantity good for at least 2 months per bottle.</li>
            <li> They make clear which ingredients are organic and which aren&#x27;t right on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my new shower gel from here on out!</li>
            <li> my daughter thinks it is like regular shampoo but larger and more expensive!It should be cheaper.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I like this so much that when it goes on sale I buy several of the large size</li>
            <li> Note I don&#x27;t live in the</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser, so you won&#x27;t get much suds out of it, but i think it works well enough for me.</li>
            <li> I really like the updated packaging of the product, the old 32 ounce was an opaque container that you could not see into to estimate how much product was left.</li>
            <li> the only thing i would add is for Amazon to use a little more TLC on packaging.  </li>
            <li> Great scent but the product cold be improved by the addition of some moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I use this bath gel for my daughter who has extremely sensitive skin and eczema, as a bubble bath.</li>
            <li> I saw 32oz on the ordering page (and 32oz arrived), so it looks like they fixed it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten use to the almost heavily lemon like smell that cuts into the lavender scent (it has a hint of the Mr. Clean brand smell I grew up with - yikes).</li>
            <li> This large bottle goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The new packaging is still green but clear making it much easier to estimate when you need to reorder.</li>
            <li> I do get more compliments when I use the cheaper shampoos and soaps because they are perfumed, but I prefer to not have a perfume that has unhealthy ingredients.  </li>
            <li> If the nozzle was more robust and made of tougher plastic, it might not have broken during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only problem was the packaging, as some of the liquid had leaked out, not too much but still, you could wish not to loose any by the time it reaches your place.</li>
            <li> Hard to feel clean without any bubbles.</li>
            <li> We use this for our kids in the bath and it cleans well as well as not dry out their skin.  </li>
            <li> I guess with natural products, the scent does not linger as long.  </li>
            <li> Great product, been using it daily for a natural mosquito repellent since mosquitoes apparently don&#x27;t like lavender.</li>
            <li> It is good and bad</li>
            <li> : good because there are no preservatives; bad because it is wasteful if it &#x27;expires&#x27;</li>
            <li> It has very little suds so mentally you feel like you need more than you actually do, but use sparingly as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Bubbles last just long enough.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last you a long time!</li>
            <li> I occasionally branch out to other products but come back to this each time.  </li>
            <li> Once out of the shower, the smell lingers just a little bit longer, there are no heavy perfumes or dyes.</li>
            <li> the same it has smelled to us for the last year and a half</li>
            <li> but I got bitten by insects so quickly that I was afraid of going outside.</li>
            <li> Smell is a little too much and hardly foams up.  </li>
            <li> Especially when I come in to the house after doing heavy yard work.  </li>
            <li> My personal preference is for the rosemary sent but that is not available in the 32 oz size.  </li>
            <li> The pump nozzle is far too thin compared to other such products, and is made of a plastic that feels rather brittle.</li>
            <li> also did not help is that the 32 ounce bottle (heavy) was just wrapped in a bubble sheet and thrown inside a carton that was too big (with other items)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that if I use it and then shave my legs or my arm pits</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is calming and helps settle them down before bed.</li>
            <li> You can lower the price to a little over $12 buying 4 of them due to shipping cost per unit at the time of this review (Vitacost).</li>
            <li> Ever since we started using it, we have less skin irritations.</li>
            <li> but it is a little bit too liquid</li>
            <li> One star missing as it is not rosemary which may be overly picky</li>
            <li> I could stand in the door way a few minutes talking with my neighbor and I would get a few bites.</li>
            <li> A few women complained about bites on their legs and arms, but I didn&#x27;t get any</li>
            <li> The tops of two of the last four 32oz bottles we got didn&#x27;t pop up (BROKEN PUMPs), poor quality control.</li>
            <li> Thus I assume a bad batch went out in the past or there was a temporary formula change in the past.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time, but the pump was broken, so I did not even get a chance to try it.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> It smells bad and leaked all over the place when I received it.</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t have any nasty stuff in it</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Winderful stuff! Clean with a lavender after aroma.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last you a long time! The smell is great, not too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap does not irritate and is calming.</li>
            <li> This bottle is HUGE; be forewarned. Nice fragrance of lavendar. I love the Avalon Lemon and Lavendar products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It seems good, no irritation, no crap in it! This is my new shower gel from here on out!</li>
            <li> Great product, been using it daily for a natural mosquito repellent since mosquitoes apparently don&#x27;t like lavender. Haven&#x27;t been bit once since I started using it. Smells wonderful, too.</li>
            <li> Great scent but the product cold be improved by the addition of some moisturizer.  Do not know if I would buy again.</li>
            <li> First of all, when I received this product it was leaking all over the place. you get a lot of product for the price and I love that it is a natural option. It foams relatively well, but the scent is not what I was expecting. I love lavender, but this version is not my favorite. I was just say it is an \\&quot;ok\\&quot; product...didn&#x27;t blow my socks off.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of Lavender in this body wash, it smells natural and strong enough so that the smell relaxes you as you shower. It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser, so you won&#x27;t get much suds out of it, but i think it works well enough for me. Good if you don&#x27;t need a really sudsy wash, or if you need that &#x27;squeaky-clean&#x27; feeling.</li>
            <li> I order this as one of my Subscribe and Save items. I wanted to go more natural with my body products and I like Avalon products. This gets nice and sudzy, smells good, rinses off and does not make my skin stripped of oil.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it and that it is chemical -free as well as nearly 100% organic. The price pointis great as well. Ever since we started using it, we have less skin irritations. The only thing is that the bottle says we are to discard it after the bottle has been opened for 12 months. It is good and bad: good because there are no preservatives; bad because it is wasteful if it &#x27;expires&#x27;; however, we have always managed to use it all within a year so hadn&#x27;t had to face the dilemma of whether to risk it or not after 12 months of use.</li>
            <li> This is a very light and refreshing natural body and bath shower gel. Avalon organics is well known for their products and the quality of the ingredient s that they use in the manufacturing process. I really like the smell of this gel, it is light and not overpowering in any way. The soap itself kind of reminds me of that natural casteel soap by Dr. Bonner. I like this so much that when it goes on sale I buy several of the large size so I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out. NSF/ANSI 305 certified organic.</li>
            <li> Love this shower gel.  Beautiful fragrance while showering but not overpowering after the shower.  Is gentle and not drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice lather ! Lavender smell not that pronounced.</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS SUPERB AND CLEANS GREAT TOO. I LIKE THE FACIAL GEL LAVENDER CLEANSER, THAT really SMELLS GREAT ALSO. AND IT&#x27;S AN ECONOMICAL BUY. THIS IS A QUALITY PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;AND THE GLYCERIN IS OF A VEGETABLE SOURCE, NOT AN ANIMAL SOURCE.IT&#x27;S IN THE GLOSSARY ON AVALONORGANICS.COM</li>
            <li> Tried this after I tried EO soap (which I didn&#x27;t like at all).  This is just ok.  Smells good, foams well, but I don&#x27;t think it cleans well.  It doesn&#x27;t really survive the post workout shower test.  I have tried several fragrance free body washes and they all worked better than this.</li>
            <li> Avalon is a brand I really like. natural, smells good and leaves the skin smooth, fresh and soft.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem was the packaging, as some of the liquid had leaked out, not too much but still, you could wish not to loose any by the time it reaches your place.</li>
            <li> A spa experience. Smells heavenly, suds nicely and rinses easily.</li>
            <li> I really like this shower gel. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and leaves me feeling clean. I like the smell. I use the matching lotion too.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I feel clean after using it in the shower or bath.  Especially when I come in to the house after doing heavy yard work.  The Lavender is a soothing scent.</li>
            <li> Has a shooting effect. Love it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice but slightly medicine smell, the lavender is really smelling the way is w/o the perfumes covering the smell. It does not lather well, better used with a puff scrub.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. The scent is equally nice for a man or woman. The lavender is sweet and fresh. I use this shower gel at night before bed and the whole bath becomes an experience that relaxes and allows you to drift off to sleep. I will reorder as needed.</li>
            <li> This is good but not so great my daughter thinks it is like regular shampoo but larger and more expensive!It should be cheaper.</li>
            <li> was a gift and they loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, this review is for the lavender. This is the only body wash I can use that will not dehydrate my skin and leave me flaky. It has very little suds so mentally you feel like you need more than you actually do, but use sparingly as a little goes a long way. I really like the updated packaging of the product, the old 32 ounce was an opaque container that you could not see into to estimate how much product was left. The new packaging is still green but clear making it much easier to estimate when you need to reorder. Thank you for that!</li>
            <li> smells nice but the ingredients are not as good as it seems looking at the front of the bottle. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this bath gel for my daughter who has extremely sensitive skin and eczema, as a bubble bath. The smell isn&#x27;t super strong, which is great for us! Bubbles last just long enough. A great product I will continue to buy again and again.</li>
            <li> This group, the Lavendar herbal one, among Avalon&#x27;s products is my favorite.  I have used the bath shower gel and the shampoo for years.  I occasionally branch out to other products but come back to this each time.  Incidentally I don&#x27;t use the conditioner -- only because any of the conditioners/moisturizers leave my hair too oily.</li>
            <li> great stuff. Delivers fast</li>
            <li> Smells great, our whole family washes with this, including the dogs :)</li>
            <li> I like to use organic and natural products and am pleased that this shower soap is available on Amazon for a reasonable price.  I guess with natural products, the scent does not linger as long.  I do get more compliments when I use the cheaper shampoos and soaps because they are perfumed, but I prefer to not have a perfume that has unhealthy ingredients.  This soap has plenty of suds and the scent is nice.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  You don&#x27;t have to worry about squeeze bottles, dispenser is perfect ~ perfect size ~ perfect smell and it looks great too!  Couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it... the only thing i would add is for Amazon to use a little more TLC on packaging.  These bigger, heavier products need it.</li>
            <li> I love this shower gel, however the most recent delivery was leaking. A significant part had leaked into the box and made a huge mess. Perhaps place it in a sealed bag to ship?</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the use of this soap for shower use.</li>
            <li> Nice shower gel. .Pleasant scent and nice ingredients.</li>
            <li> was leaking on arrival</li>
            <li> This body wash smells very light, very pleasant and not overpowering. Once out of the shower, the smell lingers just a little bit longer, there are no heavy perfumes or dyes. It leathers ok as it is natural there is not much foam. Overall. I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Does not smell well.smells chemically  he will not buy again</li>
            <li> This review is for the packaging and shipping - not for the product. The item arrived on time, but the pump was broken, so I did not even get a chance to try it. Returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is an issue with the pump design/ manufacturing and the shipping packaging. The pump nozzle is far too thin compared to other such products, and is made of a plastic that feels rather brittle. If the nozzle was more robust and made of tougher plastic, it might not have broken during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What also did not help is that the 32 ounce bottle (heavy) was just wrapped in a bubble sheet and thrown inside a carton that was too big (with other items) - so it clearly moved around in transit and clearly the pump nozzle is not designed for that kind of ride and shocks. At a minimum, a rigid packaging around the pump is needed for such shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a shame that I have to return this product without trying it in the bath. I just took a bit and washed my hands and loved the feel and fragrance. Would love to get a replacement, but the only option was return - so be it.</li>
            <li> Lavendar is my most favorite scent, so when Avalon came out with their Bath and Shower Gel in lavendar, of course I had to have some. It smells like I&#x27;m in a gigantic field of lavendar....and it&#x27;s so relaxing.</li>
            <li> big bottle, smells good.</li>
            <li> I love bubble baths. Finding an SLS free bubble bath that works and smells good is hard but necessary for my skin. My personal preference is for the rosemary sent but that is not available in the 32 oz size.  The smell of the lavender is nice, the bubbles are good and using the gel in the shower is great. Gets you clean, smells good and does not give me dermatitis. Pretty much everything I could ask for in a body wash. One star missing as it is not rosemary which may be overly picky but ah well.</li>
            <li> There is a belief that in order to feel clean there must be suds. Though Avalon does have suds it is the closes product, unless you make your own soap, to natural good for your skin and environment product.</li>
            <li> I love Avalon products so much.  The shower/bath gel works great, wonderful scent and doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It smells bad and leaked all over the place when I received it.But it has pretty good feel when using it.</li>
            <li> Love the product, been using it for years.  Keeps your skin soft and smooth.  Rinses off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or sticky.  Helps with the winter time itching.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Does not smell of lavender. It&#x27;s more &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smelling.</li>
            <li> Love how it feels on my skin and does not leave it dry. I personally like fragrant body washes and this one just smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This smells good and is organic and is a good product. I like it and will probably get it again. It helps me unwind</li>
            <li> this shower gel is awesome; I love the light lavender fragrance and the silky feel of the gel. it is also very economical.</li>
            <li> Great product - lots of bubbles, great fragrance, have used it for years.  Quantity good for at least 2 months per bottle.</li>
            <li> Review for Avalon Bath and Shower Gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ISSUE:&lt;br /&gt;-------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The tops of two of the last four 32oz bottles we got didn&#x27;t pop up (BROKEN PUMPs), poor quality control. Be sure to TEST the bottles you get right away so as to have a simple and free exchange experience if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Vitacost sent us two replacement bottles so thumbs up for Avalon and/or the Vitacost for customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTES:&lt;br /&gt;-------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A reviewer noted that he detected the smell changed. It smells now (2013) the same it has smelled to us for the last year and a half or so we have used it, lemon lavendery (more lavendery). Thus I assume a bad batch went out in the past or there was a temporary formula change in the past. However, I&#x27;d say if you buy it now you are probably okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A reviewer saw 12oz on the ordering page instead of 32oz. I saw 32oz on the ordering page (and 32oz arrived), so it looks like they fixed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Avalon describes this as 70% Organic. That may or may not be organic enough for you, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- They make clear which ingredients are organic and which aren&#x27;t right on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You can lower the price to a little over $12 buying 4 of them due to shipping cost per unit at the time of this review (Vitacost).</li>
            <li> Great shower gel. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it is just as special every night as it was the very first time.</li>
            <li> It lathers up well with a buff puff, smells divine, washes well, makes my skin feel smooth. Does a great job and has real oil of lavender in it. I buy a giant size about once every six months so it&#x27;s great value and knowing its  organic makes my skin feel happier as you absorb anything you put on your skin. I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;d eat this stuff but knowing I &#x27;could&#x27; is reassuring.</li>
            <li> This is only lotion I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> I only gave this a 3 because the soap was leaking inside of the package. Maybe a seal on the top will prevent this awesome product from receiving anything below a 4 star.</li>
            <li> Outstanding price, love the pump top, smells great, even guys will love it, gotta hide it from the wife :--d</li>
            <li> I love this product but it is too expensive, buying it here lowered the cost.</li>
            <li> I like going outside but I got bitten by insects so quickly that I was afraid of going outside. I could stand in the door way a few minutes talking with my neighbor and I would get a few bites. Note I don&#x27;t live in the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I started using this Lavender Shower gel, I don&#x27;t get bites any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, I went to a family gathering outside in the yard. A few women complained about bites on their legs and arms, but I didn&#x27;t get any and I was wearing a dress and short sleeves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve introduced this wonderful Lavender shower gel to them and I&#x27;ve ordered more for my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Lavender!</li>
            <li> This large bottle goes a long way.  The cost is awesome!  Smells wonderful and I always feel clean and fresh after showering with this. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the product and the timely manner in which it arrived. Thank you</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift. My friend loved it!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but after shaving it makes me itch.  It smells and feels great going on in the shower.  My only complaint is that if I use it and then shave my legs or my arm pits then I&#x27;m frantically itchy for the next several days.  Would love if the manufacturer could figure out the issue and fix this problem.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I will definitely be buying again once my runs out! The smell is great!</li>
            <li> I have the lemon scented gel and love it. It does the job and has a true lemon scent. It goes on easily and does the job. Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> Smell is a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> As others have said it doesnt have as much lavender as i thought I might want, but the mixture is refreshing, invigorating and i feel sort of squeaky clean, as opposed to perfumed clean...if that makes sense to anyone. I will definitely keep using this...have it on subscribe and save :)</li>
            <li> We use this for our kids in the bath and it cleans well as well as not dry out their skin.  The lavender scent is calming and helps settle them down before bed.</li>
            <li> I love this Bath Gel...very natural lavender fragerance.</li>
            <li> I love this shower gel, nice fragrance, lovely feel on the skin. I would like more lavender fragrance, but for the low price, this was an excellent choice. Very fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> I love the lather, the fragrance, and couldn&#x27;t pass up a discount.  I like the size and the pump, SO handy.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with this product.  I felt like it transported my shower stall into a spa.  After scrubbing up with this, especially the bottoms of my feet, then rinsing, I felt totally clean and fresh, but most of all I felt relaxed and refreshed and smelling like a field of lavender on a sunny day, the feeling you get at a spa.  So now I&#x27;m placing my own order for this product, which has become my favorite shower gel.  32 ounces lasted an entire year, but I did rotate it with my former-favorite shower gels.</li>
            <li> I love the price and the fact that the gel suds well. It also has a slickness to it which always helps with avoiding cuts when shaving. I find it does not leave a residue on your skin. However, the scent was recently reformulated and does not smell truly lavender like it once did. I&#x27;ve gotten use to the almost heavily lemon like smell that cuts into the lavender scent (it has a hint of the Mr. Clean brand smell I grew up with - yikes). I do have a highly sensitive reaction to smells, so perhaps for many this isn&#x27;t an issue. I am still using this gel due to the great price, and would have given it 5 stars if the scent was not changed.</li>
            <li> Both my Mom and my Sister loved this stuff!  They said the smell was amazing and they really liked the organic  bath gel.</li>
            <li> I suggest you really research this product before buying it if you have allergies.</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance.  Smells like real lavender but the product leaked out of the container all over the packaging.</li>
            <li> These products smell like chemicals. . . . Not that fresh light lavender scent that I love. . . . And with only 70% organic ingredients, I don&#x27;t even know why they put organic in the name ! I will be switching back to alaffia products, which are actually organic and smell good! Not to mention alaffia is cheaper.</li>
            <li> When Norfolk Lavender discontinued its bath and shower gel, I didn&#x27;t care for the scent of the Cotswald Lavender which was offered so took a leap of faith with Avalon Organics.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the scent of the product, its friendly packaging (break resistant and easy to dispense with the pump) and the value.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Helps with mosquitos but not all the way. Love the foaming and smell. Great product!</li>
            <li> I like it but it is a little bit too liquid</li>
            <li> This shower gel is very gentle and smell great! Our whole family love it very much !</li>
            <li> This is a great shower gel! It smells great and has good ingredients, which is what I wanted in a shower gel.  I&#x27;ll likely keep buying this brand, but may try different scents from time to time.</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> I like it because it is quite pure.  The smell is a bit undesirably strong, but only when using. Doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Smell is a little too much and hardly foams up.  Hard to feel clean without any bubbles.</li>
            <li> My kids have very sensitive skin, this is great in the bath or shower.  No reaction whatsoever.  Plus it doesn&#x27;t have any nasty stuff in it so you can feel good about using it even if you&#x27;re made of leather ;) Love the high volume size.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  Organic and smells wonderful.  I always get compliments on how great I smell.</li>
            <li> the package is broken。</li>
            <li> Smells great, good and simple ingredient list. Seems gentler on my skin than most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and loved this product for years, but the latest bottle I received smells off. I don&#x27;t know if the product itself changed, or if the gel is just spoiled. At any rate, I can&#x27;t use it, and since I&#x27;ve opened it, I can&#x27;t return it. I&#x27;ll find another use for this, and I won&#x27;t order it again. Sad.</li>
            <li> I love the lavender scent - its just right.  A couple squirts on a bath sponge and it soaps up nice.  This product is just right for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 years because I like it so much.</li>
