            <li>I love the selection of these nail plates.</li>
            <li>They have some adorable patterns and pictures.</li>
            <li>sure others would like it.</li>
            <li>but I still love it.</li>
            <li>Even though I use the love elements set more</li>
            <li>I would put this one at the TOP of my list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the pueen plates and have all three series.</li>
            <li>I was amaze by al the cute stamp.</li>
            <li>and it really has nice designs good mix of all variety of designs</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I still kept them : )</li>
            <li>Way better</li>
            <li>I love these stamps.</li>
            <li>I love the case that they came in, keeps them from falling out.</li>
            <li>The stamps are etched deeper so there is more time to position the image.</li>
            <li>love these stamping plates and the album they came in.</li>
            <li>I love the images.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try more.</li>
            <li>so I was so excited to get and try out designs, since I love doing my own nails.</li>
            <li>Some very unique.</li>
            <li>They are so unique and really nice.</li>
            <li>They can all be mixed up on you nails and blend nicely, I&#x27;ve loved all the preen stamp sets I own!</li>
            <li>own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The designs are refreshing and nice, but many of them aren&#x27;t very crisply designed.</li>
            <li>I love the original designs on many of the plates.</li>
            <li>WOW, these are great quality.</li>
            <li>set is also free of the \\&quot;tip designs\\&quot; which I don&#x27;t use, and in turn has much more full-nail</li>
            <li>i love this stamp set soo much!!!</li>
            <li>the images are clear and the fine detail is great.</li>
            <li>They won&#x27;t fit my thumbs but are probably fine for many people.</li>
            <li>It was easy to see the image, choose it, pick it up on the stamp, then put it on my nails.</li>
            <li>This can easily become an addiction.</li>
            <li>However, I think the full image Pueens would be a better bet (they are numbered somewhere in the 70s, where as this has plates 1-25).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love all the full images.</li>
            <li>The storage case was pretty nice too, except the color was undesireable.</li>
            <li>most of the plates are full finger stamps</li>
            <li>But I think if you know how to handle these image plates, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>but i don´t know if some of them are so fine that it dosen´t transfer to the stamper well</li>
            <li>Most however are very pretty and stamp well.</li>
            <li>The quality is great, and I have had success using all the ones that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Picking up the image with any stamper is a breeze and they clean easily.  </li>
            <li>They are of great quality and come with a pad in the back.</li>
            <li>They work well and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>i got them for 17.99 with free 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li>They will fit some of my longer nails, so that is a plus, and they&#x27;re wider than some designs in this height.</li>
            <li>Tested 3 designs and the were fabulous.</li>
            <li>nice product, I like so much</li>
            <li>importantly though, I really enjoy the designs...</li>
            <li>The plates work perfectly but one of the plates was missing</li>
            <li>I am still learning but cant wait to try all the fabulous stamp art.  </li>
            <li>Not a paper box stating it was a case but a real leather case with each plate is inside its own sheet protector.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the patterns and overall quality.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved them and I would totally buy more plates from this company...</li>
            <li>Super fun and easy to use!</li>
            <li>The plates are super easy to use.</li>
            <li>these have alot of fun desines 4 ur nails!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>I ordered this set the same time I ordered the love elements set (#&#x27;s 26-49) and I love this!</li>
            <li>Such a nice product!  </li>
            <li>Unique designs.  </li>
            <li>love the images and how crisp the image comes out.</li>
            <li>The design without the cutout is the exact size of MASH images, which should work for most people with short-medium length nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, but hope the designers clean up some of the designs that aren&#x27;t very crisp.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, but hope the designers clean up some of the designs that aren&#x27;t very crisp.</li>
            <li>update: contacted seller, they sent missing plates, happy once again :)</li>
            <li>This set is chock full of a variety of full nail designs (my favorite type), and all work amazingly well with both special polishes and regular nail polishes.  </li>
            <li>By the way, I did not use special polish.  </li>
            <li>You DO NOT need any special stamping polish.  </li>
            <li>They have several beautiful design and the design stamp really well</li>
            <li>I received these plates sooner than expected and they all stamp great.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have words , i love them so so much.</li>
            <li>Overall the plates and customer experience is good.  </li>
            <li>This was my first stamp set and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>The rose pattern on 22 isn&#x27;t very clear and they pretty much look like blobs, so as much as I love roses</li>
            <li>I love finding new stamping plates to play with!</li>
            <li>I definitely need more practice with them and maybe a better stamper</li>
            <li>The designs are super, varied, something for everyone.</li>
            <li>I use a Konad double-ended stamper, and these plates worked for me the very first time I ever tried stamping.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty collection of stamps.</li>
            <li>so Much I bought 1 of Each Set!!</li>
            <li>Lots of different and cute designs!</li>
            <li>The fact that the images are gigantic kind of annoys me, because I usually can&#x27;t get some gorgeous detailing onto my nails, but I try not to mind it too much.</li>
            <li>I am a newb to stamping and picked it up the first time I did it, so they are pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have large nails, and the whole nail designs fit my nails just fine.  </li>
            <li>This plates are great images are neat wide variety of designs love them can&#x27;t get enough of them</li>
            <li>They are not thin and flimsy like others I have and they work the best with the least amount of effort.  </li>
            <li>these plates are definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I thought it was worth noting though.</li>
            <li>However, many of them don&#x27;t seem complete because of the size of the etched image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far i love them.  </li>
            <li>However, it thought it was worth noting that the case the plates come in is not what is shown in the photos.</li>
            <li>Some of the detailed designs are crisp, so they just need to get consistent with this.</li>
            <li>Some of the detailed designs are crisp, so they just need to get consistent with this.</li>
            <li>I say overall, a pretty good set for first generation.</li>
            <li>but, since I never had the old one, I am glad I waited.</li>
            <li>Stamps are great - haven&#x27;t had any issues as far as picking up the entire stamp, they come out super crisp and pretty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First and foremost great correspondence and Less than 4 day delivery.</li>
            <li>plus the price is right</li>
            <li>These came pretty quick after I ordered them and is my first stamping plates</li>
            <li>A few of the images ended up being too short for my nails because of the curved bottom, but otherwise I was very happy.  </li>
            <li>The plates arrived in less than a week, in good condition, and PUEEN includes a nice-free storage case.  </li>
            <li>These are my first stamping plates, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare them to, but so far I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>The Images come off CLEAN CRISP AND CLEAR!!</li>
            <li>#20 (bottom image, one of the best ones, is obviously off center, #24 (top and right image off center), #23 (top image off center), #21 (bottom and right image off-center).</li>
            <li>These are my second ones and they seem to be better than the Shanty ones I bought.  </li>
            <li>I musta been orbiting another planet with my first critique....</li>
            <li>The designs are so pretty.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>If not, try MoYou or UberChic, both of which have better overall quality than this set of Pueens.</li>
            <li>For some of the images, you can tell online that they aren&#x27;t exactly centered, so look really closely as you shop!</li>
            <li>Like most Image plates these have the paper backing with Pueens website on the back.</li>
            <li>We love all the different  images ..</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>These were my first nail stamps I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>(the images are slightly larger and I love the swirls and lace images)</li>
            <li>These plates have some really cute designs but I have one plate (#14) that is totally defective.  </li>
            <li>but if you use a higher end or stamping polish you wont even know.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>These are beautiful nail art images, and very different from other stamping nail art brands.  </li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s not a plate I&#x27;ll use since I have nicer rose designs from other brands of sets.</li>
            <li>The most annoying thing, though, is that some of the best designs are obviosuly off-center.</li>
            <li>Very impressed with the designs, although plate 24 is too blurry for me to use, this seems to be a common issue, and the only reason I didn&#x27;t rate 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Great products but the full nail images are a bit small for larger nails.</li>
            <li>I have many sets from several different brands, and my Pueen plates are the most used by far of any brand in my collection.  </li>
            <li>The storage &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; has plastic sleeves which do their job, although easily stained by the protective blue film on the plates.</li>
            <li>All 25 came in lil packages with the blue film which was easy to take off.</li>
            <li>All of the plates I received work well, but they&#x27;re rather large for my fingers.</li>
            <li>Many of the patterns aren&#x27;t centered, like the left side design on 18, the right side design on 24, left on 22, right on</li>
            <li>Many of the patterns aren&#x27;t centered, like the left side design on 18, the right side design on 24, left on 22, right on</li>
            <li>If you have longer nails, the new 24E set has images that are both larger and don&#x27;t have the half-moon void, so you might be better off with that set.</li>
            <li>think they stamp very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like all the stamping plates as are for a whole nail design.</li>
            <li>Do some research and find out if these stamps will cover your whole nail before you buy.  </li>
            <li>I use maybe 1/3 of them with a reasonable amount of consistency.</li>
            <li>They stamp very well.</li>
            <li>so I could use the whole design or mask off part of my nail to do a tip myself if that&#x27;s what I want, but to each their</li>
            <li>I really like that it came with a case.</li>
            <li>they fit all my nails, except my big toe.</li>
            <li>I wanna use when I wanna use it and find the plates fast and efficiently.)</li>
            <li>Also fast shipping and well packed.</li>
            <li>absolutely i recomend this set</li>
            <li>They were wrapped very well.</li>
            <li>I gave five stars because PUEEN appears to really care about customer satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>These plates are very clear and crisp.  </li>
            <li>I actually just ordered the 2013 set of 25 plates in the powder blue case, I love these so much!  </li>
            <li>Other than that, no problems whatsoever stamping with this set, and I&#x27;ve used it many times.</li>
            <li>The designs are deep enough that they leave sharp, beautiful pictures on my nails.  </li>
            <li>I will enjoy these plates for a long time.</li>
            <li>The images are crisp and clear when stamped.</li>
            <li>This plate set is nice but the images are small.</li>
            <li>The plates  used so far have given me crisp images</li>
            <li>- This particular set of stamps does not seem to have very good pick up on two different stampers that I have tired.  </li>
            <li>I stamped roughly one full image per plate, and they stamped pretty decently.</li>
            <li>You get high quality plates and a protective case to hold your plates in.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>High quality plates.</li>
            <li>The images are great, a little shallow on the image but not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become a little bit of an obsession :-).  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s a convenient little case</li>
            <li>I love this little set.</li>
            <li>I gravitate towards &#x27;mature&#x27; day-to-day wearable designs and really like the images in this</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised as to how fast they came in the mail.  </li>
            <li>all plates work  so far am very satisfy with my purchase</li>
            <li>But I found that if you have big nail beds that the images want completely cover your nail especially my thumb nail, but I&#x27;m okay with it</li>
            <li>Being a new company, they stepped up to the plate with quality and design, and I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>I guess I must have really tiny hands though, because half of the full image can fit on my nails if I stamp the image horizontally and not vertically</li>
            <li>I am new to all this, so maybe a week of experience was all it took.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to stamping, this is the set to buy.  </li>
            <li>I know this is supposed to be the new and improved set</li>
            <li>It is much more obvious than I would have expected whent</li>
            <li>I am very much looking forward to the next set which I hope comes out soon!</li>
            <li>I would advise everyone to purchase these plates directly from the website to ensure the high quality of this product...</li>
            <li>The images stamp really well and very cleanly, even the really delicate looking patterns.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the first Pueen set I&#x27;ve bought, and I doubt it will be the last.</li>
            <li>I have several plate sets from several different manufacturers, and you WILL NOT get a better bang for your buck than you do with the PUEEN sets.  </li>
            <li>though, it is addictive ;-)  </li>
            <li>Im glad this set didnt have a bunch of french tip images like other sets.</li>
            <li>I got all 25 with no missing or repeated plates!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The images come out crisp and the design surfaces are large enough to cover the entire nail.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>Personally, I would rather have each design large and square at the bottom</li>
            <li>I received these plates today and as soon as I took the blue tape off, some already had large scratches across them.</li>
            <li>and this set makes professional results even for me with no training</li>
            <li>I concur with much of the commentary made by &amp;#34;Shirley&amp;#34; in terms of the crispness and centering of several of the designs.</li>
            <li>I always use a plastic scraper (an old debit card)</li>
            <li>The etching is completely smudged and unusable.  </li>
            <li>When a plate is too deep, too much polish stays on the plate for transfer.  </li>
            <li>And something is amiss with the top two rows of the right side design on plate 03 - hard to explain, but there are lines in the repeating design that don&#x27;t look like they belong there and aren&#x27;t in the other rows of the pattern.</li>
            <li>My mom has tiny thumbs and it barely covers her whole nail.  </li>
            <li>I do not have huge nails, but I cannot use these stamps on my thumb because the stamp patterns are too small.  </li>
            <li>But I have yet to find any brand that makes them big enough for big toenails, so it&#x27;s not a disappointment.</li>
            <li>When I first saw these plates I thought the price was a little high.</li>
            <li>and the Triquetra (a Celtic Trinity Knot) to be the new images on next set of plates to come out.</li>
            <li>(although, since I usually have long nails, I stamp vertically most of the time).</li>
            <li>Fantastic plates but a few of the designs aren&#x27;t engraved deeply enough so they don&#x27;t stamp well.</li>
            <li>The plates have backing so no sharp edges.</li>
            <li>- This is my major issue with this set.  </li>
            <li>I think Pueen are my favorite plates lately!</li>
            <li>but like many other people, I got two of one of the plates and am missing another.</li>
            <li>There are definitely some issues that should be fixed though.</li>
            <li>The image is so deeply edged in you can feel it completely with just your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There should be a frequent customer discount or lighten up on the price for the next sets.</li>
            <li>#8 (top design has squares that are uneven, #14 (the left image is off center),</li>
            <li>The storage case was a nice touch, but I wasnt expecting it, and its a little hard to look through</li>
            <li>What I was most disappointed in was that on a couple plates there appears to be slight scratches, one plate in particular was scratched through the blue plastic peel off covering the plate and left a line on the cute pineapple design.</li>
            <li>There is a clear star on the upper left edge of the design, which is not likely to make it onto a nail because it&#x27;s in the corner.</li>

            <li> I love the case that they came in, keeps them from falling out.</li>
            <li> The stamps are etched deeper so there is more time to position the image.</li>
            <li> love these stamping plates and the album they came in.</li>
            <li> I love the images.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try more.</li>
            <li> so I was so excited to get and try out designs, since I love doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> Some very unique.</li>
            <li> They are so unique and really nice.</li>
            <li> They can all be mixed up on you nails and blend nicely, I&#x27;ve loved all the preen stamp sets I own!</li>
            <li> own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The designs are refreshing and nice, but many of them aren&#x27;t very crisply designed.</li>
            <li> I love the original designs on many of the plates.</li>
            <li> WOW, these are great quality.</li>
            <li> set is also free of the \\&quot;tip designs\\&quot; which I don&#x27;t use, and in turn has much more full-nail</li>
            <li> i love this stamp set soo much!!!</li>
            <li> the images are clear and the fine detail is great.</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t fit my thumbs but are probably fine for many people.</li>
            <li> It was easy to see the image, choose it, pick it up on the stamp, then put it on my nails.</li>
            <li> This can easily become an addiction.</li>
            <li> However, I think the full image Pueens would be a better bet (they are numbered somewhere in the 70s, where as this has plates 1-25).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love all the full images.</li>
            <li> The storage case was pretty nice too, except the color was undesireable.</li>
            <li> most of the plates are full finger stamps</li>
            <li> But I think if you know how to handle these image plates, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> but i don´t know if some of them are so fine that it dosen´t transfer to the stamper well</li>
            <li> Most however are very pretty and stamp well.</li>
            <li> The quality is great, and I have had success using all the ones that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Picking up the image with any stamper is a breeze and they clean easily.  </li>
            <li> They are of great quality and come with a pad in the back.</li>
            <li> They work well and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> i got them for 17.99 with free 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li> They will fit some of my longer nails, so that is a plus, and they&#x27;re wider than some designs in this height.</li>
            <li> Tested 3 designs and the were fabulous.</li>
            <li> nice product, I like so much</li>
            <li> importantly though, I really enjoy the designs...</li>
            <li> The plates work perfectly but one of the plates was missing</li>
            <li> I am still learning but cant wait to try all the fabulous stamp art.  </li>
            <li> Not a paper box stating it was a case but a real leather case with each plate is inside its own sheet protector.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the patterns and overall quality.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loved them and I would totally buy more plates from this company...</li>
            <li> Super fun and easy to use!</li>
            <li> The plates are super easy to use.</li>
            <li> these have alot of fun desines 4 ur nails!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> I ordered this set the same time I ordered the love elements set (#&#x27;s 26-49) and I love this!</li>
            <li> Such a nice product!  </li>
            <li> Unique designs.  </li>
            <li> love the images and how crisp the image comes out.</li>
            <li> The design without the cutout is the exact size of MASH images, which should work for most people with short-medium length nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, but hope the designers clean up some of the designs that aren&#x27;t very crisp.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, but hope the designers clean up some of the designs that aren&#x27;t very crisp.</li>
            <li> update: contacted seller, they sent missing plates, happy once again :)</li>
            <li> This set is chock full of a variety of full nail designs (my favorite type), and all work amazingly well with both special polishes and regular nail polishes.  </li>
            <li> By the way, I did not use special polish.  </li>
            <li> You DO NOT need any special stamping polish.  </li>
            <li> They have several beautiful design and the design stamp really well</li>
            <li> I received these plates sooner than expected and they all stamp great.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have words , i love them so so much.</li>
            <li> Overall the plates and customer experience is good.  </li>
            <li> This was my first stamp set and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> The rose pattern on 22 isn&#x27;t very clear and they pretty much look like blobs, so as much as I love roses</li>
            <li> I love finding new stamping plates to play with!</li>
            <li> I definitely need more practice with them and maybe a better stamper</li>
            <li> The designs are super, varied, something for everyone.</li>
            <li> I use a Konad double-ended stamper, and these plates worked for me the very first time I ever tried stamping.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty collection of stamps.</li>
            <li> so Much I bought 1 of Each Set!!</li>
            <li> Lots of different and cute designs!</li>
            <li> The fact that the images are gigantic kind of annoys me, because I usually can&#x27;t get some gorgeous detailing onto my nails, but I try not to mind it too much.</li>
            <li> I am a newb to stamping and picked it up the first time I did it, so they are pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have large nails, and the whole nail designs fit my nails just fine.  </li>
            <li> This plates are great images are neat wide variety of designs love them can&#x27;t get enough of them</li>
            <li> They are not thin and flimsy like others I have and they work the best with the least amount of effort.  </li>
            <li> these plates are definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I thought it was worth noting though.</li>
            <li> However, many of them don&#x27;t seem complete because of the size of the etched image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far i love them.  </li>
            <li> However, it thought it was worth noting that the case the plates come in is not what is shown in the photos.</li>
            <li> Some of the detailed designs are crisp, so they just need to get consistent with this.</li>
            <li> Some of the detailed designs are crisp, so they just need to get consistent with this.</li>
            <li> I say overall, a pretty good set for first generation.</li>
            <li> but, since I never had the old one, I am glad I waited.</li>
            <li> Stamps are great - haven&#x27;t had any issues as far as picking up the entire stamp, they come out super crisp and pretty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First and foremost great correspondence and Less than 4 day delivery.</li>
            <li> plus the price is right</li>
            <li> These came pretty quick after I ordered them and is my first stamping plates</li>
            <li> A few of the images ended up being too short for my nails because of the curved bottom, but otherwise I was very happy.  </li>
            <li> The plates arrived in less than a week, in good condition, and PUEEN includes a nice-free storage case.  </li>
            <li> These are my first stamping plates, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare them to, but so far I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> The Images come off CLEAN CRISP AND CLEAR!!</li>
            <li> #20 (bottom image, one of the best ones, is obviously off center, #24 (top and right image off center), #23 (top image off center), #21 (bottom and right image off-center).</li>
            <li> These are my second ones and they seem to be better than the Shanty ones I bought.  </li>
            <li> I musta been orbiting another planet with my first critique....</li>
            <li> The designs are so pretty.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> If not, try MoYou or UberChic, both of which have better overall quality than this set of Pueens.</li>
            <li> For some of the images, you can tell online that they aren&#x27;t exactly centered, so look really closely as you shop!</li>
            <li> Like most Image plates these have the paper backing with Pueens website on the back.</li>
            <li> We love all the different  images ..</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These were my first nail stamps I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> (the images are slightly larger and I love the swirls and lace images)</li>
            <li> These plates have some really cute designs but I have one plate (#14) that is totally defective.  </li>
            <li> but if you use a higher end or stamping polish you wont even know.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful nail art images, and very different from other stamping nail art brands.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s not a plate I&#x27;ll use since I have nicer rose designs from other brands of sets.</li>
            <li> The most annoying thing, though, is that some of the best designs are obviosuly off-center.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the designs, although plate 24 is too blurry for me to use, this seems to be a common issue, and the only reason I didn&#x27;t rate 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great products but the full nail images are a bit small for larger nails.</li>
            <li> I have many sets from several different brands, and my Pueen plates are the most used by far of any brand in my collection.  </li>
            <li> The storage &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; has plastic sleeves which do their job, although easily stained by the protective blue film on the plates.</li>
            <li> All 25 came in lil packages with the blue film which was easy to take off.</li>
            <li> All of the plates I received work well, but they&#x27;re rather large for my fingers.</li>
            <li> Many of the patterns aren&#x27;t centered, like the left side design on 18, the right side design on 24, left on 22, right on</li>
            <li> Many of the patterns aren&#x27;t centered, like the left side design on 18, the right side design on 24, left on 22, right on</li>
            <li> If you have longer nails, the new 24E set has images that are both larger and don&#x27;t have the half-moon void, so you might be better off with that set.</li>
            <li> think they stamp very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like all the stamping plates as are for a whole nail design.</li>
            <li> Do some research and find out if these stamps will cover your whole nail before you buy.  </li>
            <li> I use maybe 1/3 of them with a reasonable amount of consistency.</li>
            <li> They stamp very well.</li>
            <li> so I could use the whole design or mask off part of my nail to do a tip myself if that&#x27;s what I want, but to each their</li>
            <li> I really like that it came with a case.</li>
            <li> they fit all my nails, except my big toe.</li>
            <li> I wanna use when I wanna use it and find the plates fast and efficiently.)</li>
            <li> Also fast shipping and well packed.</li>
            <li> absolutely i recomend this set</li>
            <li> They were wrapped very well.</li>
            <li> I gave five stars because PUEEN appears to really care about customer satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> These plates are very clear and crisp.  </li>
            <li> I actually just ordered the 2013 set of 25 plates in the powder blue case, I love these so much!  </li>
            <li> Other than that, no problems whatsoever stamping with this set, and I&#x27;ve used it many times.</li>
            <li> The designs are deep enough that they leave sharp, beautiful pictures on my nails.  </li>
            <li> I will enjoy these plates for a long time.</li>
            <li> The images are crisp and clear when stamped.</li>
            <li> This plate set is nice but the images are small.</li>
            <li> The plates  used so far have given me crisp images</li>
            <li> - This particular set of stamps does not seem to have very good pick up on two different stampers that I have tired.  </li>
            <li> I stamped roughly one full image per plate, and they stamped pretty decently.</li>
            <li> You get high quality plates and a protective case to hold your plates in.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> High quality plates.</li>
            <li> The images are great, a little shallow on the image but not bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become a little bit of an obsession :-).  </li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s a convenient little case</li>
            <li> I love this little set.</li>
            <li> I gravitate towards &#x27;mature&#x27; day-to-day wearable designs and really like the images in this</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised as to how fast they came in the mail.  </li>
            <li> all plates work  so far am very satisfy with my purchase</li>
            <li> But I found that if you have big nail beds that the images want completely cover your nail especially my thumb nail, but I&#x27;m okay with it</li>
            <li> Being a new company, they stepped up to the plate with quality and design, and I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I guess I must have really tiny hands though, because half of the full image can fit on my nails if I stamp the image horizontally and not vertically</li>
            <li> I am new to all this, so maybe a week of experience was all it took.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to stamping, this is the set to buy.  </li>
            <li> I know this is supposed to be the new and improved set</li>
            <li> It is much more obvious than I would have expected whent</li>
            <li> I am very much looking forward to the next set which I hope comes out soon!</li>
            <li> I would advise everyone to purchase these plates directly from the website to ensure the high quality of this product...</li>
            <li> The images stamp really well and very cleanly, even the really delicate looking patterns.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the first Pueen set I&#x27;ve bought, and I doubt it will be the last.</li>
            <li> I have several plate sets from several different manufacturers, and you WILL NOT get a better bang for your buck than you do with the PUEEN sets.  </li>
            <li> though, it is addictive ;-)  </li>
            <li> Im glad this set didnt have a bunch of french tip images like other sets.</li>
            <li> I got all 25 with no missing or repeated plates!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The images come out crisp and the design surfaces are large enough to cover the entire nail.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> Personally, I would rather have each design large and square at the bottom</li>
            <li> I received these plates today and as soon as I took the blue tape off, some already had large scratches across them.</li>
            <li> and this set makes professional results even for me with no training</li>
            <li> I concur with much of the commentary made by &amp;#34;Shirley&amp;#34; in terms of the crispness and centering of several of the designs.</li>
            <li> I always use a plastic scraper (an old debit card)</li>
            <li> The etching is completely smudged and unusable.  </li>
            <li> When a plate is too deep, too much polish stays on the plate for transfer.  </li>
            <li> And something is amiss with the top two rows of the right side design on plate 03 - hard to explain, but there are lines in the repeating design that don&#x27;t look like they belong there and aren&#x27;t in the other rows of the pattern.</li>
            <li> My mom has tiny thumbs and it barely covers her whole nail.  </li>
            <li> I do not have huge nails, but I cannot use these stamps on my thumb because the stamp patterns are too small.  </li>
            <li> But I have yet to find any brand that makes them big enough for big toenails, so it&#x27;s not a disappointment.</li>
            <li> When I first saw these plates I thought the price was a little high.</li>
            <li> and the Triquetra (a Celtic Trinity Knot) to be the new images on next set of plates to come out.</li>
            <li> (although, since I usually have long nails, I stamp vertically most of the time).</li>
            <li> Fantastic plates but a few of the designs aren&#x27;t engraved deeply enough so they don&#x27;t stamp well.</li>
            <li> The plates have backing so no sharp edges.</li>
            <li> - This is my major issue with this set.  </li>
            <li> I think Pueen are my favorite plates lately!</li>
            <li> but like many other people, I got two of one of the plates and am missing another.</li>
            <li> There are definitely some issues that should be fixed though.</li>
            <li> The image is so deeply edged in you can feel it completely with just your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There should be a frequent customer discount or lighten up on the price for the next sets.</li>
            <li> #8 (top design has squares that are uneven, #14 (the left image is off center),</li>
            <li> The storage case was a nice touch, but I wasnt expecting it, and its a little hard to look through</li>
            <li> What I was most disappointed in was that on a couple plates there appears to be slight scratches, one plate in particular was scratched through the blue plastic peel off covering the plate and left a line on the cute pineapple design.</li>
            <li> There is a clear star on the upper left edge of the design, which is not likely to make it onto a nail because it&#x27;s in the corner.</li>
            <li> There is a clear star on the upper left edge of the design, which is not likely to make it onto a nail because it&#x27;s in the corner.</li>
            <li> The are large enough for an average nail but a little tight when doing the thumb nails.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they are worth the price.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high</li>
            <li> And they are long enough and wide enough for my long nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested all but a couple of the plates, and they all stamp very well, or at least as well as the design was executed and etched on the plates.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use those because I bought the Pueen pink big carrying case, so</li>
            <li> 15mm or 9/16 inches long if you don&#x27;t use the halfmoon part of the design).</li>
            <li> The plates are standard size (55mm) and the image sizes are all 13mm or .5 inches wide and 17mm or 11/16 inches long (</li>
            <li> I guess if you are new to this process, give the product a few tries before blasting the company.  </li>
            <li> The half moon on each image gives vareity for a possible french tip.</li>
            <li> These will last forever as long as you don&#x27;t attack or scratch against each other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happier with these plates than I have been with any other brand, and have already ordered my next set by Pueen.</li>
            <li> I am definitely gonna order the other collection.</li>
            <li> The plates are apparently sharp too, as my friend cut his finger trying to help me peel the blue sticker off of them.</li>
            <li> They are much bigger than my other stamping plates.</li>
            <li> I waited until the revised set was released due to initial reviews.  </li>
            <li> The design with overlapping stars on plate 24 doesn&#x27;t have a clear star placed in the center of the design, so once stamped on a nail, it&#x27;s not easy to figure out what the design is.</li>
            <li> The design with overlapping stars on plate 24 doesn&#x27;t have a clear star placed in the center of the design, so once stamped on a nail, it&#x27;s not easy to figure out what the design is.</li>
            <li> Well, I felt pretty bad about being kinda mean, so I tried the plates again, and I had 100% success with them!!  </li>
            <li> The leftmost design on plate 17 is one example - too much going on in one small space, and the result is a mess.</li>
            <li> , I use Orly French manicure for my white, and Confetti Black Tie for my black.  </li>
            <li> only con would be the little booklet type case it comes in.</li>
            <li> it has a few similar designs</li>
            <li> he plates are off center, expecially for the lacey one.</li>
            <li> Bought her a few different sets.</li>
            <li> Some of the images are blurred or not detailed enough &amp; the design is ruined because of that.</li>
            <li> will make the image on your nail look like you stamped it off center.</li>
            <li> Very vert small slight scratch on surface of ONE plate but doesnt effect stamping!!</li>
            <li> (I stamped every image on a plain white paper and kept it as a reference</li>
            <li> designs are on the small size - about 1.4 cm wide by 1.5 cm from the middle,</li>
            <li> they are not as sharp as some other stamping plates I purchase in eBay.</li>
            <li> i had a small kit before that only came with 5 disks but now wit these</li>
            <li> I saw people use the other plate</li>
            <li> The Essie metallics work extremely well</li>
            <li> This is my first set of stamping plates, so I&#x27;m unable to speak to how they perform in comparison to others.</li>
            <li> Regardless of the polish I&#x27;ve tried, whether it be stamping polish or any other I have laying around the house, the image won&#x27;t transfer.</li>
            <li> The curved area at the bottom is so you can use the designs as tips, but like other plates that do this, the design is not always well-placed at the bottom to work well for that.</li>
            <li> I had one duplicate plate and haven&#x27;t gotten it taken care of yet, but other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> The actual case is round and a little tight, but does the job.</li>
            <li> and I mean several sets from other companies to compare quality to with that said five stars is well deserved for Pueen 2013 set...</li>
            <li> So needless to say I have some good plates and So plates so badly done (image won&#x27;t stamp &amp;/or sharp edges)</li>
            <li> There are 25 plates so there were some empty pockets in the blue plate holder that confused me for a bit.</li>
            <li> If they didn&#x27;t have that half moon cut</li>
            <li> beforehand otherwise i&#x27;ll mess up my nails trying to sift through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it cuts off a little bit of the design</li>
            <li> The little cases are cheapy</li>
            <li> The metal buttons on the inside of the case is a little rusty.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that my favorites hands down are the Pueen!  </li>
            <li> I think I had 2 missing  space in the pack tho</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it at all waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a week ago from Green Square.</li>
            <li> so I contacted Green Square.</li>
            <li> The designs may be a little small because it doesn&#x27;t always cover my thumbnails.  </li>
            <li> I have only tried three of the plates and it appears the machine that makes the plates may need a little calibration because some of the patterns are a little difficult to stamp/transfer.  </li>
            <li> Varying from four different colors randomly selected for you.</li>
            <li> It seemed as though it was used :/</li>
            <li> I wasted almost $20 for nothing they&#x27;re not good people</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t hard to stamp or anything.</li>
            <li> It is hard to tell that you have applied the stamp even with bright/bold color polishes.</li>
            <li> so the pattern is hard to transfer without smudging.  </li>
            <li> This product is AWFUL does not work at all the stamps are not deep enough to pick up the design  </li>
            <li> and I saw any result this brand is not good at all</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had a lot of time to paint my nails lately!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t just stamp the tip of my nail so that was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Etched perfectly, I never have had a problem picking up the designs.  </li>
            <li> That was one reason I bought them, but sadly there are some disappointments.</li>
            <li> I think Konad polish is crazy expensive.  </li>
            <li> Too bad so sad</li>
            <li> I had written a scathing review of these plates.  </li>
            <li> Since I received the plate my nails have not been dull &amp; boring.</li>
            <li> One plate was badly scratched, and so one image on it is unusable</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed with this set</li>
            <li> A bad purchase, do not buy!</li>
            <li> Awful!!!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with the stamping plates.  These are my second ones and they seem to be better than the Shanty ones I bought.  There are more designs that I like than the Shanty also.</li>
            <li> I had written a scathing review of these plates.  I had written that they don&#x27;t work at all.  Well, I felt pretty bad about being kinda mean, so I tried the plates again, and I had 100% success with them!!  I musta been orbiting another planet with my first critique....&lt;br /&gt;I think they stamp very well.  I am new to all this, so maybe a week of experience was all it took.  The designs are so pretty.  I actually just ordered the 2013 set of 25 plates in the powder blue case, I love these so much!  I guess if you are new to this process, give the product a few tries before blasting the company.  By the way, I did not use special polish.  All my drugstore polishes were fine! I think Konad polish is crazy expensive.  I will critique the white Konad polish when it arrives (Yes, I put a crowbar in my wallet and purchased one bottle of Konad &amp;#34;Special polish&amp;#34; in white.</li>
            <li> its alrite it has a few similar designs</li>
            <li> I have many, many stamping plates.  It&#x27;s become a little bit of an obsession :-).  These are the best plates by far.  The designs are deep enough that they leave sharp, beautiful pictures on my nails.  I have large nails, and the whole nail designs fit my nails just fine.  I&#x27;m happier with these plates than I have been with any other brand, and have already ordered my next set by Pueen.</li>
            <li> I have many sets of stamping plates and I have to say that my favorites hands down are the Pueen!  They are not thin and flimsy like others I have and they work the best with the least amount of effort.  Picking up the image with any stamper is a breeze and they clean easily.  I have 4 sets of this brand and I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> these have alot of fun desines 4 ur nails! i &amp;#60;3 the princess crowns! they work good but sometimes the desine is smaller on ur nail than it looks on the plate cuz they arent etched deep enuf.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many of these plates yet, but what I have, I&#x27;ve been real happy with.  Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like all the stamping plates as are for a whole nail design. They are of great quality and come with a pad in the back. they are not as sharp as some other stamping plates I purchase in eBay. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great plates!  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> i love this stamp set soo much!!!</li>
            <li> They arrived on time and in good packaging. There are 25 plates so there were some empty pockets in the blue plate holder that confused me for a bit. I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet but most of the patterns turn out quite nice. They are a bit small, I have pretty tiny nails and the designs won&#x27;t even cover my thumb all the way, and the stamper I use it&#x27;s good for stretching. The designs are curved at the bottom so it cuts off a little bit of the design but I guess it&#x27;s to be used for tips? I usually don&#x27;t just stamp the tip of my nail so that was disappointing. What I was most disappointed in was that on a couple plates there appears to be slight scratches, one plate in particular was scratched through the blue plastic peel off covering the plate and left a line on the cute pineapple design.</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use!</li>
            <li> I think I had 2 missing  space in the pack tho</li>
            <li> An awesome selection of designs, I can&#x27;t decide which to use!</li>
            <li> I got this brand since I viewed on you ube and liked the images, so I ordered this collection which they also have out collection called &amp;#34;Love Elements&amp;#34;. These came pretty quick after I ordered them and is my first stamping plates so I was so excited to get and try out designs, since I love doing my own nails. So as soon they came in mail I started stamping, the images stamp really good and I used China Glaze polish (the creme ones works the best). But I found that if you have big nail beds that the images want completely cover your nail especially my thumb nail, but I&#x27;m okay with it cause I just started stamping so the more I practice the better I will get. I am definitely gonna order the other collection. I do recommend this brand cause the images stamp really good.</li>
            <li> A few of the images ended up being too short for my nails because of the curved bottom, but otherwise I was very happy.  This isn&#x27;t the first Pueen set I&#x27;ve bought, and I doubt it will be the last.</li>
            <li> This product is AWFUL does not work at all the stamps are not deep enough to pick up the design  don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> these are way to awesome!!!! i had a small kit before that only came with 5 disks but now wit these i can do any and everything</li>
            <li> Excellent product, thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the chance to use these once and it didn&#x27;t work so well, I wish I had more time to play with these but I haven&#x27;t had a lot of time to paint my nails lately! I definitely need more practice with them and maybe a better stamper but I love the designs</li>
            <li> They have a great selection and the images stamp nicely. No complaints</li>
            <li> Good quality plates.  I will recommend the purchase as all the plates on this set stamp very good!!! It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> I LOVED THEM!!! They arrived all neatly in their pouch. I&#x27;m very happy and I can&#x27;t  wait to start usem them all &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> These are my first stamping plates, so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare them to, but so far I&#x27;m in love. My husband is convinced this nail stamping stuff is a cult because I&#x27;ve totally gotten sucked into it! I love the variety of this collection. I&#x27;m not such a fan of the holder it comes with, but it&#x27;s definitely not a deal breaker. I might invest in one of the booklet style holders in the future…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these plates are definitely worth the money. I know I&#x27;ll get lots of use out of them.</li>
            <li> I like them. They are toys in our office now. easy to use, and beautiful</li>
            <li> I rated this 5 stars because I love it! Good price for the pack, instead of just the price for one plate. They work well and are easy to clean. The little cases are cheapy so I don&#x27;t use those because I bought the Pueen pink big carrying case, so I recommend that to carry all the plates!</li>
            <li> Stamps great! Didn&#x27;t have a problem with any of the images I stamped.  Don&#x27;t care for many of the images provided, but there are so many images to choose from that I have found ones that I use over and over..some of my favorites to stamp with. I also like the case that it comes in as well.  The plates have backing so no sharp edges.</li>
            <li> The designs are nicely cut... every detail does show properly on the nail once stamped... Reg nail polish worked on these plates as well...</li>
            <li> These plates are well etched and the storage case keeps them separated and protected.  I get great, clear images and there is a great variety to choose from.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I really like the set, but plate 25 was missing from my order. I contacted the seller, and they gave me a discount on the product because they can&#x27;t send me an individual plate. All of the plates I received work well, but they&#x27;re rather large for my fingers. I guess I must have really tiny hands though, because half of the full image can fit on my nails if I stamp the image horizontally and not vertically (although, since I usually have long nails, I stamp vertically most of the time). The fact that the images are gigantic kind of annoys me, because I usually can&#x27;t get some gorgeous detailing onto my nails, but I try not to mind it too much. I thought it was worth noting though. The plates are apparently sharp too, as my friend cut his finger trying to help me peel the blue sticker off of them. But I think if you know how to handle these image plates, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> IM A BIG PUEEN FAN!!! THESE PLATES ARE AMAZING</li>
            <li> reached perfectly, which is what I got paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good I will continue purchasing this product has been very good</li>
            <li> Super fun and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I regret I bought these I wasted almost $20 for nothing they&#x27;re not good people told me to buy the konad nail polish to use the art stamping plate I did and I saw any result this brand is not good at all don&#x27;t buy it at all waste of money. I saw people use the other plate they&#x27;re good but mine I can&#x27;t get any image from them</li>
            <li> I have several plate sets from several different manufacturers, and you WILL NOT get a better bang for your buck than you do with the PUEEN sets.  The images stamp really well and very cleanly, even the really delicate looking patterns.  If you&#x27;re new to stamping, this is the set to buy.  Warning though, it is addictive ;-)  I LOVE these plates!  You DO NOT need any special stamping polish.  The Essie metallics work extremely well, I use Orly French manicure for my white, and Confetti Black Tie for my black.  I use a Konad double-ended stamper, and these plates worked for me the very first time I ever tried stamping.  BUY THESE!</li>
            <li> Item as described, love these plates!</li>
            <li> Nice, lots of patterns ....</li>
            <li> Great images and fun to use!</li>
            <li> PATTERNS - This set has a nice variety of patterns.  However, many of them don&#x27;t seem complete because of the size of the etched image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUALITY - This particular set of stamps does not seem to have very good pick up on two different stampers that I have tired.  The case that it comes with is nice.  However, I think the full image Pueens would be a better bet (they are numbered somewhere in the 70s, where as this has plates 1-25).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIZE - This is my major issue with this set.  I do not have huge nails, but I cannot use these stamps on my thumb because the stamp patterns are too small.  My mom has tiny thumbs and it barely covers her whole nail.  Do some research and find out if these stamps will cover your whole nail before you buy.  If not, try MoYou or UberChic, both of which have better overall quality than this set of Pueens.</li>
            <li> I picked these nail plates because the images were very different from others i have been seeing.  i gave 4 stars because i haven&#x27;t stamped with them yet  and i don&#x27;t know if they stamp well.  i got them for 17.99 with free 2 day shipping. so far i love them.  to see them up close check out my youtube video...  [...]</li>
            <li> Stamps are great - haven&#x27;t had any issues as far as picking up the entire stamp, they come out super crisp and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;My only con would be the little booklet type case it comes in. Love that it&#x27;s a convenient little case but sometimes when it&#x27;s open the discs fall out, and I have to remember to pick the ones I want beforehand otherwise i&#x27;ll mess up my nails trying to sift through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product. This was my first stamp set and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I think Pueen are my favorite plates lately! I love the designs, I love how easy it is to use these plates, I just love them!</li>
            <li> This is my first set of stamping plates, so I&#x27;m unable to speak to how they perform in comparison to others. However, it thought it was worth noting that the case the plates come in is not what is shown in the photos. The actual case is round and a little tight, but does the job.</li>
            <li> This plate set is nice but the images are small. If they didn&#x27;t have that half moon cut I think they would be much better. I recomend this to people with short nails obviously</li>
            <li> I love these.  For some reason, I didn&#x27;t examine them fully, but I feel like I received some replacement plates, rather than the ones pictured.  Still, couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I love how nice these stamp too. Perfect</li>
            <li> So for the most part, I like these. I use maybe 1/3 of them with a reasonable amount of consistency. There are definitely some issues that should be fixed though. For example, I had two of plate #4 and no plate #13. The most annoying thing, though, is that some of the best designs are obviosuly off-center. You can see this in plates #8 (top design has squares that are uneven, #14 (the left image is off center), #20 (bottom image, one of the best ones, is obviously off center, #24 (top and right image off center), #23 (top image off center), #21 (bottom and right image off-center). Also, the snake prints on #14 don&#x27;t come out well. It is much more obvious than I would have expected whent he plates are off center, expecially for the lacey one. It ruined some of my favorites, which is a big bummer. For some of the images, you can tell online that they aren&#x27;t exactly centered, so look really closely as you shop! Mostly though, the images print well. I am a newb to stamping and picked it up the first time I did it, so they are pretty easy to use. Also,t he holder it came with was essential.</li>
            <li> These plates are very clear and crisp.  I am well pleased with how well the designs come out on the nail.</li>
            <li> Like most Image plates these have the paper backing with Pueens website on the back. These image plates also come with a image plate leather case. Varying from four different colors randomly selected for you. I love the details in some of these plates lace images like the bottom one on &#x27;pueen02&#x27;. The half moon on each image gives vareity for a possible french tip. Recommended for any one who loves to stamp their own nails!</li>
            <li> This is extremely easy to work with, we started doing our own nail art and this set makes professional results even for me with no training I just watched videos online</li>
            <li> The plate are wonderful and the quality is there. Love that they come with a protective case and that is wonderful. Nothing else out there like this. THE BEST DEAL!!!</li>
            <li> Since I received the plate my nails have not been dull &amp; boring. I always get compliments on them. The plates are super easy to use. I can&#x27;t wait to order more! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> WOW, these are great quality. They stamp very well. the images are clear and the fine detail is great. You wont be disappointed with this set</li>
            <li> Hello guys-&lt;br /&gt;The stamping plates are fabulous..!  I do my own nails, and all my girls.. We love all the different  images ..😘&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picky buyer</li>
            <li> I concur with much of the commentary made by &amp;#34;Shirley&amp;#34; in terms of the crispness and centering of several of the designs. Most however are very pretty and stamp well. The storage &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; has plastic sleeves which do their job, although easily stained by the protective blue film on the plates. Overall I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> i got this set and i&#x27;m very happy with designs, however i got two #20 plates and no #24.. bummer..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well, today noticed another one: two #22 and no #9. double bummer. update: contacted seller, they sent missing plates, happy once again :)</li>
            <li> This plates are great images are neat wide variety of designs love them can&#x27;t get enough of them plus the price is right</li>
            <li> The product was defective and had scratches on the metal disks even though it had a plastic coating on them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE them. I do my nails all the time now. And I always get compliments on them. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;;)</li>
            <li> I am happy to have these plates. They are so unique and really nice. I will enjoy these plates for a long time. Good investment.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful templates. There is a big selection of templates. These will last forever as long as you don&#x27;t attack or scratch against each other.</li>
            <li> Great price and value for this nail stamping kit...</li>
            <li> this nail plates are simply wonderful. i don&#x27;t have words , i love them so so much. buy with trust, you&#x27;re gonna love them ❤️</li>
            <li> Awful!!! Regardless of the polish I&#x27;ve tried, whether it be stamping polish or any other I have laying around the house, the image won&#x27;t transfer. I have tried different plates, different images and only a pineapple worked. I am very disappointed!!! I have read blogs, viewed youtube videos, etc and nothing has worked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested all but a couple of the plates, and they all stamp very well, or at least as well as the design was executed and etched on the plates. Here are my thoughts, and keep in mind I have plates by Mash, Cheeky, Bundle Monster, Shany, Gals, Konad and others, so I have a lot of reference for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The designs are on the small size - about 1.4 cm wide by 1.5 cm from the middle, 1.8 cm along the sides. They won&#x27;t fit my thumbs but are probably fine for many people. They will fit some of my longer nails, so that is a plus, and they&#x27;re wider than some designs in this height. The curved area at the bottom is so you can use the designs as tips, but like other plates that do this, the design is not always well-placed at the bottom to work well for that. Personally, I would rather have each design large and square at the bottom so I could use the whole design or mask off part of my nail to do a tip myself if that&#x27;s what I want, but to each their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The designs are refreshing and nice, but many of them aren&#x27;t very crisply designed. The leftmost design on plate 17 is one example - too much going on in one small space, and the result is a mess. The individual heart design on the same plate is the same way - it&#x27;s made up of circles within circles, but they&#x27;re all so close together, it just looks like a fuzzy heart. On plate 01, there is an individual design on the left that is the same way. I think it&#x27;s supposed to be a bear, but it&#x27;s a blob. And something is amiss with the top two rows of the right side design on plate 03 - hard to explain, but there are lines in the repeating design that don&#x27;t look like they belong there and aren&#x27;t in the other rows of the pattern. The rose pattern on 22 isn&#x27;t very clear and they pretty much look like blobs, so as much as I love roses, that&#x27;s not a plate I&#x27;ll use since I have nicer rose designs from other brands of sets. Plate 24 has a fuzzy design as well... there are others, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue with some of the designs - they&#x27;re not centered well for use on nails. The design with overlapping stars on plate 24 doesn&#x27;t have a clear star placed in the center of the design, so once stamped on a nail, it&#x27;s not easy to figure out what the design is. There is a clear star on the upper left edge of the design, which is not likely to make it onto a nail because it&#x27;s in the corner. Many of the patterns aren&#x27;t centered, like the left side design on 18, the right side design on 24, left on 22, right on 21.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice set with interesting designs, but don&#x27;t expect the world. They stamp as nicely as the design is to start with. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, but hope the designers clean up some of the designs that aren&#x27;t very crisp. Some of the detailed designs are crisp, so they just need to get consistent with this. I would still buy any additional sets Pueen came out with, but only at this price point.th some of the designs - they&#x27;re not centered well for use on nails. The design with overlapping stars on plate 24 doesn&#x27;t have a clear star placed in the center of the design, so once stamped on a nail, it&#x27;s not easy to figure out what the design is. There is a clear star on the upper left edge of the design, which is not likely to make it onto a nail because it&#x27;s in the corner. Many of the patterns aren&#x27;t centered, like the left side design on 18, the right side design on 24, left on 22, right on 21.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice set with interesting designs, but don&#x27;t expect the world. They stamp as nicely as the design is to start with. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, but hope the designers clean up some of the designs that aren&#x27;t very crisp. Some of the detailed designs are crisp, so they just need to get consistent with this. I would still buy any additional sets Pueen came out with, but only at this price point.</li>
            <li> Very pretty collection of stamps. They can all be mixed up on you nails and blend nicely, I&#x27;ve loved all the preen stamp sets I own!</li>
            <li> I love the variety of these plates, and while I have not tried to stamp all of them, the images I have tried have all stamped wonderfully. I am quite pleased with this collection and would give it 5 stars but one of the plates is defective (Pueen08). Even with that defect, I like this collection and see myself using it a lot in the future.</li>
            <li> First and foremost great correspondence and Less than 4 day delivery. All 25 came in lil packages with the blue film which was easy to take off. Mine came with a stamper and scraper. Tested 3 designs and the were fabulous. Working on a YouTube review and with plates and demo.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift. Both my daughter and I love it. I really like that it came with a case. I will be getting more. I have not had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> These plates are such a pleasure to work with. It was easy to see the image, choose it, pick it up on the stamp, then put it on my nails. They were perfect, look great, and I can&#x27;t wait to use them again. I have a lot of stamping plates and these are among the best.</li>
            <li> Some of my favorite nail plates!  Etched perfectly, I never have had a problem picking up the designs.  Great starter collection or for someone who has a lot of plates too.  Very creative plates.</li>
            <li> These were my first nail stamps I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  They&#x27;re awesome. Designs always come out better than I thought they would.  The designs may be a little small because it doesn&#x27;t always cover my thumbnails.  But that doesn&#x27;t bother me. Anyways- I recommend these!! 100%</li>
            <li> Great products but the full nail images are a bit small for larger nails. These came in a nice leather case with plastic sleeves.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a birthday present for a friend of mine. She loves them. The images are crisp and clear when stamped. She like the curved end so you could possibly do french tips with the images. The are large enough for an average nail but a little tight when doing the thumb nails.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they are worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these stamps.</li>
            <li> I love the selection of these nail plates. They have some adorable patterns and pictures. The quality is great, and I have had success using all the ones that I have tried so far. They are a great price for the amount you get and for the quality. I always use a plastic scraper (an old debit card) so I don&#x27;t scratch plates, as I don&#x27;t know if it damages the images. I have done nails on family and friends with these and they have raved about the patterns. The size of the full-nail plates are great, too- they fit all my nails, except my big toe. But I have yet to find any brand that makes them big enough for big toenails, so it&#x27;s not a disappointment. You won&#x27;t regret adding these ones to your collection!</li>
            <li> Love all the full images. Some very unique. Im glad this set didnt have a bunch of french tip images like other sets.</li>
            <li> I stamped roughly one full image per plate, and they stamped pretty decently. One plate was badly scratched, and so one image on it is unusable but the others seem to be in tact. I say overall, a pretty good set for first generation. The storage case was pretty nice too, except the color was undesireable. Itt was a yucky orange color, however im sure others would like it. The storage case was a nice touch, but I wasnt expecting it, and its a little hard to look through but I still love it. Overall, I would definately buy another set if and when they put one out. The images are so unique!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this set the same time I ordered the love elements set (#&#x27;s 26-49) and I love this! The images came out great. They weren&#x27;t hard to stamp or anything. I know this is supposed to be the new and improved set but, since I never had the old one, I am glad I waited. The case it came with is so convenient. I can always find a plate if I need it (I stamped every image on a plain white paper and kept it as a reference so I can always decide which design I wanna use when I wanna use it and find the plates fast and efficiently.) Even though I use the love elements set more then I do this set (the images are slightly larger and I love the swirls and lace images) I would still recommend this because it is a great plate, it has beautiful images (which are about the same size as the Winstonia plate) and it came with a great case. Great deal. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> nice product, I like so much</li>
            <li> I would recommend this set of stamping plates to fellow stampers! Stamps beautifully and the designs are wonderful. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been playing around with nailart stamping for just over two years now and have purchased a LOT of most popular stamping sets.  I would put this one at the TOP of my list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The images come out crisp and the design surfaces are large enough to cover the entire nail.&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly though, I really enjoy the designs... I gravitate towards &#x27;mature&#x27; day-to-day wearable designs and really like the images in this set.&lt;br /&gt;This set is also free of the \\&quot;tip designs\\&quot; which I don&#x27;t use, and in turn has much more full-nail designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have for all nail-polish enthusiasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves these. Bought her a few different sets.</li>
            <li> these are great and easy to use.  This grouping has just about every thing you could want in nail art.</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife and she is very happy with the set that she received..They have several beautiful design and the design stamp really well ,we have had several and I mean several sets from other companies to compare quality to with that said five stars is well deserved for Pueen 2013 set...Also fast shipping and well packed.</li>
            <li> I love these plates!  There are several images I do not have.  The quality of the plate is awesome!  I was glad to add these to my collection!</li>
            <li> I love finding new stamping plates to play with! All worked great!  I got all 25 with no missing or repeated plates!</li>
            <li> Beautiful designs, great etchings that transfer over perfectly. I had one duplicate plate and haven&#x27;t gotten it taken care of yet, but other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I love the pueen plates and have all three series. I am very much looking forward to the next set which I hope comes out soon!</li>
            <li> the pueen are real nice, good working stamps wish there was time to use them all. thank you very much</li>
            <li> I was amaze by al the cute stamp. but i don´t know if some of them are so fine that it dosen´t transfer to the stamper well</li>
            <li> super awesome can&#x27;t wait to use them all.The plates  used so far have given me crisp images</li>
            <li> I bought this about a week ago from Green Square. The plates work perfectly but one of the plates was missing so I contacted Green Square. They responded promptly and took care of it!</li>
            <li> These work amazing.  I just got into doing my own nails and stamp nail art to save money and love these plates.  This can easily become an addiction.</li>
            <li> all plates were neat no scratches and it really has nice designs good mix of all variety of designs</li>
            <li> Such a nice product!  I am still learning but cant wait to try all the fabulous stamp art.  Love it.</li>
            <li> The designs that I have tried from this set don&#x27;t seem to be engraved into the plates well enough to transfer to the nail.  It is hard to tell that you have applied the stamp even with bright/bold color polishes.</li>
            <li> I loved these plates! They have gorgeous uniqe designs and awsome stamping quality! I absolutely loved them and I would totally buy more plates from this company...</li>
            <li> Pueen has great plates. Good quality, no problems stamping and a million options. I prefer the buffet series over these and infact meant to order that series and got this by accident. I still kept them : )</li>
            <li> I have many sets from several different brands, and my Pueen plates are the most used by far of any brand in my collection.  This set is chock full of a variety of full nail designs (my favorite type), and all work amazingly well with both special polishes and regular nail polishes.  I own all three Pueen sets, and am thrilled with each one.</li>
            <li> These plates have some really cute designs but I have one plate (#14) that is totally defective.  The etching is completely smudged and unusable.  Amazon gave me a credit for the plate since there is no way to get one plate replaced.</li>
            <li> Unique designs.  I was pleasantly surprised as to how fast they came in the mail.  Very happy with purchase and would recommend  this to anyone.</li>
            <li> SO I have been doing this nail thing for 3 yrs now. I have just about every brand out there. So needless to say I have some good plates and So plates so badly done (image won&#x27;t stamp &amp;/or sharp edges) I also know about a good price to pay for plates. When I first saw these plates I thought the price was a little high. But it comes in a \\&quot;real\\&quot; case. Not a paper box stating it was a case but a real leather case with each plate is inside its own sheet protector. The image is so deeply edged in you can feel it completely with just your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of plates are not as deeply edged but if you use a higher end or stamping polish you wont even know. I got an orange case (my 2nd fav color). The images are great, a little shallow on the image but not bad. The price is a little high but you are paying for what you get. You get high quality plates and a protective case to hold your plates in. Good buy. There should be a frequent customer discount or lighten up on the price for the next sets. I also got the 2nd set of Pueen plates (26-49). Way better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m waiting for the Ankh (an Egyptain Cross) and the Triquetra (a Celtic Trinity Knot) to be the new images on next set of plates to come out.</li>
            <li> Fantastic plates but a few of the designs aren&#x27;t engraved deeply enough so they don&#x27;t stamp well. The ones that do are great and most of them do stamp well.</li>
            <li> i have all three sets of these stamping plates and i am extremely happy with them and the case they came with. love the images and how crisp the image comes out. absolutely i recomend this set</li>
            <li> These plates do not transfer the image to the stamp. I have tried everything. A bad purchase, do not buy!</li>
            <li> These are beautiful nail art images, and very different from other stamping nail art brands.  I recommend this product to nail art fans!</li>
            <li> They are much bigger than my other stamping plates. That makes it easier to cover my entire nail with a design without having to do multiple stamps per nail. The speed at which they came was even more impressive!</li>
            <li> Good quality and comes in a case. Nice.</li>
            <li> most of the plates are full finger stamps and I like that&#x27;s  what I Like about these plates would tell my friends to buy them</li>
            <li> I love this little set. Very impressed with the designs, although plate 24 is too blurry for me to use, this seems to be a common issue, and the only reason I didn&#x27;t rate 5 stars. Other than that, no problems whatsoever stamping with this set, and I&#x27;ve used it many times. Being a new company, they stepped up to the plate with quality and design, and I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I received these plates today and as soon as I took the blue tape off, some already had large scratches across them. The metal buttons on the inside of the case is a little rusty. It seemed as though it was used :/ I would advise everyone to purchase these plates directly from the website to ensure the high quality of this product...</li>
            <li> I waited until the revised set was released due to initial reviews.  The plates are standard size (55mm) and the image sizes are all 13mm or .5 inches wide and 17mm or 11/16 inches long (15mm or 9/16 inches long if you don&#x27;t use the halfmoon part of the design). The design without the cutout is the exact size of MASH images, which should work for most people with short-medium length nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off 1 star for the half-moon cut-out.  If you have longer nails, the new 24E set has images that are both larger and don&#x27;t have the half-moon void, so you might be better off with that set.</li>
            <li> I live this brand and all the designs I thung its a great set! I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> High quality plates. Work well with any stamper.</li>
            <li> great product easy to use  all plates work  so far am very satisfy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I love the original designs on many of the plates. That was one reason I bought them, but sadly there are some disappointments. Some of the images are blurred or not detailed enough &amp; the design is ruined because of that. Some are blobs, and some have double etching, making them blurry. One of the prettiest images is not centered, so to use it will make the image on your nail look like you stamped it off center. Not unhappy, but not thrilled with the set.</li>
            <li> I love these stamps. They&#x27;re durable metal and come in a nice case. I definitely recommend them. Get them now!</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described. All of the images that I have stamped stamp well. I love the case that they came in, keeps them from falling out.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I received these plates, they stamp well and the images are great but like many other people, I got two of one of the plates and am missing another. Will be contacting the seller.</li>
            <li> The stamps are etched deeper so there is more time to position the image. They were wrapped very well. The designs are super, varied, something for everyone. And they are long enough and wide enough for my long nails. I love Pueen!</li>
            <li> These Pueen Plates are Really Great Quality Very Good designs and Very Sturdy Plates I loved them so Much I bought 1 of Each Set!! The Images come off CLEAN CRISP AND CLEAR!! In My Opinion These Plates are BETTER than KONAD! and For the Price YOU CANT BEAT THEM!!!!!!! DONT HESITATE TO BUY THESE PLATES!!!</li>
            <li> love these stamping plates and the album they came in.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 16-year-old granddaughter.  She was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I received these plates sooner than expected and they all stamp great. I love the images. I have received compliments on some of the images I have done already and have only done a couple. Can&#x27;t wait to try more.</li>
            <li> Lots of different and cute designs! Very vert small slight scratch on surface of ONE plate but doesnt effect stamping!! Very satisfied and can&#x27;t wait to try all the designs.</li>
            <li> The images of my set are blurred. It is a plate engraving issue, the images stamp the way they were engraved. Pueen has improved the set...so they say. What about those of us with faulty sets? Too bad so sad I guess. If they replace my set, I will change my review.</li>
            <li> I gave five stars because PUEEN appears to really care about customer satisfaction.  Overall the plates and customer experience is good.  The plates arrived in less than a week, in good condition, and PUEEN includes a nice-free storage case.  I&#x27;m happy with the patterns and overall quality.  I have only tried three of the plates and it appears the machine that makes the plates may need a little calibration because some of the patterns are a little difficult to stamp/transfer.  The stamps appear to be a bit deep so the pattern is hard to transfer without smudging.  When a plate is too deep, too much polish stays on the plate for transfer.  Also, some of the plates arrived with superficial scratches.</li>
