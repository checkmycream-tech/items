            <li>this is a very good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good but not as close a shave as a shaver for face.</li>
            <li>Amazon was very good about the return process as always though.</li>
            <li>tried the foil shaver end on my face in the shower and it just doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.</li>

            <li>very good.</li>
            <li>The quality was very good too.</li>
            <li>It does a very good job for an electric.  </li>
            <li>Hi All ,&lt;br /&gt;it is a very good product</li>
            <li>Very good razor - charge lasts forever.</li>

            <li>If they would replace the shaving end with a cord...that would be my ideal trimmer.</li>
            <li>body groomer is excellent and is great for downstairs like everyone on here</li>
            <li>May not be ideal for those with thick/coarse hair.</li>
            <li>The trimmer feature is so good!</li>
            <li>good packing !</li>
            <li>Guys, if you like to keep that area looking good (we shouldn&#x27;t ask women to do anything we would not do ourselves!)</li>

            <li>This worked beautifully for a month or two, and I had no problems.</li>

            <li>Very glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>This Body Groom is awesome, it can be used for many applications and it can be used in the shower!</li>
            <li>I bought this because lady shavers aren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>The product itself does a great job.</li>
            <li>The idea is great</li>
            <li>The adjustable length setting is great, and doesn&#x27;t slip like</li>
            <li>It was great while it worked ,  it stop working  </li>
            <li>then that works great</li>
            <li>But, looks aren&#x27;t what make this a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is a sturdy, great product that does the job.  </li>
            <li>The holder is not so great.</li>
            <li>I am happy that I did my research and read all the reviews....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>great idea</li>
            <li>This groomer is great in that it gives you a sense of safety.</li>
            <li>Ergonomically it is not so great either</li>
            <li>Great while it works, but none of three product I had lasted a year.   </li>
            <li>The trimmer part with adjustable comb length is great also.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job removing hair from places you don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li>It also works really great</li>
            <li>Great price, delivery and product.</li>
            <li>this is a great trimmer to do &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; below the belt.</li>
            <li>Works great and no danger of a mishap.</li>
            <li>Great product, I gave this to my boyfriend</li>
            <li>and I was happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Great trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li>Great for athletes trying to keep areas</li>
            <li>Not the closest shave, but a great product.</li>
            <li>Norelco has a great product and Amazon did a great job filling the order.</li>
            <li>The trimmer aspect of the Bodygroom is great.</li>
            <li>It worked great for the couple times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof so its great for shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li>This shaver has a great design to it.</li>
            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>Great Product</li>
            <li>It shaves well after 8 months of use and looks great.</li>
            <li>and if I leave it in the charger cradle all the time it works great.  </li>
            <li>This does a great job at trimming those \\&quot;special\\&quot; areas</li>
            <li>a ape lol     </li>
            <li>lol.....    </li>
            <li>This unit is also replacing a trimmer, and for that it does a really great job.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I bet it&#x27;ll do a great job.</li>
            <li>This does a great job.</li>
            <li>It would be great if you could shave your face.</li>
            <li>However, for body hair, the shaver works great.</li>
            <li>and I experienced all of the pain and torture involved with the use of each one.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job all over.  </li>
            <li>Works great for getting a &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; cut on your tender areas but if you want it &amp;#34;razor smooth&amp;#34; you will still have to use a razor.</li>
            <li>It is designed for the body and it works great for keeping myself trim in areas all the areas that I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the great performance of the shaver, I commend Philips on the design.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of shaving those &amp;#34;private areas.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Sleek handle, great grip.</li>
            <li>If Philips Norelco lost the the trimmer blades or made them fully retractable this product would be GREAT.</li>
            <li>This works as a great trimmer, great close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that I now know what it feels like to be hairless.  </li>
            <li>Great product, pole, pouch, and starfish approved.</li>
            <li>But because I was so happy with the BG 2020, I took the dive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am happy with my decision.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good razer, holds a charge, works well in the shower and does a great job with my manscaping</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for the trimmer, which works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Guys this is the best shaver for the scrotum area, without the worry of knickin the nuts:)</li>
            <li>Excellent, priced fairly, wonderful product, exactly as described,  zero misrepresentation....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped it many times, used it both in and out of the shower, and it has held up great!</li>
            <li>bought this product about 2 weeks ago specifically for my groin area and more, and it trims perfectly.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works on all parts of the body without pinching, in all directions, and leaves a nice stubble length trim (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re shooting for!)</li>
            <li>I used to use a pair of scissors and disposable razors to keep my underarms and nether regions \\&quot;hair-free\\&quot; and in the process had experienced my fair share of cuts, burns and frustration.</li>
            <li>shape is great to hold and the pivoting head can navigate through the treacherous regions like a good 4WD off road vehicle.</li>
            <li>Design is perfect and the performance is top notch.</li>
            <li>I thought the trimmer worked most excellent, but I would advise taking the time to trim longer body hair with scissors before using the trimmer on this shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many trimmers in the quest for an excellent trimmer I can rely upon.</li>
            <li>I read many of the glowing reviews here, and decided to drop the cash and hope for the best.</li>
            <li>you need to trim in the nether regions, and want to make sure you the process is pain-free, this is the best one out there that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The aluminum body is a nice touch!</li>
            <li>for this price it is best deal. :)</li>
            <li>I have tried many groomers and this the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This should be called the bikini area deluxe trimmer and shaver!  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband he uses the manscaping side for just that and the beard trimmer too nice to have it all in one!</li>
            <li>ok it works perfectly all over.</li>
            <li>The one plus is they look good on my bathroom counter, design is very nice looking.</li>
            <li>It shaves perfectly and well, charges nicely on the handy charger stand, and also has convenient trimmer choices.</li>
            <li>Great buy, quick shipping !!!</li>
            <li>Now it is doing a great job very pleased with this shaver</li>

            <li>Is easy to handle and works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the design is perfect and easy for use .</li>
            <li>Works perfectly as described ands is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is perfect, it has 5 lengths, but I think it is plastic maiden, and I think it might break easily.</li>
            <li>This is great because you can use it in so many ways!</li>
            <li>This product looks very good and the razor shown at the bottom of the photograph works ok...</li>

            <li>Really good product.</li>
            <li>I researched this item for months, bought it, loved it,</li>
            <li>It took a couple days before it stared to to do a good job.</li>
            <li>I knew that wasn&#x27;t a good idea.  </li>
            <li>It may take a bit longer this way but you are insured a good result.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll dispense with the pro forma encomiums of praise for this gadget&#x27;s grooming properties: they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Reviews were really good</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a good 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>does not shave any part of your body good.</li>
            <li>all it is good for is shaving your arms &amp; legs a bit closer.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been good.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable guard is good quality (stays locked in at desired length, isn&#x27;t too flimsy)  2)</li>
            <li>Npt that good - might be good for the balls</li>
            <li>good product.  </li>
            <li>but i think that can be a good thing.</li>
            <li>After reading a lot of good review i decided to order this.  </li>
            <li>it worked well, I loved it.</li>
            <li>Its a really good system.</li>
            <li>Once you figure out that perfect angle it works great, nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Good for trips.</li>
            <li>Has some good heft to it</li>
            <li>and you can tell its of good build quality.  </li>
            <li>I cant complain about this product, it works really good</li>
            <li>performance and battery life are really good.</li>
            <li>The guard is plastic, but it seems to be of good quality, and I don&#x27;t see it ever</li>
            <li>One end is good for giving a close shave.</li>
            <li>electric razor is good.  </li>
            <li>So awesome that my armpit is so smooth like I shaved with a razor.  </li>
            <li>your all good.</li>
            <li>The battery life is good.</li>
            <li>Still a good unit.</li>
            <li>and battery life it good too.  </li>
            <li>But to be fair, it is advertised as a body trimmer and not a beard trimmer, so</li>
            <li>i would recomend it to anyone who is looling for a good men&#x27;s body groomer</li>
            <li>The razor work good though I don&#x27;t care for the swivel head because it folds over when you use it.</li>
            <li>Its good if you don&#x27;t have these.  </li>
            <li>Still a good product.</li>
            <li>every good thing said was truth.</li>
            <li>Manual shaving works good</li>
            <li>/&gt;The adjustable clipper works without nicking, and has a good selection of trim lengths.  </li>
            <li>Good.....</li>
            <li>a good product</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s usually a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I found out that I did not charge it, I was amazed on how good it worked.</li>
            <li>Loved it for the 5 months of battery life it offered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple times now and it seems well built and works good.  </li>
            <li>so there was no razor that was going me anywhere close to a good shave without pulling and hurting.</li>
            <li>I threw away a perfectly good unit.  </li>
            <li>Good tool for grooming.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>The battery is also superior.</li>
            <li>Keeps good charge...</li>
            <li>Fairly inexpensive in the range.&lt;br /&gt;Design.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>which was surprising.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a good choice.</li>
            <li>It works as stated and is a good quality shaver.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the reviews had me</li>
            <li>a good concept</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for some time now and gotten good use out of it.  </li>
            <li>The handle is nice and sturdy and shaving head works great.</li>
            <li>Which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I can use with shaving cream, in the shower, I can use it without water and it still shaves good.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s a fair reason for a one star review.</li>
            <li>exception to a shortened battery life (I have to recharge before use), it still operates and looks as good as the day I received it.</li>
            <li>We appreciate quality products at fair prices.</li>
            <li>We appreciate quality products at fair prices.</li>
            <li>Good looking practical well constructed Trimmer/shaver.</li>
            <li>It does a good job</li>
            <li>Really good bodygroom</li>
            <li>I do like the trimmer side much better, great for touching up the eyebrows and &#x27;stache, just not as impressed with the shaver as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>but the guide is too rounded to get hairs to stand up for a good cut.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s always a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Good luck to those deciding</li>
            <li>Good charge, design results.</li>
            <li>It has a good nonslip grip, that works well even in the shower.</li>
            <li>Shaves good and the pros end there.</li>
            <li>Does EVERYTHING a good groomer should do and then some.</li>
            <li>Good battery.</li>
            <li>well and good,</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my husband and he loved it</li>
            <li>This product is just as good for women.</li>
            <li>Cuts fairly close as well.</li>
            <li>Good buy</li>
            <li>buy the optimum one compare to your budget, quality, brand, life time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you can set the length from zero to 5, which allows you to cut your hair and mantain your beard looking good without removing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good product</li>
            <li>The was a good investment.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery lasts for a good 1/2 hour of trimming&lt;br</li>
            <li>good battery</li>
            <li>The good side for this item is it&#x27;s battery powered and works in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>This is the best trimmer available for trimming those &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas.</li>
            <li>ITS that good.</li>
            <li>The battery life is good, and the trimmer works well.</li>
            <li>all accompanied by that wonderful whirring sound to let you know that it is indeed powered up and that you are not just imagining that you turned it</li>
            <li>When it is charged, it works fairly well</li>
            <li>The shaver is good....</li>
            <li>Time will tell if it is as good as using the Braun shaver I had been using.</li>
            <li>this works good.</li>
            <li>Good for travel or keeping at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loved</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will never buy another Remington smooth and silky or Phillips bikini perfect.</li>
            <li>, it is as good an option you can find out there at this price.    </li>
            <li>Good battery life.</li>
            <li>It is a good shaver when it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>SAVES MONEY DOES A GOOD JOB</li>
            <li>The fact that you can use it in the shower makes it even more ideal.</li>
            <li>The foul side is working as good as ever.</li>
            <li>Anyway the trimming is really smooth and the results are excellent with no irritations at all.</li>
            <li>Good razor, versatile.</li>
            <li>It has a good battery charge and has done anything I&#x27;ve asked of it with regards to hair maintenance.</li>
            <li>Works good not going to sugar coat anything i bought this as to trim my pubic area.</li>
            <li>all I think it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good body groomer that could also function as a shaver.</li>
            <li>This tool is so handy, sturdy, and attractive.  </li>
            <li>I have, however, garnered a good sense of it&#x27;s capabilities and drawbacks.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It does a good job getting all the hair, but as you &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; it over your skin, the hair it is shaving sort of collects under the buzzer and then causes the blade to start nicking your skin a bit.  </li>
            <li>This body groomer does a good job.  </li>
            <li>There is a market for a good bodygroomer</li>
            <li>If you shave every day, this is a good tool to use, as it gets a good close shave.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t review this item per say, because there are some good reviews preview to mine.</li>
            <li>This product is really good..</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>you shaved it with a razor, thats how good of a shave</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge fairly well and is convenient to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>a good body groomer.</li>
            <li>when i read the reviews, i thought it was to good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is good.  </li>
            <li>-in-all a good groomer.</li>
            <li>good deal, but can&#x27;t shave close</li>
            <li>Good trimmed and groomer</li>
            <li>Hits all areas good.</li>
            <li>loved it .</li>
            <li>Not a close shave but good</li>
            <li>BEWARE of those good reviews.</li>
            <li>The batteries were good for about 3 months, and that was with once-weekly use.  </li>
            <li>Good battery life.</li>
            <li>very nice i liked  it</li>
            <li>$ I thought I would have a rich mans shaver but its best to pay for something cheaper like the cruzer 6 by gillete or not since replacement blades are pricy for the cruzer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The Phillips Norelco Body Hair Trimmer is the most superior shaver I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s my favorite trimmer I&#x27;ve had, good for necklines, sideburns, chest etc...)!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product that cuts closely and cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Best if you are in hurry to clean your body hairs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>does exactly what the packaging states, very awesome grooming tool, the charging dock it great and the charge lasts</li>
            <li>The unit itself (the trimmer not mine) feels good and sturdy in your hand and is a good size (ok, mine could be described that way too, lol).  </li>
            <li>this is an awesome tool for all your grooming needs, it recharges quickly and holds the charge for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>The best of the best, after try like 4 different shavers this one is definitely the best I ever try, and the best part is It can be used on the shower.</li>
            <li>But the best improvement is in the blades, which cut well and quickly.</li>
            <li>, this is the best bodygroomer they have come out with and is excellent for a multiple reasons.</li>
            <li>Exceptional product.  </li>
            <li>Here is a tip, make sure you partner is in a REAL GOOD MOOD if not get some Band-Aids READY!!!!</li>

            <li>Works great.  very easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>This works great for what most men are going to buy for it.  </li>
            <li>stand isn&#x27;t the most sturdy and the cutter at the bottom with the adjustable thingy is great for those of you who need your scalp cut.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased that I bought it.  </li>
            <li>The top end in the picture works great.  </li>
            <li>It is very stylish and compact.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, this is a great product, and for the price point, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything better out there.</li>
            <li>So many 4 &amp; 5 reviews looked great.  </li>
            <li>but ither than that if u have better luck than me, the side that works works great</li>
            <li>and i can tell you for sure that you will feel great while and after using it</li>

            <li>I also own the BG2020(Which is good as well)</li>
            <li>Good to carry in travel pouch, battery charging period is just nice.</li>
            <li>When I asked him how much he liked it and what should I put on the review he said, and I quote \\&quot;Good s</li>
            <li>The trimmer portion is good, and its nice that it is adjustable</li>
            <li>It is a very good grooming product, but I did not find that upgrading from the lower priced model was a significant increase in quality.  </li>
            <li>Very nice trimmer with many functions.</li>
            <li>Because of the guard lengths, it hasn&#x27;t made a very good versatile trimmer for keeping the sides clean and tapered for me.  </li>
            <li>this product is a very good body groomer, I use it very often and every time is a pleasure, great results</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do a perfect job (which is why I gave it 4 stars), but I was definitely happy with it as it gave me a very good shave in less time vs a Gillette Razor.  </li>
            <li>Great Shaver, awesome design allows for quick trimming and comfortable skin afterward.</li>
            <li>Very good shaver to shaver the full body</li>
            <li>So this is a very competent razor with a great handle and easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>more than four times!No Joke!</li>
            <li>SAFE!</li>
            <li>Works perfect,  does exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>If it takes many passes sometimes - who cares!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>What i like most about it is that you don&#x27;t get cut and scratched while you are removing hair 99% percent of the time(even in the groin area!).</li>
            <li>I love this body groomer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!!</li>

            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>b/c it worked perfectly the first time around.</li>
            <li>If you want it to trim you&#x27;ll love it but don&#x27;t except to get a &#x27;close&#x27; shave because this is not the tool for the job!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this thing!  </li>
            <li>First, this is the best grooming product I have used to-date.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the fact that you dont have to keep it plugged in for ages to clip two inches of hair!</li>
            <li>safe!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>love this thing!</li>
            <li>This is truly a fantastic beautiful device.</li>
            <li>I really love it!</li>
            <li>I bought this Philips Norelco for self-grooming (I&#x27;m loathe to use the term &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34;) and have found it to be superbly designed.  </li>
            <li>I like the easy adjustment of the trimmer settings which work great on my sideburns.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t experienced any nicks yet and handle easily.</li>
            <li>This shaver is easy to use and it does a great grooming job.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool, and adjusts easily to trim beard, mustache and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Great products and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>the great thing is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get razor bumps REALLY easily, and this worked great for it.</li>
            <li>easy to use works great.</li>
            <li>It was OK when it worked, but the battery isn&#x27;t very good and the foil breaks easily.</li>
            <li>Close and smooth shave, and extremely easy to use for perfect lines and edging.</li>
            <li>Having both an electric trimmer and shaver on one razor is incredibly convenient, and given how quickly and effectively this thing works</li>
            <li>I have found this BodyGroom Pro to be effective, easy to use and a joy to use.</li>
            <li>Always very smooth and a good looking cut.</li>
            <li>Very smooth results as well, but expect to spend some quality time on yourself if you want to look good.</li>
            <li>VEry nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is both a very good product and a very good bargain.</li>
            <li>But this is an absolutely amazing product.</li>
            <li>So alot of people have been saying how this is amazing</li>

            <li>This product is amazing...</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>so my son now has his own.</li>
            <li>That was nice to not have to worry about that.  </li>
            <li>You have two ends, each with their own on/off controls.  </li>
            <li>If you use this in the shower, you will need shaving cream with warm</li>
            <li>shaver/trimmer comes with a nice charging stand.</li>
            <li>3-The shaver/trimmer comes with a nice charging stand.</li>
            <li>and honestly I thought I would wake up with razor bumps all over my nether-regions from this shaver.</li>
            <li>In all, I think I&#x27;ve own about five or six.  </li>
            <li>In all, I think I&#x27;ve own about five or six.  </li>
            <li>my husband liked this gift.</li>
            <li>Nice 2 in 1.</li>
            <li>I had a \\&quot;body bare\\&quot; shaver before this that was nice and compact</li>
            <li>Keeps a nice charge going as well.  </li>
            <li>I like it a lot and would recommend this product if this is the kind of appliance you are looking for.    </li>
            <li>side trimmers cause their own issues.  </li>
            <li>It had no trimmer side like the Pro does, and of course it had its own design issues, but compared to this one...</li>
            <li>I use the close shave side to get rid of my neckbeard, and the trimmer side to keep it at a nice length.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still loving it.  </li>
            <li>Pros  Water proof design and nice charging contacts  </li>
            <li>a nice uniform shave  </li>
            <li>Although it takes practice to get used to its multi-functional design, the Bodygroom Pro Grooming System is quite an efficient body hair shaver for the hirsute among us who want to stay nicely clipped before laying claim to Darwin&#x27;s theories of evolution.</li>
            <li>No nicks, cuts, or gashes of any kind.</li>
            <li>Nice product to have and to use.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s still the best bodygroomer on the market, and being waterproof really puts the selling point on this item.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it&#x27;s just one unit</li>
            <li>They just want to let you figure out by your own after buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No nicks or scratches of any kind.</li>
            <li>I honestly had no complaints at all with this product.  </li>
            <li>end has its own on/off button</li>
            <li>The shaver is cordless and fits slides into a nice charging stand.  </li>
            <li>it was effective.  </li>
            <li>I cut my own hair</li>
            <li>I also liked the weight, seemed sturdy (go figure).  </li>
            <li>I also liked the design which in my opinion helped me to &#x27;reach&#x27;</li>
            <li>I liked this product, however after a month or two the foil head broke on the machine.</li>
            <li>I placed the trimmer on the charger and once it was fully charged, I began to tackle the treacherous terrain of my own body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice close shave with the foil end, and basically no chance of Knicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>The Philips is nice.</li>
            <li>It also did a really nice job on my beard.  </li>
            <li>Nice charging station.</li>
            <li>Kind of a rip off for a $70 trimmer basically.&lt;br</li>
            <li>also gives a nice, close shave when wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice razor&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t the fault of the groomer but a fault of my own.</li>
            <li>I have had friends tell me that they shaved their nuts- and that their girlfriends REALLY liked this-</li>
            <li>am the kind of guy who shaves and always gets that irritation after</li>
            <li>NICE PURCHASE</li>
            <li>Nicely updated version.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice how you just rest it on and take it off when you want it...  </li>
            <li>This gives you this nice, fold out stand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really nice</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the BEST all over body shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own against the linoleum.</li>
            <li>No pulling at all at hairs or any kind of irritation at all.</li>
            <li>This body groomer is twice as nice.</li>
            <li>nice close cut without having to worry about nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li>nothing spectacular</li>
            <li>Waterproof is a nice touch, too.</li>
            <li>If you want a mole rat with matching luggage,  I recommend this handy tool.</li>
            <li>What i really liked about the BG2040 is that all the attachments are on the shaver.</li>
            <li>(So no switching required) is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>but it does a nice job and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin.</li>
            <li>Everything in one piece is nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a person paid to give a review to this product or anything, this is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>This gives you this nice, fold out stand.</li>
            <li>Let me be honest with you guys.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this groomer a lot, and it is the absolute best.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the shave function, but the trimmer is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the product...but ...not the design....</li>
            <li>The adjustable trimmer length is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>the trimmer on the bottom is nice.</li>
            <li>Nice for body shaving.</li>
            <li>I wanted to splurge and get my husband a nice razor for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Loving it.</li>
            <li>This machine is honestly a godsend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a nice looking thing if nothing else.</li>
            <li>Trimmer is good shaver is ok</li>
            <li>and I can say its a good and safe product to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Coming from the Wahl with 19 bazillion attachments, it&#x27;ll be nice to not have to carry a separate ziplock bag with the attachments whenever I travel.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly, as soon as I opened it, I tested it in my body, it has no pulling-feeling, and it&#x27;s really gentle with the skin.</li>
            <li>The minute I received the machine, I used it for three hours non-stop and it didn&#x27;t even get warm.</li>
            <li>I do not buy this kind of objects because i think they are ripping me off but this one truly works.</li>
            <li>It actually kind of adds to the decor of my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Okay so I was a bit pessimistic even though this product had plenty of good reviews....</li>
            <li>Philips CSR was polite, understanding and effective.</li>
            <li>If I keep going over and over the area it does a nice job.</li>
            <li>the charging stand is nice</li>
            <li>the tend to bog and even kind of tug at the hair.</li>
            <li>I would recomend it for anyone looking to tidy up any place you that needs it.</li>
            <li>Although the design is nice the performance is lacking.</li>
            <li>The dual purpose heads on either end are really handy.</li>
            <li>nice shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that you can take it into the shower with you, and I like that you can get a nice close trim with it...</li>
            <li>after you stop it&#x27;s kind of</li>
            <li>I own a Phillips beard trimmer as well.</li>
            <li>I used to own the BG2020 until it died.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it can be rinsed out,</li>
            <li>so honestly it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the trimmer just couldn&#x27;t handle my type of body hair.</li>
            <li>so honestly it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the trimmer just couldn&#x27;t handle my type of body hair.</li>
            <li>Really liked the body groom razor, would recommend this item.  </li>
            <li>They do not cut the skin so they were honest there</li>
            <li>For this kind of money wouldn&#x27;t&#x27; you think they could have put in a lithium battery?</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer side (bottom of the device as pictured) is excellent and works very well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own and not returning it to the charger until it wouldn&#x27;t turn on again.</li>
            <li>Best in class, easy to use and keep it clean.</li>
            <li>Was a nice gift for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>I thaught that i can depend on phillips an thought that phillips is a good and famous brand.</li>
            <li>it gets a nice shave.</li>
            <li>it is $50 and might seem pricey, but come on a good razor costs $15 or more</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me a razor like finish like I had kind of hoped for</li>
            <li>Does not seem as effective in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>i ordered this to some of my friends and co-workers and they all liked it.</li>
            <li>I liked the design</li>
            <li>Maybe one with a corded option would be nice as well?</li>
            <li>I also own a Phillips Norelco which I have had for over two years.</li>
            <li>It has a good curved shape that allows you to reach most places.</li>
            <li>And I have to admit, I was loving on it for about a month or two.</li>
            <li>I do my whole body and it does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the micro blades much because I prefer a razor, but the trimming edges are perfect if you want to leave some stubble on your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they were all honest reviews.</li>
            <li>Nicely designed body groomer,</li>
            <li>/&gt;the edge trimmer is nice works</li>
            <li>Really fantastic razor and trimmer; it does a very nice job on everything below the face.  </li>
            <li>Excellent beard and moustache trimmer and the shaver keeps the parts you want smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It looks great, but it doesn&#x27;t fit in there very easily.</li>
            <li>Well, I was a happy owner of the ORIGINAL Bodygroom, BG 2020.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Prior to purchasing this product, I had the original bodygroom and it worked great on the jewels.</li>
            <li>I own this, and a Sonicare toothbrush from Philips and am impressed by the high quality.  </li>
            <li>He said the razor is very comfortable and easy to use and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>It works great - close clean shave and no irritation.</li>
            <li>had the best price for this particular item.  </li>
            <li>Does a really nice job no matter where you use it, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>He shaves all the time now, and I must say he is mighty smooth :) Happy husband, happy wife.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it for men looking for this type of product.</li>
            <li>Perfect so far no complaints!!</li>
            <li>I am still very satisfied with the product and more so after seeing the how it was put together, but there are some caveats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And great for full shaving your man parts.</li>
            <li>Great Produt, great built, battery last a good time.</li>
            <li>so I can really give the razor a chance to either be a screw up Or be the AMAZING shaver it truly is!!</li>
            <li>Because Man has a new best friend!!!</li>
            <li>had many reviews but who knows maybe the top five commentaries are always paid by some organization to write a good review for product.</li>
            <li>Good and easy</li>
            <li>designed, has a good feel to it, easy to use.</li>

            <li>isn´t a perfect tool, but I´d say it´s really close, and definitely better than anything I´ve tried that is a machine.</li>
            <li>Holds a good charge n is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The pivoting head makes it very easy to work.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to adjust the length and even though it says to not use without the guard, I do it all the time...unless it voids my warranty, because then I don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>Very easy to handle.</li>

            <li>Removes longer hair very easily but still does not shave as close as a razor and takes quite a while to shave effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Ps it is very easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li>best groomer on the market, wish you change your own batteries but overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have been able to groom those areas (TMI: and more!)</li>
            <li>Fantastic for manscaping lol, just got this baby this morning and first impressions are great.</li>
            <li>shaving cuts, no long-time shaving sessions, a pretty wonderful battery life, and&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s able to be using under shower (waterproof), and more of features.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right now, I&#x27;m smooth where I want to be and perfectly groomed elsewhere!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very smooth, effective shave when trimming hair under your arms.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and effective.  </li>
            <li>wow very nice &amp;#62;&amp;#62; the great bodygroom machine</li>
            <li>VERY NICE GROOMER SHIPPED QUICKLY BY SELLER.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very happy,the transaction was veri excellent,the item is very very good.</li>
            <li>very good thanks for sending greetings from Venezuela all</li>
            <li>This is a very good one, I shave my arms and it works very well</li>
            <li>this one by far is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used .</li>
            <li>Ultimately it is a safe and effective razor.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that this is by far the best one I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>SO far, its the best grooming tool i have ever had.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly helpful  to have in the shower to trim my body hair to a reasonable length.</li>
            <li>let me just say this is by far the best body shaver i have ever owned ......   </li>
            <li>(and it&#x27;s the reason I still give it three stars): out of the electric razors I&#x27;ve tried, this is the best one so far.  </li>
            <li>By far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Perfect for hard-to-reach, sensitive and \\&quot;wife mandated\\&quot; areas.  </li>
            <li>Okay this shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is by far the best of either type I have ever owned, being about my fifth one over the years.</li>
            <li>Like most products of its kind made today, it has no replaceable parts (except the shaver head)</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by this product because of the dual heads, being able to switch from trimming to the foil shaver with a press of a button is amazingly convenient.</li>
            <li>and - with removing the plastic guard I am able to get a nice close-ish shave of any part of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Suitable for thinning hair from around the body</li>
            <li>Fairly powerful and has great battery life.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with this</li>
            <li>This thing is as good as everyone else says it is, but the dial to adjust the trimmer length feels extremely cheap.</li>
            <li>But, it is the best shaver I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>Excellent so far.</li>
            <li>So far i had used dozens of body hair shaving and grooming products, but this one is the best .</li>
            <li>This is by far the best body grooming product I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with this razor so far.</li>
            <li>This is far and away the best groomer you can purchase and not feel ripped off.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best razor out there .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of body groomers and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li>But honestly, while ur at it, buy a better one..</li>
            <li>So far it has been awesome.</li>
            <li>Its a great change and its definately worth it.</li>
            <li>I will stick with my good ol&#x27; Wahl Chrome Pro clippers and just trim it all!sue; smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>The device is excellent and meet my expectation, it is as is described, and it is doing his functions professionally</li>
            <li>One of the best body groomers I have used so far.</li>
            <li>My experience so far has been excellent.</li>
            <li>more so my own skin...</li>
            <li>This is the best sensitive area shave I have ever used</li>
            <li>Tried a number of Bodygroom models and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Great product definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>If you want to rid yourself from the hair completely waxing still is the best way.</li>
            <li>many strikes to be minimally effective</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, have used a couple times ,1st use was good</li>
            <li>When the first shaver had a charge it shaved flawlessly and was comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly easy, incredibly fast, and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;re done and it&#x27;s done right, you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t expect great results in that area when it tells you right on the box</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair on my torso and the comb on the trimmer</li>
            <li>this is still going strong!</li>
            <li>Good product, good price, fast shipping, good fit.</li>
            <li>It does what is says it does, is a easy to operate product, no additional pieces that you may loose and compromise the usage of the item, does a perfect job, even on \\&quot;that area\\&quot;, and at a great price..</li>
            <li>This is just good for trimming large areas like chest, pubic area, and good for butt with a lot of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>This item is as good as advertised, I&#x27;m not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>I had the original Bodygroom (no longer sold) and loved how it worked for over 6-7 years.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got this, thinking it would glide right across my sack taking the hair with it, but no!!!!</li>
            <li>Very good, high quality engineering on this device.</li>
            <li>this razor is decent at best, i havent really been able to find a great shaver for manscaping since i used my roomates in college one.</li>
            <li>The body shaver head works great and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I find this to be a great product and will be happy to continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li>Tried many body groomers, this by far is the best.</li>
            <li>battery life is great, the low charge indicator is a great feature, lets you know when your about to run out of juice.</li>
            <li>I keep it well charged and in good, clean condition.</li>
            <li>So far this thing is awesome, no nicks on da nutz any more.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this great product if you need to&lt;br /&gt;a reliable, convenient, comfortable, and smooth grooming shaver.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>works great and gives a very very close shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very much body hair, but this thing works great on my chest and leg hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and does a very good job cleaning up my neck in the spots that my other electric razor doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Overall, its great, well worth the cost, and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>but I must say this is a great product, it performs exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The trimmer while it holds the charge for the first year is great..</li>
            <li>happy with this and hope it lasts longer then the battery did in the first one.</li>
            <li>I am pretty happy.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful but not by much</li>
            <li>I was pretty happy with the product until it just stopped working on the cutter end.  </li>
            <li>First, it works great as a bush whacker, no blood</li>
            <li>trimmer/shaver is great gets really close without irritation and its powerful, this part alone is what made me happy</li>
            <li>For the first year of so this was a great product.</li>
            <li>so you can say I am pretty happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a full charge at home, I am good for 10+ day trips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s leaves a great, clean, &amp; smooth cut for me,</li>
            <li>Good quality, strong, easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works fine!</li>
            <li>It gives a very smooth shave to the tenderest parts with no nicks or pinches.</li>
            <li>time skin is not burning, very smooth.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The blades are rounded making it very smooth and</li>
            <li>It has a very smooth shave</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Excelent product, very comfortable to use</li>
            <li>its really nice and easy to shave ur body</li>
            <li>Nice product, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>But it has a good grip and you get used to it really quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good shaver and it&#x27;s really handy</li>
            <li>Easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and can tip over easily, given the groomer itself has a nice weight to it.  </li>
            <li>Durable, good and quick shave.</li>
            <li>If you want to buy this and pretend to get a super close shave, it isn&#x27;t for you because, it do a really good job, but you could feel a litle bit when you pass over with your hand...</li>
            <li>This thing must have been made by the gods so that we mortals could be as smooth and sexy as them!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed that impressed me was that, unlike my hair clippers, this could go right over my nipples without nicking them.  </li>
            <li>Nice that is is waterproof, so trimming in the shower is fine.</li>
            <li>The effect made certain others happy.</li>
            <li>It is very good for those sensitive areas...</li>
            <li>Very good for sensitive skin and shaving close without any shaving cream.</li>
            <li>So far it is a very good groomer.</li>
            <li>Perfect for getting rid of hair anywhere you need haven&#x27;t cut my self with it yet and it works like a charm good battery and leave little to no stubble</li>
            <li>i love it and my wife loves me for using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too many electronics now a days are designed to be disposable.</li>
            <li>Fabulous investment!</li>
            <li>some others.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver side is ok.</li>
            <li>Top reasons its bad&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also bought some more Nair, but just for my netherparts since I didn&#x27;t trust putting a razor to that area . . .</li>
            <li>It was more spray-on than like a foamy, whipped type that I had used before.  </li>
            <li>solid product, i guess best at the market now adays</li>
            <li>u will really love it</li>
            <li>Razor doesn&#x27;t cut anything more than 2mm in length  2.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s agree: shaving is more than an act of maintenance.</li>
            <li>I have a beard, and I&#x27;m able to take care of more things with this tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I want to add one more thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to take care of the extras, and that&#x27;s a difference</li>
            <li>Ah, the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that has all changed, and now men need more out of their shaving system.</li>
            <li>Well, that has all changed, and now men need more out of their shaving system.</li>
            <li>This is much better.</li>
            <li>I went to my local stores (Best Buy, Target, Walmart, BedBathAndBeyond) and they all had the Philips BG-2040.</li>
            <li>and I was able to use it today in the shower.</li>
            <li>and I was able to trim with ease.</li>
            <li>This is perfect because I like to use the lowest possible setting when using the trimmer.</li>
            <li>charging portions is OK.</li>
            <li>the manual states that the shaver/trimmer should never be put on the charger after your using it and never leave it on for more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>able to use the shaver while plugged in</li>
            <li>able to leave the shaver in charger overnight</li>
            <li>thought the shaver cant be left on the charger, this is an excellent product for what it does.</li>
            <li>This is perfect because I like to use the lowest possible setting when using the trimmer.</li>

            <li>Outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Bodygroom Shaver and it shaved OK.</li>
            <li>I Love it.  </li>
            <li>They range from cordless to cords, beards to top hair to pubic hair.  </li>
            <li>That intermediate one will bite sometimes without a guard, so I just use its better guard lengths.  </li>
            <li>Maybe once or twice a week at most.      </li>
            <li>That intermediate one will bite sometimes without a guard, so I just use its better guard lengths.  </li>
            <li>The stand looks nice and supposedly the razor will fit inside the curve while being charged.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>It does give me a nice smooth feeling when I am done using it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone, man or woman who wants to trim, cut or groom below the neck.</li>
            <li>it shaves more because it bends closer to the blade.</li>
            <li>50 mins sounds like a lot, but I seem to be charging it more than I want.</li>
            <li>, it would be even better if it collected the shavings.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>one more try</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love both features.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed getting him something practical</li>
            <li>even attempted to swap out the stock batteries with a much better brand.  </li>
            <li>but now that I did, I am glad.  </li>
            <li>will have to try \\&quot;further\\&quot; when I have more time.  </li>
            <li>Where I did shave, I was pleased with the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>Over all, I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased to say that he loves and it and uses it all the time.</li>
            <li>(if I need to spell it out, you shouldn&#x27;t be buying this for yourself) and stay on top of keeping it trimmed, because the foil trimmer part is a lot easier to use on &amp;#34;those areas&amp;#34; than the sharper razor and blades therein.  </li>
            <li>I made sure the battery was fully charged.  </li>
            <li>i paid a lot of money for this and used it on my nether regions, like youre supposed to be able too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just something that you will get better with as you use it more.  </li>
            <li>This one is surely the most convenient.</li>
            <li>No hassles... Works like magic...</li>
            <li>is:  my Gillette Fusion 5-blade razor can&#x27;t shave me better than this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Perfect for all the male parts.</li>
            <li>Most electric face shavers</li>
            <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s agood  water proof and touching button</li>
            <li>The foil requires a slower hand, and requires you to hold the body groom perpendicular to your hair, and move it more deliberately.     </li>
            <li>You end up charging it more than you use it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this shaver.</li>
            <li>but i still love the item itself.</li>
            <li>thought this would be a better alternative to using a trimmer -&amp;#62</li>
            <li>I simply love this product.</li>
            <li>It is a quality product of Phillips, which is serving my purpose satisfactorily for more than a year now.</li>
            <li>This model of the Norelco Body Groom is drastically better than the BG2020 model.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, they should lower the price to make it a better deal.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now</li>
            <li>thanks for good and nice product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report it&#x27;s still working really well.    </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can \\&quot;manscape\\&quot; without pain.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m enjoying this purchase.  </li>
            <li>so most trimers take me awhile to use but out of all of them</li>
            <li>nice and smooth...  </li>
            <li>After reading a lot of reviews I felt confident this item would handle my grooming needs.  </li>
            <li>Did I get better with practice?</li>
            <li>This was the part I was most worried about.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a believer :)</li>
            <li>Glad I bought these.</li>
            <li>This thing is magic.</li>
            <li>At the top is the groomer, which consists of a pivoting shaving head that floats according to the contours and curves of your body no matter how contoured it may be.</li>
            <li>What I appreciate most is how both the shaver foil and the trimmer are made of hypoallergenic material so as to prevent the possibility of skin irritation, allergy, or rash.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re only looking for a trim, it works great!    </li>
            <li>I need more to power through my ahem...</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this item.</li>
            <li>I wanted them to show better</li>
            <li>I love mine and have had it for about 2 years now.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re gonna spend the money anywhere why not on your most prized appendage?</li>
            <li>A razor works much better</li>
            <li>We both enjoyed the closeness of the shave and that it was able to reach all areas - as another reviewer described - the nuts, bolts and sack</li>
            <li>I feel completely safe using it</li>
            <li>and it produces really sexy results.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be sack, shaft, and [...] safe.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this razor to any man looking to feel sexy and safe.</li>
            <li>There must be a better way to design a charging stand.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>but I have used it many time and it has not dulled the blade.</li>
            <li>Worth all the $$ and works as good in the shower.  </li>
            <li>For many men, part of this grooming includes trimming and/or shaving body hair, on ALL parts of the body.</li>
            <li>When I was through, I was amazed at the results, and so was my wife, whom immensely enjoyed the well trimmed look as well as the baby-smooth parts.  </li>
            <li>Glad that we bought it, and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This really gets a close stubble which made the razor shave great (eliminated a lot of post-shave razor burn too).</li>
            <li>Overall, this is the best unit I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This was one of the better purchases I have made in a while.  </li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the 1 star reviews.  </li>
            <li>I am sure glad I did.</li>
            <li>The Bodygroomer is a sleek and stylish product that works as well as it looks.  </li>
            <li>The groomer comes with an equally stylish charging stand.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I have used it for various areas of body hair and have been very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Let me answer the most pressing question guys ask when considering a trimmer like this.</li>
            <li>Even with those nicks every once in a while it&#x27;s a hell of a lot better than using a manual razor to try and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s just okay for beard trimming</li>
            <li>Was able to shave in the no-no places with ease and comfort.</li>
            <li>its a great razor that you can use on those intimate areas without fear, whether you&#x27;re a man or a woman.  </li>
            <li>love to have this product...</li>
            <li>I bought a wired Wahl, and I&#x27;ll see if that one works better.  </li>
            <li>This 2040 does have a better trimmer though.</li>
            <li>Love this product, except I dropped it in the shower and the flexible top part broke off.  </li>
            <li>The model below this one was better IMHOP.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>But I already did and was hoping for a lot better trim.</li>
            <li>Make sure to follow the charging instructions as this unit uses a NiMh battery, not a Lithium one</li>
            <li>What I like most about this product is the battery life.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer does not work well whatsoever, and I am amazed that others seem to be satisfied with the performance of the product.</li>
            <li>After reading many review I took the risk and bought the item.</li>
            <li>Anyways; its better if you mail Norelco $10 and save yourself pulling hairs and a headache than ordering this for much more, and adding the headache.</li>
            <li>I have tried using a hair trimmer, electric shaver, and manual shaving and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with any of it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>decided to &#x27;upgrade&#x27; and purchased, what I thought, was a better model.</li>
            <li>While it works, and gets the job done, I don&#x27;t feel as &#x27;safe&#x27; using it around the nether regions.  </li>
            <li>So much better than using a blade razor.</li>
            <li>For the most part it works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No awful bleeding or anything though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is probably effective for someone with light body hair.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, the product is great, a 10/10</li>
            <li>that, for lack of a better description, Manscapes.  </li>
            <li>THE BEST personal grooming tool EVER!</li>
            <li>With that I am well pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love this groomer.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing the body trimmer, most reviews suggested it was meant for men....</li>
            <li>It shaves the MOST tender areas without any nicking or grabbing.</li>
            <li>Since the latest cradle fell apart, I&#x27;m having to do some wacky workarounds to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Razor/foil probably should to be replaced more often than once a year, which is the recommended.  </li>
            <li>It turned me from a hairy chimp-like creature, to a more human-like creature.</li>
            <li>Safe as some say for stomachs and chest</li>
            <li>The close-shave part worked just &#x27;okay&#x27;, although I have nothing else to compare it to.</li>
            <li>Wish I had read more reviews before purchasing this groomer.</li>
            <li>I get better results with a 2 blade razor than I do this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a groomer for two years and this one is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times now, and could not be more pleased with the performance.  </li>
            <li>I believe there has to be a better product out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t be able to comment on that part.</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>/&gt;He was able to trim his beard, shave his chest (for me.</li>
            <li>Works even better than the cheaper ones that work well also.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>If I was you I would consider some of the lower cost options which are much better to handle and do a better job in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I am several months in and have very, very happy with it.    </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cute though Norelco followed the induction charging fad with this one.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Wish it would cut better, but I guess you get what you pay for????</li>
            <li>give it a try, youll love it....</li>
            <li>given it includes free shipping, which this is why i like to shop on Amazon and no tax !</li>
            <li>Well it can go most places for me</li>
            <li>Works MUCH better on my body than my Braun Synchro, which is made for your face.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll LOVE it.</li>
            <li>The foil end also does a great job of cleaning up areas after the clippers where you want a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Its ok, I do like it for the groin area</li>
            <li>Great sleek design and very portable.</li>
            <li>Really works great.  </li>
            <li>but this one is much better.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never used a better shaver.  </li>
            <li>Works good and worth a buy..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple tools to help in this area, and this is the best.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just better for everyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking baby smooth!</li>
            <li>Seller: 5 Stars Product Quality: 3 Stars  </li>
            <li>It works, it&#x27;s one of the better devices for trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>I will say that this product does do what many have described.</li>
            <li>a better shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re confident and competent with a blade, go that route, it&#x27;s cheaper and faster.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten better use out of a Conair groomer than I did out of this thing, and for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>After reading on with most of the reviews I realized that most people had a faulty product that just needed to be exchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I EXPECT TO BUY THIS BRAND MORE OFTEN</li>
            <li>It is ok there</li>
            <li>Better than a razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, for 50 dollars you can&#x27;t get anything better.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box I was immediately pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I used it straight out of the box and it worked great.</li>
            <li>I have not found a better option.</li>
            <li>have used the trimmer for many man-scaping expeditions and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has provided many days of baby  butt</li>
            <li>Bottom line, this does many things, non of them well.</li>
            <li>and I am really satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>and I love the dual ends.  </li>
            <li>After using it just once, the springs under the switch (and the plastic on top) fell off.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve been thoroughly impressed with the quality!&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once satisfied, I can switch over to the shave-end and take care of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>trimming/shaving, be confident.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Most shavers and trimmer have just the unit itself and a cord for charging it.</li>
            <li>Hence, unless you love the idea of displaying your bodygroom pro on your counter, you will have to keep track of three things, not two, and get out three things, not two, when you want to charge the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ok all i can say is this works perfectly for that zone above your knees and below your waist</li>
            <li>I was amazed by how close the groomer was able to trim.  </li>
            <li>was expecting more from you</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Have used this for years and it is durable, dependable and gives a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Shared by me and my boyfriend and we love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li>I am able to get 1.5 -2</li>
            <li>Love this BodyGroomer.  </li>
            <li>One of the best purchases I have made recently.</li>
            <li>Safe for those tender regions</li>
            <li>I will detail for better understanding:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since so many people are complaining about this, Philips Norelco MUST know that they have a problem with the battery.  </li>
            <li>I love every bit of how it shaves and how it works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe to use in</li>
            <li>This is the best appliance I have purchased in the last 10 years:</li>
            <li>But, I wouldn&#x27;t trade the trimmer length adjuster at all, unless it got better.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t stand the clip on goofy type.</li>
            <li>Love and so does my wife.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The BG2040 feels more sturdy than my BG2020.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an ok product.</li>
            <li>For the price, it should have been a much better and premium product.</li>
            <li>elaborate, it trims EVERYthing</li>
            <li>This machine -- and it is a MACHINE -- does the job quickly, safely and thoroughly.</li>
            <li>and here I am now, with what is probably the most hilariously patchy and razor burned pubic region in all of America.  </li>
            <li>love it .</li>
            <li>I guess, I was expecting more as I love Norelco</li>
            <li>I like it, I love it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced absolutely zero pulling or nicks using both ends of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It was ok to use.  </li>
            <li>I have two different shavers made by them and very happy with both.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Ok product.....</li>
            <li>but I would say it is better as a trimmer than a shaver....</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product!!</li>
            <li>I was able to go bald in about 20 mins.</li>
            <li>Also combines the best of both worlds with a adjustable trimmer and contact mesh trimmer on opposite sides.</li>
            <li>I am surprisingly pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>but overall this is the best product I have used.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job, all around useful tool, not as close as I would like</li>
            <li>Have not cut my self yet even in the more sensitivity man areas.</li>
            <li>my body look sexy and attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stylish, it&#x27;s light-weight, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Well built and stylish.</li>
            <li>And it really does a great job all over.   </li>
            <li>This one cuts the skin more.</li>
            <li>Their model below this model works better.  </li>
            <li>And the trimmer worked again for a couple more days before it quit again.  </li>
            <li>for the unit itself for doing its job, I guess it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Still wish for a plug-in mode, so it has more power.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s overall the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Awesome features, including individual controls for each end, battery indicator, and pivoting head.</li>
            <li>is there anything more that needs to be said.</li>
            <li>I shave most all my body For that &amp;#34;smooth Look&amp;#34; and thi is the product to do it.</li>
            <li>and I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>Both the shaving and grooming end have a top quality sturdy feel and perform well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I Love It.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m baffled that this thing isn&#x27;t marketed more to men.</li>
            <li>More of us need to hear about this device.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be confidently recommending this one to all my guy friends, including you</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with this purchase and the price I paid.</li>
            <li>8)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not always a lot of surface area to work with, and the designers of the product should have accommodated that circumstance better.    </li>
            <li>I love the ability to flip it around for trimming v. a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Best combo personal grooming tool I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>The more times you charge it, the longer you can use it.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cheers smooth body friends!</li>
            <li>are notoriously better made than women&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;3/5 - Okay shaver.</li>
            <li>It works ok as a body groomer</li>
            <li>I use a wahl clipper set for this task since it has a much better guard.  </li>
            <li>The shaver part is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Most shavers and trimmer have just the unit itself and a cord for charging it.</li>
            <li>Hence, unless you love the idea of displaying your bodygroom pro on your counter, you will have to keep track of three things, not two, and get out three things, not two, when you want to charge the device.    </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better.</li>
            <li>The best combo for me since all I need is to trip my facial hair with one end and body hair</li>
            <li>My girlfriend appreciates it too! :-)</li>
            <li>It scratches more than others</li>
            <li>The results on my leg were much better then anticipated.</li>
            <li>I love the Body Groom Pro and the features it has.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am impressed with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have had several trimmers over the years, and this has to be the best I have</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>so this helps with chaffing and I am now able to shave whenever I desire.</li>
            <li>Great product and very affordable.</li>
            <li>My wife would like me to shave off all the stubble more often.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I just keep writing more because i am trying to reach the minimum limit...</li>
            <li>actually I give this tool to friend and he was very happy with it</li>
            <li>I love this thing, I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Shape is perfect for reaching the pesky lower back hair - you can reach all the way, almost to your spine.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>there are many things out there</li>
            <li>Using the foil end is ok,  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done for the most part.</li>
            <li>It should be much better to travel with too.</li>
            <li>Does not hold more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have an outlet you can designate to this if you decide to purchase.</li>
            <li>I am pleased that I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am pleased that I will no longer have to suffer razor burn or irritation again.</li>
            <li>Best personal groomer!</li>
            <li>My rating will probably get better</li>
            <li>Safe for all body parts.</li>
            <li>okay..</li>
            <li>Shaves nice and close leaving a smooth surface.  </li>

            <li>Do yourself and those you love a favor and buy one of these.</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for a better alternative.</li>
            <li>Top quality product.  </li>
            <li>As the product name states this trimmer is great for the whole body.</li>
            <li>As a pilot, I am on the road more often than not.</li>
            <li>I love it and would give it 5 stars if I could shave my face with it.</li>
            <li>so I have not used on the boys just around them, which I am still satisfied with .</li>
            <li>last thing.. this product might be perfect for a hairy guy..</li>
            <li>i feel like there are better trimmer out there for a better deal</li>
            <li>This is the best male ball, taint, ass shaver in the business.  </li>
            <li>Anywhere else this does the trick better than any of the others i have tried.</li>
            <li>This is most definitely the best Bodygrooming device that I have used.</li>
            <li>It will operate better, and pregrooming will reduce hair from pulling or tugging, or clogging the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is well built and does a much better job without razor burn or hair pulling.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect to be able to do a couple days in a row, without charging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i was able to shave it quite well.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine a better off to college gift.</li>
            <li>, it was better not to have the 3D Pivoting Head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s able to trim on all surfaces no problem at all.</li>
            <li>Thanks Philips for another great</li>
            <li>As for the shaving(top) part, It does an ok job.  </li>
            <li>I just tried it once, and I am already pleased with this</li>
            <li>and/or the more the skin folds, the lighter pressure you should apply.</li>
            <li>Your girlfriend or wife will agree :)</li>
            <li>Im torn with this, its ok.</li>
            <li>They would probably do a much better job &amp;#34;downstairs&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like a Wahl trimmer much better if you are looking to trim and not shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>most foil shavers, it is loud.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with the purchase, here are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I haven&#x27;t found anything better on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product gets close and is able to be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>If I had known this was so much better</li>
            <li>Bought this for as a Christmas present for my wonderful son</li>
            <li>You have to go over everything many times and even then you still find stray hairs and have to use a razor.</li>
            <li>i owned many BG2030</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>then I will get more cuts and bump..</li>
            <li>BG2030 WAS BETTER...</li>
            <li>trimmer by itself is ok could be wider&lt;</li>
            <li>For 70 dollars I expect a better quality than this.  </li>
            <li>Its perfect for, ahem, sensitive skin, and the guarded trimmer on the bottom of the shaver prevents nicks.</li>
            <li>do think this could have been a much better product if some improvements were made.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and he just feels better.  </li>
            <li>eight more words to allow this to submit</li>
            <li>but I love it for body shaving...</li>
            <li>leaves razor bumps (which I, along with many others</li>
            <li>hate!).&lt;br /&gt;-Waxing hurts the most of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s WAY better</li>
            <li>does ok, it doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave</li>
            <li>probably should have sent mine in for a replacement, but at this point I am going to look elsewhere for something that better suits my needs.</li>
            <li>But not any more.  </li>
            <li>All in all I would recommend this to anyone and guarantee that you would be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure the battery would have given out by now</li>
            <li>Even used in shower then tossed out on the rug on many occasions.</li>
            <li>, if you are looking for a wonderful electric toy with which to satisfy the deep masochist you are, then by all means...get this one!&lt;br</li>
            <li>like it -- not in love with it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad now, because I use it all the time and gives me the results I want.</li>
            <li>Does an okay job.  </li>
            <li>But it sounded more like an electric razor than a smoke alarm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The feel is smoother and it seems manufactured better.</li>
            <li>but i thought maybe there is a better way.</li>
            <li>This does a way better job :)</li>
            <li>I love this &amp;#34;groomer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already gone to Costco and purchased another Philips Norelco groomer that seems to have a more rugged comb system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this Body Groomer.</li>
            <li>This model of the Norelco Body Groom is drastically better than the BG2020 model.</li>
            <li>I feel completely safe using it</li>
            <li>and it produces really sexy results.</li>
            <li>I find it to be sack, shaft, and safe.</li>
            <li>I recommend this razor to any man looking to feel sexy and safe.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the end-all-be-all of body grooming tools, but I don&#x27;t think I could&#x27;ve found a more reliable combo for the money.</li>
            <li>but I feel that I am able to convey his opinion.  </li>
            <li>and now I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>this one is better.  </li>
            <li>favorite think about Phillips bathroom electronics are their simplicity and length of time before I have to plug them in and charge them again.</li>
            <li>irritate my skin with the appropriate shaving gel and works well in the shower.</li>
            <li>Love it . .</li>
            <li>/&gt;this one is nicer on your counter, but the multigroom is better for close quarters &amp; travel.</li>
            <li>Need I ask for more?</li>
            <li>With some more patience I could probably get rid of the leftover stubble, but I don&#x27;t mind it since it isn&#x27;t so</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll have to buy him one too. :)</li>
            <li>I should have known better but nothing ventured nothign gained right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beyond this I can&#x27;t review the item any more than my preliminary experience.</li>
            <li>Again, I am sure it would work for many</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beyond this I can&#x27;t review the item any more than my preliminary experience.</li>
            <li>Again, I am sure it would work for many</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave!</li>
            <li>Love that I can use it in the shower, too, if I want.</li>
            <li>Ok, let&#x27;s stop beating around the bush.</li>
            <li>Whatever, all of that stuff happened to me and more...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery could be better</li>
            <li>but it can be better.</li>
            <li>One of my many Philips hygiene products.</li>
            <li>and I love this thing.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both use this groomer and it works well most of the time.</li>
            <li>It removes unwanted body hair efficiently and safely - on any area of your body.  </li>
            <li>Heck even my Gillette Fusion Pro Glide with the built in clipper setting does a better job (at trimming).</li>
            <li>better just to buy one that has a quality battery or allows you to replace them.</li>
            <li>One, you will get better at finding a technique that works for you.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer stated, this device truly is shaft, sack, and starfish safe.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 4 weeks, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>but you better don&#x27;t need to replace the shaver&#x27;s head ( $20 )</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t reach most of my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok I&#x27;m going off on a tangent here</li>
            <li>I will update my review once I have more info.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li>The shaver head is just OK.</li>
            <li>Now it seems much more like an extended disposable.</li>
            <li>I read Wahl has better warranties.</li>
            <li>I got the most effectivity out of the trimmer without its guard.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t have so many parts you have to keep track</li>
            <li>Simply the best groomer.</li>
            <li>I am writing this review years later as I have bought another one(at Best Buy which I paid more for) because this one suddently quit.</li>
            <li>My husband used to love his bulky corded Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li>It was OK.  </li>
            <li>Your girl is gonna love it, trust me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;ve used this for a while, I&#x27;ve gotten to &#x27;learn&#x27; how and when use the various cutter lengths and am now very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li>Fantastic body groomer!  </li>
            <li>The foil shaver gives a nice close shave and leaves the skin smooth almost like a waxing.  </li>
            <li>Many months between charges for me.</li>
            <li>Way better then</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but it wouldn&#x27;t be able to cut through it in one, two</li>
            <li>what more can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better quality than others I&#x27;ve purchased including Wahl.</li>
            <li>just looking at this trimmer (fully charged) makes my precious marbles crawl up in their sack trying to hide from this blood hungry monster.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is not however safe to use on either your scrotum or shaft.  </li>
            <li>As for the Amazon services, I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the shipping</li>
            <li>Please consider the Aussie market, you&#x27;ll have many buyers.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t got any cuts, just make sure how to move it against your body</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay, for now.</li>
            <li>I would also not trust the top trimmer to be used in your &amp;#34;ahem...area&amp;#34;, it catches skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>yet I&#x27;ve always nicked myself so many times.  </li>
            <li>It works better out the water, in this way it doesn&#x27;t get stucked with foam an hair mix, saving lot of time!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>This is the latest in their line of groomers.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of a design that would work better all around.  </li>
            <li>but then again it&#x27;s more for the body hair trimming purpose</li>
            <li>i LOVE IT</li>
            <li>One of the best part being an international traveler is, it has supply voltage range!</li>
            <li>Sure beats the heck out of what I was trying to use before.  </li>
            <li>It seems like its more of a 1 1/2 or even 2 than a 1.  </li>
            <li>After one year, the battery no longer holds a charge for more than 5 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>I decided to go through with the purchase because I could return it if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li>If they make a hybrid product like the groomer 7100 where the body trimmer is excellent but the trimmer is low powered and does not give a stubble look.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li>If you trim &amp;#34;EVERYWHERE&amp;#34; you will love this..</li>
            <li>My son uses it to shave his shoulders and chest and othe areas that get more hairy as the months go by.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my husband for Valentines day :)</li>
            <li>Now i just have to find similar one for his face, the rest of his body is perfect with this Norelco.</li>
            <li>I must say I love it.  </li>
            <li>This works better than the womens version.</li>
            <li>awesome for my private parts!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>and Wahl&#x27;s (wired) does a better job trimming.</li>
            <li>I love the versatility to use either side of the razor.</li>
            <li>It does everything I need and more.  </li>
            <li>groomer is totally sexy.  </li>
            <li>And yes I&#x27;m including the penis and testicular area as well as it is safe to use around there.</li>
            <li>Yes, I use it to shave my face mostly.</li>
            <li>While the groomer will remove most hair, it takes 3-4 passes to get everything thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It really holds a charge and does a great job trimming and shaving.  </li>
            <li>, i am sure she will repay your efforts with something</li>
            <li>ok,</li>
            <li>its ok anyway.</li>
            <li>not that good&lt;br /&gt;Trimming part could be better</li>
            <li>/&gt;3/5, could be better.</li>
            <li>Opening the unit is ok, but may break the waterproofing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m smooth for days!</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get it and enjoy!</li>
            <li>my husband love this Philips shaver.</li>
            <li>he said it&#x27;s the best for shaving around the back of the neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is probably my favorite thing about it.  </li>
            <li>Love everything about it.</li>
            <li>I think this may have been more of a problem with my hair than the buzzer itself.</li>
            <li>There is an instructable found online to replace the batteries with better rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll love this thing.</li>
            <li>Retains sharpness even after many uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had much better luck with a $12 trimmer from Walmart, followed by shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li>It worked well but eventually lost most of its charge and the head would keep snapping off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say more like 8 hours</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I have it and Prime two day</li>
            <li>I love mine -</li>
            <li>and she had said that it&#x27;s better to buy an electric razor for men for the legs.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I listen to that review</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li>I love the thing.</li>
            <li>hair gets almost all over this product if you use it like I do, and if you want to maintain it you have to take it apart and make sure all the hair is out.</li>
            <li>better than any razor on the market.</li>
            <li>in all I love this product</li>
            <li>The trimmer is very strong and cuts hair from all over the body easily.</li>
            <li>It was a great decision and the first use was amazingly easy and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof, holds a good charge, has a nice shaving foil side, and the trimmer side is great too for beard and other body hair maintenance</li>
            <li>Glides right through with a good trim without clogging up the blade.   </li>
            <li>holds a charge good, razor burn is very minimal, works good in the shower, works as good on the tree as the yard.</li>
            <li>One end is great for shaving my face, and the other end is great for trimming hair on my body, even the lower extremities.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when my package arrived.</li>
            <li>Very friendly customer service.  </li>
            <li>variable length selection is a great, but I mainly just use the shortest</li>
            <li>If you have the older model and it&#x27;s still working great, I see no reason to upgrade to this.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts a long time and being able to use it in the shower on softened skin make it the best man hi-gene tool.</li>
            <li>I took the leap per the reviews and am just as happy with this one as I was with the older one.</li>
            <li>now it is good for about two minutes after a full charge and the the light starts blinking.</li>
            <li>Over all this is a great razor for the money I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for the good handling and shipping speed and product quality</li>
            <li>so many others have already said, this thing is great when it is new.</li>
            <li>Works great love my new trimmer</li>
            <li>It gives a very clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaves very clean, almost to the skin.</li>
            <li>Feels very comfortable on my hand and does its work easily.</li>
            <li>battery life is pretty good on this model.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good razor.</li>
            <li>The clippers on the head with the screen are pretty good</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job and is convienent.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>so I find that to be pretty good.</li>
            <li>The BodyGroom Pro is a pretty good unit for any sort of trimming or shaving needed below the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave is fairly close, it doesn&#x27;t get hot and doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>Holds the battery charges pretty good too.</li>
            <li>But it does cut the hairs pretty well and makes you look good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a good product so far, nice trimmer but could have had lower sizes for the trimming part in order to be more helpful.</li>
            <li>it comes to the first, you can use any pair of hair clippers to do just as good of a job (and</li>
            <li>This trimmer is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>so the first ones, while good, needed some improvement.  </li>
            <li>Excellent battery that retains charge for quite a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This  thing really is worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I still use this, and should probably get a new one, but this one has been great.</li>
            <li>but I was still not 100% happy so this time I just bought a brand new one</li>
            <li>think this time Norelco hit it off great this time with this new line of the men&#x27;s BodyGroom.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of cleaning up the more sensitive areas we bought it for.</li>
            <li>shaver on top is great for removing hair completely - and it doesn&#x27;t pinch, cut or leave ingrown</li>
            <li>It looks nice and charged quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a handy quick grooming device that gives a close shave.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer is effective and quick.</li>
            <li>a doubt I would recommend this to any man looking to safely, quickly and effectively manscape.</li>
            <li>Strong battery, stays charged for more then one session.</li>
            <li>Easy safe body shaving</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof so you can use it in the shower, though I suggest you don&#x27;t cause it works best on dry</li>
            <li>best dry.</li>
            <li>It is safe and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, safe and can be used everywhere.</li>
            <li>really easy to use, shaves well and is generally safe to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and looks nice on the its charger.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and has a nice place to store it.</li>
            <li>This product lasted me for not even one charge, so I really hope I am able to get a replacement, as it seemed to be a good product during the hour that it was functioning.</li>
            <li>but I can say this razor does a much better job and gives a much closer shave than the lady fair feminine trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This is much more comfortable to use and does a better job.</li>
            <li>The Bodygroom Pro is effective at trimming as advertised, and comes with a handy charging stand so you never need to worry about whether or not it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li>I researched available products on the market extensively and this one seems to be the best.</li>
            <li>It simply does not provide neither good trim, nor a good shave...period.</li>
            <li>This thing works great and is far better than a razor.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a good quality razor to shave the more intimate areas and men&#x27;s products</li>
            <li>It is a personal item, but if you are comfortable giving it, this gift is perfect for the guy who has tried or would like to try trimming things up.  </li>
            <li>Great product, simple and effective on the tricky to reach places.</li>
            <li>It looks good, with its stylish induction charger/stand, and it cuts through hair really well.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I decided to try this out myself, it works just as they claim, very easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.    </li>
            <li>Plus since its waterproof its very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean up and holds a charge longer than the directions indicate.</li>
            <li>This product has been very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>they are very easy to detach and clean.</li>
            <li>It must still be given the credit that it deserves, however, as it is still the best electric shaver I have used to date even though it does not get every single hair.</li>
            <li>I thought with all the positive reviews this would be a good shaver for a man</li>
            <li>With this \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; trimmer, I now have to use two separate trimmers to get what my first one has done for many years with great success.  </li>
            <li>With this \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; trimmer, I now have to use two separate trimmers to get what my first one has done for many years with great success.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth ignoring the top side of the shaver if that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re after!</li>
            <li>I will emphasize that this item is very smooth, easy on your skin and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice clean shave ANYWHERE on your body, easy to use, easy to handle and very easy to clean after each use.</li>
            <li>It works very smoothly and accurately.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I just got it for ma friends who needs to have a clean one everywhere!</li>
            <li>still its ok and will shave your body fine</li>
            <li>The long/thick hair buzzer seemed to struggle a bit more with fine hair.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy clean up of your downstairs (good bye swamp butt).</li>
            <li>And then I read all the wonderful reviews on this product by other Amazon customers who came before me (my favorite thing about Amazon).</li>
            <li>All in all, he has only used philips shavers/trimmers - and he believes it&#x27;s good value for the money! :)</li>
            <li>It takes me from hairy beast to sexy stud quickly!  </li>
            <li>Good quality, smartly designed and does not geth hung up on anything.</li>
            <li>After reading many good reviews I decided to buy this particular trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the razor I got was just a defective one out of many good ones, but for about sixty dollars for a razor I would have rather used my money to get a decent blade</li>
            <li>Gets a nice clean, smooth shave with ZERO bumps or razerburn.  </li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s been a very good unit doing everything I&#x27;ve needed it to.  </li>
            <li>Very good on those scraggly hairs around your back and shoulders.</li>
            <li>final verdict is that it is a very good body groomer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited, because I finally found a body shaver (mostly for bikini area) that doesn&#x27;t leave bumps/redness &amp; grows in nice without any of that mind blowing itching!!</li>
            <li>The charging stand is aesthetically pleasing on the counter top which is kind of a nice unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li>Best $70 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li>Really great product, not sure why they say not to use it on your beard or goatee, but I have and it works really great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for shaving everything below the neck, if youre gonna shave in the groin area use a sensitive shaving gel.</li>
            <li>I just used the razor as I feel more comfortable with that.</li>
            <li>I am not giving it 5 stars because it does not work perfect once you are wet which I was expecting before buying it.</li>
            <li>The foil shaver, however, works best while wet - like anything you need to make a close shave with.    </li>
            <li>, I assume to make it more comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li>I can say that I&#x27;m pleased with the results, while not \\&quot;smooth as a babys</li>
            <li>I get better results from a cheap beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using a cheap beard trimmer for 10 years or more to do the job</li>
            <li>more importantly, the groomer never worked again.</li>
            <li>My cheap 20 buck buzzer from Walmart worked 1000x better.</li>
            <li>If you want to be smooth wherever or just some touching up, this is the gadget for the job.  </li>
            <li>I have found it works best as a wet shave in the shower using</li>
            <li>I already have a basic bodygroom, but this one was great, more power and more battery</li>
            <li>It seemed to do the job around 75% of the time, but many spots wouldn&#x27;t shave smooth.</li>
            <li>All in all this is exactly what I needed in the most convenient and effective design.</li>
            <li>Has the ability for trimming and shaving and is great on areas with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>But after some usage, you will get more comfortable and the hairs will not pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;ve been really happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; technique is the most important.</li>
            <li>Great so far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, and most importantly is in battery life.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product, was everything I expected</li>
            <li>It worked great for those, but that is as far as I would go for face use.     </li>
            <li>This thing has given me the closest and most comfortable shave and trim that I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Great upgrade from the old style.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, it charges in a way that requires the stand, which you must fully unfold and set on a nice even surface, where it&#x27;s still pretty unstable.</li>
            <li>Also is great to trim up the old &#x27;stach.  </li>
            <li>It provided a more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>, it was amazing the hair came off like a breeze with no pain, and just fell into toliet, this product I definitely recommend to all men it is amazing!</li>
            <li>More importantly ...</li>
            <li>This device makes me feel more comfortable about my body</li>
            <li>Even works great in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>this is your first time to use this kind of product, it&#x27;s better to read the attached instructions&lt;</li>
            <li>Be sure the light is lit up and stays lit so it charges.</li>
            <li>Was in the market for a much easier and superior trimmer for my</li>
            <li>I have found that a good solution for this problem is to gently pinch the areas where the hair is not being removed and go over them with the shaver head.</li>
            <li>It charges relatively fast, and that is always a good thing.    </li>
            <li>You really feel that this is a good quality piece of machine from the minute you hold</li>
            <li>I feel that this device is a very close-to-skin trimmer and may not/won&#x27;t be as good as shaving.  </li>
            <li>It really does a good job.</li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t shave the boys with the clipper end, the foil end is much safer and does a good job.</li>
            <li>I chose it because it was supposedly good for the whole body.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for your whole body but still doesn&#x27;t work as well on the groin area.  </li>
            <li>Have searched all over for a good quality trimmer and this really fits the description.</li>
            <li>Dosent shave fast or good.</li>
            <li>It really does a good job doing that.  </li>
            <li>To summarize, if you are looking for a body groomer that shaves very close, is forgiving of its use, doesn&#x27;t cut, pull or irritate your skin, this is a good one.  </li>
            <li>To summarize, if you are looking for a body groomer that shaves very close, is forgiving of its use, doesn&#x27;t cut, pull or irritate your skin, this is a good one.  </li>
            <li>fast delvery and good product</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shaver and yes, it is the best option for trimming down there.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for crack clean up as I had an ex who liked to...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as smooth as my face feels right after a good shave; smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>This is easily overcome though by repeated uses, and becoming more comfortable with handling the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Excellent trimmer and groomer with many improvements over previous models from Norelco.  </li>
            <li>works great and super fast.</li>
            <li>Any experienced man-scaper is familiar with the erect and stretch methodology of shaving this sensitive area, but this product is not even safe to be used with that method.  </li>
            <li>This shaves and trims, and feels great in the hand, the design feels very natural and comfortable,</li>
            <li>Also I have yet to nick myself with this trimmer, which is very nice when you shave sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normal disposable razors and a steady hand work the best for that.</li>
            <li>I bought it to originally be used mostly for my chest, but I thought I could use it all over my body if need be.  </li>
            <li>As for other man-areas, very good!  </li>
            <li>I have owned 3 other types of body groomers, and I&#x27;m here to tell you that the \\&quot;Philips Norelco BG2040/34\\&quot; is THE best on the market.</li>
            <li>The other end with the screen does the job flawlessly on the twig and berries.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Build quality is top notch and mine has been running off the original charge for 2 weeks now.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, who complain about the design of the groomer and the side trimmers of this groomer, in my opinion, it has a perfect design.</li>
            <li>Like others have said one of the downsides is when it arrives its not charged and the charging time is a full 8 hours!</li>
            <li>my husband can use the clipper end for his bread which is the only good part of the shaver!</li>
            <li>Other than that, its awesome.</li>
            <li>That being said it&#x27;s the most groin friendly shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The trim feature on the bottom is great, perfect length settings and has enough umph that you don&#x27;t expect it to give out for a long while.</li>
            <li>I have tried the other two bodygroom products and I think that this is the best.</li>
            <li>The reviews on this product are TRUE!</li>
            <li>This is not like an electric razor for your face; a little more finesse is needed for best results.</li>
            <li>I am more familiar and skillful with the groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comparing to other that I used, this was the best.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Other than that I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li>but Philips Norelco is definitely the superior one!</li>
            <li>best body groomer i have found after trying other.</li>
            <li>I own the previous version but the charger good fried while I was traveling in Asia!</li>
            <li>To my surprise it was easy to take apart except the batteries are soldered in.</li>
            <li>Given the cost and being otherwise so easy to take apart</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, its great to be able to achieve the bald eagle look without the skin troubles, or even to just keep the hair short with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Both sides of the Norelco pop off or up (in the case of the trimmer) to allow for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to get carried away and this unit does it all...</li>
            <li>It would be all too easy to bump into and end up trimming where you didn&#x27;t want to.    </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean/wash-off since it is water resistant.</li>
            <li>As I stated earlier, I have used it 2 more times &amp; am still happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Love it, easy to use, easy to clean</li>
            <li>Hell, it was so easy</li>
            <li>Easy to use for both men and women.</li>
            <li>I disagree, its well designed and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy as that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to be so easy to make a routine out of keeping things trimmed.  </li>
            <li>I can only assume that this thing does work great for some people and they love it.  </li>
            <li>Amazon honored the 30day money-back return policy and made returning it fairly easy although I did have to pay about $6 for the return shipping.  </li>
            <li>Easy to locate and push</li>
            <li>I did not feel any snagging and it easily followed all contours even under the chin.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is just as easy as shaving.</li>
            <li>Prior to my purchase, I waxed and shaved with great results, albeit more effort required.     </li>
            <li>Easy handling.</li>
            <li>It is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use with battery which lasts hours.</li>
            <li>With the Philips Norelco BG2040, my manscaping is made easy.</li>
            <li>really easy to use and does its job.</li>
            <li>The adjustable guide slide a bit too easily.  </li>
            <li>pro makes it easy,</li>
            <li>And the stand is relatively easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This thing is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s waterproof and cleans easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and will take your hair all the way off if you want.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>but once i learned that it was easy to correct for and now i can hit my scrotum without any fear</li>
            <li>would be easy to remove my hair but its not.</li>
            <li>Also it charges very quickly and I have never had it die on me</li>
            <li>This is a great overall product and i love the convenience of using this when I am in a rush.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s easy to put it in the charger in a way that it doesn&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li>The heads detach for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both the foil and plastic guard pop off for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>I never thought its going to be this much easy.</li>
            <li>Easy on the nether regions.</li>
            <li>The materials used on the build are great and I love the versatility of having the two ends dedicated to different tasks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ergonomic, and easy to handle (all around your body).</li>
            <li>how easy it&lt;br /&gt;is to use</li>
            <li>but there does not seem to be an easy way to pull it of..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rechargeable and also cordless, which makes it so easy to control without a cord getting in the way.</li>
            <li>No knicks or cuts, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>would advise to use wet, and with some light soap for lubrication, as that seems to work the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>Something that I wish worked and was easy to man-scape isn&#x27;t helping and just causing head-aches.</li>
            <li>This does everything very quickly and makes everything come out just about as close as shaving using a razor.</li>

            <li>My old and cheaper Norelco bodygroomer did just a good of a job if not even better.  </li>
            <li>strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have had this product for 2 years and still is going strong.</li>
            <li>and it was really useful getting a nice smooth fade along my neck.</li>
            <li>Decent piece of equipment; does everything you would want it to do fairly well.</li>
            <li>So far so good. :)</li>
            <li>Purchased this item on April 30, 2010, and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, it is strong to shave my head and beard</li>
            <li>This replaced an older version it is good quality.</li>
            <li>Superior to older models.</li>
            <li>Still going strong, and haven&#x27;t had to do any maintenance on it to date.</li>
            <li>and it is still going strong with no issues.</li>
            <li>It is highly rated, and I find it to be a good product.</li>
            <li>Cut Sizes liked very much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good trimmer .</li>
            <li>This groomer is an excellent product and is absolutely painless and has a solid feel and very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>This is NOT a professional clipper, but it is a very good clipper for the money and being portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ladies - get this one for your man and enjoy the adventure of shaving him clean!</li>
            <li>top trimmer had a real problem catching my fine chest hair.</li>
            <li>Works very well ,does take some time to recharge but over all very pleased.</li>
            <li>A smooth and more importantly PAIN FREE trimming experience.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my first time to buy a body groom, and tbh this one is amazing.</li>
            <li>This thing is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>The shape and the design are very appealing, and very manly.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it can be used in the shower is pretty nice also.    </li>
            <li>I had a couple of pulls but nothing remarkable or unexpected.</li>
            <li>A full charge takes about 4-5 hours and still the trimmer won&#x27;t work more than 3-4 minutes, however the shaver would work without a glitch.     </li>
            <li>AND the points are now rounded so that they do not irritate the skin, which is the most important improvement over the original.</li>
            <li>Great product..works well and does it exactly what its supposed to do battery life lasts long as well.overall good  product</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself does an average job at best.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it, I like to use it for full body grooming.  </li>
            <li>It works just as well as the day I first received it which is spectacular.</li>
            <li>Sure that are better shavers and better clippers, but this thing does both well and is very versatile.</li>
            <li>The way the charger works is pretty nice,</li>
            <li>I am first time user for this kind of product</li>
            <li>The trimmer side is pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>I liked the older model better.  </li>
            <li>The best body groomer I have ever owned hands down.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best damn trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can recharge this thing, which is so nice (pretty quick too!)</li>
            <li>Charges fast and does a good close clean shave in all areas you need to shave</li>
            <li>The Norelco Bodygroom Pro is hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>this is a great body groomer, works great for chest hair, and works really good below the waist line, if your woman likes you trim and proper down below, this will work great for you, even if you want to go totally hairless, just take your time</li>
            <li>It is also the most economical and has the best BANG 4 the BUCK rating compared to other shavers of this type.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s too soon to determine how the battery will hold up with this new generation, it&#x27;s performance is just as good</li>
            <li>Once in a while is fine but</li>
            <li>The trimmer part is fine; it gets the job done, which is why I&#x27;m giving the product a two-star rating, but it&#x27;s nothing</li>
            <li>It is unexceptional, and works fine.</li>
            <li>For shaving your face, you will have to go over the fine details with a disposable just to touch up.</li>
            <li>Using it is easy and very much secure.  </li>
            <li>On the legs and arms the trimmer works just fine no problems.    </li>
            <li>Tonight the shaver quit working (trimmer still works fine)</li>
            <li>Me and my wife uses it regulary now and it works fine.</li>
            <li>The hair on my legs is coarser and it did a fine job neatening it up.</li>
            <li>but it is fine product.</li>
            <li>Previous reviewers said it best, I&#x27;ll echo their confidence in this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li>The battery life was fine.</li>
            <li>I have gone through many in the past and this works the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to report I used it for the first time last night and did NOT have that \\&quot;OH</li>
            <li>this razor is the best i&#x27;ve seen, i&#x27;ve had it for years now and have only changed the razor head once, stills works as the first day.</li>
            <li>concentrate and you will be fine.     </li>
            <li>Designed to fit your hand, easy to manage and maneuver.</li>
            <li>I can run it freely with no guard, without worry on my chest and stomach (the ends of the teeth are rounded and don&#x27;t bite easily),</li>
            <li>I was able to successfully use my regular electric razor to get the smoothness I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>The fact that you need to replace the blade every so often is fine....</li>
            <li>Shaver side works fine</li>
            <li>But if you do, you&#x27;ll be fine.   </li>
            <li>Smooth shave, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much buy a disposable razor for a close shave and use this to trim... Happy Cleaning</li>
            <li>but you will probably still need to go in with the razor for some fine tuning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product itself is fine, no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m uncertain about it&#x27;s shaving but, being Norelco, it should work fine.</li>
            <li>but it seems to work fine.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Philips was nice to me the first time this happened, and they sent me a free Comb Guide.</li>
            <li>I purchased this over a year ago had it about a week or two and seemed to work fine, then it came on by itself, wouldn&#x27;t turn off until it drained the battery fully</li>
            <li>The shaver has a fine trimmer on either side of the shaver screen.</li>
            <li>For me is just fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>

            <li>- It would do the job more efficient &amp; quick.</li>
            <li>It quickly has found its way to be inside the vanity cabinet instead of on top.</li>
            <li>When the light starts to flash, it still runs strong</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re after the hairless LOOK, it is more than adequate.  </li>
            <li>Okay for quick touch ups and for trimming.  </li>
            <li>and makes quick work of most all types of hair</li>
            <li>The trimmer is quite good for taking the hair down to a good level which can then be smoothed out by the foil side.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this based on all the positive reviews and works amazing.</li>
            <li>It lasts 10 minutes at the most (from the very first day</li>
            <li>If they can get the battery life to last 3 years plus then i&#x27;ll be more than happy to give it a full 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed right out of the box because it was easy to open, and the form fitting tray holding the unit was actually high tech molded paper, so most of the packaging was recyclable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s  water proof and can be easily rinsed off and put back in its charger after each use.</li>

            <li>This little guy is awesome.</li>
            <li>I have been using this item for over two years still works great, the charge lasts forever, I mainly use to shave the longer hairs on my legs and arms in the summer months, it gets hot in Florida, I don&#x27;t need the hair.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s been About four years now and the original is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Some areas are better with the guarded edge, while others are better with the trimmer edge which works well for large areas.</li>
            <li>The pivot head is great because it better follows the contours of your body and is especially handy in the groin (be careful down there!).      </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s been easy to clean up and does give a close shave leaving the skin smooth.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s a huge step up from it.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a huge plus</li>
            <li>This is a good razor that is comfortable to use, but it will &#x27;pull&#x27; hairs in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>The reviews of this product are accurate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge benefit being waterproof</li>

            <li>Now, that i am better at maneuvering it and in the rare event</li>
            <li>Does it take a few passes sometimes, yeah, but nothing is perfect in the world.  </li>
            <li>and yeah u can clean ur privet place like the ball so easy and</li>
            <li>(Reminds me of going into a barber shop and asking for a &#x27;light trim&#x27; and walking out as if I had just joined the Marines.)    </li>
            <li>Besides I would think you wouldn&#x27;t want to risk irritation, redness, snags, pulls, or scratches, in order to be cheap, sooooo</li>
            <li>You can have a smooth shave or a trim.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it is really easy to clean.</li>

            <li>have been fortunate not to experience any gashes or &amp;#34;craters&amp;#34; while using this shaver.  </li>
            <li>It is ergonomically designed and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It has a nice captive adjustable plastic guard you can set the length with.</li>
            <li>and I can certainty say it shaves smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cuts well and fits in my hand comfortably.</li>
            <li>After reading some mixed reviews, I can say that this item works great.  </li>
            <li>it did a fantastic job on my chest/stomach and below.</li>
            <li>Flimsy and too light charger/holder  </li>
            <li>its easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>No pinching no nicks nothing just baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li>The ease with which the blade guard can be installed, adjusted, removed is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The adjustable trimmer on the opposite end is a great feature too.</li>
            <li>but everything was going so well and looking so smooth</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean .</li>
            <li>However, I still had to risk the use of a manual razor because it just didn&#x27;t get it as smooth as I would like.</li>
            <li>and it is so smooth it even feels</li>
            <li>It is very well designed, fits in the hand nicely, and trims well.</li>
            <li>The comb on the cutter head is cheap and flexes.</li>
            <li>my nether regions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried multiple electric groomers, some work great, others just slice and dice.</li>
            <li>The groomer is lightweight and curved perfectly to fit your hand.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I am quite happy with this shaver and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for trimming the back of your neck between haircuts.</li>

            <li>Great for manscaping and overall body grooming.  </li>

            <li>There is no close or smooth shave to be had here.</li>

            <li>Just smooth skin after the fact.</li>
            <li>Great product overall.</li>
            <li>The plastic parts looks cheap and non durable.</li>
            <li>Since this was purchased primarily as an electric shaver for the face we are returning.</li>
            <li>The instruction says to use up all the juice in the battery before charging, but I have used it 4 times now and the indicator light has not come on yet.</li>
            <li>With the Bodygroomer I have just smooth skin and no irritation in the nether regions.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves the skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect your skin to be baby smooth for a guy.  </li>
            <li>It works great for armpits in the shower and for my back.  </li>
            <li>This is a great tool for any male to have!</li>
            <li>Both foil and electric parts easy to clean.</li>
            <li>there are many kinds of products like this out there, but I have toy say, that this, is totally worth it</li>

            <li>Works fantastic.</li>
            <li>It shaves smoothly and has never once nicked my balls or cock.</li>

            <li>Followed all the instructions in regards to not charging the battery until the light indicates it&#x27;s time and waiting until it&#x27;s fully charged.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect groomer, I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>I can see how this would be great for larger areas of hair..</li>
            <li>the darn orange light starts flashing to recharge it.</li>
            <li>It is low hassle and works great.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts forever without a recharge and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Got really smooth.</li>

            <li>Smooth shave and comfortable</li>

            <li>Skin is extremely smooth after use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>what can i say.. just save you money and buy a hair cut machine cheap than this joke..</li>
            <li>I use this with a talc powder which makes everything go smoothly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, it doesn&#x27;t come close to giving you a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t planned on being as smooth as a child</li>
            <li>Works great for female grooming.</li>
            <li>Made well, and does not feel cheap or will break.</li>
            <li>I thought the BG2020 was fantastic</li>
            <li>My privates -- sack and staff -- are silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Before buying this product, I just had some cheap trimmer that I bought at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>Now daddy is a smooth customer</li>
            <li>It is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>Smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>Works great for body hair, but not as well if you want to use it to keep stubble on your face (was hoping to only have 1 razor).</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great for the trimming of key areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient in the sense that both heads trim hair and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and no pulling at all..</li>
            <li>He really likes it and says it has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li>easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is a great close shave and solved several of my grooming needs.</li>
            <li>This is a very simple product and does a great job at shaving.</li>
            <li>It gets him smooth everywhere, something he thought would never be the case.  </li>
            <li>Extremely easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>Not a knick, not a rash - just smooth hairless skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all hairless now, and its SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>hairless, still smooth (unlike my face which has stubble within hours of shaving).</li>
            <li>I am used to getting the cheap trimmers from Target or Walmart for under $20 -</li>
            <li>Use it repeatedly without recharging until you see it&#x27;s indicator light flash orange -</li>
            <li>It seems a bit cheap</li>
            <li>Great improvement over the former model which was antiquated and not durable.  </li>
            <li>Does not leave any cuts and works smoothly.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for baby bottom smooth, ditch the razors and just use Nair.    </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>I shave my skin smooth for athletic purposes and dealing with the summer heat at work.</li>
            <li>Its very flexible and handy.</li>
            <li>A great tool for the obvious ----</li>
            <li>Shaving smooth my chest hair</li>
            <li>I moved to my lower area where I am smooth also.  </li>
            <li>The thought of taking a razor to my body didn&#x27;t sound manly.</li>
            <li>I have used it for the last 3 months and it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>fairly secure</li>
            <li>The rounded edges of the guard, on the trimmer, slide smoothly over skin without scratching or pinching.</li>
            <li>The pivoting head provides a comfortable shave in curvy areas.</li>
            <li>While the \\&quot;manual\\&quot; says it&#x27;s not intended to be used above the neck, it does still also work great for trimming your beard or side burns.</li>
            <li>To get the rest though, it will take some time, if you want it to be baby smooth.</li>
            <li>Sometime it will sound as if it&#x27;s going to die soon, but it will still go for a bit longer.</li>
            <li>It will just take some finesse (and perhaps some satisfaction of not getting SOME areas as smooth as you&#x27;d like)</li>
            <li>The actual device and how it functions was great.</li>
            <li>The actual device and how it functions was great.</li>
            <li>The groomer works fantastic.</li>
            <li>The charger stand takes about 30 seconds to get used to/figure out how to fit the shaver on it, but I didn&#x27;t read the instructions that came with it either.</li>
            <li>Not plasticy or cheap feeling.  </li>
            <li>the edge trimmer to lightly skim the skin of the sack.</li>
            <li>Smooth skin every time.</li>
            <li>Compact and easy to use will recomend it to any bear who likes to be shaved in..easy to clean and store</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a FANTASTIC groomer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t buzz smooth to skin.</li>
            <li>Close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>i am using it regularly and its works great.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and mantain both heads of the product.</li>
            <li>Keep the skin pulled taut and tread lightly until you get used to it.</li>
            <li>The bottom is great for trimming my goatee, and has 5 different length settings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great... not practical for back neck shaving (according to my wife)  </li>
            <li>that isn&#x27;t smooth and</li>
            <li>and there is a charging light on the device.</li>
            <li>It is very waterproof, and it glides nicely using body wash as shaving cream.</li>
            <li>My whole body is looking nicely groomed, since I started using the Norelco</li>
            <li>Smooth as eggs with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>Great product and obviously a beast.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is also more economical as it is priced below $20.</li>
            <li>Will get you smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>Very well built and looks nice.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I saw the ominous blinking light of my Philips Norelco Bodygroom razor.</li>
            <li>BodyGroom Pro models avoids flaws A through D, and actually has not detachable pieces, which is great.</li>
            <li>only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because the battery life isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>Now you have to realize a shave will never get you a smooth shave like a razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and charge.</li>
            <li>This thing makes me a silky smooth honey badger.</li>
            <li>Easy to charge, use and clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean also.</li>
            <li>On some areas of my chest and stomach, it chopped the hairs off no issue; smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>This item was for my son, who thinks it is a great trimmer, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>My legs are so smooth, along with everything else I&#x27;ve shaved.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care if it isn&#x27;t pink or dainty looking or that it doesn&#x27;t have a girly name.</li>
            <li>The shaving end does not work as well, but will provide a smooth and painless shave with some effort.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t light up when you put it in the charging dock</li>
            <li>In the questions area there is a tip on replacing the cheap rechargeable batteries with 2 AAA batteries.</li>
            <li>but I have used it trim my beard, and used electric shave with it to shave my face and was just as smooth as proglide and faster</li>
            <li>Great motor that powers through coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Fifty bucks for a year of shaving, not such a great deal.</li>
            <li>Even then it never gave me anything close to a smooth effect.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts forever it seems, and the device is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It works well as a hair clipper and beard trimmer, and cuts all body hair gently and effectively.</li>
            <li>Leaves you smooth like a babies bottom.</li>
            <li>so they look and feel smooth.</li>
            <li>The blades are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The product is definitely sleek and attractive.</li>
            <li>The groomer is easy to clean, you just pop off the head and rinse it off with water.  </li>
            <li>Ridiculously smooth.</li>
            <li>It will not get it as smooth</li>
            <li>This thing worked great, did everything as advertised until about 18 months of occasional use when the battery stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li>It clips body hair smoothly without pulling.  </li>
            <li>and it is completely smooth and silky, tis all.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a baby smooth finish then just stick with a razor.</li>
            <li>like they said get the skin nice and taut haha..</li>
            <li>As a big guy with my share of chest hair that i wanted gone i can say this groomer works great.</li>
            <li>It is great on the arms and legs, chest and back and under arms.</li>
            <li>REMEMBER that area has not seen the light of day since you were 11 yr.</li>
            <li>It takes some finess to get comfortable, but this thing rocks.  </li>
            <li>But never expect silky smooth, anywhere, with this shaver.</li>
            <li>This means that it is fantastic for smooth skin, but not for wrinkled skin.  </li>
            <li>I definitely enjoy the product and will continue to use.  </li>
            <li>Those reviews made it sound as if one would be taking an electric hacksaw to his nether regions.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for male grooming.</li>
            <li>it is great that it trims only what it is intended to trim.</li>
            <li>Initially when I get each time the battery is great.</li>
            <li>It shaves and trims smoothly without any problems.</li>
            <li>No rash, no pain, no itching, just smooth, hairless areas.</li>
            <li>Easy to charge, clean and store.</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job when it is charged.</li>
            <li>However, I think I got too comfortable with the groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>groomer itself is comfortable to hold and use, and the shaving head can be used moving in either direction.</li>
            <li>I do feel comfortable using it though, just don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>The larger part of the shaver is great for shaving your balls.</li>
            <li>trimmer side is both effective and gentle enough to use anywhere on your body, and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for the actual grooming, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>it makes them so smooth</li>
            <li>the battery is good also if its near to end its will light orange</li>
            <li>I seen this shaver and heard several good reviews, so I gave it a shot, and i&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>However, with most trimmers/clippers, if you want a very close trim or near-shave, you will need to remove the plastic guards, and that&#x27;s when you start being able to cut yourself.</li>
            <li>The repair man should in all good conscious wear gloves.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Does a good job so far in aiding in my metro endeavors.  </li>
            <li>Lets just say that, after suffering through a whole host of similar products, over the years, this one works PERFECTLY, with no rashes, nicks,</li>
            <li>I find it works pretty good in the shower if a body wash has been applied first to lubricate the skin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a must buy for the man who wants to stay perfectly groomed.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t in good conscious recommend this product to anybody.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>not all that good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s vital to stretch out the area you are shaving, as that will result in the most effective trim.</li>
            <li>Its also classy and looks good whiles being charged.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It is also a sturdier product that feel better in the hand and looks better, with the stainless finish, too.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Save time and money just using your good old razor blade.</li>
            <li>Explaining to me the BG2020 was discontinued she immediately shipped out the BG2040, which is superior in nearly every metric to the BG2020.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BG2040</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Good product, but as with most gadgets in my house its currently collecting dust.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>good if you have sensitive skin as you can shave every day if you want and it leaves no rash at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>seems good quality so far</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>i could not have made a better choice, its easy to use, comfortable on the skin and it does exactly what it is advertised in the product description.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve found the right product so buy it and get those smooth goods you want!</li>
            <li>However, right when I used it, I fell in love.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if I just waited until I NEEDED it, and then just charged it right before, it would be better on the battery.</li>
            <li>This is the most efficient product of its nature in the market right now.....</li>
            <li>Also make sure you put it in the charger the right way or it wont charge.</li>
            <li>So this is a very good razor/shaver except the other day I was shaving my head</li>
            <li>I thought it will be clean and fine shave any where on the body.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is easy to use, easy to clean, charges quickly</li>
            <li>FAST Shipping!!!</li>
            <li>A regular razor will LITERALLY do a better job at shaving than this!!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t something where you just grab a shaver or razor and master the first time!!</li>
            <li>Very worth the cost.</li>
            <li>The trimmer on the side opposite the shaver is very handy for shortening leg hair, etc.</li>
            <li>However, that is very rare.</li>
            <li>clipping end (with adjustable size) gets clogged with hair very easily, making it a pain to clip large areas at a time</li>
            <li>What makes the design unique is how it allows a comfortable shave without the risk of skin irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the original Bodygroom and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>The original batteries were cheap junk.</li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s still the best groomer you can find right now.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised that both sides of this shaver are perfect for different purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver side actually does a great finishing job on my face</li>
            <li>Works fine on women too! ;)&lt;</li>
            <li>The clipper end did better, and got most of the busy bits out, but the trimmer just couldn&#x27;t finish the job, even on my legs, which should be easy.</li>
            <li>The shaver head is a bit of a pain to keep clean, but the waterproofing is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>My skin is as clean and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>He got it and says he loves how easy it is and how it makes grooming quick.</li>
            <li>It has a pretty good battery life,  but what I really got it for was for shaving those \\&quot;other\\&quot; areas of my body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a leap of faith the first time you apply it to your junk and rake it across, but when you feel how smooth the trim is and how it does not cut or burn your tender bits, you will groom more aggressively.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, I found what I wanted, ordered it, and am very pleased with my Philips Norelco Bodygroom.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He said it doesn&#x27;t pull on his hair when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is easy to charge, and quick to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quickly and easily cleans up below the waist with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, cleaning is also quick and easy.</li>
            <li>If you want to take care of body hair quickly and easily, give it a try.</li>
            <li>For most of my life, I&#x27;ve been pretty cheap about grooming.</li>
            <li>I own both the Mangroomer (older model) and</li>
            <li>/&gt;This really is a perfect shaver - I spent 60 bucks on my first electric shaver because I trusted people buying this from Amazon, so hopefully you can trust my two thumbs up here too.</li>
            <li>It works great and is so much easier and quicker than using a normal razor.  </li>
            <li>you have hair you want to get rid of, would like something easy that works well and recharges quickly</li>
            <li>This groomer has a nice, solid feel and is very easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, well constructed body shaver at a fairly reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with the ease and pain-free way that I&#x27;m able to virtually eliminate all of my hair down there.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quality, effective pair of \\&quot;body\\&quot; clippers; theseare definately highly recommend by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have a bunch of parts separate from the unit, which makes this the best for no clutter and taking up very little room.  </li>
            <li>An orange light also blinks when the unit is about to die and that light comes on fairly quickly even after it&#x27;s been charging for hours.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, easy, and safe.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes off really easily to wash, and so far works like a charm during warm showers.</li>
            <li>It recharges quickly and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>At no point have I experienced any more itching than is typical when unshaven.  </li>
            <li>I experienced any more itching than is typical when unshaven.  </li>
            <li>but you have to make sure the light goes on, there isn&#x27;t a positive click or anything when you rest it on the cradle.    </li>
            <li>It is a good trimmer, but it will pinch your skin if not careful.</li>
            <li>The Nair for Men I had originally used never gave me any issues when putting it on my junk even when leaving it for 15+ minutes on there.  </li>
            <li>First, for touching up the sides to stay within regulations, then for the nether regions soon after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty unstable, it could be better.</li>
            <li>I would leave the unit charging but it would never get a full charge according to the light on it.  </li>
            <li>Friendly</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace the original BodyGroom because the blade kept falling out and the battery was dying.  </li>
            <li>For the most part, you can be pretty reckless with this thing and not hurt yourself.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I bought this about 9 months ago and for the first 6 months it worked, mostly.</li>
            <li>I originally set it on the longest setting, as a bit of a precautionary thing.</li>
            <li>My son had no trouble at all using the Phillips Norelco BodyGroom Pro and is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed with this one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It has a modern a suitable design.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I lost 24 pounds and was excited to try this shaver.  </li>
            <li>wrote my original review on this product in January 2011.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re reading this, you&#x27;re probably as excited about this product as I was, after reading all the glowing reviews of it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s lowest setting its leaving a significant amount of hair, and if you take it off you&#x27;re going to cut yourself.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s unique  features and</li>
            <li>thats a small price to pay for awesome though.</li>
            <li>worth it´s price!  </li>
            <li>This is the ultimate groom solution for any man who wants to keep his body&#x27;s hairs tidy and looking good without waxing or using scisors &amp; etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t perform as well as the original.  </li>
            <li>I became used to flying through my manscaping on the original.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it just took more getting used to that I was willing to give it.</li>
            <li>This unit tends to pull and snag and has a significant ouch factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>charge cradle is small and fits perfectly in my medicine cabinet sideways with the Razer in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure my husband will want to use this now though.</li>
            <li>I know this is kind of a pricey item but worth far more than what you can get for $20 cheaper.  </li>
            <li>You can see my original review below.</li>
            <li>After about 6 months it began to weaken significantly to the point</li>
            <li>I wanted this for a long time and was so happy I did.</li>
            <li>I am still using the original BodyGroomer</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately though, I was able to replace the batteries in my unit with much higher quality rechargeable batteries and now it works like a dream.</li>
            <li>Yes, I know most people would have stopped the first time it sank</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>I have used it on the MOST tender of areas, and I think you have to be pretty reckless to receive a nip from this one, regardless of which end you are working with.  </li>
            <li>However, the shaver part seems to grab/pull hairs which I never had a problem with the original.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Beyond cleaning it under tap water, I haven&#x27;t tested the waterproofness of this, although I understand that might be a significant factor for some.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good, but I&#x27;m not jumping up and down about how good it is.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, comfortable, no snags...lasted about 2 years, buying another right now.</li>
            <li>b) Make sure you clean up first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many of the other BodyGroom models, and this model is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>other option is buying two, good and cheap trimmers than this one, better but costly.</li>
            <li>Works great, hold a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li>great machine and the battery lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li>u clean ..    </li>
            <li>This product will have your skin super smooth though.</li>
            <li>Makes quick work of hair, but doesn&#x27;t cut quite as smooth or close as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>Rounded foil head is a godsend keeping those leg/torso junction areas neat and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can adjust the depth of the one end to trim my goat, adjust the depth again to trim my eyebrows, then flip it over to clean up the perimeter of the goat, my sideburns, and remove anything on my neck and ears.  </li>
            <li>I can reach it, I can trim it cleanly and painlessly with this unit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by saying that the trimmer works great; I have another trimmer and used it in various \\&quot;areas\\&quot; with some success, but also with some problems that I haven&#x27;t had with this one.  </li>
            <li>The shaves aren&#x27;t perfectly smooth or even, but it&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t provide a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I have purchased and used all kinds of personal grooming devices and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I also take the guard off to clean up my neck before using a razor.</li>
            <li>But overall, it&#x27;s a nice product :]</li>
            <li>This takes care of the issue quickly and leaves you smooth and silky without causing razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Dry, it works great.  </li>
            <li>But since the quality of the trim is good, the simple adjustment isn&#x27;t a huge inconvenience.   </li>
            <li>Just pop the trim selector off and wipe it clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this unit, as my primary electric razor from Braun really isn&#x27;t up to the task of shaving the rest of my body, and this seemed much more convenient.  </li>
            <li>I quickly became comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is, take a shower and really clean your self    </li>
            <li>Both heads detach to clean out any hair that might have gotten stuck.</li>
            <li>Provides a clean and neat shave without cuts or irritation.  </li>
            <li>So, after jumping in the shower, soap up and clean rinse yourself off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The biggest and most important flaw is this shaver doesn&#x27;t get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Quality is good, it feels very solid and comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>or it would bite me, and found I had to keep going over places again and again and again before they were clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous shavers, from manual to electric, and this is by far one of the best.  </li>
            <li>My daughters had great fun shaving papa bear back and then talcing me up.</li>
            <li>You must be careful though, because its still blades moving really fast, but it&#x27;s the best yet.  </li>
            <li>to clean the head I will sometimes take the head off and use a can of compressed air</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t know how to pull the head off in order to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, but the last one I had lasted a good 3-4 years before it ate through the razor guard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If youre looking for a clean shave, trust me, this isnt it.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>, like me, you clean out this tool after each use, that means that you also take off the Comb Guide as well.</li>
            <li>I like to use it to trim my bear and keep my neck clean.  </li>
            <li>The idea is good in having a blade on each end but the handle is only comfortable when using the rounded end.  </li>
            <li>It really works great, doesn&#x27;t nick you up even in the sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>but there is no product that can clean as well as</li>
            <li>Well designed and clean groomer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaver doesn&#x27;t give a clean finish and shave</li>
            <li>I have to couple of times to get clean shave or groom.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several others and this is by far the best body trimmer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Lightweight easy to use, powerful with a close cut.</li>
            <li>I have tried to clean it thinking</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide a super close shave, but it&#x27;s a really quick and easy way to take care of the job.</li>
            <li>All I do is replace the head and blades once a year, clean and charge the unit.</li>
            <li>Since i am an owner of 3 different kinds of Philips Norelco products The bodygroomer 7100 , Norelco Click and Style and the old G bread trimmer i can say that Norelco will NEVER make the perfect product.</li>
            <li>Glides smoothly and removes hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It irritates my skin after shaving and it doesn&#x27;t give a perfectly clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just remove the shaver or trimmer as instructed and clean away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Somewhat tricky to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different groomers and this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li>and i like it alot and thanks and good bye and thanks again</li>
            <li>The features it has are all well and good, the cool charging cradle works well, and it&#x27;s very nice to be waterproof, but the plastic adapter that covers the bottom part is simply too big</li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping to be able to speed up grooming around the special bits, and still maintain a fairly close shave with minimal pain and difficulty.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews on Amazon (mostly positive) I decided to pull the trigger and test this out.</li>
            <li>but most were positive.  </li>
            <li>but after reading many positive reviews, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have experience with other razors like this, but this one is easy to use and is very effective.</li>
            <li>I mostly use the hair trimming side (the end that has the adjustable length guide) since I only want to keep things tidy rather than go for the full bald effect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for trimming and keep body hair neatly in check, especially in areas that can be intimate spots for some special person!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has exceeded my expectations of fair and works excellently.&lt;br /&gt;Wet or Dry, this trims well, cleans easy, charges fast and is an all-around good</li>
            <li>much easier to use and very smooth trimmer.</li>
            <li>I wish the clipper attachment was a more sturdy kind of plastic, it does bend fairly easy so be careful</li>
            <li>After my SO refused to express an opinion on body hair, I decided to go for the full clean shaven look, it went over</li>
            <li>I had the original, loved it, then lost it in a move, and wasn&#x27;t in the financial ballpark to buy another.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d more readily buy the original.</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to catch up before a shave, and 1 second later trims my beard perfectly, then under the faucet for a rinse.</li>
            <li>Replacing the old one with a new one; having the shaver + trimmer all in one was pretty nice, and it did a good job.</li>
            <li>It works great in all the hard to reach areas and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Specially for those who want legit trimmer.      </li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I use to have an older version of this product, but after 2 or 3 years, is out of order and needed to replace, I tried so far two times and I am quite happy with it.       </li>
            <li>This mode is much easier to clean and does a much better job at trimming armpit hair.</li>
            <li>Its a very good everyday tool.</li>
            <li>First time you use it, it may take a little longer until you get the best flow and direction for use of the device.  </li>
            <li>I read all the glowing reviews on here and was super excited to try this out.</li>
            <li>I was super excited about this newer, supposedly improved, version of the BodyGroom.  </li>
            <li>It works great for Male genital area and is very gentle.</li>
            <li>Works great a little heavy to maneuver the underside of groin area but with help it is perfect!</li>
            <li>The trimmer side is much more effective when dry (great for trimming underarms) and the shaver side is great both dry and wet.</li>
            <li>Any guy willing and brave enough to test drive a body groomer on their boys</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be throwing them away after not much use because the quality really isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>Great body gromer, works as expected even after two years of purchase</li>
            <li>Does a great grooming job, just need to be careful as then edges</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pity.. could be a great product...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so ticked off because I gave this device great praise when I first got it the first time, I praised it thinking I had found my miracle for grooming those sensitive area&#x27;s without the fear and pain of getting bit or cut and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Clean easily with hot water.</li>
            <li>for all who try the old model they know its really nice</li>
            <li>That makes sure I don&#x27;t take off too much.  </li>
            <li>started shaving the top part of the shaft with the trimmer and it went really well up until (GULP)</li>
            <li>I was cool.  </li>
            <li>I use it full body, and I don&#x27;t pinched or nicked.</li>
            <li>I love the stainless steel, that it&#x27;s made out of too.  </li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s a clean shave (as close as a razor, but with much less attendant ingrown hair irritation) or a meticulous, even-haired trim, this product&#x27;s one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame since the overall quality of the shaver is quite good otherwise.</li>
            <li>The second time I used it, I felt much more comfortable with it and felt I did a better job.    </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good purchase</li>
            <li>What everyone here is saying is true, this electric razor is da bomb.  </li>
            <li>Looks good on my shelve next to  my sink.</li>
            <li>Good for trimming only.</li>
            <li>the bottom is a more intense trimmer designed to cut longer hair for refined grooming.</li>
            <li>The pivoting head is great for sensitive areas, Ive never gotten such a close and SAFE shave on the hanging twins.</li>
            <li>This COULD have been a really good personal shaver.</li>
            <li>Oh and chicks dig a hairless package as much as we dig their hairless area :)</li>
            <li>I have to say the BG 2020 lasted me a good 6 years, being in the shower constantly, only coming out to be charged.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, modern men like to groom themselves more than ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth mentioning I am not a hairy person, but I do like to keep a couple of areas completely free of any hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After an hour between the shower and bath, the only thing I found this good for was just the areas I had razor bumps on and the &#x27;starfish&#x27; area.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed it so much that I decided to purchase one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bump Patrol cool shave gel that I get through StockNGo</li>
            <li>The pivot head is one of the Key additions that makes the model superior, reduces any possibilty of cuttes or close calls.</li>
            <li>but i would stick to the razor for more gentle areas.</li>
            <li>WHY are the reviews on Amazon so often full of lies?  </li>
            <li>Was able to trim my &amp;#34;lady parts&amp;#34; neat and get a very close shave on my legs.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, sturdy, overall nice.</li>
            <li>Safely cuts real close to remove unwanted body hair.</li>
            <li>, I really could not ask for more from a product.</li>
            <li>We use it for our more intimate areas.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could return it for a full refund.    </li>
            <li>It really does charge in 50 minutes, which is one of my favorite things.  </li>
            <li>I also like the styling of it and the battery last for a good while.</li>
            <li>It was simple and felt like good quality.</li>
            <li>The only problem is the batteries are not quite as good as they should be but last a good while.  </li>
            <li>a no thrills electric razor that isn&#x27;t good enough for your face, nor does it give a close shave anywhere else on your body.</li>
            <li>I have opted for full body waxes instead.</li>
            <li>It does not shave the face, the clippers are the only thing good on this product</li>
            <li>still doesn&#x27;t cut my sideburns or trims close enough to make it any good.  </li>
            <li>its true</li>
            <li>/trim is good and is built to last.</li>
            <li>it looks that cool.</li>
            <li>It trims very well, probably better than the 2020.</li>
            <li>It really is a full body trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to have as a back up, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li>I would charge it until full, take it off and leave it alone until use.</li>
            <li>You do need to go slow &amp; take your time until you figure out which direction works best for you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that the preference varies among the user how close or how much you want to be groomed, so I didn&#x27;t feel the need to knock off a star or take that into account when reviewing the product.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, to my bewilderment, this thing really works, and better than I imagined.</li>
            <li>I loved that trimmer when I returned to the states I used my universal converter</li>
            <li>The dual ends is cool.</li>
            <li>I walked out into my living room after shaving where there was natural light coming through the window and the light made hairs show up like magic that I couldn&#x27;t see before in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>how soft and nice the shaved area after using this machine.</li>
            <li>It cuts close enough to the skin and is good at edging.</li>
            <li>This is solidly constructed shaver that feels good in your hand.  </li>
            <li>Even though the instructions state not to use the foil shaver above your neck, I have been using it on my face and it works good.    </li>
            <li>I have had at least three groomers and this Norelco is the best.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll of course get the best results when you take things slow when using this.</li>
            <li>full shaved ..amazing alll around body groomer</li>
            <li>I would recommend to any man keeping a beard full and neat.</li>
            <li>Worked fairly well for trimming unwanted body hair, but the battery life vanished after several months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found there&#x27;s a nice rocking action to the shaver end</li>
            <li>This sucker works great!</li>
            <li>man!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That may be true...</li>
            <li>This product is as stated in the Ads, a good groomer where you can maintain different areas the way you like.</li>
            <li>you really have someone in mind that you&#x27;d just love to give them this as a \\&quot;gift\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x60;t used more than 20min with my legs, very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it comes with a more modern looking base.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is that I&#x27;m returning both guides for full credit and will retire my Bodygroom.</li>
            <li>I heard good things about the 2040 and decided to just go to the next level.  </li>
            <li>For instance, the screen-end doesn&#x27;t save any time over shaving with a good standard multi-blade razor.</li>
            <li>a 20 minute recharge at most and it is ready.</li>
            <li>It had a full charge after that.  </li>
            <li>it will keep this shaver in top condition and really get rid of the stuble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you know if it is charging or not, it lights up when the battery is full</li>
            <li>This one is nice and working well so far.</li>
            <li>this is a good product, the only thing there may be a question about</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s safe to admit that I was really scared.</li>
            <li>and the full charge lasts about 5 shaves for me.</li>
            <li>I have been a true Philips Norelco fan since beginning - but this product made me vouch for it to all buyers..</li>
            <li>I have a Panasonic ES-LA63 full size razor that I use for my face and some on my body</li>
            <li>But overall it does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li>This thing is the champ of body hair remover, faster than a razor and a quick clean job and the wife sneaks it to trim her peach to.</li>
            <li>Love it, it really works.</li>
            <li>It runs something like 5 minutes on a full charge and then requires a recharge.</li>
            <li>The shaver is really gentle and the Bodygroom Pro has a countouring/pivoting head that moves making for a better shave.</li>
            <li>and while it worked fairly well (only one nick with foil&#x27;s comb, which the trimmer in the BG2040 helps to mitigate happening again), I couldn&#x27;t stand the charging routine that NiCad batteries require.  </li>
            <li>If you have been reading the reviews on this they are all true.</li>
            <li>Having two layers of trimming power really makes this product worthwhile.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>When I started my research for a versatile body groomer for my sensitive areas, I first looked at Norelco products and this one had good reviews.</li>
            <li>Not a bad razor at all..</li>
            <li>Its not bad.</li>
            <li>not a bad thing but not my preference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to buy a whole new one hoping it would work as great as the first one I purchased before replacing the head on it.</li>
            <li>Well, this sleekly designed and easy to use body groomer is just the ticket to safely and professionally get the look (and feel) that we want.</li>
            <li>So, as a lady, I have previously owned and loved a Panasonic lady&#x27;s shaver, but wanted to see if I could find something that was shaped better - ie.</li>
            <li>is a noticeably better made product superior in manufacture and use (the motor vibrates less and is quieter</li>
            <li>It is simple to operate, easy to manipulate and effective.</li>
            <li>This is the first full body groomer that I have used worry-free!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Resuming:: it is one of the best electronic products I&#x27;ve ever bought, the cost/benefit is unbelievable!</li>
            <li>The razor works better than the other models and the 2 different sides are perfect for triming and shaving.</li>
            <li>Gaining confidence from other reviewers, I used it and am very pleased with the results!  </li>
            <li>and I mean everywhere and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom all over and my ego is through the roof right now.  </li>
            <li>when i was read the positive responding i was enthusiastic to much of the product.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>Charging is pretty easy --</li>
            <li>Charging is pretty easy --</li>
            <li>First of all, the plug comes out easily, so if you pick up the cradle the plug may fall out.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to trim the verge quite easily and quickly with the old model.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer on the back with the guard removed helped to clean up the areas missed but not as smooth as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comes apart easy after you figure it out the first time for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can hold the guard in place pretty easily so it doesn&#x27;t move if you are nervous about that.</li>
            <li>A quick charge on the stand was all it took for a full charge and there wasn&#x27;t a nick on me afterward.</li>
            <li>Parts remove easily for cleaning and it does exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t take any risk if you are grooming your private parts, with this one you do it secure and fully confident!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s tight and let this great trimmer mow it smooth.  </li>
            <li>A regular   old razor is much more effective, quicker, and you get a better shave.  </li>
            <li>For the most part, this is the best product I&#x27;ve used for shaving my testicles &amp; genital area as razors are tedious, but I am very cautious and keep the skin pulled smooth!  </li>
            <li>This shaver leaves the skin super smooth when used right.</li>
            <li>So... read other reviews to confirm this is an uncommon issue.</li>
            <li>I had the original BG2020 when it was released and rarely used it.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it works great</li>
            <li>However every other area it is great.</li>
            <li>Other guys have given it great reviews</li>
            <li>this its a great groomer because has 2 sides to select if you dont want anything of hair or select the other side to control the lenght</li>
            <li>The BodyGroom Pro is so much better than the original BodyGroom that Philips should have chosen a new name for this product.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best trimmer I have ever owned, and I only buy top of line electronics.  </li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream or even be in the shower, this is extremely helpful for quick touchups on the fly and convenient.</li>
            <li>The two different heads, work very well and gives a very nice shave, easy to use and very fast..</li>
            <li>For the new ones getting into trimming and more so shaving please PLEASE PLEASE:  - clean yourself well  - go in one direction (for now)  - take your time (go in stages)  </li>
            <li>This is must have for every man care about his clean and keep the smell fresh.</li>
            <li>Using actively twice a week, great shaver and trimmer.</li>
            <li>This shaver is super fast for body shaving and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The cutter is constructed of cheap material, and the motor does not turn fast enough to warrant a good, clean and even trim of my goatee.  </li>
            <li>Yes its safe for your most private parts.</li>
            <li>Quick reCharge.</li>
            <li>The product shipped and was received quickly with out any troubles.    </li>
            <li>a quick word on the &amp;#34;3D Pivoting Head&amp;#34; that they advertise.  </li>
            <li>I quickly learned that there was nothing to worry about.  </li>
            <li>Great Product, Price but battery is already dying fast after only about a dozen uses.</li>
            <li>did what it was supposed to do quick, close shave.</li>
            <li>Seems to be well built especially the attractive stainless metal and rubber grip housing.  </li>
            <li>It recharges fairly quickly and holds its charge well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been working out recently and after starting to see some awesome results, the hair all over just wasn&#x27;t complementing me.  </li>
            <li>But after a month - and after the time to get the item returned - the battery just quickly faded.  </li>
            <li>It glided effortlessly through all parts doing the job quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the older model, but people are really satisfied with it.    </li>
            <li>I quickly gave up and just decided to return it.  </li>
            <li>It will also help clean out the hair from the razor head by absorbing any skin oil/moisture and thus the hair can just be blown/brushed out easily for cleanup.      </li>
            <li>However, I feel that the cheaper older models work better; giving me a smoother closer shave.</li>
            <li>Typically I am a loyal Norelco user.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;(You can also take the guide off to quickly shave longer</li>
            <li>This razor took care of that problem; you can get a quick shave</li>
            <li>Just go slow on the family jewels, otherwise, welcome to a more hairless world.</li>
            <li>I can get an even smoother shave if I spend a great deal of time (10-15 minutes), but this really isn&#x27;t practical for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 7100 is a striking improvement over the older model.</li>
            <li>I found it was working quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>It might be ok for trimming beards, but a proper trimmer will do better.</li>
            <li>the older one is better.  </li>
            <li>The build seems adequate</li>
            <li>That one the battery died rather quickly in my opinion.</li>
            <li>If you move too quickly it will pull on your skin and cause irritation.</li>
            <li>It even shaves better than the older model.  </li>
            <li>The older models were better.</li>
            <li>and this is my quick view on this product.</li>
            <li>I am super hairy below the neck</li>
            <li>received my product quickly.</li>
            <li>I was lucky</li>
            <li>: The trimmer is decent, but could be better.</li>
            <li>I was able to reach most of my back which has always been a problem.</li>
            <li>so I can give myself a quick shave when in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Really seems like the battery life should be better for a rarely used groomer.  </li>
            <li>: Requires multiple passes with the razor part to get all hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an awesome product for all necessary body-hair grooming needs!</li>
            <li>The pivoting head on the larger end is a welcome feature I did not know I needed and makes for a much safer, smoother trim.</li>
            <li>I use it for a quick face shave if I don&#x27;t have time to shave with a razor.</li>
            <li>The cost from Amazon was also a plus and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Very practical and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Cuts quickly and zero pulling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky if I can trim my chest before it dies on</li>
            <li>So, I decided to buy the latest model since the charger for the older one was about $13.</li>
            <li>Until we got this Norelco BodyGroom Pro which is Super</li>
            <li>You want that nice smooth look, especially the boys, this is your go to.  </li>
            <li>Eazy to handle and quick to charge.  </li>
            <li>overall strategy is that I have begun using this as a day-to-day in the shower to keep hair neat and under control, and will periodically use a razor to get a nice, smooth finish.</li>
            <li>You do need to be careful in sensitive areas because no shaver will be perfect.</li>
            <li>I decided to get something actually made for multi-use and that was claimed to have better a better battery-type that also hopefully didn&#x27;t take hours to charge.  </li>
            <li>For those men that like to keep the bonsai (as Philips Norelco calls it) looking nice there is no other choice than this.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and light pressure required.</li>
            <li>But given its obvious purpose as a groomer for MEN, particularly the hirsute subgroup, it seems remarkable that the design team omitted to consider that men are no more able to shave their backs alone than fly without wings.</li>
            <li>The trimming end works great to tame armpits and bikini areas, and the shaving end gives a close but comfortable shave elsewhere.</li>
            <li>This product on the other hand is very very effective.</li>
            <li>The shaver portion does a great job on the &amp;#34;boys&amp;#34; and I love the smooth feeling there and am addicted to it now.</li>
            <li>I used the trimmer side to trim the hair short and then applied baby powder so that the foil can glide more easily, and then the shaving side shaved it clean off.</li>
            <li>my razor bumps from normal shaving cleared up and smoothed out my skin a bit, this shaver is doing better.  </li>
            <li>The shaver did a fantastic job on most parts but not very well on the more contoured areas.</li>
            <li>It is also waterproof making clean up easy, especially for me since using it in the shower means not having to lay out towels on the floor and sink top to catch all the falling hair.</li>
            <li>Results: after the first day of use, the hair was still smooth</li>
            <li>willing to return it and buy a cheap haircut machine that is cordless.  </li>
            <li>normally write humorous reviews, just to be an a-hole.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very glad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one of them, so that might be the reason why using normal razors are better for</li>
            <li>For the first couple uses it works fantastic</li>
            <li>The clippers work well, but I recommend just buying better quality hair clippers for a lower price, and then using a normal 4-5 blade razor for shaving.</li>
            <li>First body groomer that I enjoy using.</li>
            <li>I just trimmed the very top of my chest and back of</li>
            <li>I have tried everything for body grooming, scissors, razors, other grooming tools from Amazon, this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>If you do not care about how long it can hold a charge, I would recommend you buy it because it is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>Fair price to equipment value (far cheaper than many facial shavers)  </li>
            <li>I wanna say that this is an overpriced product, but then I&#x27;d be saying that it&#x27;s worth buying at a lower price, which isn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;chrome looked not so good after long period of using</li>
            <li>If this describes you, don&#x27;t buy an electric body groomer at all and find some really good sensitive skin shave cream plus a fairly expensive razor because this will give you the best results.</li>
            <li>Good , but if you have long body hair there may be some pian</li>
            <li>this shaver works good and it holds a charge for a long time before you need to plug it in.</li>
            <li>keeps charge for long time and good grip.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good groomer for a long time and got the Norelco Bodygrom Pro after reading the reviews at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the result that i had very smooth on my body &amp; remarkably great in my groins area and my other sensitive places , I&#x27;ve never used bodygroom before until i got this product..</li>
            <li>This little buddy is a fantastic solution to keeping a smooth, safe groom that you (and your lady) will love.</li>
            <li>As advertised this is a great razor for the neck down.</li>
            <li>it worked great and trimmed the length of the hair down</li>
            <li>Great shaver for the face and down south.</li>
            <li>I bought it for grooming down below and it works great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great neck down trimmer.</li>
            <li>The trimmer work great and works particularly well for trimming leg hair (different lengths can be selected) or bushy chest hair.</li>
            <li>I clean myself up every few months and feel great.</li>
            <li>great for trimming down there and arm hair and arm pit but does not do so well for legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a lot of hair so trimming down under and on the stomach worked great.  </li>
            <li>, I experienced this as well, however I figured out that you must trim the hair down with the razor</li>
            <li>, I also shave down under and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use and very portable.</li>
            <li>, I am a hairy guy and this does a great job for all other areas!</li>
            <li>Its quite easy to use once you get a hang of it (which doesn&#x27;t take long) and it has been, for me,  the most comfortable way to remove all the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>This has not cut me a single time and since there are some pretty sensitive areas, that&#x27;s an awesome thing.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does seem to make a good every other day basic trimmer, but doesnt even come close to waxing, razor shaving, or even a good electric razor.</li>
            <li>and I love the new man-scaped version</li>
            <li>most new Philips shavers</li>
            <li>new version holds a charge much better and the head stays put.</li>
            <li>I previously owned the Norelco BG2020 and got great use of it for about 2 years.</li>
            <li>The waterproof feature is od great help for cleaning which was my problem with my previous model.</li>
            <li>I owned the previous version of this item and it worked great</li>
            <li>But this shaver was easy to use and worked very well.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth $60 for a quick trim and shave whenever needed.</li>
            <li>Great product it works really well and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>After a while it seemed too easy, so I really got after it, and still nothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- the shaving blade seems to be better quality, and also seems to operate at higher speeds then the 2020, shaves seemed much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For 4 years of use, I feel like I got my moneys worth in the long run and dealt with good customer service....</li>
            <li>The head (side) that has the shaver works fine, except that if your hair is more than 2 inches long it would hurt a bit and won&#x27;t work smoothly.    </li>
            <li>Thanks for the easy return Amazon.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy.</li>
            <li>very practical and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>While this gets a very close and easy shave you still need to take your time.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty good.</li>
            <li>I keep an extra pair of head, for sometimes in a pinch, I have even shaved my face with it, and it did do a pretty good job there too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Philips Norelco BG2040 Body Groom Pro is a pretty fair tool for shaving my back and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>My wife dislikes body hair just as much as I do and this trimmer makes it easy to keep it all under control.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job on my upper legs.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco Bodygroomer is easy to hold and works very well.  </li>
            <li>Gentle, easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t irritate?</li>
            <li>Now I know that electric razors in of themselves aren&#x27;t perfect, but even if it didn&#x27;t cut FULLY I would at least expect a consistent cut if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>Now I know that electric razors in of themselves aren&#x27;t perfect, but even if it didn&#x27;t cut FULLY I would at least expect a consistent cut if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>It has a blade for every part of your body and is reasonably quite as well as provisioned with a strong battery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the original BodyGroom for years which I loved other than I seemed to replace every year or two.  </li>
            <li>its look nice and really easy to put it in bag for travail ( its dont have bag ) and its really look clean after many used and heavy work  ..    </li>
            <li>I also own the smaller Norelco with all the different attachments and find it&#x27;s not only more effective and versatile but does a better job as well.</li>
            <li>problem (at least for me) is: I have very fine hair, not a lot, but gotta keep the edges trimmed so the lawn looks good.  </li>
            <li>nice skin tight and very smooth</li>
            <li>Easy to use, great price; purchased one previously and paid more for the same brand and model.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be back for more!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product because it has all the features in one!!!  </li>
            <li>, its  more like completely hairless-yay!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li>According to the directions, it needed to be charged first - dang it!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I can use this thing on my most sensitive areas without worrying about nicks or scratches!  </li>
            <li>Does exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>Just gotta make sure you follow the instructions to keep this great manscaping tool working for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and recharges pretty fast (about an hour or so).</li>
            <li>This thing is pretty legit, I can use it everywhere/ anywhere with out getting cut!</li>
            <li>For something like this to get 5 stars it would have to come with a hot chick (or guy if that&#x27;s the way you swing) to do the shaving for me!</li>
            <li>Works very well!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I did though Knick myself where the sun don&#x27;t shine, very minor, but at the same time you cant expect a product that is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how protected the blades were yet I was able to get a quick and close shave/trim everywhere (including the \\&quot;Kiwi\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t cut or pinch even in folds, leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It was about half the price, and I liked it much better.  </li>
            <li>This is great for something quick and convenient, or for getting rid of hair where you don&#x27;t want to use a blade, but it&#x27;s just not a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Double sided, makes it nice for a quick change between trimming and shaving.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not using it everyday or more than once a week.&lt;br /&gt;cleans easy, and pulls apart quick and easy too.&lt;br /&gt;trims clean and even&lt;</li>
            <li>Good for chest an back, not so good for down below..</li>
            <li>I recommend buying it, but just be prepared to spend at least more than an hour doing a full shave if you want it looking perfect (arms, legs, armpits, feet, private area, and belly button area).</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use the shaver in really sensitive areas but once you get the hang of it you can get a very smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to clean,  long lasting charge.</li>
            <li>I have a cordless beard trimmer that I got when my first one started to not hold a charge well that I use for keeping the sides clean</li>
            <li>I have a cordless beard trimmer that I got when my first one started to not hold a charge well that I use for keeping the sides clean</li>
            <li>I can even clean up my hairline pretty well between haircuts.  </li>
            <li>First time using it shaved me clean with no issues.</li>
            <li>The smaller end more easily navigates nooks and crannies and suits my needs better than the old BG2020 with attachments.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works pretty good dry but with some shaving gel and a hot shower this thing is smooth</li>
            <li>So, I purchased this great little Norelco BodyGroom</li>
            <li>I suppose if your hair is more fine than coarse.</li>
            <li>The dual buzzers by the shaver help to make it more comfortable and easy because it cuts longer hairs down and then has the shaver right there to shave it clean.</li>
            <li>but I found it to be slow and takes time to have a very good shave.</li>
            <li>For the first time, I can really clean up the most sensitive of body parts without any discomfort, pain, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Regardless, it finally fully charged, and I used the trimmer a little later that day on the shortest setting and it done a good job, so I was very happy about that part.  </li>
            <li>Jack of all trades  easy to clean  switches between functions super fast  super sweet rocking action on the shaver</li>
            <li>blade on the trimmer will remove any kind of hard hair, it works smoothly and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It’s comfortable and trims very wellskin-friendly shave.</li>
            <li>It also did an amazing job on the back door!  </li>
            <li>This thing has been an amazing investment for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was born particularly hirsute, so much so that it would be easy to mistake me for a wild animal</li>
            <li>Does not create produce baby smooth skin, but very close.</li>
            <li>The supplied plastic stand feels somewhat cheap and isn&#x27;t very stable.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a really close and silky smooth shave, this isnt the product for you.</li>
            <li>What I found was it does get a smooth skin finish, but it comes with all the downfalls of using a straight edge razor (ie: ingrown hairs).</li>
            <li>I have worked very well, perfectly smoothly</li>
            <li>Worked great for a few weeks and now it doesn&#x27;t charge anymore.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this to anyone who wants that smooth feeling anywhere below the neck.</li>
            <li>You have to be patient using it, not going too fast, and it does give a close smooth shave without nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>The shaving end cuts very close, leaving you with smooth skin after you are finished.</li>
            <li>My husband likes it because it does get very close to the surface and stays smooth for quite a while.</li>
            <li>I bought this cause of a review stating that it was an amazing personal ball hair cutter.</li>
            <li>The picture is accurate, in the portrayal of the motion necessary to remove foil shaver, but a bit more direction in regards to this would be helpful.</li>
            <li>When I ordered Philips Norelco, I expected it to be much better than those cheap things, and fortunately it was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it works great....</li>
            <li>Like any electric razor, you are not going to get a razor-blade close shave, but the difference is negligible unless you absolutely need to be baby smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned it for a few weeks now and it works great.</li>
            <li>even in the most sensitive places</li>
            <li>i was used the old model for more than 1yr or 2yr ,,    </li>
            <li>its auto stop charging after full but close ur power as soon as u can after full charge     i really recommend it</li>
            <li>I had to return the item and use the regular razor blades, which gives me better control with a close, smooth shave without the nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>You can go in all directions with it and has a comb and then a close shaver to make sure you are as smooth as possible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried women&#x27;s bikini area trimmer/shavers and they don&#x27;t work worth</li>
            <li>Your review was informative, enlightening and, yeah, at times</li>
            <li>First, it looks cool.  </li>
            <li>Worth the investment in every way</li>
            <li>The charge lasts about 10 minutes when fresh.  </li>
            <li>It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the cost for something that does its job this well.</li>
            <li>Now, for the more sensitive parts of the body, the 3D pivoting head is a charm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice that only one end will operate at a time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely \\&quot;frank and beans\\&quot;safe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the shape/bulkiness of the groomer.  </li>
            <li>And THAT is worth alot to anyone.</li>
            <li>groomer itself is heavier and bigger than the BG2030 and fits more comfortably into my hand when using it.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is surprisingly effective at getting through hairy areas and the plastic guide has 5 settings without needing to use different plastic attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall if you&#x27;ve been using the BG2030 and could use a trimmer attachment this model is worth the $10 incremental cost.</li>
            <li>The design is so good that I was able to reach my upper back all by myself without any assistance.  </li>
            <li>The price is extremely fair for such a wonderful product, so, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>The product clearly says that it is not for facial use, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>I had the old model of this before with the changeable heads which broke after too many drops on the tiles.</li>
            <li>Foil end of groomer gets surprisingly close with not really much irritation.  </li>
            <li>Overall a nice package.</li>
            <li>I just kind of figured all body trimmers were created equal.  </li>
            <li>This thing is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>No switching attachments, decent battery (but no indicator) and really easy to use.    </li>
            <li>Make sure to run the batteries completely out before recharging for another 10 hours and never leave it on the charger for days on end if you care to have it work for years to come.</li>
            <li>so far, this seems to be better built then</li>
            <li>Well worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I used to regularly maintain my body hair with Gillette Fusion razor and shave gel before i was driven to Gove it all up altogether for my own wellbeing.</li>
            <li>Kind of big in size.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer with the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; is kind of fragile.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the coin.</li>
            <li>The shaver side is only good for areas with very sparse hair.    </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t worth your money at ANY price.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s the same idea.</li>
            <li>If it provided the shave it provides now, but saved 80% of the shaving time, it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Kind of a short life span, however.</li>
            <li>this shaver, wish I would of had this all my life, simple and effective at removing body hair</li>
            <li>Initially, my husband and I liked this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>worth every penny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only kind my fiance will use.</li>
            <li>Okay so far.</li>
            <li>Contours to any part of the body, even the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>looks like a fresh waxing or shave without the razor bumps..</li>
            <li>I shave almost every thing in my body, Just don&#x27;t apply pressure in more sensitive areas, take your time</li>
            <li>To clear any doubts, this is solely a bodygroomer and as such is a great piece of kit.</li>
            <li>the fun part.</li>
            <li>Worth the $50 just buy it</li>
            <li>This electric razor will do far more damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought in from Amazon Austria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had much success with the shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li>Clearly, others love this device</li>
            <li>Have fun</li>
            <li>I have a wet/dry Panasonic electric shaver that is far better.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth the $30-40 bucks you can save on having it do a lot of razor work.</li>
            <li>, I think I&#x27;ve spent good amount of $$</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as powerful as I would like</li>
            <li>Feels cheaply made, and does the job only ok.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for sensitive areas mostly.  </li>
            <li>The manual that comes with it doesn&#x27;t clearly indicate how to pull off the top.</li>
            <li>I have owned a few body razor&#x27;s for men and so far I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money invested.</li>
            <li>The old one lasted more than a decade and cost me $37 (bought in 1999, died in 2012).  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t actually do an exact measure, but it&#x27;s around the neighborhood of 30 minutes per full charge.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job on all the remote areas.</li>
            <li>(worth the money)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thus far, I have used this device twice, the trimming function works well, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It was definetely worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I liked it enough to get another.  </li>
            <li>Clearly, others love this device</li>
            <li>This is ok, but not great, the shave isn&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li>This is much better than the old version.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth it to upgrade to this version of the BodyGroom, over the cheaper versions.</li>
            <li>The razor side does remove easily , but again to my mind the diagram is not as realistic as I would like.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re deciding between the 2, this one is worth getting just for</li>
            <li>According to my husband the face trimmer isn&#x27;t worth anything.</li>
            <li>He uses that to shave with before he uses a straight razor and he says its not even good enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I contacted Philips and they were kind enough to still send me a replacement handle.</li>
            <li>However, I contacted Philips and they were kind enough to still send me a replacement handle.</li>
            <li>When you open the box it has to charge, but it is really nice.</li>
            <li>real user friendly--the pivotal shave head is very convenient and far better than the Remington I was using.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m really satisfied so far with this product.</li>
            <li>It is WELL worth the money.</li>
            <li>then it would be a useful things.</li>
            <li>I debated returning the product but decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle and am still using the product.  </li>
            <li>luck and have fun</li>
            <li>but I think it is worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth</li>
            <li>This is better than a razor and it worked better than expected.  </li>
            <li>The BG2020 was a simple and effective unit and after it died after 11 months I requested warranty repair via phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT is it worth the risk?</li>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase definitely money well spent.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This is much better than the cheap kit I used to have with a bunch of different plastic</li>
            <li>one does not only look better, more modern</li>
            <li>Well worth your money.</li>
            <li>No knicks so far and the battery life is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it looks nice, and has a very solid</li>
            <li>worth every penny...</li>
            <li>Not terribly inconvenient, but I knew it was just a matter of time before</li>
            <li>Well worth it.  </li>
            <li>it is worth to have.</li>
            <li>Clearly there must be better values out there.</li>
            <li>That said, the beard trimmer does such a nice job</li>
            <li>If anyone could recommend a good back shaver that is not the Mangroomer, thanks in advance.</li>
            <li>but I defintaley got my moneys worth out of it.</li>
            <li>Not in the fact that it cost me a lot, but for the amount of times I use it and how useful its been, heck yes</li>
            <li>Far better than the VS Igroom</li>
            <li>spectacular in everything but the following downsides:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>But, if you already have a 3 head Norelco, I can&#x27;t say this is worth getting, unless you don&#x27;t like the idea of using your face shaver elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I had come to realize that that pain wasn&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>If you are more infrequently than that, stay far away from this.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this thing, it is well worth the money</li>
            <li>...totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>And believe me it is worth your money....</li>
            <li>It does not cut as close as I had hoped and requires way more than one pass to clear hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to complete the process</li>
            <li>charger is nice too, only thing to be improved must be the price.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>trimmer is useful</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The battery charge seems to last for a good while, much longer that the trimmer I replaced.</li>
            <li>, however the shaving end takes many passes to remove the stubble in sensitive areas causing some irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the BodyGroom Pro once so far, but it did a great job.</li>
            <li>It works great for preventing razor bumps in the man region but as far as closeness it doesn&#x27;t beat a regular Quattro blade.  </li>
            <li>You still need to be careful but it does the job almost as good as a razor.  </li>
            <li>Makes manscaping soooo much easier especially in the lower areas which you need the most concentration..:)</li>
            <li>Its extremely easy to use, safe on ANY region of your body, and not very loud at all.</li>
            <li>Solid construction, easy to use and a zip to clean!</li>
            <li>It is very good at getting a very close shave, and I feel safe enough to use it for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas, which I can only assume is the main purpose of this product.</li>
            <li>Will nip you if you&#x27;re not careful but overall does a good job and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my new shaver for the past couple of weeks and this thing is the best!  </li>
            <li>If you have more hairy areas, you can knock it down quickly and efficiently with the bottom part of this device, and then follow up with the top part to get it</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Philips Norelco Bodygroom Pro Grooming System, Black / Silver]]This product is great value for money and does exactly what it says on the box.</li>
            <li>The other end works better and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It was pretty good on the original as well, but this new one seems to be lasting longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I researched other products and models and this was definitely the best buy.</li>
            <li>While this razor would make a great beard trimmer, it is lacking in the body trimmer section, mainly because it doesn&#x27;t provide a very close shave, especially with the buzzer side.</li>
            <li>The flip side is awesome for shaving neck and back hair or virtually any other hair below the nape of the neck.</li>
            <li>It allows you to clean up and look smooth and hair free in a short time.</li>
            <li>The clipper is ideal for trimming, and the shaver is close enough for body work (but is neither intended for, nor would be sufficient to shave one&#x27;s face; the directions flat out tell you not to in fact).</li>
            <li>I owned the previous version of this groomer and found this to be a more efficient less bity version that works excellent everywhere</li>
            <li>I have since used this on 2 other occasions to equally good success.  </li>
            <li>At first I was pretty but not totally disappointed in it.</li>
            <li>The battery charged up quickly the first time</li>
            <li>but the next couple of shaves &#x3D; nick free, pain free and pretty smooth.  </li>
            <li>So nice work better than expected and expectations were high</li>
            <li>Ok, so I have dabbled somewhat in manscaping before, which mainly involved using Nair for Men all over my body, which worked very well even for my netherparts.  </li>
            <li>And most times, you&#x27;d have to go through the same area a couples of times to get a clean cut.  </li>
            <li>Also make sure to clean it regularly after each shave.  </li>
            <li>The side with the adjustable fins is great for trimming down regular body hair and, contrary to the instructions, is great for trimming facial hair to that 3 o&#x27;clock shadow look if you take the guard off.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I have is taking off the top to clean it.</li>
            <li>But when i shaved my upper arms and tried to clean up the top of my chest</li>
            <li>and i really like how it feels and shave a lot better then the older model.  </li>
            <li>I think works best when your hair and skin is a little moist, but not wet.</li>
            <li>Trying to shave a weeks worth of growth on my legs or arms with a razor is a nightmare, but if I go over it with this shaver first it shouldn&#x27;t take much time at all!!  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as good as i was hoping from other reviews.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested primarily in trimming hair outside of the groin, then fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have been using for a long while now, and I&#x27;m still glad I purchased this!  </li>
            <li>Good clipper on the other end though.</li>
            <li>Like the other people have said, this shaver is good for practicably anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li>Forget all the negative comments if you focus below your nrck &amp; this will prove to be a good buy!</li>
            <li>honestly, I still use it on my face and it certainly does a better job than my previous shaver.</li>
            <li>I will definitely try it while being dry the next time because I might get better results that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is awesome</li>
            <li>Even going very slow with the razor required me to make 2-3 passes to get successfully trimmed up; the &#x27;pre-trimmers&#x27; were doing a better job than the razor under the foil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>what its about right?</li>
            <li>The feel is just right with the razor.</li>
            <li>you knew that was coming right?    </li>
            <li>&quot; so the trimmers will lop them right off.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the right one</li>
            <li>So, then I charged it for 8 hours-ish, then used it right away.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Just when you&#x27;re cruising along, the head will catch on something, pivot, and the side blades go right into your nether bits.</li>
            <li>Like all things in life you have to pay attention to what your doing if you want it to come out right.</li>
            <li>Bonus, the 2040 model has all the attachments built right in</li>
            <li>This product was defective right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>The light indicates charging, low battery power and full battery, great to know since most of these devices can malfunction if left charging to long.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use it right away</li>
            <li>right out of the box</li>
            <li>And then you have to position the shaver just right</li>
            <li>It says so right up there in the instructions.  </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>but hey if it works it works right?</li>
            <li>This was even though i used an after shave moisterizing lotion on it right out of the shower and then again before bed and the morning after.</li>
            <li>having all the tools attached right to it</li>
            <li>right.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I made the right choice on this tool.</li>
            <li>The right tool for the job.</li>
            <li>Oh that&#x27;s right, it bends.</li>
            <li>Oh that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get right to it.</li>
            <li>Fits right on ones hand.</li>
            <li>so I would suggest charging right away.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the charging stand is cumbersome and the shaver does not always set right in it.  </li>
            <li>Believe all the hype, use it right</li>
            <li>It should be right?</li>
            <li>Which is wierd because I usually do it right after the shower, so there shouldn&#x27;t be anything to clog my pores.</li>
            <li>says it is- shears hair right off like</li>
            <li>I tried everything to get it to sit right</li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>I can put lotion on right after using</li>
            <li>works as I expected, easy to use, easy to charge, can be used to shave most of the body hair, highly recommanded</li>
            <li>This new one seems much more solid and shaves even better.</li>
            <li>still prefer my Norelco SensoTouch 3d for shaving my face... but the Bodygoom 7100 has won me over when it comes to transforming my winter Chewbacca coat to a smooth physique that allows me to stay MUCH cooler during the hot Texas summers.</li>
            <li>I had the older version with interchangeable blades and this is a HUGE step up.</li>
            <li>This thing worked great for the first few months.</li>
            <li>They charge quickly and are easy to keep clean and put away so you won&#x27;t gross your wife out with the pubic hair balls all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for keeping areas clean for taping, massage, etc.</li>
            <li>It gets everything looking clean, trimmed, and ready for a night out.</li>
            <li>The beard accessory is kinda flimsy, as another reviewer wrote it tends to go the the default 1 setting when held normally,  this is good for people like me who like to keep short goatees, but for those that don&#x27;t it could be an issue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very east to clean.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, don&#x27;t expect to be able to do your whole body on one charge after using this on a normal basis for a year.</li>
            <li>The instructions said, that you have to get used to the machine, and your shaving will improve in several weeks, If it is true It would be better than a razor.</li>
            <li>This thing has the capabilities to power through dense hair growth without the need to constantly clean out a razor blade, and has the added benefit of not irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li>This can get a decent smooth shave in just about any location on the body.  </li>
            <li>Cut my body grooming down from an hour to about 10 min, which is perfect for last minute date nights.</li>
            <li>This baby works perfect and without a doubt better than some other trimmers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>One end for bulk removal and the other end for a nice clean finish.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to any guy who has a lady friend who loves it when the balls are smooth as silk and there is no risk of a cough up.</li>
            <li>You will feel clean and your significant other will love the polished look.</li>
            <li>It works very well on all the special parts.  </li>
            <li>Very useful &amp; decent value.</li>
            <li>However, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t go quite short enough - I would have liked two more settings further down to get that &amp;#34;shaved two/three days ago&amp;#34; look, instead of the &amp;#34;shaved a week ago&amp;#34; that is the best I can get with it.</li>
            <li>Grooming my beard to specific length was easy and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve noticed that the clipper end has always been weaker and looses power much more quickly and than the foil shaving head even after coming off the charger after several hours.</li>
            <li>Super quiet though, and love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>I tried again with very very light pressure and had a little better result, but basically i don&#x27;t let the shaver foil touch my skin.  </li>
            <li>You can trim comfortably around the groin area without so much as a slight nick - and get a very clean shave!     </li>
            <li>from a woman&#x27;s perspective, I have never been able to find an intimate shaver that actually made me smooth but this shaver does the job and doesn&#x27;t leave cuts.</li>
            <li>My husband used this on a small area of his chest, and it worked great, though because of the space between the teeth, I don&#x27;t think the shave was as close as a handheld razor would provide, but it did the job.    </li>
            <li>The clipper end would be better if you could cut closer as well, while still leaving the guard on for a clip shorter than 1/4&amp;#34;, but longer than bare skin.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s worth discussing the bottom of the device - the \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; trimmer or clipper part.</li>
            <li>you are holding the shaver as it will nick you, and most likely in the most sensitive area too (as it did me).  </li>
            <li>At first this razor made shaving fun again.  </li>
            <li>Works well but thought I was buying a FULL body shaver capable of trimming &amp; shaving all areas.</li>
            <li>Worked well for about a year then it stopped charging normally (the light ceased indicating charge level).</li>
            <li>Most recently I started to shave my legs, ( actually spilled some hair remover on my legs and liked the look</li>
            <li>The shaver on both sides are easy to clean and it feels good in your hand; the opposite side does not interfere with the other side.  </li>
            <li>Saved considerable amount of time grooming, and offers outstanding pain free shaving results.</li>
            <li>but i Did a full shave (even areas where before i wouldn&#x27;t DARE) and not a nick,pinch, or oopsie the whole time.</li>
            <li>Apparently the trimmer end requires a significant amount of power to run, or it has its own battery that is defective, because no matter how long I charge the device, it starts to blink an orange warning light when the trimmer is running.  </li>
            <li>I realized this might burn the whole apartment building to the ground, so I took it out and stared at it for a full minute.</li>
            <li>This is so cool with it&#x27;s settings: you really can&#x27;t make a mistake on grooming levels for your hair all over your body.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different body groomer and this one is clearly the best.  </li>
            <li>It takes much longer than 1 hour to get a full charge.</li>
            <li>Pretty good shaver, seems to be as sharp as ever, doesn&#x27;t tug on my hair or anything like that.</li>
            <li>Will have more to offer on prolonged use but right now, I have not a single regret.</li>
            <li>This was a great trimmer while it lasted, but the battery has failed after 18 months of very light usage.  </li>
            <li>My wife just commented this am, how good i look down there.  </li>
            <li>The foil side works well for smoothing out the pubic area, chest and &#x27;starfish&#x27; without worry about nicks, cuts or razor bumps.taking the hair down to a good level which can then be smoothed out by the foil side.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s touted for use from the neck down, but I&#x27;d bet it would do a fair job of shaving one&#x27;s head, if that&#x27;s your thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the one model down is equally good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut body hair good at all even when you trim it down before shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neither end does well in the water, which sounded good when reading the reviews, but makes no sense, since you want the hair sticking up, not laying down, stuck to your skin under the adhesive and cohesive forces of water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The upper part seems to get stuck a little when shaving, the trimmer works excellent though.</li>
            <li>i would like to have a little more power and better battery life and pivoting head</li>
            <li>the trimming end left me with a freaking gash on my obliques and red marks all over stomach, it&#x27;s alright though, pretty cool body groomer, shaved my balls with the shaving side successfully</li>
            <li>The foil side is perfect for long hairs, but has lots of trouble cleaning up shorter hairs, takes several passes to get cleaned up nice below the waist.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been  looking for this kind of body groomer for a long time!</li>
            <li>and I thoroughly enjoy the new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but once I lathered up the first time and put it to work the hair just came right off of me.</li>
            <li>It also just wouldn&#x27;t be consistent right on my pectorals and I could feel hairs longer than the others that it just wouldn&#x27;t want to grab.</li>
            <li>It also just wouldn&#x27;t be consistent right on my pectorals and I could feel hairs longer than the others that it just wouldn&#x27;t want to grab.</li>
            <li>the first time was a bit tricky getting the right angle</li>
            <li>The hair on a guys body grows in so many different directions that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to be able to get a perfect finish.  </li>
            <li>it regularly -I found using it dry was better than wet, so I use it before I shower and then shower up afterwards  2 very happy customers!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, solid device.</li>
            <li>The battery has held strong thus far.  </li>
            <li>Unless the current model (GMT189RGB) of the one I had has changed any, it made a great personal and beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The battery has held strong thus far.  </li>
            <li>Unless the current model (GMT189RGB) of the one I had has changed any, it made a great personal and beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Care instructions are clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>I love being able to take care of it in the shower and not get the counter all messy.</li>
            <li>Not only does it keep you well groomed, the Bodygroom itself is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>This was quick and much easier.</li>
            <li>but more like every 4 months if you are using frequently because the blades do wear out fast.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I cut myself a few times before I figured out the best way to use</li>
            <li>It is heavier then the earlier models, has buzzers on both ends which can have only one on at a time (great incase ur absent minded like me at times).</li>
            <li>Have had it a short time and only a couple of uses but as discussed was great for the nether regions of the body that we&#x27;re all trying to shape up.  </li>
            <li>if you just wanted a quickly done shave without needing a really close shave, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li>I have tried waxing, traditional razors, and epilators, and this is by far the superior choice.</li>
            <li>One charge lasts about half an hour which is plenty of time to cover a fair amount of space.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of getting a close shave around the next and back.</li>
            <li>Overall, so far so good.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The side that has a trimmer with a comb is what is most useful, but that can be replaced by the trimmer on my face shaver (currently a Braun series 7 790</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not designed to do the heavy lifting of a mans beard Shaver, although with a better battery (Li-ion), and a better foil, it could have been a all in one</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing product, I recommend this to any guy who wants to have balls you can grip like two ripe grapefruits or raisins.  </li>
            <li>Allows more frequent trims which take much lest time than the semi-annual hair fest you are staging in your bathroom now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price this thing is worth it and all things considered I like it better than the last shaver I had</li>
            <li>BodyGroom produces a very close shave similar to the kind of shave</li>
            <li>The charge really holds and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re super hairy, just straight up.</li>
            <li>It really gives you a quick and close &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; of everything you will need to use it for.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts for a good while as I shave once every week and a half it has lasted me for two months before charging.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying to help keep up with day to day needs, but keep in mind you will likely need to supplement with something else if you want a smooth, irritation free finish.</li>
            <li>Easy and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t cover as much surface area as quickly.</li>
            <li>but I have to tell ya please if your interested and wanting your boys nice, clean and shavin down there</li>
            <li>long.&lt;br /&gt;the power stays consistent for a cordless device compared to other devices, very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I am unsure as to why so many people said it was a bad shaver because this shaver is actually pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>Works extremely well very satisfied with purchase</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty nice, but it&#x27;s really the only thing I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>but now that I&#x27;m using it on a consistent basis, I&#x27;m glad that I made the investment and believe that over time I&#x27;ll definitely get my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li>Excellent shaver for for body hair with long lasting battery charge complete with brush</li>
            <li>minor suggestion : that trimmer is kind of useless because that shaver end is so god damn excellent that the trimmer has a subduded role here !</li>
            <li>** out of luck, your disposable item goes right in to the landfill, and it&#x27;s back to Amazon to drop more $ on another product.    </li>
            <li>It does get you clean shaven all over but just be aware that you can&#x27;t speed shave downstairs like you could on the older model.</li>
            <li>Using powder will also reduce friction between your clothes and shaving areas, so this is particularly good for athletic folks or anyone who wears tight clothes.</li>
            <li>That attachment at the top can cut the hair anywhere on your body (i lost mine, so I have ordered a new Replacement Trimmer/Shaver Foil which is great because when you take it out to clean it, and your careless like I was you can lose it.</li>
            <li>I shave my entire head to a 2, and the settings on this are a little shorter than normal trimmers, so I place the setting to a 3 and am able to get a nice shave on the top of my head and beard.</li>
            <li>I would very much recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Wears our very fast.</li>
            <li>However, ultimately it will leave a VERY smooth finished product that will not lead to ingrown hairs, razor bumps, burn etc.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>While I am not an excessive &amp;#34;manscaper&amp;#34; it has worked very nicely for keeping my privy parts pretty.</li>
            <li>The battery charges very fast, about 2 hours from 0% to about 100%.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>No pain, no bumps, and very fast.</li>
            <li>and like it very much.</li>
            <li>The comb is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or irritation.</li>
            <li>Even save on the \\&quot;hoo-ha\\&quot; No nicks or pinches and it would get very very close.</li>
            <li>Very light and quiet.  </li>
            <li>I got amazing results using it dry, by the way!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve got kinda sensitive skin and its fine with no creams/gels/forms or anything</li>
            <li>When the screen popped a hole,I was able to find the replacement screen,so I got 2 new screens and one new razor</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews I convinced myself to just try it; and write an honest review for all the skeptic guys out there (like me) that don&#x27;t believe there really could be a device that could actually work for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will have to admit that even with the good reviews I was still a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work as advertised.  </li>
            <li>shaver part is really good, trimmer part size adjustment little bit ineffective.</li>
            <li>also it was easy to clean and comes with other accessories for full grooming from head to toe.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t live in Siberia, this is a significant problem because the ladies (below the arctic circle) don&#x27;t like this sort of thing.</li>
            <li>first off, the Norelco Bodygroom is a very, very well made piece of equipment.</li>
            <li>I just bought this nice little shaver and so far I am pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>the new charging station and self clean..</li>
            <li>/&gt;The feel was very comfortable in my hand, not too heavy and easy to hold with a lite grip</li>
            <li>Love the 2-in-1 for different lengths.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The battery doesn&#x27;t last more than 5 minute at a time anymore.</li>
            <li>Very versatile!</li>
            <li>, I deliberated that it would be proper to get something more permanent and reusable than a bottle of Nair.  </li>
            <li>Yes, getting pinched in the bag at first hurt.  </li>
            <li>Really works well , worth the price</li>
            <li>It can take hair out of those funny places that didn&#x27;t use to grow hair, but now they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can take hair out of those funny places that didn&#x27;t use to grow hair, but now they do.     </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li>to hot water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the first go, I was a nervous wreck...</li>
            <li>After searching reviews and different products online and eyeing every trimmer I came across in stores on and off for a couple of months, this one came towards the top and was priced not too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut myself more times using this trimmer than times I&#x27;ve been cut using anything else, for my entire life even.  </li>
            <li>I will say, the water proof feature is nice and it&#x27;s been the easiest to clean--mostly because I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting something wet</li>
            <li>and I still use it to bridge the gaps of this one for the more \\&quot;personal grooming\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even cut my neck with this nonsense--a first for any trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>Now I will say, the water proof feature is nice and it&#x27;s been the easiest to clean--mostly because I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting something wet</li>
            <li>and I still use it to bridge the gaps of this one for the more \\&quot;personal grooming\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even cut my neck with this nonsense--a first for any trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying more from Philips in the future...  </li>
            <li>and, you&#x27;ll never be the same all over...  :)</li>
            <li>Not one for writing reviews but had to say that I was somewhat apprehensive at first in buying this.</li>
            <li>However, it faded after I used it the first time.  </li>
            <li>The first go</li>
            <li>first take a hot shower, it opens up the skin pores.</li>
            <li>I was able to do the frank and beans, leather cheerio, upper legs, chest, arm pits, and feet within 10 minutes.    </li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver that has worked on my beard.</li>
            <li>and it fact the charging light goes off completely even when in the charger.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a guide if you&#x27;re interested.  </li>
            <li>first time it chewed into some skin...</li>
            <li>It gives a pretty close shave, but it does miss hairs, but so does a razor.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be the first shaver and trimmer that would work on the groin area</li>
            <li>This is exactly what every guy who likes to keep the downstairs grass trimmed or shaved needs...</li>
            <li>Worked well for the first couple years.  </li>
            <li>I charged it 100% before the first use, and got about 4 uses out of it before the battery died.</li>
            <li>The top is the close shaver side and bottom is for buzzing off larger quantities of hair at once.</li>
            <li>but I was able to figure out how to disassemble the shaving head easily enough without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most trimmers only offer this functionality.     </li>
            <li>The top of the device is a rotating head, with two short trimmers and an electric shaver foil in-between them.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as I would expect and would recommend it to anyone who likes to trim their beard in the shower.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, I charged it for about 10 hours and then used it</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t pulled or tugged or ripped out any hair and is pretty boss.</li>
            <li>and I love the physical design.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to shave chest, groin, and even further below with no nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li>No wonder Philips confidently gives a 45 day money back guarantee, no wonder why!</li>
            <li>It pulled a hair or two the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>love the fact that there is only one removable attachment</li>
            <li>I first used the trimmer end to trim the longer hair then switch to the shaver end.  </li>
            <li>It is aesthetically pleasing and has a modern look to it, so I&#x27;m not afraid to leave it on the bathroom counter at times.</li>
            <li>even a light rug on your back ain&#x27;t cool.  </li>
            <li>to to repeat, so I have switched back to shaving most of my netherregion with a Gillette Sensor.</li>
            <li>You can register online, which you&#x27;ll earn either an additional 6 months of warranty on the groomer, or a 15% discount on your next purchase of $100 or more at the Philips Norelco online store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work equally as well for women.he shaving head.</li>

            <li>This product may seem somewhat expensive at first however the thing does a great job where it needs to!  </li>
            <li>I have used many different shavers.  </li>
            <li>first thing you notice when you get the groomer out of the packaging is that the charging stand is rather clunky and unstable.</li>
            <li>It costs just a bit more than lesser products, but would be a bargain at twice the price with its ergonomics, ease of use, functionality and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Used the trimmer first to shorten the hair and then the shaver foil side.  </li>
            <li>Actually its more than that</li>
            <li>I bought this for the same reason many of you are looking into it:</li>
            <li>For shaving the face it just isn&#x27;t as close as the regular razors,  it&#x27;s better if you wanna keep trimmed.  </li>
            <li>For first timers like me you&#x27;ve got to be patient with this thing</li>
            <li>will give this product a couple of weeks to see if/how the results improve from regular use, but after my first night using it, I was not overly impressed, and if I didn&#x27;t believe in second chances, this would be going back to Philips</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the product in the brief period</li>
            <li>I first used this model before I purchased one by borrowing my father&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This is the first razor or shaver that I have ever used that didn&#x27;t either pinch, draw blood or leave a razor burn.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I purchased a BG2020 (the cheaper model by Phillips) about a year ago.</li>
            <li>After charging for 4 hours, I went to remove the product from the charger, and it was burning hot.</li>
            <li>It was so hot it could have burned my hand, but</li>
            <li>Its much more comfortable than using a razor and hair grows back soft.</li>
            <li>first trimmed my beard and mustache.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have had a product like this.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s always about a millimeter of stubble left no matter how many times you go over</li>
            <li>This is something to be aware of if you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing.    </li>
            <li>took me a couple of shaves* and the first I did nick myself on the first shave</li>
            <li>but pretty close.  </li>
            <li>In terms of cuts, dings, gashes, etc, it is definitely possible but more so from not paying attention, taking your time and planning what you&#x27;re going to do (think about it - do you think your barber just hacks away??</li>
            <li>If you are not accustomed to shaving/trimming and venturing in this area for the first time, then:    a) Talk to a woman (someone you trust); they&#x27;ve been doing this for years (think about it)</li>
            <li>Battery lasts long time, and its easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I really love this thing especially since its water proof it makes my life a lot easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Bodygroom since it first launched years ago and have been upgrading as Norelco improves the product.  </li>
            <li>boys\\&quot; at first</li>
            <li>First of all, I Will tell everyone who reads this.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews on this site and many others before I decided to finally pull the trigger and make the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, You can&#x27;t just run rampid and reckless and not get a bit nicked up.</li>
            <li>I mostly use this on my face to keep my beard trimmed very short.  </li>
            <li>I followed the direction exactly.  </li>
            <li>I owned the first one that came out BG2020</li>
            <li>The dual heads are a great idea in one unit because you really need different approaches to different body parts.</li>
            <li>primarily use the trimmer for sensitive areas and to shorten up some of the hair on my gorilla arms</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I read the manual when I first got it</li>
            <li>The battery life is more then sufficient for an entire body use (~35mins fully charged).</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it combines the different trim heads into one that glides along skin.</li>
            <li>In one year&#x27;s usage I never got more than ten minutes.  </li>
            <li>Today I woke up and shaving was the first thing I did.  </li>
            <li>The foil shaver end does work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>;-).</li>
            <li>Quite a few nice features, and well made, with a nice solid feel.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my sweetie who is pretty hairy.  </li>
            <li>at first.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Norelco!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>As one who is an avid shaver of unmentionable parts</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re hairy, buzz cut that junk first and use this as a detailer.....</li>
            <li>so it takes more time than my last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of you are probably thinking of one specific area that you would rather not injure while trimming/shaving.</li>
            <li>First it&#x27;ll pick your hair a bit.</li>
            <li>Much higher quality than the cheapo 20-25 dollar units you see in retail stores.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions (being my first time shaving), and started with my stomach.</li>
            <li>First stroke, no hairs pulled, just shaved.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d stick to a manual razor or use something a bit higher up on the quality totem pole than this.</li>
            <li>After reading many different reviews about many different groomers I was hopeful that this one would work out.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to recycle the battery responsibly and discard the shaver!</li>
            <li>MUCH better than the similar product made by Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I was nervous at first to use this on my man-hood, but after a couple times the nervousness has subsided.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is anything better than this currently on the market now.</li>
            <li>Sheesh I don&#x27;t grow hair that fast!</li>
            <li>Over the last couple months  I&#x27;ve scoured the internet as most probably had, looking for a \\&quot;best\\&quot; groomer.</li>
            <li>If your hair is too long, you will need something more powerful or you will spend all day.</li>
            <li>This was my first bodygroom product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews in products, but I finally found a razor that&#x27;s water proof and works perfect in groin region.</li>
            <li>My first one was over 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>Using it in the hot shower with gillette body shaving gel</li>
            <li>Ive decided to give it one more try two weeks from now and if it finally does what it says I will come and change this</li>
            <li>No uncomfortable nicks.</li>
            <li>The blades do not last forever so be sure to order replacements.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m actually quite pleased.</li>
            <li>Take it slow and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>, it will stop taking a charge between 6-12 months after first use.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>and I was weary at first to try an &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Overall, I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase and would recommend to any guy that is trying to get into some body hair management.</li>
            <li>Maybe mine is a dud, but why can&#x27;t it last more than thirty minutes?  </li>
            <li>First of all...when you venture below you you can nick yourself and yes when you do it bleeds and bleeds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had much better luck by powdering prior to the shave.  </li>
            <li>The body is pretty solid metal construction and looks to be able to survive a drop (although I cannot confirm this yet).  </li>
            <li>First let me state</li>
            <li>entire body has been shaved in 15 min :).</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have ever bought where I felt compelled to leave a review.   </li>
            <li>I charged it and used it three times before putting it back on the charger and could have used it more before recharging it.</li>
            <li>The first one I received was not holding a charge</li>
            <li>When I First Had Body Hair.</li>
            <li>first experience:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was able to trim a lot of areas on my chest, back, and no-no zone that needed some tending.</li>
            <li>I just did that (for the first time) and it fully recharged in exactly one hour as advertised.  </li>
            <li>For the first year I got about 20-30 minutes of use before the unit needed to be recharged.</li>
            <li>Well first off, I&#x27;m not a guy</li>
            <li>but it feels so much safer!  </li>
            <li>Probably better off just getting a trimmer and not paying extra for the shaver.</li>
            <li>So I was planning on using this to make it a better, happier place for her to visit but after nicking myself grooming my crotch, no way was I gonna try to turn myself into a Chinese contortionist to groom my butt crack.</li>
            <li>Battery life was more than enough for armpits, front torso and nether region.  </li>
            <li>Also the shaver end could be higher quality.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a replacement sent to me more than once, and each of the units have the same exact problem.</li>
            <li>Just as many reviewers (who initially convinced me to try this groomer) have said, this thing works wonders.</li>
            <li>It can safely be used almost anywhere, except it indicates it&#x27;s not made for the face or private areas.</li>
            <li>Most of the time it doesn&#x27;t bother me except when I wear a collared shirt with chest hair popping out or a short sleeve shirt with arms that look like they need combing.</li>
            <li>The first one stopped working for no reason after about 8 months.</li>
            <li>My first electric razor was a Norelco.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the end all be all to making your junk pretty</li>
            <li>Nothing has worked for me to get rid of the &amp;#34;itch.&amp;#34; After using this, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve been hairless &amp;#34;there&amp;#34; and have had no itch.</li>
            <li>They were not wrong.</li>
            <li>only thing better is that it had the trimmer attached, which I use often to trim my beard</li>
            <li>Consistent with those who suffered a battery/charge problem with this unit, my battery died as well.</li>
            <li>I love this no problem at all, and its actually waterproof.</li>
            <li>Well, I used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>but I feel its more work for an ok result, not a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I was glad this model had the double sided setup, cause</li>
            <li>First time using it</li>
            <li>It can cut pretty close if needed.</li>
            <li>(could be the amount of time since my last shave though), but cuts better, closer and reaches farther.  </li>
            <li>The battery outlasts the Wahl model I have owned for years, and the size of each head, clipper &amp; shaver, allows more nimble navigation than a standard clipper or face razor.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect a pain-free, nick free experience, you&#x27;ll be painfully surprised.</li>
            <li>Today I used it for first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shave where it counts with it ;)</li>
            <li>this is a pretty good trimmer with a few flaws, theres 3 trimmers for this 1 for longer hair for months of hair growth , 2 the trimmer for closer cuts after you used the one by itself...</li>
            <li>This shaver does exactly what you want it to do.</li>
            <li>If the blades on the &amp;#34;pre-trimmers&amp;#34; were closer together they wouldn&#x27;t be able to grab your skin and nick you (only an issue when manscaping).</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied!</li>
            <li>First use....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shave everything, and maintaining crisp lines with this tool is</li>
            <li>When I purchased the first Philips Norelco BG2040</li>
            <li>does exactly what it needs to do below the belt.</li>
            <li>I probably would have given this product four stars had it not failed about three months after purchase.  </li>
            <li>I was shaking with fear when at first attempt.</li>
            <li>Very well designed product and worth the higher price</li>
            <li>It seems to work better when shaving at the sink when your facial hair isn&#x27;t softened by the hot shower water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>both ends work exactly as needed and</li>
            <li>The BG2040 is safe to use on your private area no problems at all.</li>
            <li>I was able to exchange it at Bed Bath and Beyond for a replacement, but 18 months is too short of a battery life.</li>
            <li>me on one of the first uses...</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was the smoke detector.</li>
            <li>Now when I plug it in it gets REALLY hot</li>
            <li>first and then use the shaver.</li>
            <li>part felt a bit more solid when it&#x27;s rubbing against the skin.</li>
            <li>This shaver does exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it runs low on charge if I have been using it for more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>This is my first ever electric body razor</li>
            <li>Not everything i wanted in a razor... trims and shaves pretty well</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that it had a warrantee, it still would have been a lower graded review since of the inconvenience having to deal with a defective item in the first place.,</li>
            <li>First off, I must say that if you don&#x27;t know HOW to use the razor to shave your Kiwis you WILL cut up your twig-n-berries, this is not an opinion, this is a fact.</li>
            <li>It does shave your sausage and meatballs pretty close, pretty DAMN close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From my experience, the shaver wasn&#x27;t entirely consistent.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it was worth paying that much for what I ended up using it for so</li>
            <li>Great product from Norelco that should last a long time.</li>
            <li>I read complaints about it not shaving close enough, like shaving your face make sure the pull the skin taunt and again take your time,</li>
            <li>, firstly, there is no carrying case included, so you&#x27;ll have to take that in mind if you want to protect your shaver from accidental damage, or even just to store until you need it again.</li>
            <li>I bought this one as a replacement for the first one I had, after buying replacement heads it&#x27;s started to bite and cut in the area</li>
            <li>i only wish i could plug it into an outlet i would be able to use it longer</li>
            <li>Comfortable, doesn&#x27;t nick sensitive areas........</li>
            <li>As a groomer, this one works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>After years of being nicked by electric razors, I&#x27;m glad to have finally found this product.</li>
            <li>The design is great, works in the shower, 5 different length settings and makes total body grooming much quicker and faster than you might imagine.  </li>
            <li>with this product is it exactly as described and works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>And I absolutely love the different shavers or groomers.</li>
            <li>Then the plastic apparatus holding the top blade on the trimmer broke - it&#x27;s a simple pop out blade, (just apply pressure to the blades with your thumb after removing the plastic thing that controls closeness of the cut)</li>
            <li>I simple love this BodyGroom because it doesn&#x27;t procuce irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rarely trying to get really close on body parts</li>
            <li>That was better than the actual shaver.</li>
            <li>The trimmers are handy but buyer beware: the shaver is about as rough a shave as you can imagine.</li>
            <li>Smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>So the BodyGroom is definitely the better product for</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll most likely need the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li>so therefore it was better on the back.  </li>
            <li>Overall, you can&#x27;t do better in my opinion if your wanting to keep your body well groomed and don&#x27;t want hurt yourself in the process.</li>
            <li>My husband is pretty hairy</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to get too hot like some trimmers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However I came across the BG2040 on Amazon, and after seeing the glowing reviews for it took the plunge and purchased it (Not from Amazon, I found a better deal locally)  </li>
            <li>Dont by it, it was a second most expencive machine online</li>
            <li>So first off, let&#x27;s talk man to man.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the first time I&#x27;ve EVER used an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I would find a similar product, with more convenient charging options.  </li>
            <li>I used the trimmer first and then flipped it over to the shaver to finish it off.  </li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s like most shavers the battery will last well for the first part of its life but like all cordless things out there the batteries are going to deplete over time.  </li>
            <li>and i can say it does a great job in delicate areas</li>
            <li>shaver/groomer  performs exactly as described in all the five star reviews predicted.  </li>
            <li>The top one cuts the hair really short causing skin irritation and redness, sometimes the edges trimmer causes me to bleed too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This tool is exactly what a men&#x27;s body grooming device is supposed to be.</li>
            <li>the 3D pivoting head can still have improvements especially when handling the groin area, one should take his time and get used to maneuvering/handling it more.</li>
            <li>Economical price, found as described and fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Strongly recommended, will deal again in future for sure.</li>
            <li>It is safe to use on the pelvic area, upper thighs, and the crease of your thighs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got quite an ergonomic design and overall I&#x27;d rate it as outstanding.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to replace the head yet and it still works as well as when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>Definitely pay more to get the swivel head like this one has.  </li>
            <li>It is therefore tempting and logical to want to put the shaver in the cradle when done with it.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a wax job, you won&#x27;t get it.ore tempting and logical to want to put the shaver in the cradle when done with it.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has an awesome return policy so if your not satisfied you can always send it back.  </li>
            <li>The comb doesn&#x27;t fall out of place (which makes trimming a lot faster and safer(, it is much smoother, and there are now 5 trimming sizes opposed to 3!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and very sturdy build</li>
            <li>Youll feel safe and gets it close enough without making you bleed.</li>
            <li>On the first one the trimmer didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>and I hope Philips/Norelco use better quality batteries in future models.</li>
            <li>The battery life is more then enough.</li>
            <li>10 minutes at most even when you are being extra</li>
            <li>Purchased over 3 years ago and have been using it about once a week consistently.  </li>
            <li>you see a pattern?&lt;br /&gt;Norelco will keep you coming back for more</li>
            <li>This is the first body shaver I have ever purchased and</li>
            <li>but it seems I wanted it to work too much!</li>
            <li>I have a $20 facial trimmer than works much better than this product.</li>
            <li>You´ll get some cuts here and there, but no scary ones, unless you decide to go all lumberjack on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it perform?</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has two sides, one that lets you trim a specific length, and another that´s more for &amp;#34;get</li>
            <li>but it leaves you a bit of &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; hair, which isn´t exactly the nicest thing to touch, and hair</li>
            <li>A lot better than using a facial trimer for grooming but was hoping for it</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesistant to purchase the Norelco Bodygroom Pro at first.</li>
            <li>my first try</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Battery back up is quite okay.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>However, as with all of the Norelco Bodygoomers, the foil doesn&#x27;t last more than 8-12 months.  </li>
            <li>Replacement foils are not expensive.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, this thing does not hold charge.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re the type to let your hair grow out on your body, this is pretty neat to use.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Even then the nicks weren&#x27;t enough to draw blood and were more like a carpet</li>
            <li>I never had an issue with the charge the first 10 times</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping to quit using razors, but soon realized that razors are just much better in every way possible, except the price.</li>
            <li>The metal contacts on the plastic dock and the unit don&#x27;t like to stay touching properly all the time!</li>
            <li>Could&#x27;ve been better if battery lasted longer or it was possible to plug it in and use it.</li>
            <li>I hope it works as good as now, in a few months.</li>
            <li>Definitely good to be able to trim down all those neglected long hairs at first though</li>
            <li>and it was effortless and most importantly painless to shave down there.</li>
            <li>Got this because like so many other men here, needed something to clean up on the parts we are all too embarrassed to talk about.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with its performance down there.</li>
            <li>The other side is great for trimming long hairs and is recommended if you&#x27;re very hair and want to go completely smooth - use this side first.</li>
            <li>user must use slower strides and careful on the angle using the fine clippers on either end of the main (top) head of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Very smooth to use in shower or just sitting on the toilet and going at it.  </li>
            <li>I like this product and use it frequently on all but the most very sensitive of areas.</li>
            <li>It can be a bit tricky to get the &#x27;pouch&#x27; perfectly smooth due to the hair growing in different directions, but with practice this becomes more easy.  </li>
            <li>least I have the original, which I am very satisfied with.</li>
            <li>The groomer worked effortlessly and I was very happy with the clean look it left behind.  </li>
            <li>works good wet or dry and can easily be washed off after you&#x27;re done by running it under the</li>
            <li>I use this up and down stairs, it does a fine job, but takes much more time as you must move at a much slower pace in order to elude pinching.</li>
            <li>It took less than an hour to charge fully right out of the box, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Multiple blades make finding the right cut easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as smooth as a babies bottom now which the little lady very much enjoyed.  </li>
            <li>This thing shaved poorly, never held a charge for long enough used it twice before giving up, greatly diminished my opinion for Philips</li>
            <li>But other than that, it works quite nicely.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as epilating, but it&#x27;s comfortable and effective.  </li>
            <li>Other than the shaver foil itself, everything is well built and nice materials.</li>
            <li>I love it because it can be used safely and without help from mom by a teen boy to trim long leg hair if that&#x27;s an issue.</li>
            <li>Nice sharp trim and</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to clean my foil with some rubbing alcohol or something, because I aftershave down their already just to make sure I don&#x27;t get bumps and for some reason</li>
            <li>So far I am very satisfied with product and hope that it will last me for a very long time :-).</li>
            <li>I was able to clean up those pesky single hairs that my normal Braun electric razor could not get.    </li>
            <li>The trimming edges are also SUPER safe on skin - I didn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;nicked&amp;#34; once, unlike other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Great shaver / trimmer, though user might want to be careful not to swing/move it too fast as the shaver unit is not very secure, comes off rather easily.</li>
            <li>Obviously you can&#x27;t go zooming with this thing at mach speeds, but the trimmer end (the flat pivoting head) is really great at simply contorting to your shape, and it smoothly shaves around any object you put in it&#x27;s path without damaging anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the rest of my hair is simply too fine for this to work with, or perhaps I wasn&#x27;t doing something right.  </li>
            <li>but she enjoyed paying special attention down there.</li>
            <li>The tilting head really helps get the taint and ass area baby smooth, in complete comfort.  </li>
            <li>Charge lasts longer then expected and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Have used it for several months and have never been nicked or otherwise harmed, which is an amazing do to the nature of the sensitive parts that must be trimmed.</li>
            <li>Ok, same as the previous models - which I liked.</li>
            <li>Another issue i have noticed is the battery power is not as strong when i bought it, but hey I cannot complain I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years, but i would say it can last for 20mins which is more than enough time for me.</li>
            <li>, my skin is just too sensitive to handle being shaved clean to the surface, I&#x27;ll stick with my beard trimmer to trim deeeeeeeez nutttssssssss.</li>
            <li>It is actually has a quite stylish and modern look to it</li>
            <li>The trimmer on my face shaver is far, far better.    </li>
            <li>I know shaving my face with a blade works better if the hairs have softened, so I took a long, hot bath and lathered myself</li>
            <li>I had the personal groomer before, which was simple and good.</li>
            <li>The foil shaver was pretty good, used to remove a small chest patch I have.</li>
            <li>when.it was at least mostly away and decided to give it one more try.</li>
            <li>Far superior to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I just came back here to read the specs, and laughed when I saw its supposed to last 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good enough for 15-20 minutes of use, but you definitely need to charge between uses.</li>
            <li>a nice cut without cutting the skin...and a good battery life</li>
            <li>I also loved how you don&#x27;t only have to go in one direction because the head pivots which allows you to go back and forth until the forest is</li>
            <li>Everything you need to get the precise trim/shave you are seeking is right there on one little unit, and it is truly easy to use.</li>
            <li>We both enjoy this product and highly recommend it to everyone, males, females, couples and all bipedal species that choose to live a hairless, or &amp;#34;less hairy&amp;#34; lifestyle.</li>
            <li>If you have never groomed \\&quot;below the neck\\&quot; but are considering it, then I highly recommend buying this groomer and getting it done right the first time.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and goes over personal areas very gently.  </li>
            <li>In short, I am very pleased with this product as I was able to shave \\&quot;the below area\\&quot; entirely hairless after my second try with this groomer.</li>
            <li>This is the only body groomer that I have used so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it against, but overall I find it to be pretty good.</li>
            <li>After a few months is cut perfectly, but I guess at least annually or should do little more head change can be achieved very easily here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I prefer the previous model for better results!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t just whilly-nilly jam it into your more sensitive areas, but if you&#x27;re careful, it&#x27;ll do just fine.</li>
            <li>Comes with a small brush to clean off the hair, and it&#x27;s easily detachable to clean with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Specially when your shaving sensitive areas you don&#x27;t want the head to move.</li>
            <li>I used to own the basic version, and in order to cut to a length, you had to clip one of three cheap plastic covers that were hard to take off and broke or got lost easily.</li>
            <li>Whenever I left the teeth on one area for too long, it did pinch me a bit which wasn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li>I needed to shave my neck quickly and this is the first electric shaver I could use on my sensitive neck skin without it tearing it up.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is everything that the positive reviews claim it to be.  </li>
            <li>But I splurged on this product because of all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I ordered this groomer after reading a lot of positive reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then continued to all the positive reviews given to this product</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews I decided to go for this one.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading lots of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable and easy to use for all hair control needs from the eyebrows on down.</li>
            <li>The shaver head will indeed get rid of your hair and make your skin nice and smooth (and WITHOUT any irritation, to boot!), but as stated, it will take quite a few passes before it can remove all the stubble that was left from the trimmer end.</li>
            <li>Fantastic as a general hair groomer.  </li>
            <li>I just use the general grooming side for all my body except I use the foil side to smooth out my arms</li>
            <li>I shopped for a long time looking for a body groomer, and I am extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>How long has this been available!  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works great, but is insanely sharp and it has cut/nicked my manhood on several occasions.</li>
            <li>My other Norelco shaver irritates my neck but this does a great job; no irritation even when used daily.</li>
            <li>Shaving underarms are a lot better with this versus the 2020 by a long shot and the added length from having the electric trimmer &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now and have had some very interesting experiences with it.</li>
            <li>It has clippers on both sides of the foil, so you can pretty much come from any direction and get results.</li>
            <li>The pivot head is just enough flex to get the curves of my chin and face and the trimmer on the other end is great for a stubble week.  </li>
            <li>I found myself using the two side mini-clippers most of the time shaving as close as possible with those, then trying to get a smooth finish with the middle shaver.</li>
            <li>This pretty much makes those issue non-existant.  </li>
            <li>On one end is a regular shaver that is great for just trimming up my body hair, and on the other end is a close shaver/foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the people who rate this lowly because of almost cutting off their balls, I would never suggest using this product to shave your junk; however, as a body shaver it works most excellently.  </li>
            <li>I trust this thing pretty much everywhere.</li>
            <li>Title pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with clippers of this type but they do cut pretty close.</li>
            <li>It dies pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Will be interesting to see how long this one lasts.</li>
            <li>Pretty much a six o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li>so you pretty much always have to keep it on the charger.</li>
            <li>been looking for something like this for a long time, and love the functionality.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ll be able to use this unit for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This does pretty much anything you need except a close shave.</li>
            <li>What can I really say, it&#x27;s a shaver that does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do</li>
            <li>Even in intimate parts you will have good results, but I warn you to be careful and not make it into the wild because it can hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should have listened to others but bought it because it is small and looks really good.</li>
            <li>I tend to believe that if you follow cleaning , maintenance, and charging instructions, that electronics usually hold up fairly well over time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I took the time to write this one because the product is that good.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how good of a job it will be for u men</li>
            <li>Other Norelco products that I have owned over the years have far superior battery life that this &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; body</li>
            <li>I wouldn´t use this in my face, although it could probably do a good job if you´re just trimming small</li>
            <li>I recommend it  for those who like to stay sharp and clean!!</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve only done my torso and arms and it leaves everything pretty smooth and clean looking.</li>
            <li>After working fine for about six months, the second one has now also lost its ability to hold a charge as well, just like the first one.  </li>
            <li>To be honest I don&#x27;t trust this one down by the privates.</li>
            <li>The height adjustable trimmer is a much better solution than the different level blade guards the older model has.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t rush the job it works great, just go slow and steady.</li>
            <li>Decent shaver, bought it primarily to use in the shower, no issues so far.</li>
            <li>I searched the net for a while to find a decent machine but many of the reviews were discouraging and conflicting.</li>
            <li>but if you want a nice electric shaver for your head&lt;br /&gt;and want it down to the skin like a razor this one is the one you want.</li>
            <li>3 months in the large trimmer stopped working and after 6 months the battery needed to be charged pretty much after every use.</li>
            <li>Plain and simple, it&#x27;s the best by far.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t apply any pressure at all near the thinnest, most fold-ey, most vulnberable skin, the shaver should skim a millimeter above such skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I prefer using it dry, which is a breeze to be honest, the fact that it is water proof is only an added advantage and makes it that much easier to clean</li>
            <li>And I very much like the way I can adjust the trimmer with what I think are a lot of settings... more than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>will also note that I have used this as a facial shaver &amp; it works great, but takes a while to shave compared to conventional gel &amp; razor shaving.</li>
            <li>While this razor can cause some slight drying out of the skin it really is amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s meant for below the neck, but you can easily trim above the neck as well.  </li>
            <li>I think it works better dry but works in the shower as well.</li>
            <li>I owned the previous version of this groomer, and of course now own this one as well.  </li>
            <li>, guys if you think this makes it easy to trim your back yourself, think again.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve discovered that it works better dry.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer on zero can cut you if your not careful but it gives you a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Works better dry than it does in the shower.    </li>
            <li>Simple, easy to use.</li>
            <li>only had problem with the US/Europe pluging system; I couldn&#x27;t find a plug adapter easily here...</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the powder over the area you&#x27;re going to shave first, then gently rub it in so the powder covers the whole area evenly.  </li>
            <li>I think one of the cheaper models without the floating head would work better for this, since you could keep the foil level even on dry</li>
            <li>Replacement heads are only $12, and are so easy to replace.</li>
            <li>It protects sensitive areas and cuts super close to the skin.</li>
            <li>Not only is it easy to use, but it&lt;br /&gt;leaves</li>
            <li>it is easy to trim up the entire body.</li>
            <li>Think it works better when hair is dry.    </li>
            <li>Trimmer works better dry</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd different Phillips Norelco BodyGroom and am very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>Not the closest shave, but it does the job of several shavers and you can easily use it in the shower.    </li>
            <li>gel is better than shaving dry.</li>
            <li>those of you that are, this shaver would work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to hold, and operate with 1 hand, and I do like the double ended Shaver/trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>charges easily and seems to last even through longer</li>
            <li>Solid feel and easy to hold and control</li>
            <li>The cutter end flips open for easy cleaning</li>
            <li>also like that it has independent switches for either end, and that the charging stand is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Luckily I hadn&#x27;t tossed my old razor yet and reverted to using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All-in-one device that makes grooming as easy as possible.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly dry before showering as I have found that it works better that way.  </li>
            <li>If I charged it and then let it sit unused it would completely lose the charge quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it both dry and while in the shower, but I can&#x27;t decide which is more effective/comfortable.</li>
            <li>It can be used in the shower or out; however, I find it works better on a dry body.  </li>
            <li>I had tried the Body Bare shaver, but it is only effective as an after-the-shave shaver and managed to nick me.  </li>
            <li>Each end turns on independently, and the built in guide is easy to use and saves the hassle of attachments.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Charge lasts as advertised and the unit feels very solid and is easy to handle the shaving part of this unit is</li>
            <li>I can use it without meeting any type of shaving cream or water it works better on my skin dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;update: 2.5 yrs later, this thing is still going strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beards - This has been a great tool for keeping my beard neat and even without letting myself go full blown scare the women away with my mass of scary face hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;3- Motor/mechanism strong enough: does not snag or hesitate while cutting&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant on using this product on certain area of my body, I know it says it can be used pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li>Fairly large but does hold enough charge for a 3-4 day trip easily.</li>
            <li>battery life seems more than adequate in my limited use so far    </li>
            <li>it really feels like a high quality product and it does the job right</li>
            <li>My navel, chest, pits, shoulders, back, and \\&quot;down south\\&quot; were all shaved in no time and looking great.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have great motor skills, then I personally wouldn&#x27;t attempt to shave down there.    </li>
            <li>Also great for mowing down your unnattended armpits and back and shoulder hair for all those Chewbacca&#x27;s like myself.</li>
            <li>after a few months it turns itself on, running down the battery (best case)</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say how many uses you will get out of a single charge.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how many uses you will get out of a single charge.</li>
            <li>Problem is, it is built at a large scale.</li>
            <li>, it is large and can be quite cumbersome in certain areas.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a large gap in the length range going from no guard to the closest guard setting.  </li>
            <li>nothing worse than trying to balance a piece of buzzing equipment near your features, this works great on all sorts of body hair and is much better than a plain razor, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I would charge it before doing anything large like your head.  </li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer specifically to trip a certain part of my body.</li>
            <li>measurements, it&#x27;s either pure blade or a noticeable gap.</li>
            <li>this means that if i want to use the comb attachments to shave hair to a certain length i don&#x27;t have to hunt for or even change anything on the shaver.</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy this again in a heartbeat</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco Bodygroom BG2040 is fairly large.</li>
            <li>but I could certainly see room for improvement.</li>
            <li>If most of your hair is on your upper back and your shoulders then the BodyGroom is definitely the better product and the right product for you.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I bought this for the adjustable large trimmer not for body shaving.  </li>
            <li>If your trying to do large areas of your body like your chest, legs etc.</li>
            <li>and they sell for about $40-50 used or new (everywhere!!)</li>
            <li>This could be a product that should fit the needs of most men, but there are a few major limitations that prevent it from being worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>with the new one, I do not see this happening as it seems more solid.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the mechanism that holds the foil unit in place gave out and I decided to re-up and get a new one and went with the Pro, thinking it would be better than the original.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The BodyGroom is good but the foil/shaver head does not last a year like they say it does, and it does not hold a charge for very long</li>
            <li>Nice quality, only complaints is that I like to have a longer length setting for the beard trimmer, and the stand is a little easy to tip over.</li>
            <li>I have used it a ton and it works great dry or wet.  </li>
            <li>I tried it both wet and dry, and I got great results for both.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very well built and strong device.</li>
            <li>Made shaving my balls less mutilating and more fun.</li>
            <li>Very usefull, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;-Battery is only 50min</li>
            <li>I have coarse hair and it does a dang good job using it dry style.</li>
            <li>And, of course, the warranty on the first one (after their refusal to extend it for the new replacement) has now (just) expired!  </li>
            <li>First it&#x27;s great but...not last more than two years, A disposable equipment is of poor quality , do not buy!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so most attempts to get rid of body hair has left me with rashes and razor burn.</li>
            <li>It will last 5-15 minutes at full charge, and die - pending a new full charge.</li>
            <li>I will always love that old trimmer but this new upgrade after the old ones death is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now back to the entire body smooth look and have to say with this shaver it is an easy task.</li>
            <li>also used this to \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; my entire head/scalp for the summer, and it worked just fine for that.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a few seconds and would get very hot.</li>
            <li>It even says in the manual not to use it for your face and head, but it works fine enough if you have patients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first use was on my face, and the foil shaver did a decent job, so for those wondering, you can use it on your face.</li>
            <li>just got it yesterday shaved my legs with it and it did a pretty decent job..</li>
            <li>The first is that the unguarded main razor will cut into your flesh and the battery life is now dismal.</li>
            <li>Very high quality device</li>
            <li>Very high quality blade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very high quality, cuts chest hair, groin hair, thigh hair</li>
            <li>For those of us who like to keep our bodies as well as our faces groomed, I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality and precision product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more success with disposable single blade razors for sensitive skin that I bought from CVS.</li>
            <li>While this might happen in some instances, the foil itself is actually responsible for the large majority of injuries I have sustained.  </li>
            <li>and it works really well on large expanses that I keep hairless.</li>
            <li>Beard trimmer half is great for toning down those hairy legs without full shaving.</li>
            <li>Also despite the nice aesthetics and good overall quality, some of the plastic parts, especially the plastic trimmer blade guard look and feel kind of cheap, and I am always a little worried I might brake it, rendering the trimmer pretty useless.  </li>
            <li>I did get experience a little nick, but that was my own fault.</li>
            <li>However, I normally use a Wahl Hero T Blade, or Andis T-Outliner trimmer if I&#x27;m not shaving clean, so it&#x27;s kind of hard to compare to those.</li>
            <li>Its best to let your skin soak in warm water in order for the hair folicles to relax, however its easier shaving the sack when its cold, which causes the skin to pull tight.</li>
            <li>As an avid manscaper, I highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>The second time I used it did not leave any cuts just pure smooth baby</li>
            <li>I think I nicked myself once while shaving the pubes, but it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt much and within a minute I corrected myself and haven&#x27;t nicked much since.</li>
            <li>Very nice it can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Worth paying a little more for the quality.</li>
            <li>charging stand works well for the 1 hour it takes to charge it, and it folds away flat for easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>An elegant finishing, a little bit heavy, good price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you really want that clean clean shave, you nust use a razor but other than that, To me it worked.</li>
            <li>But even on the shortest setting I noticed it didn&#x27;t really cut evenly and I had to go back and forth several times for the easiest of trimming on some arm hair which is very fine and light and easy to cut typically with my hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>(give me the old James Bond not the new clean</li>
            <li>What used to take me a half an hour now takes 10 minutes with a smooth, clean finish.</li>
            <li>Then I started venturing around more and more, gaining more confidence in this bad boy with each swipe.  </li>
            <li>It is plastic and it should be removed carefully and more gently.</li>
            <li>Myself, I like a clean, smooth feel (perhaps I was a Roman in a previous lifetime) and have relied on my razor for decades.  </li>
            <li>Another huge plus is the utter lack of attachments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using hair clippers (more powerful and not reliant on a dead battery) for tougher jobs or when I let my body/face hair grow out.</li>
            <li>Does a much better job that expected</li>
            <li>It does what it is designed to do really well---when the battery is charged.  </li>
            <li>This version has a very s***ty battery that takes forever to charge and discharges within a couple minutes of use.</li>
            <li>It did the job well and gave me a very close shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1.re-grown hairs around groin area are very troublesome to re cut</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind it too much.  </li>
            <li>i have so much  heir in my body</li>
            <li>I really do.</li>
            <li>What it is, though, is very flexible.</li>
            <li>This is a very nimble device.</li>
            <li>Running my hand across the shaved area in the SAME direction of which the hair grows feels and looks smooth.</li>
            <li>and I had nippleitis (HAHA).</li>
            <li>I told my wife I do this as much for me as it is for you.  </li>
            <li>Works really well, shaves very close.</li>
            <li>It really works on all areas.</li>
            <li>It shaves very close &amp; the battery lasts alot longer before you have to charge it up again...  </li>
            <li>Very well made &amp;</li>
            <li>After much research, i decided to purchase the bodygroomer for my boyfriend for xmas.</li>
            <li>I really like about this model</li>
            <li>Replacement blades are only needed once a year and are cheap here on Amazon (under $12).</li>
            <li>The shave isn&#x27;t as close as I expected, but I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>This worked very well on my bikini line as well, and the waterproof casing allowed me to take it into the shower.    </li>
            <li>I REALLY like about this product,</li>
            <li>Its very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like the fact that you can use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I would highly suggest using this body trimmer!</li>
            <li>So far, well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>real problem here is the shaver side.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it that much, maybe once or twice a month.  </li>
            <li>this works very well for trimming body hair in your arm bits and nether regions.</li>
            <li>This item feels like it is built very well.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband for Christmas... being a woman, I really don&#x27;t know about body groomers</li>
            <li>The 2040 feels solid and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go really close to your skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I would pay that much again.  </li>
            <li>Real close shave and grooms your body realllllly well.</li>
            <li>i have so much body hair</li>
            <li>why     it dose cut a very close shave i do have to say that the 1st time i used this trimer</li>
            <li>i was going to fast</li>
            <li>but i found out if you take your time this will give you a really close shave</li>
            <li>Once I was ready to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; the Philips actually did a really nice job (chest, stomach, the boys, butt, and back).  </li>
            <li>There were no snags, the shaved area felt smooth &amp; there was no irritation later.  </li>
            <li>I really like this electric razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It shaves very well with no scars or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and without any blood associated with straight razors.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m not one of those guys that likes to have baby-smooth skin on my whole body, and this shaver won&#x27;t do that for you.</li>
            <li>You need to really work through your skin with this one.  </li>
            <li>I shave my whole body with this shaver.</li>
            <li>yes, every where else not so much.</li>
            <li>This thing is always leaving patches of hair as well as it pulls the living daylights out of my legs, not so much the arms.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>think if they did not add the integrated pre-trimmers located on both sides of the shaving head it will be much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for trimming body hair it works really well and gets a very close shave with no irritation</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, the razor shaves really close.</li>
            <li>Very simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>of course that all depends on how much it costs!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really nervous to try and use an electric razor around my manhood and backside, but it worked fantastically.  </li>
            <li>I really like the style and the charger</li>
            <li>This is a very well designed groomer that does the job without the pain, discomfort or anxiety of wondering if it will \\&quot;bite\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This thing really does it.  </li>
            <li>The comb and guard edge (settings for desired length) are very well amde</li>
            <li>I use it to trim my man regions and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Until now, I didn&#x27;t really consider myself a hairy guy.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you are using the center of the foil shaver to trim the hair.</li>
            <li>This thing really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very simple to use, virtually maintenance free, and does what is advertised.</li>
            <li>thanks philips for this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this thing for a while and never had as much as a pinch.  </li>
            <li>i have very course body hair and doubted it get the job done.</li>
            <li>Did the job much</li>
            <li>It was so gentle on all body parts calling it</li>
            <li>None really for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a whole lot that I can write that others haven&#x27;t already said.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t make much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>but with thisand the mangroomer &#x3D; I really don&#x27;t need anyone to do any shaving for me now.  </li>
            <li>Like the description says this really is an \\&quot;all in one grooming</li>
            <li>from all i could find out before i purchased this i expected better.</li>
            <li>MUCH BETTER than I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For $50 here on Amazon with free shipping, it was cheaper than my local store.  </li>
            <li>The comb attachment at the end is really nifty -- it slides for length adjustment, or you can just take it off for closer mowing.</li>
            <li>Making short, smooth movements helped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;5/5, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Make sure to replace blades roughly every six months</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I was very cautious around \\&quot;the</li>
            <li>but it just really worked well in taming my jungle.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>REALLY, REALLY works well.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t let the Forest overrun the Tree to much</li>
            <li>or it really gets difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but still I was very iffy on trying it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut very close either.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works very well but needs a closer setting.</li>
            <li>ER also used to cut hair on head and pubic area, works very well for both.</li>
            <li>absolutely painless and no pulling of hair.</li>
            <li>Works very well in all areas, except face, which it&#x27;s not meant to be used for anyway.  </li>
            <li>This item works really well--until it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to give this 4.5 stars.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this Norelco to anyone who has some manscaping to do!</li>
            <li>But after that, you are ready to go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effortless.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it really can be used all over and not just on the body.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to get into too much detail on this one.</li>
            <li>Some months, I really let myself go.</li>
            <li>She uses it for the same reason I did; to trim the lower region and this one will not pinch or cut and shaves smoothly.</li>
            <li>For areas that I wanted to be smooth, this left a lot of stubble.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made and intuitively designed.</li>
            <li>The shaver/trimmer end works very well</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much of a bump to get that piece to pop out either.  </li>
            <li>or the whole thing will fall over.</li>
            <li>Works really well and gets the hair.</li>
            <li>This product performs very well.</li>
            <li>And the whole body means the mustache</li>
            <li>But who wants to?</li>
            <li>Really exellent product.it is used for both shave and trimming.while shave</li>
            <li>For the money I expected much better quality.</li>
            <li>That part really does not bother me at the slightest, any shaver you buy you need to replace the blades on it after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They say you&#x27;re supposed to stretch your skin straight but the pivoting head makes it so you don&#x27;t really have to focus on getting everything straight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this product isn&#x27;t really something I&#x27;d recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If this product worked very well, I would really appreciate its design and ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to find one that worked well.</li>
            <li>Really does the job.</li>
            <li>not work very well on the face&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cut is much closer and no pain at all.</li>
            <li>shaving end cuts very close</li>
            <li>The only thing I am not getting is the light to come on....</li>
            <li>Really wanted 2 dedicated devices that specialize in each.</li>
            <li>I was happier with that result but on that I expected a bit more a well.</li>
            <li>The product is safe to use if you are slightly careful.</li>
            <li>In addition to getting $10 credit with Phillips Norelco after registering the product warranty, it works very well.</li>
            <li>Husband uses to manscape which really prevents skin irritation since he&#x27;s a runner.  </li>
            <li>Closest thing to a real shave.</li>
            <li>this is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I am not talking about thirty straight minutes without turning it off.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for returning with no problems.</li>
            <li>The shaving head can both pivot and telescope; Thus it can follow the body curvature very well.    </li>
            <li>Everything works very well.</li>
            <li>Has worked really well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This product performs very well.</li>
            <li>There really are few things better than a freshly shaved nether region.</li>
            <li>This has made the process much easier.</li>
            <li>I like to write my product reviews after I&#x27;ve owned a product for a while since in the modern era, things don&#x27;t seem to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it has very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is built very well</li>
            <li>Thanks to Philips.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say about this product.</li>
            <li>i really dont like buying shavers with like twelve attachments...</li>
            <li>it works really well....</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, thanks amazon.&lt;br /&gt;2nd</li>
            <li>The battery really does not hold the charge well.</li>
            <li>Combine all those designed flaws, and you get a unit that can tip over very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t really like the shaver as it doesn&#x27;t seem to work well on my hair compared to the trimmer.</li>
            <li>When I am buying an electric RAZOR that I plan to use very close to my nether regions</li>
            <li>This gadget does everything, trims and shaves all body parts, very well.  </li>
            <li>The purpose for this groomer is to care for intimate areas.  </li>
            <li>The rotating head on the shaver is a very much appreciated comfort item and also increases the effectiveness of the shaver.  </li>
            <li>I really like this and plan to get one for my son for Christmas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very close shaving razor</li>
            <li>Has lasted me years and trims very well.</li>
            <li>Fast forward one day; shaver fully charged.</li>
            <li>In fact, it worked so well, so fast, I couldn&#x27;t stop myself.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY DOES.</li>
            <li>But really, EVERY MAN NEEDS THIS, PERIOD.</li>
            <li>What I like about this product is now I can trim the groin and underarm areas without any nicks or cuts very closely.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference between the two styles.</li>
            <li>So let me get this straight</li>
            <li>And it wasn&#x27;t too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really encourage you to think about what you want from this product before buying it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>It also works very well on the privates, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>Works very well in the shower.  </li>
            <li>but it works very well and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Using this outside of the shower is not as smooth.</li>
            <li>- this really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>trimmer has been used twice and works really well.  </li>
            <li>and I can confirm the comments about not being capable of a close shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>High-quality very versatile</li>
            <li>I tried the trimmer part, but it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I really understand how to use the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it multi-functionality.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to get a close enough shave that feels smooth, this works.</li>
            <li>can sometimes nick, charges fast and the charge lasts a while</li>
            <li>It gives a very close cut and does the job</li>
            <li>I never realized that a smooth shave on the body in any area was possible with an electric razor, but with this one, it is.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li>Better than i expected.</li>
            <li>While you do need to take your time with this groomer around sensitive regions, it is forgiving and rarely hurts</li>
            <li>This is not for shaving facial hair but is instead a body groomer primarily designed for men.</li>
            <li>very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>If you body groom very often this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li>much resistance so am reluctant to pull to the extent of breaking the unit.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it was just too much work to try and maintain.</li>
            <li>much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>The results for the shaver may be better under wet conditions</li>
            <li>Both the trimmer and foil shaver open easily (including the removable guard) and only take about a minute to clean.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really seem to &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; that well into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really sodas pointed when I got it.</li>
            <li>All I can say is just really take time.</li>
            <li>Yes I bought this about 3.5 years ago, so I can&#x27;t complain much,</li>
            <li>and the comb is much smoother, that is, it doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin as I use it.</li>
            <li>Very strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and there i don&#x27;t mind so much.   </li>
            <li>I was very leary about buying an electric shaver for the downunda&#x27;s if you get my drift.</li>
            <li>I am a very hairy guy, so I put it to the test.  </li>
            <li>You can get really close with this and can skip the shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the adjustable groomer part</li>
            <li>Really durable and also doesn&#x27;t pull like cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>Before this I had bought two cheap trimmers that have different heads for nose, etc.</li>
            <li>It is safe, but it still gets the skin folds if they are too folded, no bleeding yet, but be careful.</li>
            <li>It is very sleek</li>
            <li>Works really well, thanks</li>
            <li>I think you, Philips, and my manscaping-insistent girlfriend thanks you</li>
            <li>razor holds a charge very well, too, though I tend to just keep it on the stand.</li>
            <li>This really feels like a quality product.</li>
            <li>I would have purchased it much sooner.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy in your hand as well.</li>
            <li>Charges fast.  </li>
            <li>it clearly works as stated on the advertisement and its worth a piece one should have.</li>
            <li>As a whole product, very well put together and got it in time.</li>
            <li>It works very well, still have not had to recharge, and no nicks or cuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This model really works at mowing though unwanted hair.  </li>
            <li>tap.&lt;br /&gt;The top is for grooming everything else, and the heads pivot to make it follow your body contours, just be careful when manscaping as the &amp;#34;pre-trimmers&amp;#34; can nick the dangly bits and make you bleed.</li>
            <li>You really have to watch how you hold</li>
            <li>works very well, very versatile.  </li>
            <li>It worked really will.</li>
            <li>This one feels much sturdier and still works well after being dropped a couple times.</li>
            <li>I am what you can consider a really hairy man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have used cheap trimmers and electric shavers before, but I would always have to go over the same spots over and over again.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to use</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>It does not give the very closest shave, however.</li>
            <li>Would much prefer a straight plug in the bottom.</li>
            <li>The Norelco gives me the same results I got when I used a razor, a smooth shave all around and no pain.</li>
            <li>Then it gives a not so gentle tug on your follicles</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very intimidating to use anything electric on your genitalia...</li>
            <li>I would just reccomend to anybody purchasing this item to check the charge before throwing away the packaging as you very well may have to return, which I no longer have the luxury of doing.</li>
            <li>I prefer very close shaves and this doesn&#x27;t get me there.  </li>
            <li>Works very well...</li>
            <li>I thought a lot about the change between the different options currently available of the bodygroom.</li>
            <li>, it trims very well because of its 3-D shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product is very noisy and vibrates a lot.</li>
            <li>I belive the shaver is intened for men who feel they have too much body hair.</li>
            <li>It would probally work very well for that purpose.</li>
            <li>They have improved on this model so much.</li>
            <li>It does all of this very well.  </li>
            <li>and it is ready to use again.</li>
            <li>All I&#x27;m saying is, be gentle...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have purchased a corded trimmer, this one gave me more skin irritation than I expected.</li>
            <li>Really &amp;</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t notice anything unusual while you&#x27;re using it, but</li>
            <li>the quality of the product is certainly better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Buy this if you really need it.</li>
            <li>I used it straight out of the box after about an hour charge.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle even when using it without the length</li>
            <li>This thing is a beast, but a gentle one.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is to be used on the whole body below the neck!&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>** niggah\\&quot; hahahaha.</li>
            <li>He likes it, and it shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the head does not pivot as much as i would like it to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the Norelco BG2040 Bodygroom</li>
            <li>shaver works well and replacement blades are reasonable.</li>
            <li>if you are gentle you can replace them, but they are not meant to be replaced</li>
            <li>This product is better than expected.  </li>
            <li>A couple things really stood out to me.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to have this with the shaver</li>
            <li>It works very well on all areas including the face.</li>
            <li>Even on the lowest/shortest setting on the clippers I never snag my skin and can work so much faster without that worry.  </li>
            <li>Very well engineered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;...let&#x27;s just say it works best when the bathroom is cold.</li>
            <li>Unless of course you consider 12 dollars per shave reasonable.  </li>
            <li>It really yanks on hairs...</li>
            <li>You would really have to be trying to cut yourself with this groomer</li>
            <li>It was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>Close shave with the foil and the trimmer really does the job and has a variety of length adjustments.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>The shaver now - I think it works fantastically with cream, not so much.</li>
            <li>Prior iterations of the BodyGroom had a detachable head that you could swap out for clipping versus shaving/trimming, and detachable combs to fit onto the clipper to control the length of clipping.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really prep my pubic area or the razor</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still running like the day I bought it, which is much appreciated.</li>
            <li>For this to work without injury you must pull your bag very taunt.  </li>
            <li>and you just lie back and enjoy.</li>
            <li>It is really convenient to use on your body.</li>
            <li>Would not pay this much for this product again.  </li>
            <li>Using it for really anything caused tug and pull on the hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the razor.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t stand that...</li>
            <li>and my skin got really irritated)</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>i was very suprised when i used this.</li>
            <li>Having said that, it gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Try it, I really don&#x27;t think you will regret it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as often as I could, but it&#x27;s always charged and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>It takes a whole night charge the thing.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really know.  </li>
            <li>And they are not ingrown hairs either, they are just straight up pimples.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the smooth finish, she&#x27;s the final judge.</li>
            <li>It shaves almost the whole hair.</li>
            <li>Makes it so much cleaner and easier</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to fix an off haircut, shave if i run out of razors, trim, erase, etc, and don&#x27;t have to worry about getting anything wet and having it malfunction</li>
            <li>It will up the intimate regions with ease.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to stay well groomed and ready to go.</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t regret it, i was a amazed on how fast it arrived</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t make much noise.</li>
            <li>; side has a pivoting head which is really helpful since the head follows your body so you won´t need to go inch by inch</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed it is much easier to nick yourself in the shower than while dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, and very well.</li>
            <li>Trims very well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Mind you, I have really hair legs</li>
            <li>No razor burn and better cut than expected.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you just want to dedicate extra time and get a detailed shave.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t grow in as fast.</li>
            <li>Neither look was really working for me.  </li>
            <li>really pulls hair when you shave</li>
            <li>Works well and holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Men should be gentle around the &amp;#34;coin purse&amp;#34; if you use it without the detachable guard.</li>
            <li>The the trimmer side does work really well as an eyebrow trimmer.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>This shaver is gentle and does not leave nicks and cuts, but neither does it shave really close.  </li>
            <li>The trimming end has a built in height adjustment that works very well.  </li>
            <li>That was really scaring me until I read the #1 review for this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;1-I have not been able to read anywhere online about this, but the 5 setting trimmer end, the head actually comes off completely which</li>
            <li>After my old trimmer finally died after many years of use, my search began for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>The product is safe to use on sensitive area such as the groin and testicle region.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will say though that the mini-clippers gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, but it also took me more than 2x as long to shave (when compared with using normal hair clippers).</li>
            <li>Does alright for trimming, but for actual shaving, my 5 year old electric shaver does a much better job with</li>
            <li>The top of the unit doesn&#x27;t pick up hair very well and doesn&#x27;t provide anything remotely resembling a close shave.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t nearly do the job that a blade does but decent if you want a quick shave out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It might not be enough juice for a full body grooming for some of you, so be aware of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me recreate for you what happened most of the time I used the shaver, when I wasn&#x27;t busy getting a giant cut</li>
            <li>This is far better and easier than using a regular shaver.</li>
            <li>While the shaver dual head design and charger is nice, the battery life dwindles after a few months.</li>
            <li>Meaning you can not fix the dead batteries on your own.</li>
            <li>It drew blood (both sides of the tool) on multiple occasions from my most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite impressive at giving you a very close trim (without the guard) in the pubic region without cutting.  </li>
            <li>The shaving end is simple and I did not get any pulling or burns - even in the most sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>Good battery life as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after using it like a year... Battery is NEAR to Dead.</li>
            <li>This is however a very good substitute for those of us who are a little bit too scared of the pain that comes with waxing and all the other work you need to do to prepare and finish a wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So when you have the quick touch up before special times you won&#x27;t be sure it will have enough charge and of course if you rush you will arrive with a few wounds.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the comb part doesn&#x27;t seem to lift the hairs that need to be trimmed very well, which means that it takes a very long time to get a nice consistent cut.  </li>
            <li>It worked great up until week 3, where the foil that guards the shaving end developed a small hole which grew larger quickly, leading in cuts.</li>
            <li>It will bring you right back to the days when smooth was natural...</li>
            <li>(I mean most important point is what style(s) do you need ?</li>
            <li>I can say is, Wow!!!  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to shave super close to my...more personal areas, but I had no issues at all.</li>
            <li>i mean really good.</li>
            <li>The charging is cord-free, and the battery has yet to give me any troubles in terms of holding its charge or running out before I was done, and it typically takes a good half an hour or more to complete one</li>
            <li>Nice design, holds a charge really well, does seem to do a decent enough job of facial hair</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and google &#x27;Philips Norelco BG2040 ifixit&#x27; to see the type of maintenance you will have to perform or be willing to buy a new one every six months</li>
            <li>--it feels a little flimsy but is quick, easy and stable.  </li>
            <li>I wish it captured the shaver more securely but it is more than adeqate with a cord length long enough to string across my double sink and mount it opposite side of my plug.    </li>
            <li>I like a stubbled look and this cuts down to almost clean shaven (yet not fully clean shaven for those of you hoping for that)</li>
            <li>the charging cradle, though it looks nice, is not well balanced, only holds the trimmer when on a flat surface and cannot be mounted on a wall.  </li>
            <li>Also, it really doesn&#x27;t do anything any better than any other shaver.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a high performance, durable material and easy to use this product will work for you, the price its a little bit higher but the shaver really worth it .</li>
            <li>Even though I never re-charged until the red light came on, and did a complete discharge/recharge from time-to-time, after a couple of years, my first unit would require as much as 5-6 hours of charging time to yield maybe 10 minutes of usage.  </li>
            <li>The fact of the matter is that we&#x27;re all unique, and the skin and the grain of the hair growth (in odd directions) on my face and neck simply doesn&#x27;t seem to be suitable for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I had the lower model, but the battery wore out really quickly and it got jammed with hair quickly.</li>
            <li>This tool works fine, but it takea a long time to charge and then discharges fast.  </li>
            <li>I mostly used it to trim my thick leg hairs without them looking stubbly or clean</li>
            <li>The charge seems fine as long as you&#x27;re not trying to do your whole body at once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for over a year, its been decent for trimming, but definitely does not give a smooth feel at all for those who are hairy.</li>
            <li>main problem with it though, is that I don´t think it shaves smooth enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also had it pull more on that end than other shavers.  </li>
            <li>that he actually got excited</li>
            <li>I think the other reviewers have said most of what I&#x27;d planned to say, so I&#x27;ll try to add comments that fill in some of the gaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But back to the original...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve nicked part of my body with a host of other products.     </li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s because of the other side - the top.    </li>
            <li>i like the design of this better than other electric shaving machines.</li>
            <li>The 1 seemed to trim more like a 2 compared to other trimmers.</li>
            <li>This is better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s longer than other units.</li>
            <li>Went to use it today and it would not work for more than 10 seconds due to no battery charge.</li>
            <li>After using 2x of the original BodyGrooms 2020 models *which in my opinion are junk overall</li>
            <li>I love having the convenience of the groomer on the other end.</li>
            <li>Pretty soon, after you go slowly the first few times, you&#x27;ll get more confident and get an even closer shave!</li>
            <li>As many other reviews have said it does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>i think the guard needs more settings amongst other things..</li>
            <li>Like every other guy that&#x27;s sure to be reading this review, I was looking for easier ways to keep.... things... cleaned up.</li>
            <li>other end is ok to shorten hair</li>
            <li>Just as many other reviewers state, you can shave EVERYTHING with this groomer.  </li>
            <li>It gives a close shave better than some other razors that I have tried.</li>
            <li>This model does however work while in the shower if needed which is a plus over most other models.</li>
            <li>I guess, their original advertisement indicates its for body only.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy this razor again, but not before looking around at my other options for something better.</li>
            <li>I have also used it on other areas of the body to trim hair and it works just as well, usually better.</li>
            <li>The shaving part is sharp and safe.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Highly accessible to all your private parts, making life simpler..!!!</li>
            <li>br /&gt;i&#x27;ve had other groomers this in the top 2 i&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li>I shave my torso with this, and so far it is good battery last long</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough for me, but please don&#x27;t expect perfectly smooth skin if you have typical \\&quot;man hair\\&quot; in various \\&quot;man places\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave is VERY close to the skin and leaves it super smooth; my bf&#x27;s facial hair took a couple days to grow back to his shadow.</li>
            <li>When Purchasing this product I read the reviews and the guy who gave the indepth, detailed, book long body imprint of personal male grooming, gay display of how it feels to utilize this product., and ordered it for my huisband, and what was said was 100% true in terms of product ability.</li>
            <li>I use the trimmer to taper down all my hairy body parts to a respectable length and the shaver part to keep my back baby smooth and pre-adolescent.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because when I groom down below with a normal razor, I get ingrown hairs and razor burn very easily.  </li>
            <li>It is very good for sensitive areas, I used bad products as well, so I can easily compare.</li>
            <li>It shaves cleanly, trims nicely, and it takes a sharp razor blade out of your hand and away from anything that should really never be touched by an edged blade.</li>
            <li>i researched very carefully all the groomers and this one was supposed to be one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>You have to be very careful and make sure you have the angle</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, now pumped full of rage, endorphins, adrenaline, and an overall contempt for having to do this in the first place, I&#x27;m now ready for my wild night with the woman!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy that I went ahead and purchased this trimmer and in the next few years, if it lasts that long, I would buy it again!</li>
            <li>But for down under it is the best I have used, and ample for body contours that are hard to shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often go for the clean shave, just a short length.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this for 7 months now and the battery barely lasts more than 20 minutes now.</li>
            <li>I am going to clean it well to remove my pubes and take it by the local battery joe to see what they can do.  </li>
            <li>You can choose to either simply brush everything clean with the included brush, or you can do a combination of brushing and rinsing under the faucet.</li>
            <li>You can choose to either simply brush everything clean with the included brush, or you can do a combination of brushing and rinsing under the faucet.</li>
            <li>you must pass over the same spot a lot to get a clean shave, but doesn&#x27;t everything.  </li>
            <li>$29.99 retail for the older BG2020 was a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>(at this point let me re-iterate, makesure you clean yourself properly).  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a guy, keeping your private areas clean is a must.</li>
            <li>Both sides are useful and necessary ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a simple body hair trimmer, and use a safety razor when I want a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I trimmed the hair on my chest and arms which is not a lot, but enough that I like to keep things clean.  </li>
            <li>so I still have to use a razor blade to clean edges up, but it handles the rest of my facial hair.  </li>
            <li>, this has eliminated the need to groom outside of the shower, and thus, the need to clean up.</li>
            <li>you dont mind going over the same spot 5-10 times to get that clean shave, by all means get it.</li>
            <li>also haven&#x27;t managed to remove the foil end to clean it properly.</li>
            <li>I had the same experience as others here, I&#x27;ve used past models, they shaved great but the blade kept falling off.</li>
            <li>The price of the second one was worth it because I like this groomer THAT much!</li>
            <li>u can take it the shower with u and do all ur grooming and clean it at the same time</li>
            <li>While I do not use it in the shower, the ability to run water over it to clean is terrific.</li>
            <li>you want a clean shave, this shaver doesn&#x27;t work as well as a traditional razor like mach 3 with foam...</li>
            <li>Really did come out smooth and didn&#x27;t take long at all.  </li>
            <li>The only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; part about it is that it&#x27;s a hassle to clean...</li>
            <li>but of course when getting down around more sensitive areas it&#x27;s wise to use a little more caution and pull the skin tight a bit just in case.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an unusual feeling to have no hair down there, and I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works good on the down low area</li>
            <li>Going up my legs was so easy, one single pass from foot to knee where it took three or four strokes</li>
            <li>i figured it would be like all the other razors... its seriously the best ive ever used... not cuts and no burns</li>
            <li>The most important lesson I learned is to really take it slow on the sensitive parts.</li>
            <li>I guess for the price I expected it to be perfect for me and have a stronger motor, sharper cutting action and assumed (I know I should never assume) more length setting options.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend it to anyone looking for an all-around groomer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that this machine will be very gentle and as efficient with sensitive body parts.</li>
            <li>really like, shaved fine, non-irritating after shaving, the only thing to remember is to not disturb while shaving is that it fully charged, because when you need load it hurts and sometimes it hurts, but it does what it offers.</li>
            <li>these days.&lt;br /&gt;The battery last a long time between charges, it&#x27;s water proof and super easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li>This is because it only took 5 minutes on the phone with Philips Norelco to get a new one shipped via Fed Ex for free.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s not the case for most due to the number of high reviews</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sleek looking, more so than the previous models.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it isn&#x27;t super fast.  </li>
            <li>trimming end works well enough, but also gets clogged easily requiring frequent brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easier to handle than its predecessor and does a good job of cutting, However, watch the placement of the teeth sides, they will cut skin easily.</li>
            <li>No fuss, no complicated things to set up or super long manual to read/memorize.</li>
            <li>I enjoy being thorough in product reviews so that others can reap the benefits and know what they are in for when it comes right down to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Holds a charge for a very long time, I can go on vacation for a week and be fine on battery when I return.</li>
            <li>After using it a while you will know where the problem spots are and take a little more time in certain area than others.  </li>
            <li>No more living by the seat of your pants trimming your kiwis, as the original Bodygroom advertising detailed.</li>
            <li>it takes a long time to get smooth skin on abdomen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the battery life for this one yet as I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I was able to do a full trim (15-20 min) basically straight out of the box even though the manual said to charge it for 10 hours first.     </li>
            <li>Hair grows way too fast for me to want to use a razor that frequently around my genitalia, and if you use this shaver every day then it will be smooth enough.</li>
            <li>night--this is true--I woke up to this strange buzzing sound.</li>
            <li>It cuts the long hairs off, then shaves smooth.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well it cut and trimmed with almost no irritation even on the first use.</li>
            <li>This requires me to strategize and divide my trimming sessions across the week, as it&#x27;s barely possible to trim my beard on one charge - let alone my full body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With my first use, I didn&#x27;t get one nick, pull or bite in any of the highly sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and everything I have used to shave below the neck has just caused irritation .  </li>
            <li>It is also pretty loud.</li>
            <li>At first was leery about sensitive areas but after using it there is no concern.</li>
            <li>I have used this several times and it holds true to the claim.</li>
            <li>The body bare shaver is worth having though.  </li>
            <li>Two complaints - full metal body is heavier than necessary for airline travel.</li>
            <li>I frequently had to replace them resulting in much higher cost over time.  </li>
            <li>The longest charge this razor has held was 15 minutes prior to needing a full recharge.</li>
            <li>When you initially purchase it, you&#x27;re supposed to let the groomer charge for a full hour before using it.  </li>
            <li>I have to give it a 5 because the product is GREAT and the cost is more reasonable than the other expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I just charged it yesterday for the first time, as it says to let the battery die completely before charging.</li>
            <li>So far, I have only used it twice, I find that a wet safety razor does a superior job.  </li>
            <li>As long as the clippers were kept at a normal angle there were no nicks or rubs at all even against the most sensitive skin areas.  </li>
            <li>Its light, doesn&#x27;t have a ton of attachments to loose and modern.  </li>
            <li>The best way to groom your junk is do not pull the skin tight and go slow.  </li>
            <li>No real issues after the first use, and following the instructions made things pretty straightforward!&lt;br /&gt;The blades on the shaver especially are oh-so safe, and although it does take a pass or two at the right angle, the damn thing does its job really, really well.</li>
            <li>I came back to Amazon to order a replacement and see what other models might be available, but I would have been fine ordering this model again</li>
            <li>item is as described, it&#x27;s quality made, so far it&#x27;s holding fine and looks like it will last for some time.</li>
            <li>pull ur hair :) its will shut down</li>
            <li>but it SAFELY takes the hair all the way down to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this groomer because I wanted a better alternative to a razor for shaving down there.</li>
            <li>You can use the bottom to shave down longer hair and use the top to finish it off.</li>
            <li>is hands down a lot more</li>
            <li>Works better then any other I have bought!</li>
            <li>Having first hand experience with customer service, I am very confident that if anything goes wrong Philips will make it right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also too large and unwieldy to use between the cheeks, another area where the simple razor blade wins again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a little trouble getting a clean shave on my first try, so make sure to give it some time!</li>
            <li>he says he likes it ok, but sometimes it pulls the hair a little too much</li>
            <li>Always register your new items!</li>
            <li>I have used it now for 3 years and it still delivers as new!</li>
            <li>THE NEW LOOK ALSO!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain, gave a quick once over dry, shaved it pretty close, still would recommend using a manual blade for that ultra-close shave, but only after using this and only if needed :)</li>
            <li>: get the speed cream next time, which looks similar and probably is the Nair I had originally had success with.  </li>
            <li>but if you use this shaver daily or every other day even, you&#x27;ll be happy with the smoothness it achieves especially considering the alternative</li>
            <li>They are sharp blades and for obvious reasons accidents can happen but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Not much pulling and easily maneuverable.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the road periodically, so being able to pack less is always welcomed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the road periodically, so being able to pack less is always welcomed.  </li>
            <li>Works so much better than my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li>There is a slight learning curve to the shaver side like many say</li>
            <li>This will create a smooth, dry shaving surface so the blades can cut close but will lessen the risk of nicking the skin.  </li>
            <li>My previous Phillips manscaper (I have had it for 6 yrs now) was much more maneuverable.</li>
            <li>....far better than the previous model which the blade kept falling out of it</li>
            <li>Which is why the top half of my thighs are also hairless now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to grip and use even when wet.</li>
            <li>All I am saying, is that I could easily see someone unintentionally damaging foil head because the directions are not very clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy to use, Wet and dry, smooth touch</li>
            <li>the shaving head goes more or less unused.</li>
            <li>It was part of a morning ritual, along with John Gambling on WOR and the percolator&#x27;s steady steam.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an 18 year old female who was looking for something to get me smooth and hairless without the irritation.</li>
            <li>If quickly remove it from the charger and put it back</li>
            <li>Works quite well, does not cut your balls and gives a decent shave.</li>
            <li>The instructions state to fully charge before first use, so I charged it for about 6 to 8 hours the first day, then unplugged it before bed and plugged it up the next morning before college.  </li>
            <li>The foil shaver aspect is decent.</li>
            <li>I have coarse hair and sensitive skin, but it gave me a smooth shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li>I went to charge it back up, and sure enough, it doesn&#x27;t charge...at all.</li>
            <li>but the head kept popping off while shaving and felt cheap, which is the last thing you want to feel when putting a razor to sensitive parts.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smoother side of the Bodygroom allowed me to take care of my underarms and private areas quickly and painlessly...</li>
            <li>It was a decent shaver for a couple years, but crapped out soon after.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this groomer, just make sure to follow the \\&quot;obvious</li>
            <li>Bought to replace an older version.  </li>
            <li>I even used it for a quick facial shave (It was an emergency) and the results weren&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am actually quite surprised I use and enjoy using this groomer as often as I do.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m moderately furry, and trim everywhere except my back (which is mostly hairless)</li>
            <li>The shaver just wasn&#x27;t able to get close enough to trim these hairs as short as I neeed.</li>
            <li>I used it on several highly sensitive areas and received smooth skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li>ask for advice for your particular situation    </li>
            <li>the shaving, it takes multiple passes with the long-hair trimmer to get the hair actually cut shorter, and after that it takes even more passes with the close shaver all for an end result of stubble.</li>
            <li>After looking up reviews online this particular model received the highest praise for that area</li>
            <li>It nicked the sack once already, my older bodygroomer never once did so.</li>
            <li>My older $20 Remington still work after 5 years and the battery stays charged.  </li>
            <li>For me, the 2020 does everything I need, and does it better than it&#x27;s more expensive cousin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>I decided to opt for the more expensive option hoping it will do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>mainly use the trimming head to shorten my body hair.</li>
            <li>The shave is much smoother than the old model and it handles very well.</li>
            <li>Decent design.  </li>
            <li>any sensitive part should be taken care of gently no matter how smooth the product is cause its not cut proof!</li>
            <li>The reviews were decent.</li>
            <li>recommendation would be to skip this particular model.  </li>
            <li>I had an older version of this.  </li>
            <li>The beard trimmer works well compared to the older Wahls that I had.</li>
            <li>The top part, for shaving the private area, includes a very short trimming edge on both side.</li>
            <li>I owned the older Phillips bodygroom razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavier and more solid to hold, there are no attachments and it has an indicator letting you know when battery is low.  </li>
            <li>It does a decent job with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the ultimate for grooming your most private area.  </li>
            <li>But I found, particularly in my groin area, that the trimmer didn&#x27;t always work.</li>
            <li>I normally shave with a razor but tried this electric shaver instead... took me 1.5 times as long and wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I like.</li>
            <li>Love this product i just wish it will last longer or the battery  will last longer</li>
            <li>Particularly the section that says once charged you&#x27;re supposed to use it until it dies before charging it again?</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t give a soft smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>This body groom is really good, but after few moths the battery had problem, but I bought the same one again because I like it</li>
            <li>My older Norelco 3-headed shaving razor is older and still has plenty of life.  </li>
            <li>There is definitely a lot to the bodygroom, and it does most things well enough, but none quite as well a dedicated tool.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older unit I had.</li>
            <li>but you might have to run through the same patch of hair more than once and in some cases in different directions..</li>
            <li>electric razor is well designed but it has two main design flaws.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not simple, you have to gingerly pull the contacts off the batteries which are soldered on and then make sure the battery connections are in place and the battery pack is making all the necessary connections along with the connections to the charging prongs.</li>
            <li>They allow for a better looking (if you ever have a habit of missing a few hairs these rarely miss a beat) and faster shave (they cut the hairs shorter allowing them to easily be cut by</li>
            <li>It was an upgrade after my older one would not hold the blade any longer.</li>
            <li>the head begins to lose the main net,so no way to continue</li>
            <li>However the main problem is the lifespan of the device.</li>
            <li>I use it on legs mainly.</li>
            <li>You need a steady hand around some body parts because this one is not forgiving....</li>
            <li>Never really seemed to do anything great but was serviceable in a few areas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaving/trimming head is improved compared to the prior version, as the head is now articulated (it swings forward and back) to better match the contour of your body.  </li>
            <li>I think I red most of the reviews last year when I bought this piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, after a year or so the batteries don&#x27;t charge and it&#x27;s only good for a few minutes of underpowered clipping.  </li>
            <li>Since most such electronic devices suggest only perodic run-downs, it&#x27;s a bit of an annoyance.  </li>
            <li>Since most such electronic devices suggest only perodic run-downs, it&#x27;s a bit of an annoyance.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;The main flaw is the battery.</li>
            <li>This product efficiently and quickly trims and is really a solid device.</li>
            <li>Removed hair without cutting sensitive skin or causing razor burns; is also easy to clean and feels good in my hand-easy to manipulate around the shaving area and leaves public area skin silky-smooth.  </li>
            <li>shave itself is decent.  </li>
            <li>and I never had that issue with the older model.  </li>
            <li>However, Amazon was lower than the local &amp;#34;mega lowmart&amp;#34; and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace an older model of the BodyGroom.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t easily drop it to the floor when showering and your hands are wet and soapy, which the older model had.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so this works very well for me, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all with it....  </li>
            <li>first philips product for me, sounds nice and as described , a bit soft on skin , sometimes u need to press hard to get it all out, but</li>
            <li>It lasts me a really long time and it charges back up very quick too!</li>
            <li>The Trimmer: The guard on trimmer side easily falls down to the lowest setting, so I only use it on the lowest setting now, limiting its versatility significantly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more expensive than most groomers, but is still cheaper than many.</li>
            <li>Though I have considered just letting the whole thing go natural, a la Seventies!</li>
            <li>To shave smooth, I have always used a Norelco 3 head shaver, AND a beard trimmer first to shave close enough so the razor can then be used without going over and over longer facial hair.</li>
            <li>but the top blade pulls at my hair, not cool . . .</li>
            <li>I got this since other shavers in the past had always cut me and took much longer to make everything just right and nowhere as good as this does.</li>
            <li>In the wild world of manscaping one must be willing to try new ideas, and sometimes suffer the consequences.  </li>
            <li>do find that the battery runs down quickly, and that the shaver isn&#x27;t very secure in the charger, but those are minor gripes.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the original Body Groom emitted only a moderate noise, just strong enough to give me confidence that it was going to get in, get the job done, and get out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, it does work great for beards and other less sensitive body real estate.</li>
            <li>This was not so, in fact the skin down there is as smooth as can be and I am completely comfortable into the next day.      </li>
            <li>I was recently shaving the top of my penis close to the base and the shaver took a pretty good bite (1/8 diameter) of skin which took a while to stop bleeding... not to mention it looked like it might be some other kind of</li>
            <li>No cuts, no nicks, no blood, no pain (just make sure you pull the skin tight and perform on dry/clean skin).</li>

            <li>Highly recommended without reservation.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have yet to return the BG2040 to Philips and discover how they handle warranty claims, but it is one of the more expensive options available on Amazon, so I would have expected better durability.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The Norelco did not work for me, therefore, I cannot rate it highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing weigh training and high intensity interval cardio for quite some time.</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>You can tell it is made with high quality parts.</li>
            <li>But I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone and already have.</li>
            <li>I think some people are setting their expectation way to high for a $50 shaver.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The foil side does a good enough job that I don&#x27;t have to use my traditional wet razor very often anymore.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item to those who have to keep their body hair in check like myself.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for shaving body hair all around.</li>
            <li>In my experience, the battery life is only good for a few days before it needs charging, which sucks because the charger stand is kind of an eyesore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I opened it up and saw that Philips uses cheap NiMH batteries (not decent at all).</li>
            <li>As long as you keep it clean</li>
            <li>Clean up is a snap and battery lasts a long time during use.  </li>
            <li>It grooms extremely well the lower area allows you too nicely groom the area above and cleans up well the hair around the boys.</li>
            <li>The design makes it incredibly easy to trim all of the hair from your back and shave it smoothly with just a few passes.</li>
            <li>but like I said before, if you are careful it will be fine.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it offers both the &amp;#34;close shave&amp;#34; on one end and the adjustable trimmer on the other.  </li>
            <li>Mangroomer on the other hand produces the same kind of shave you can get if you were shaving your face with a hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>The shaver cuts close enough to cause minor razor burn on tender skin, but otherwise is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I like this electric shaver a lot, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is just because the shave isn&#x27;t excellent, and the battery life didn&#x27;t seem to be the specified 50 minutes on a full charge, but as long as it last long enough to do the job once, then I don&#x27;t mind putting it on the charger to refill for the next time.</li>
            <li>It could use a little better documentation</li>
            <li>The most I can use it for anymore is to trim my little goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want to be just a little hairy you will love this</li>
            <li>and I believe that the shaving on that was a little bit better, but it died.</li>
            <li>i will update this rating after i use it a little bit more.</li>
            <li>Wish there was a little more protection for drops thogh</li>
            <li>That could use a little more engineering.</li>
            <li>, I thought maybe a little trim would be okay.</li>
            <li>The shipment took a little longer that it should have but that was okay.</li>
            <li>be a little more flexible.</li>
            <li>Charge lasts a long time and blades clean easily and stay sharp.</li>
            <li>It was a little more than what I planned on spending at the time</li>
            <li>it could have be a little more ergonomic to be used on the face but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Extremely satisfied with this product, I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a year I think.</li>
            <li>Worked great when it was new, but began using less as the battery became less and less potent.</li>
            <li>This groomer works extremely well, cleans easily, and has a sleek design.</li>
            <li>I guess that goes without saying, but from all the other reviews I had read I thought it was just gonna be a relaxed easy going experience with these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The body shaver side does cut very close to the skin, also without nicking, and has a dual sided fine trimmer as well to knock down the hairs.  </li>
            <li>It casts a large shadow so it should be used in a well lit bathroom, preferably where the light is coming in from different sides of the room or directly above.     </li>
            <li>I cannot speak yet on if it is worth the price over the lower end models, but it feels very solid and high build quality.</li>
            <li>It gets everything the first time and is so quick compared to other ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>even when I used it on the most tender parts, and I even used the shaver end it on everything down yonder!  </li>
            <li>this is the first body grooming sistem that i can use with totally confidence that i will no get hurt... very high recommended</li>
            <li>One thing that others haven&#x27;t mentioned: It actually LOOKS GOOD on the bathroom counter and takes up very little space.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this new body groomer to replace the older model before this one.  </li>
            <li>I had the older BG2020 before upgrading to this new trimmer.</li>
            <li>All other positive reviews are true.  </li>
            <li>The micro trimmer is great, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li>Like many others who have written reviews, I chose to ignore the negative reviews that detailed horror stories of cuts, gashes, and &amp;#34;craters&amp;#34; left in the wake of this product.  </li>
            <li>Helpfully, it&#x27;s waterproof which gives you the flexibility to use it in the shower, and the curved shaft between the groomer and the trimmer has a rubber grip that allows a secure hold even when the Bodygroom is wet.</li>
            <li>where near gonna be as fast as a razor.      </li>
            <li>I have only charged this item 2x in the last 5 days which was amazing compared to the 2020 which after a shaving session, I would have to charge daily.  </li>
            <li>The stand is really cool-looking and the dual action allows me to get the shave I need.</li>
            <li>spent hours researching the perfect all-around shaver that wasn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li>Any sensitive area like obliques or your ass, be ready for some rashes.</li>
            <li>Great hair removal,  lousy</li>
            <li>I was surprised how close of a shave it really was.</li>
            <li>Then, I tried an epilator (which looks like a shaver, but just pulls the hair out completely), and while this is the best removal method, it&#x27;s painful and very time-consuming.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Really frustrated is the best way to sum it up.  </li>
            <li>I really like this model so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the item holds its initial charge for quite a while and that it&#x27;s one of the few shavers/groomers that&#x27;s really easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>Fantastic battery life does everything I expected it to do</li>
            <li>Use light pressure and make several passes (much like using a regular electric shaver on your face).  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco Bodygroom stopped working after much use and 4 or 5 years time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Helps to keep you really trimmed and professional looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, trims your body hair to display a man that takes pride in his presentation.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the shaver part much at all, but use the trimmer frequently.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s just my tastes, but the foil side snags far too much when my beard is on the longer side (1/4th inch) and cuts way to close regardless.</li>
            <li>However, if you want to shave in the &amp;#34;more sensitive places&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m very scared about what might happen.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical but reading all the great reviews from users like myself</li>
            <li>Great groomer, works as expected, like the dual sides, don&#x27;t be afraid of it. :)</li>
            <li>but if u still need to cut few more u can click to start again</li>
            <li>I really like the small edger on the top and bottom of the trimming area.</li>
            <li>No grooming tool for men worth its salt can be sold on the premise that shaving must be a two-person operation if the entire body is to be tended to.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally like to write these things, but I thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t decide between the models, spend the extra $, it&#x27;s well worth it to get the 2040.  </li>
            <li>Replaces my normal face shaver and body trimmer  </li>
            <li>Now that it was ready to use I proceeded to use the &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; side first on the #1 guide setting to cut the hair short before switching to the &amp;#34;shaver&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Normally, after trimming and then shaving with a manual, I&#x27;d end up with some razor burn/irritation 1-2 days after.</li>
            <li>I like the dual heads, but I would have rather had a smaller, more agile groomer with removable settings than this larger, more awkward setup</li>
            <li>I recently began growing a beard, just for fun.    </li>
            <li>actually prefer to use the basic body groom from Norelco far more than this one.</li>
            <li>Ok, one thing; battery last really long.</li>
            <li>Then, I get 10 minutes at most of use before it goes dead.  </li>
            <li>It is good for getting into small areas such as groin or in the crevice of your chest (the sternum).  </li>
            <li>The charger stand is small and appropriate, doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li>However, if you are not careful (don&#x27;t go too fast!)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>When he first received it he was a bit unsure but now that he has had time to actually use it he really likes it.</li>
            <li>(you can make it slip with excess pressure) and holds well under normal use.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but you need to know this before getting it.</li>
            <li>The maximum length setting (5) is more than long enough for anything</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably just bring a normal razor.</li>
            <li>The shaver works almost as a razor, the shaving is pretty close, but if you use it  in different direction it has nothing to envy to a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Light soft hairs that grow long on my chest.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re never 100% sure it&#x27;s set in correctly and there is no light letting you know either.</li>
            <li>Overall, its worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will last long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about it at all, but can&#x27;t send it back.</li>
            <li>I suppose I can&#x27;t be too annoyed since I did get 3 years of good use out of this shaver.</li>
            <li>It is a good razor for body hair, but not great for your face or beard.  </li>
            <li>The main shaving and trimming parts easily break down for cleaning.</li>
            <li>It has a very cool charger, very modern and sleek looking, if a bit larger than some of our other trimmers.  </li>
            <li>BTW I did not use the other end, so that might work fine for all I know.</li>
            <li>I was lucky, otherwise one will need to go to a department or local store to see if they sell one small oil lubricator and pay more</li>
            <li>One thing I will miss about the Wahl (at least when it was new), is the amazing battery life.</li>
            <li>This product works as advertised (I only tried it dry) and does a much better job</li>
            <li>It is not effective underwater, as it was advertised to be, but it is versatile on dry skin and is great for neatening up.  </li>
            <li>It is good but Less than expected</li>
            <li>I am able to safely and efficiently trim down the hair, and then subsequently shave it off with the other end.</li>
            <li>The precision trimmer, similarly, works well enough that I&#x27;m not complaining, but not quite as good as other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I mean can you honestly blame me?</li>
            <li>It is water proof so in the shower is so much easier and no mess.</li>
            <li>I mean, if you somehow eunuch-ize  yourself with this, it&#x27;s probably your own fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right out of the package this shaver has a solid feel to it.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and a rebate added the final touch.</li>
            <li>I had been contemplating this purchase for awhile, and finally made a decision when the price was right.</li>
            <li>But, the last time I dropped it it hit just right and bent the blade head.</li>
            <li>right next to number 2 trimmer is  trimmer 3 which is like</li>
            <li>We are in the 21st century right?</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li>The charge lasts a long time and is really quick to refill at just around an hour.</li>
            <li>Luckily I have long arms.</li>
            <li>If this is your first body trimmer, you don&#x27;t know if it can be better or worse for certain.  </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first but man, it is great!</li>
            <li>(i mean come on who hasn&#x27;t lost some of the 800 attachments other products provide) and the combination of the trimmer and foil gives you nice smooth results.</li>
            <li>Very nice, got tired of the waxing pain!</li>
            <li>I took it slowly, cutting down the forest first with the close shaving end, only to find out it was better to shave down most of it with the guarded side first, which brought down the hair much more quickly.  </li>
            <li>proper lubrication, the razor does a pretty decent job, comparable to a Gillette Trac-II blade razor (which costs under $1).  </li>
            <li>This one has been going strong for almost a year with no issues and no signs of slowing down.</li>
            <li>but it certainly was a disappointment for me because the convenience of the product is great</li>
            <li>The Remington neatly fit into an assortment of other men&#x27;s care products:</li>
            <li>The Remington neatly fit into an assortment of other men&#x27;s care products:</li>
            <li>The other end, however, is noticeably sharper, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it below the belt, but it&#x27;s great for other areas such as the chest or neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li>Another thing is that this shaver or most electric shavers in general are a lot more difficult to shave in between crevices or curvy</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much harder to shave the boys using this as compared to the original model.</li>
            <li>the other end is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I primarily bought this to use on my man parts but trim chest hair and some other spots too.  </li>
            <li>:  It does an admirable job of shaving smoothly and closely everywhere in the nether regions, without nicks or other drama.  </li>
            <li>When I would stumble out of bed to turn it off, I&#x27;d find it very hot - about to start a fire hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The other end is a razor which can be used to smooth over stubble.  </li>
            <li>It charges well and and has a nice appearance, so overall it works well but is a little aggressive for me.</li>
            <li>So basically you have to solder contacts on NEW batteries</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco is for that new man.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco is for that new man.</li>
            <li>After using the Panasonic ER224s for years, I wanted a new one that could be used in or out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;After looking for a trimmer to shave my chest and lower region in the shower, I came across the Philips BG-2040 and Remington BHT-650.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li>I like the new dual-head design and improved ergonomics of the handle.</li>
            <li>I am new to using a shaver in the shower</li>
            <li>a new foil for the shaver end and works as new.  </li>
            <li>And it had been awhile since I had performed any grooming because I was looking for a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I returned the item to Amazon and have since received a new groomer that thankfully charges as designed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is still just like new.</li>
            <li>Philips sent me new one.  </li>
            <li>So it work like new again.</li>
            <li>Will need to buy new foil head.</li>
            <li>So.. after i got this new body groomer, i tried it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need to get a new one.</li>
            <li>EDIT- Customer Support provided me a brand new shaver and for that I will have to give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Swapped the new shaving foil ($12?)</li>
            <li>and I went looking for a new body hair removal device.  </li>
            <li>the market for a new one this weekend, and</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco is my new shaving brand.</li>
            <li>this IS her NEW Groomer....</li>
            <li>Mine stopped charging after a month or so, but Norelco customer service got me a new one in about 3 days in a painless warranty process.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new shaver...</li>
            <li>So I plan on buying a new eventually.</li>
            <li>I can live with that for the convenience of using it in the shower.</li>
            <li>We live, we learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the new one and charged it and brought it with me on a business trip out of the country.</li>
            <li>but I need new blades where do I</li>
            <li>put the brand new guide on the Bodygroom, and -- (drum roll, please)</li>
            <li>My husband used 9ne for 3 years and I just got him a new one.</li>
            <li>I talked to Philips customer service and they send me out a new one.</li>
            <li>Basically...needs a new after every 2 uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this new razor I got.</li>
            <li>It runs out of battery a bit faster than it did when it was brand new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably just going to purchase a new one instead.</li>
            <li>I tried the new one and zap.</li>
            <li>but with the new charging cord.  </li>
            <li>I am going to buy a new trimmer, just not this one.</li>
            <li>I need a new one</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be looking for a new product that has a battery that doesn&#x27;t tie after 10 charges.</li>
            <li>I honestly tried about 5 different angles and approaches and I could not cut any hair, and would probably still be standing there trying to trim if I did not get out my old Wahl and limped it along to knock the tall hair down.  </li>
            <li>The charger stand also folds flat which makes the entire system easy to store or pack for travel.  </li>
            <li>Every man should own this product, whether you just want to trim you facial hair, or shave it completely, this product will not let you down.</li>
            <li>So far, I have not had any issues with the adjustable trimmer sliding down to the lowest setting when trimming hair and the trimmer is by far my favorite side of the groomer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far safer and easy to use than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>after the battery died after nearly a year, I called Norelco to see how to get a replacement and because I registered this product they sent me a new item - no questions!</li>
            <li>So, I tried putting the blade from the old one into the new one and looks like blade from the older model</li>
            <li>I have used it both wet and dry, but for me dry use is more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I am &amp;#34;naturally tan&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s a challenge finding something that will leave a clean canvas minus the nicks.</li>
            <li>The only downside I have found is it really does need to be fully charged to really get the job done.  </li>
            <li>only complaint may be that is that shape wise</li>
            <li>my last Norelco had multiple combs, none of which was ever the precisely correct length.  </li>
            <li>Be careful of drops because once you break the top you only have the side burn end that will work.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re on the go fast you can simply brush a towel gently across the area and that&#x27;ll get rid of the excess powder, too.  </li>
            <li>people who have issues with it most likely rush or are a bit too rough on it.</li>
            <li>The main reason I purchased this was for smoothing out the old twigs and berries, so the misses doesn&#x27;t get bark in her teeth.  </li>
            <li>Nice heavy balanced feel for a personal groomer.  </li>
            <li>The red light at the back of the shaver flashes when I try to turn it</li>
            <li>The charger works fast; the charger only takes about an hour to fully charge and you&#x27;re ready for another 50-60 minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still able to get the fade, I just have to take the comb off and be extra careful.    </li>
            <li>Smoothly handling the most difficult places to shave,&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I tend to shave my body so this shaver really only gets you so smooth before you have to switch to an actual razor.  </li>
            <li>* your private areas will be safe including the boys, i&#x27;d recommend that area being wet</li>
            <li>I loved this product at first, but was seriously disappointed by how quickly it died.</li>
            <li>it is good in the shower and so far I have not experienced the charging and holding charge issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t entirely the body groomer&#x27;s fault, obviously, but I figure if the thing&#x27;s job is to trim body hair (and we all know what specific region of body hair that most buyers are interested in trimming), then it better be designed in such a way as to make that a little simpler.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it highly to anyone wanting to go clean down below.</li>
            <li>Capable of shaving almost my whole body on a single charge makes this very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Every single time I have used it to try to shave my most sensitive area, however, I have been left bleeding and in pain.  </li>
            <li>thing I do find a little bothersome is that the fella runs out of juice pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I had the previous model, and like any tool after learning how to use it have found that there&#x27;s really no other or better option for your \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These blades will work fine if you shave a flat-surface area like your legs for example, but any other areas that are curvy and sensitive like your groin, they will cut your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>You can get a very, very close shave with the pivot head, but it won&#x27;t be the same as using a razor, waxing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I only had one problem and Philips took care of it very fast.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Some how they&#x27;ve changed this thing so that it can shave very sensitive areas without any pain or nicking at all.</li>
            <li>I mean you can&#x27;t really get any better than this.  </li>
            <li>I could live with all this if the initial cost wasn&#x27;t higher.</li>
            <li>The shaving side takes a little practice and getting used to, but overall works very well and does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li>Where it really shines is taking down a full blown hairy area, and getting you down to smooth.</li>
            <li>Worked great for about 2 weeks, then blades seemed to dull and the battery last very very shortly, especially when you use the beard groomer.</li>
            <li>The screen side doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I&#x27;d like but still better than any lady shaver I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Bigger, better, smoother than the smaller one with the blue handle.  </li>
            <li>I first started shaving \\&quot;below the neck\\&quot; while deployed to Iraq because it was the only way to prevent \\&quot;desert</li>
            <li>This means you can just wave this thing all over your body, in many lazy passes, without having to worry about nicking or hurting yourself.</li>
            <li>This thing is LOUD!  </li>
            <li>Now where exactly will I be shaving since not everyone will shave the same spots.</li>
            <li>The first unit I ordered from Amazon simply would not charge.</li>
            <li>I like to keep the package they hang out in completely hairless, this groomer does it!</li>
            <li>This razor is so fearless, you could allow your significant other to use it on you, or you could use it on them.  </li>
            <li>However, I miss my old 2020 for one reason - this one bites!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thoroughly enjoyed using this unit for the past 6 months.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this is the shaver for you!</li>
            <li>The Philips BF2040 is my first personal groomer.</li>
            <li>A must by if interested into personal grooming men and women alike.</li>
            <li>I bought my first back in 2010 while living in Italy!</li>
            <li>THIS SHAVER NEARLY BLED ME TO DEATH!  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my significant other; he loves it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this product based on other reviews.</li>
            <li>Although the shaving head is exactly the same as the one on the BG2020</li>
            <li>Wow..!</li>
            <li>This is the second one I have owned after the first one stopped charging.</li>
            <li>You definitely need to trim with the blade guard first.</li>
            <li>I sent the first one back</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li>Pretty simple.</li>
            <li>I had two of these, the first got left at a hotel</li>
            <li>Much better than other similar products.</li>
            <li>Who knew hair grew in so many different places other than your head?</li>
            <li>I will not shave the pits again, as there is other issues with that area, i will only trim there and feel confident this unit will do well.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if that will be better or not for me.</li>
            <li>Well worth trying it out as long as you remember to take your time.</li>
            <li>I find myself having to go over areas more than I would on the other model to get the same result.</li>
            <li>Exactly 2 years later</li>
            <li>Exactly 2 years later</li>
            <li>The skin-protecting shaving head is made from hypo-allergenic materials, and you can see the difference after having, you don&#x27;t get any rash or itching due to the shave, again this is important for the sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also a gift for my significant other.</li>
            <li>but honestly, it&#x27;s pretty darn close enough.</li>
            <li>However it needs its dock for charging and this creates a need for a more than usual space for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I have used this consistently &amp; its actually exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>This is probably the most expensive product on the market, yet its performance is lousy at best!  </li>
            <li>That was the first and last time I will use a Norelco product.  </li>
            <li>I thought this model would be a significant improvement over my three year old Bodygroom, but not really.  </li>
            <li>They either tug the hair and cause pain, barely trim, or leave really scratchy stubble.</li>
            <li>The trimmer end, even on the closest setting, does not get close enough to cut the skin, which is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo2YR5TCUXZR33P]]This is my second Norelco Bodygroom product, and just like the first one, it stopped working about a year after the warranty</li>
            <li>(here) is probably more efficient for trimming as the clip-on combs require lots of repetitive strokes from all angles, but my review has to do with the shaver portion.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to worked pretty well when it actually worked, but don&#x27;t know what to do now.</li>
            <li>I was able to correct this to a small extent by repeatedly turning on the unit and leaving it running until it stopped on</li>
            <li>Mine is broken( top part of the shaving head, secure net to protect you from blades)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works exactly the same as if you used a razor and cream.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with it is that it can&#x27;t hold a charge, and it takes FOREVER to charge it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>; This is a quality shaving unit, and will complete any of your body grooming tasks!</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd unit, I replaced the first one after the battery life dropped to about 5 minutes per charge.</li>
            <li>Able to reach my back and works well on all the other parts of the body (chest, groin).</li>
            <li>this has become my first and only option for body shaver.</li>
            <li>I have used many of shaver in the past.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not huge, the battery life is good enough to trim your body and facial hair, can be used in the shower, and doesn&#x27;t take any space.</li>
            <li>My hair trimmer does a good job over all of trimming body hair but is bulky and running a cord and extension cord all around is not ideal.</li>
            <li>and it was replaced under warranty with a new one but with the clear proviso that the warranty would not be extended for the new model.</li>
            <li>I have blonde/brown facial hair that doesn&#x27;t grow to thick or fast on my face so this actually works very well for easy, quick trim/shave.</li>
            <li>as long as you&#x27;re careful down there and pay attention to what you are doing it works great.</li>
            <li>, in my humble opinion, nothing can beat a normal (but good quality) razor to shave down there.</li>
            <li>After owning many trimmers where you had to be very very careful not to nick the boys, I approached these with the same caution.</li>
            <li>Very nice looking a little larger than expected.</li>
            <li>Was so easy that I got a little bite carried on a got the legs</li>
            <li>/&gt;While $50 might seem a bit high for the actual item received, it is only a few dollars more than you might wish to pay, and if it works for at least 2 years it will be a good value.</li>
            <li>The only problems are: 1) it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long; and 2) the plastic comb piece that attaches to head tends to break easily.</li>
            <li>Tried it on my upper arm, shoulders, back, lower neck and got a clean result.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product on a daily basis to trim my facial hair (I like it at about a 4) and clean up any unwanted stubble, this despite the fact that it is not intended for use on the face.</li>
            <li>What it doesn&#x27;t do well is get things really clean in tighter and harder to reach areas (like directly under my nose).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using things like this for about ten years for the clean head effect and they used to last a couple of years.</li>
            <li>So I took the plunge and bought this in town and what can I say even though the instructions say for neck down Only this thing works great for keeping my head shaved down almost as close as a traditonal razor blade but without the cut&#x27;s and irritations.  </li>
            <li>It trimmed my body hair and left me as clean as a male porn star.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it keeps me baby smooth down there for her.</li>
            <li>every where else, I feel comfortable when using it down below and haven&#x27;t had any nicks, scraps or cuts.  </li>
            <li>, I prefer a smooth shave down there, as does my wife, so I turned the trimmer end off, and switched to the razor end.</li>
            <li>Primarily I use it for shaving some unwanted chest hair and for trimming down there.</li>
            <li>it will give you a smooth shave down there, but it does have it&#x27;s flaws.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any issues other than trying to figure out how to clean it.</li>
            <li>Now I have this new one and it kicks my old trimmers butt.</li>
            <li>The new one&#x27;s battery life has lasted one year so far and the battery life is now diminising</li>
            <li>Naturally, I wanted to show off the new physique.</li>
            <li>long as you are sensible, and don&#x27;t put the side trimmers at a right angle to your skin, you will never even feel it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use small, gentle, 1-2\\&quot; strokes for areas of dense hair, and broader strokes for just a light dusting of hair.  </li>
            <li>It has 5 different measurements for your beard and can easily shave the neck (or any other place) to a smooth surface with the other side.</li>
            <li>and the guide moved easily to the shortest setting creating a uneven cut.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer will easily remove the hair that&#x27;s been there for a few months.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s easy to get Impatient</li>
            <li>This product is most definitely not worth the extra $25.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and operates as expected.</li>
            <li>It balances on a silly holder that is just built to look cool on your sink top.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a predecessor to this groomer and was skeptical to buy a newer version since I liked the older one so much.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t turn as many RPM&#x27;s as the full size razor which means it has trouble with the occasional single , longer than stubble, hair.</li>
            <li>Also, I find the handle design is good and long, allowing me to reach all sections of my back, with a little stretch.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It might take a little bit of getting used to, but it works just fine after a couple of times.</li>
            <li>Every few years we buy a new one bc the battery poops out, but we always get this brand because of the quality performance and that it&#x27;s great in wet and dry environments.</li>
            <li>I bought the BG20240 based on positive reviews, but cannot personally recommend.</li>
            <li>When you plug the charger in, the indicator light will flash green while charging;  when fully charged, the light shows steady green.  </li>
            <li>had it long enough to guage battery life, but I am overall pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The only thing i can tell is that the battery does not last so much, so you have to recharge very often, however, this product is excelent!</li>
            <li>and I am not sure if it is necessary but as cheap as it is I feel like it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>and like most batteries they don&#x27;t last long enough for a shave after two years.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, I returned it to Amazon, as it&#x27;s just not powerful enough to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, gets the job done, looks cool.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite grooming tool, at least during lake season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>Used it very rarely, maybe once a month or even less.  </li>
            <li>Also, the trimmers are less effective when your hair is wet.</li>
            <li>The shaver sits in the holder less securely than the old model.</li>
            <li>Ultimately I decided to pay a bit more than the BD2028 or the BG2038 thinking that the previous one had lasted over 7 years.</li>
            <li>I use it more dry than I do when wet.</li>
            <li>The battery problems were typical for 3 year old (cheap) rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li>I most likely will be buying the previous version of this again.  </li>
            <li>I do not use this on my shaft or scrotum, razor is much better for that area and much less likely to get cut.</li>
            <li>Trimming of body hair (after your initial grooming) only takes two quick passes to maintain your desired results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This device has two sides with different functions: one (the upper side) was built to eliminate any kind of hairs without irritation in EVERY area of the body, including that one down there.</li>
            <li>I remember reading reviews and comments over a year ago before choosing this unit, some quite entertaining and some rather awkwardly juvenile descriptions of \\&quot;your junk\\&quot; which were were also sometimes entertaining, as least as far as being in a locker room can be.  </li>
            <li>Some areas are more fragile and require a little technique... Or a soft touch!</li>
            <li>These batteries held up long enough for me to use it one full session before recharging when it was new.</li>
            <li>The back end is OK for trimming but still is not full size and the #1,2,3 adjustable part does not lock well and slips halfway through using it giving you an accidental shorter cut, so it is disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just over an year after I purchased it, the trimmer part is dead, though the groomer works fine.</li>
            <li>The charger stand is a bit gimmicky, but works fine.  </li>
            <li>but, just like the trimmer, it&#x27;s not as good as other electric shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>The saver works fine, it can hurt a little if the hairs are too long, so I suggest using the trimmer first</li>
            <li>You have to fold it a certain way to get the power supply cord in and then fold it a different way in order to get the groomer in the charging cradle.</li>
            <li>I had originally tried using both my hair clippers and my electric razor for my face on my chest, which worked to some degree, but it either didn&#x27;t get the hair down as far as I&#x27;d like, or I would have razor burn.  </li>
            <li>trimmer guard still seems a little cheap</li>
            <li>trimmer is good for thicker hair but is worthless for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>And, I think it actually hurts a little more than a razor &#x27;cause it plucks a</li>
            <li>only with the guard on first for the major cut.  </li>
            <li>better reach for hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>it is oddly curved and very large for trimming the intimate areas.  </li>
            <li>Before my shower, I sat down on my favorite throne (aka &#x27;toilet&#x27;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little strange looking and the charging stand is pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li>Using the guard on the 4 or 5 setting is nice for keeping leg and arm hair in check, but doesn&#x27;t shave it enough to be &amp;#34;noticeable&amp;#34; and I use it on 1 for my underarms to avoid nicking myself on the hard angles.</li>
            <li>As a wife that cleans her hubby up - I not only needed it to be easy to use - I needed it to work on him without the nicks, cuts, or other dangers involved when shaving this sensitive area.  </li>
            <li>The cost of the new complete charger is $55, the same price of the new unit!</li>
            <li>In contrast to other positive reviews, I do not find this electric shaver works very well on either armpit hair or the pubic region.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the reviews got better as the better model presented itself,  the price increase didn&#x27;t shoot up that bad.  </li>
            <li>Bad in you won&#x27;t get perfectly smooth with this, but good because then your skin won&#x27;t get as irritated from the hair braking back through.</li>
            <li>I fault Amazon for not making this clear in its description of this shaver.</li>
            <li>I used it on my Italian sweater that I had been wearing my whole adult life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They make a big deal about the advances like the 3d pivoting head, but it&#x27;s not really that smooth a shave.</li>
            <li>It seems to last much longer than my old nimh.  </li>
            <li>I still have to resort to a regular wet razor for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quite fiddly to keep in the cradle for charging, and the thing can&#x27;t be plugged directly in, so even if it&#x27;s only the charger that died, the whole thing is now unusable.</li>
            <li>(Maybe Norelco has improved the battery life since mine is 2+ years old now?)</li>
            <li>I have not had any problems with nicks or cut while trimming sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>However, the only issue I&#x27;ve had with it is the guard on the razor itself doesn&#x27;t guard very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oddly loud, too.</li>
            <li>This is much better.en was solid, not fancy.</li>
            <li>After that, the manual states that the shaver/trimmer should be used twice a year where you let it die completely where the motor stops working.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After that, the manual states that the shaver/trimmer should be used twice a year where you let it die completely where the motor stops working.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that it&#x27;s just a first-time marriage that needed to break-in and was going to work itself out (..at least, I hoped....lol).  </li>
            <li>how do i get it fixed or replaced?</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my current all-around trimmer for almost a year.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s been a complete letdown.  </li>
            <li>The groomer itself actually works really well.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and every time I used it the \\&quot;please charge me\\&quot; light blinks on.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it thus far.</li>
            <li>I find anything with batteries wares out far too soon.</li>
            <li>With this upgraded model, they&#x27;ve apparently fixed that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, however it occasionally nicked things (ouch) and it didn&#x27;t hold a charge very well at all.  </li>
            <li>regular razors is so much simpler</li>
            <li>I have used this electric shaver two times so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trimming and shaving frank and the boys for about a year now using an old beard   trimmer and Gillette Fusion razor.  </li>
            <li>On my old Body Groom, for whatever reason, this was never an issue and never caused any pain.  </li>
            <li>On this one, the friction that results from contact with sensitive skin hurts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About that old Body Groom I owned.  </li>
            <li>How I rue the day I bought this and threw the old one in the trash.  </li>
            <li>what you gain is a complete assurance thatyou won&#x27;t cut yourself.</li>
            <li>It has two ends - one for trimming body hair and another for shaving (including sensitive areas) without any cuts or scratches on the skin.</li>
            <li>He used to break out when he used his old body groomer</li>
            <li>The only thing I really hope they eventually do is add the ability to dispense lotion, which my face razor does.</li>
            <li>and there that really stand out next to closely shaven skin.  </li>
            <li>But the battery life dropped so rapidly to near unusable that I cannot recommend this item.</li>
            <li>And there&#x27;s no avoiding them as far as I can tell...</li>
            <li>My biggest problem with this razor is that you can&#x27;t plug the cord directly into the razor.</li>
            <li>though this shaver is a body groomer and not advertised as a facial hair trimmer, I do use it to trim my beard, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I blame myself not the machine for the cut, i was just going to fast thinking I wouldn&#x27;t have enough time to cover everything in 50 minutes</li>
            <li>It works well in those sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Thanks Philips for the brushed metal finish.  </li>
            <li>The battery life truly surprised me.  </li>
            <li>Charger automatically shuts off when charging is complete.  </li>
            <li>Never have i received an item that I am so completely blown away by.</li>
            <li>times there was blood coming out when trying to shave in the sensitive place.</li>
            <li>When it came time for me to replace it, I went with this since you naturally want to go with the \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li>I suppose it wasn&#x27;t really intended to be used for facial hair.  </li>
            <li>it far exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel it did a much better job and in at least 1/10th</li>
            <li>This shaver doesn&#x27;t cause as much irritation or nicking as I got when I tried a regular old face shaver, but there&#x27;s still some, and it doesn&#x27;t get anywhere near as close as the face shaver.</li>
            <li>This constantly nips my skin and doesn&#x27;t shave very close.</li>
            <li>For the Man that worries about shaving the Chest and Forest below and knows how sensitive those areas are.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not nick-free and it frequently pinches in places that you don&#x27;t want it pinching.  </li>
            <li>I frequent</li>
            <li>Use it all over even on sensitive skin areas.  </li>
            <li>I never had much pubic hair since I also purchased the Personal Shavers Men Package..</li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t want to be completely hairless...</li>
            <li>I found a refurbished version of my old Remington beard trimmer here on Amazon, and will buy that for both beard and body.  </li>
            <li>My old Philips Norelco Bodygroomer worked</li>
            <li>I ditched the old one and purchased this model.</li>
            <li>I spent more than 4 times to remove it properly so it might be different situation from man to man!</li>
            <li>have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I took the head off of it and stuck it on the old model I still have.</li>
            <li>I only nicked myself twice in this area and it was because I was going fast and rushing through.</li>
            <li>Tested on legs and arms so far.</li>
            <li>You cannot plug it directly in; you have to use the charging cradle.</li>
            <li>part is its not to loud and is usable in shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I only use it for 15mins in shower depending how much I have to shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be direct here and tell you</li>
            <li>No complaints at all so far</li>
            <li>Just works, unexpectedly well in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note; when you remove the foil for cleaning, read the directions on how to handle it.  </li>
            <li>It does nip sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Just shave &#x27;em with an old fashioned razor like everyone else does, it&#x27;s easier.</li>
            <li>As far as longevity goes I csnt say.</li>
            <li>Since I happen to have one from my old trimmer</li>
            <li>I am only giving four stars as I have not had a chance to use it that much..</li>
            <li>So far this is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really the only issue anyone could have with this device.</li>
            <li>It takes 2 separate uses to complete a beard trimming.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have with the 2040 is that it tugs on longer hair if I move to fast, which is something I never had a problem with on the 2020.</li>
            <li>really want to return it but cannot as I am leaving for a trip tomorrow and wont be back for</li>
            <li>It was my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for my old Norelco BodyGroom.</li>
            <li>This is completely the razor you want if you want to shave your man bits.</li>
            <li>I ended up using my old Braun shaver instead.</li>
            <li>A couple of times I&#x27;ve gotten nicked, but overall it works very well for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>Now as far as shaving \\&quot;below the border\\</li>
            <li>When my old Norelco sideburns trimmer died on my, I was researching for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>Got this for Valentine&#x27;s Day for my boyfriend to replace his old shaver.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have soft supple skin</li>
            <li>Oh, why did I toss my old Bodygroom so hastily?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I try the last possible angle available to me, short of bending the space-time continuum. 9)</li>
            <li>: When I use this shaver, either it cuts so close that it makes a crater in my skin, or it&#x27;s so far off</li>
            <li>It gets the job done so much faster than the regular shaver.</li>
            <li>It died last year which really saddened me for it</li>
            <li>I really like the brushed metal body.</li>
            <li>It cut hair evenly and has not nicked my skin, even in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Removes the hair completely.</li>
            <li>Norelco does it completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough around the manly areas so don&#x27;t worry about that.</li>
            <li>Complete junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The instructions are rather sketchy as far as removal of the shaving foil head.  </li>
            <li>The groomer comes complete with a charging stand and charges the groomer within one hour.  </li>
            <li>The foil side has cut me often in some sensitive places.  </li>
            <li>have an old trimmer (19.00) one that I got at Walmart and am toying with getting another of that brand.  </li>
            <li>Meh.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving end doesnt shave completely at all,</li>
            <li>I think most of the negative feedback regarding this product revolves around the life of the battery.</li>
            <li>if that happens, then this shaver will have far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>...works well for the sensitive parts of your BODY...</li>
            <li>My old razor had an attachment that was about 1/2 the length</li>
            <li>:  The one thing the bodygroom absolutely excels at is its sheer versatility.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning and charging is a breeze, and have had no problems thus far.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not to say grab it and go wild</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any male who wants to trim body hair.</li>
            <li>and I nearly broke</li>
            <li>Before buying this trimmer, I researched reviews, hoping to find one that would not cut me in sensitive places.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen many negative reviews about the charging/battery.</li>
            <li>almost* completely gone, but not as close as a razor and cream.  </li>
            <li>so I was looking for something to remove my natural snuggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>That actually made it work really well today though.</li>
            <li>just pain old</li>
            <li>Mine takes over 12 hours for the green blinking light to go out after usage.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li>Frequently Bought Together</li>
            <li>I do not expect it to perform a shave like my Braun razor, but I would like for it to trim side burns and shape my beard a bit, but both of those tasks are far beyond its capability.  </li>
            <li>Or at least a system that&#x27;s geared more toward function than form.  </li>
            <li>The quality and style of the Norelco far exceeds what you would expect in a Body Groomer.</li>
            <li>Complete loss of words.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my husband who has a very hairy back.</li>
            <li>First we use the trimmer to get rid of the long hair</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>does not shave smoothly or completely like a razor would.</li>
            <li>Works very well for facial hair shaving/trimming and for &#x27;manscaping&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I am a female and I can&#x27;t stand women&#x27;s trimmers - they just pull too much.</li>
            <li>I love the unit, but the stand sucks</li>
            <li>The shaver was much too big and clumsey for her.</li>
            <li>I took it out the box, charged it up and completely shaved everything but my face in under 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>The BG2040 Body Groom Pro does the job but tends to pull hair in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for nearly a year now</li>
            <li>I got this body groomer for my husband because his old one went out after 5 years of service.  </li>
            <li>Buy the replacement head, but don&#x27;t change it too early</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as they make it out to shave.</li>
            <li>For those of us who are very hairy, I&#x27;d recommend just doing some manscaping with clippers with a short guard or no guard with maximum taper.</li>
            <li>For those of us who are very hairy, I&#x27;d recommend just doing some manscaping with clippers with a short guard or no guard with maximum taper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old and suffered through women&#x27;s razors all my life.</li>
            <li>It can be used everywhere and anywhere including your sensitive parts.  </li>
            <li>I received mine a few days ago and have already used it, simply the best thing I ever used to shave my coarse and thick hair without any cuts or bruises.</li>
            <li>My guess is these quality batteries will last much longer than 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The design is very sleek and solid, so I look forward to using this for some time!</li>
            <li>So far I like the body-groom, even though I haven tested all its features.  </li>
            <li>Shaves everything below my waste with no irritation and leaves the skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>battery completely quits 2 years and two months from purchase.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old trimmer with this for use as a beard/stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t make the mistake of leaving it on the charger when not in use, the battery seems to form a memory and will start to lose power near the end of grooming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 20 year old guy, and I&#x27;m Indian.</li>
            <li>And my hair grows back really fast.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s completely bricked, won&#x27;t even charge when plugged in.</li>
            <li>For those of you that are apprehensive about using this device in sensitive areas - don&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li>Fearless body hair grooming, including sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>old.</li>
            <li>Recommended 100% built to last does it&#x27;s job very well and for its price could be considered a steal don&#x27;t think twice</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had it for 8 months.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all about making a fast buck, make a product to last</li>
            <li>but it did feel like it pinched the more delicate areas as per my sweetie&#x27;s critique</li>
            <li>Far below the neck.  </li>
            <li>end first if its too long for the foil side to handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>By far the best.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Purchased in February 2012, and they battery completely died in January 2015, which puts it out of warranty range.</li>
            <li>The unit seems well designed and works well so far.  </li>
            <li>use it sensitive areas between my thighs, under, on the scrotum, between</li>
            <li>And when you think about all the functions this item offers it&#x27;s not overpriced.  </li>
            <li>As the old saying goes, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft after shaving.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use the bottom part without the guard for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>No bite in the sensitive shave areas.</li>
            <li>I had an old razor that I</li>
            <li>but it does not cut you or leave razer burn in your sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;DO NOT USE THIS ANYWHERE ON OR NEAR YOUR BALLS.</li>
            <li>the real problem is that it wouldn&#x27;t sit in its charging station properly so it would never charge.</li>
            <li>Works really fast (only a couple of passes did the trick).</li>
            <li>Maybe my face is just too soft, but never had this problem before.</li>
            <li>However, I do think using the clipper edge with the guard removed is by far the riskiest proposition.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any problems with nicks or cut while trimming sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>The blades are unprotected and touch directly on your skin.  </li>
            <li>also am one to be known to have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I love this manscaping tool, however the battery is beginning to die and only holds a charge for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>It was worth that for the experiment and potential and maybe you want to take a similar gamble</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this shaver is well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>and he started shaving - let&#x27;s just say he looks like a newborn every time he shaves, not to mention his constant need to nick himself more than a few times while shaving.</li>
            <li>this one is heavy, and the silver seems nicer, but the weight means it&#x27;s more likely to slip out of your hands in the shower.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-A tad more expensive than I would have liked; I&#x27;ll forgive that if it continues to perform for a few years</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m portuguese but my hair isn&#x27;t that thick.  </li>
            <li>After one use, I would say, it was good product, but still chest area for men difficult to remove hair.</li>
            <li>If you go slow and are careful you will get good</li>
            <li>While that&#x27;s not a huge problem when trimming facial hair or the hair on your head, it&#x27;s a dicey situation when trimming in the more \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I have been using the original Norelco Bodygroom BG2030 for just about a year and the head finally became so loose that it was no longer usable.</li>
            <li>Third, it goes through the hair quickly and smoothly even if it&#x27;s a little long.      </li>
            <li>that in FOUR different attempts it can&#x27;t even shave two little hairs that a normal razor could easily pick off?</li>
            <li>Also, make sure to keep your skin tight and the foil flat against your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall i am very comfortable using this, and i don&#x27;t have to constantly be carefull not to cut myself as i did with other triming devices.</li>
            <li>I does what it says on the box, much beter than a previous non philips model i had, and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>well, I did since its easier to clean the mess.</li>
            <li>This being my first electric (dry) shaver I can only compare it to the disposable razors that I&#x27;ve been using since I turned legal age.  </li>
            <li>When it was working, a full charge would last a long time!  </li>
            <li>But he says that you should be sure to &amp;#34;stretch out&amp;#34; the boys when going near them with the groomer or else it grabs them in a mean way.</li>
            <li>Would give 5 stars, but the battery doesn&#x27;t seem to stay strong long enough, but then maybe it isn&#x27;t made for daily use as I use it.</li>
            <li>So, naturally, the first thing I did with this razor was try to shave dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts a long time between charges, gives ample warning if low charge, and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>Also my bathroom has no, and I mean no, counter top space</li>
            <li>It is \\&quot;shaft, sack, and starfish\\&quot; safe, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>I love it takes less than 5 mins in the shower (using a shower mirror of course) and gets right down next to the scalp without any irritaions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>read the other reviews, and it is even better than i expected.</li>
            <li>Within a year, after a full day&#x27;s charge the battery lasts for less than 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>And then last week the Comb Guide on the new unit broke and Philips wouldn&#x27;t send me a new guide.</li>
            <li>A little more than I usually drop for a body groomer, but it is definately worth the money.  </li>
            <li>What they do is trim very effectively, without almost any possibility of cutting yourself.     </li>
            <li>After only 1 use, I went back to using my normal hair clippers as the irritation coupled with the 2x time trimming wasn&#x27;t worth it to get such a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It would last long enough most times but had to be constantly charged.  </li>
            <li>Using even more precaution with pre shave oil and the shave gel it cut one part of my shaft raw and the next day had a bunch of bumps..</li>
            <li>I typically use a razor to shave, but I&#x27;ve found I can actually razor shave every other day by banging out a quick shave with the foil end, if I don&#x27;t have an important meeting at work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not gentle by any means and certainly doesn&#x27;t glide over your skin like a normal trimmer.  </li>
            <li>You can take it in the shower no mess, no cord.  </li>
            <li>NO MESS</li>
            <li>Was cautious at first because of how other products left flesh wounds, but after a couple weeks if use, I am confident in the performance of this product and take little time to trim and shave.  </li>
            <li>The groomer portion (as opposed to the trimmer) is very similar to the prior version and if anything actually seems to be slightly less effective.</li>
            <li>The waterproof thing is a gimmick, it doesn&#x27;t cut wet hair very well, so using it in the shower is highly ineffective.  </li>
            <li>a manscraper sounds harsh but it really does the job so very gently.</li>
            <li>i dont trust myself waving a double sided high speed reciprocating blade anywhere near my bunghole.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the trimmer end first, to knock down the high stuff.</li>
            <li>The orange light is supposed to mean that there are 10 minutes left, but ever since I first started using the tool, the trimmer has not run longer than 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well those reviews were right, after just a few times using the buzzer it only holds a charge for about 20 mins and becomes noticeably weaker within the first 5 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li>For such a high price , one would think that Philips /Norelco Company will at least like many other brands ad a small plastic oil lubricator per their own recommendation to lubricate the trimmer before 1st use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You can more or less blindly shove these anywhere and come out ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product it takes care of all my grooming needs in one simple to use device, and  works wet or dry</li>
            <li>OK, let&#x27;s be serious.</li>
            <li>With my old ones I used to get small cuts and they were not so precise.</li>
            <li>I had an older version that finally petered out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m female and it took FOREVER to find a decent groomer.</li>
            <li>After that, short hairs will be guided through the foil holes, and the covered main trimmer will shave your body without any problem.</li>
            <li>I finally gave up and ordered another, choosing the more expensive version in hopes it would last better, but it turned out just to offer an extra type of clipper which is of no use to me.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I am not sure I could go back to shaving my body without it.</li>
            <li>Amazon, this is about the third time you have sold me something that is exactly the opposite of what I asked for in the search</li>
            <li>It works decent enough for your under carriage, but I just prefer to use a safety razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I tried shaving for the first time earlier this year with a standard razor like what ladies use, and I tore myself up.  </li>
            <li>However I have only used this maybe a five six dozen times in the many years I&#x27;ve owned it and barring the first few times used, it could never last long.  </li>
            <li>The charge seems to last a decent amount of time as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to use mainly like a regular electric razor.</li>
            <li>It cuts his body grooming in half with a close quick shave.</li>
            <li>The foil is decent enough that it gets the job done</li>
            <li>I upgraded from the older blue model to this one.</li>
            <li>was ok, but the other side had sharp edges.  </li>
            <li>For those wishing to shave these particular areas, you&#x27;re going to want to stick with the razor blade or standard electric razor head.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe and has guards to protect against nicks -- although, even without the guards, I&#x27;ve found the teeth to be small enough to avoid nicks.</li>
            <li>The machine doesnt almost shawe your body it only cuts a litlle bit of hair ( with the wide part ), its not a bad product but -  for Philips and 2014 technology</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product which makes removing body hair task easy but this body groomer is not very good in that.</li>
            <li>I can shave smooth or use the trimmer to shave down to short stubble.</li>
            <li>But for the last THREE times I&#x27;ve done this, the shaver/trimming head falls off and PLOOP right into the toilet!  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to ensure the battery would last as long as possible, but whenever I took the razor off of the charger, sure enough the red light would flash to indicate the battery was almost dead.  </li>
            <li>This sounded cool, but it hurt a little when I did my chest.  </li>
            <li>As long as you do things their due justice, this shaver should do the job just fine.</li>
            <li>Then switch to the other side for the final clean up.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend purchasing updated version and recycling earlier Norelco Bodygroom device.</li>
            <li>For now though, highly recommended for manscaping and daily use!</li>
            <li>so I figured a regular razor was out so, after seeing the high reviews on the norelco bodygroom</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for shaving in those private areas.</li>
            <li>will give one tip though, on the more sensitive areas I would say be careful and go slow if you are using the shaver side, if you go too fast</li>
            <li>Sent me the new one and a return label to send the old one back.  </li>
            <li>specially since its not a cheap product.</li>
            <li>I wish the clipper head was a little bigger like the shaver side, it takes a while to do larger surfaces, like my BALLS :)    </li>
            <li>Makes manscaping much easier, and whole lot less risky.  </li>
            <li>It works wet or dry, but seems to work better dry as a first step if you wait to long between shearings.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty hairy, and I&#x27;ve struggled with certain areas for most of my life, and this device makes it a little easier to trim up in those tough areas.</li>
            <li>The fine (close shaver) is a little to big for my girlfriend to use.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if there was a little longer length setting, otherwise the battery still holds a charge and it cuts cleanly (I&#x27;ve never had it pull once).</li>
            <li>It took probably 15 minutes the first time, but, long story short, I ended up with a completely shaved netherworld, and it was done without drawing blood or nicking myself.  </li>
            <li>Takes a long time to take hair off of whole body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a few days and no red rash, no bumps just smooth soft skin.  </li>
            <li>The body bare was alright for stubble but would not touch the longer hair and the included clippers with the package I had purchased with it, irritated skin and don&#x27;t even think trying to use any of them in sensitive areas unless you want to have a sex change</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into the head changing (and they usually are really cheaply made).</li>
            <li>the only con so far after two uses is that the foil blade seems to not cut very well, especially in the shower.</li>
            <li>Against bare sensitive skin it can cut you.</li>
            <li>Long battery life, waterproof for shower use, and hasn&#x27;t done much damage yet.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a long time and trims really close.</li>
            <li>It works very well, battery lasts an amazingly long time (I also used this to cut his hair after it started growing out).</li>
            <li>It works really well, and stays charged for a long time.  </li>
            <li>No more Knicks and cuts just smooth.</li>
            <li>Works very well and holds charge for a long time</li>
            <li>I no longer work as a performer, but my hair continues to grow back faster and thicker, so I finally resorted to hair clippers once every couple of months and decided that getting a close shave on my body was more trouble than it was worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have no back hair, my chest hair wasn&#x27;t over grown, my arms were normal compared to a lot of my friends, my legs were probably hairier than some.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;m overreacting since this is my first time shaving my body, but I expected babysmooth skin.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>So, if you try using any setting longer than 1 (the shortest), and you apply normal pressure to your skin, the comb will get pushed back to the shortest setting.  </li>
            <li>Now for the graphic parts, after putting shaving cream where you are going to be working, take the Bodygroomer and just use it like you would a normal razer.</li>
            <li>Superb cut, slick design, battery long enough for cutting full head</li>
            <li>At first, I spent half-hour just to take the blade apart, and I cleaned the sideburns trimmings, which I thought to be the issue.  </li>
            <li>First off, I recieved this product faster than expected and have opned it for a couple months now.  </li>
            <li>It is not as soft and smooth as other more expensive brands</li>
            <li>However, even with a full charge, this trimmer is still not lasting long enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>To put it simple, If I were traveling and had to bring either this or a normal razor, I wouldn&#x27;t depend on this one alone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different products that claim to work better than they actually do.  </li>
            <li>last but not least</li>
            <li>After having used this full body groomer, won&#x27;t be going back to any other brands.  </li>
            <li>Irritation is pretty minimal...</li>
            <li>If your worried that this Norelco won&#x27;t give you a close shave and get all the hair, put all that aside, because this Norelco really does work great at removing the hair in all areas, whether you have thick or thin hair.</li>
            <li>Go slow, keep your skin tight, and you&#x27;ll be good.</li>
            <li>I used it wet and dry to test, and so far dry is better for me.  </li>
            <li>i figure that if I&#x27;m gay, and even I am unable to use a grooming product successfully, then there&#x27;s no hope for all the straight guys out there, and the product&#x27;s gotta be flawed.</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s a very advanced anatomy joke, most of you idiots won&#x27;t get it).</li>
            <li>The other shavers I&#x27;ve tried have not worked as well as shaving, but the Norelco Bodygroom Pro is now my favorite tool for trimming or shaving down there.</li>
            <li>I also found that a little shampoo or body wash facilitated the shaving tremendously.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I have bought ever ,it has tow ways of use one for the small hair and other one for long, you can use it for body shaving or face shaving , very long battery life ,light and thin .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I only have to be clean shaven on average twice a month).  </li>
            <li>and I can only use it for a few minutes on my decidedly fine body hair.</li>
            <li>If you want to trim certain sensitive areas, it works, just be careful.</li>
            <li>at first I was skeptical and I was very scared to use this product in a quick manner, but now I use the trimmer to shave my genitals every 5 days with no worries or cuts or bleeding or bumps.</li>
            <li>The one plus for this shaver is that it has a strong battery which lasts longer and trims hard till it</li>
            <li>I like having as few trimmers as possible and this has pretty much replaced my old beard and hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>Truly amazing trimmer wet or dry, for the body...neck down.  </li>
            <li>or whenever they become dull (you&#x27;ll notice you have to push harder and sweep over areas more frequently with dull blades, and will tend to get more nicks).    </li>
            <li>I use the trimmer end if its longer hair, then i go back over it with the other end to get it super close.</li>
            <li>But few weeks ago the razor just completely refused to charge itself, even when placed correctly with the electrodes touching each other.  </li>
            <li>When I turned the new one on, I was actually startled.  </li>
            <li>I got in my new Philips about 5 weeks after my last trimming session.  </li>
            <li>With all new confidence I could only  suggest every man to Buy it.  </li>
            <li>I got brand new replacement and after another 2 years the same thing happened and it won&#x27;t charge anymore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway second time around they didn&#x27;t give me another replacement of course but they did offer me 15% off a new one.</li>
            <li>A defective brand new BG-2040 underscores my suspicion that the entire line of Philips/Norelco bodygroom shavers are lemons.  </li>
            <li>when i got this nothing on it worked, so i sent it back and got a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick with regular clippers and the new gillette mach razor.  </li>
            <li>And replacing a $5 dollar battery will require you to open the unit and SOLDER on the new battery.</li>
            <li>It has yet to wear out, it keeps the same charge it did as it was new, and I&#x27;ve performed *</li>
            <li>They intentionally crested defects likely for the purpose of getting you to buy a new one.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to do when dry.</li>
            <li>As well as Dry, much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>I tried it both dry and with some shave gel and much prefer shaving with the gel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ladies, be sure to keep your thin, sensitive flower petal parts out of the way, pay attention, and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, the battery last a really long time between charges.  </li>
            <li>I have been trimming my beard hair, head hair, and using the razor to trim my neck for a few months now and the product has worked better than expected.  </li>
            <li>say they did (thanks for that), but it did not work and definitely showed the potential to cause harm.  </li>
            <li>battery didn&#x27;t last long in my case after I followed instructions and had it first charged for 10 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it to shave mainly the pubic area and since I use this machine, the area looks clear without the red spots left by the blade shavers.</li>
            <li>This shaver is really designed for trimmiing up the chest , legs, and back on hairy individuals (trimming being the key word here).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It performed FANTASTIC for those few short weeks though!  </li>
            <li>I have persuaded my hubby to trim a bit more.....and this jewel makes it simple and fast enough that he does not complain about using it.  </li>
            <li>The blades are a micro-factor when it comes to distance between them, only separating enough to really get hair fibers in between them to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The directions for the first charge were followed and he never left it sitting on the charger too long.</li>
            <li>My husband will most likely be returning this item if it is not too late to do so.</li>
            <li>is just a regular ol foil over norelco with blade that pinch and pull long hairs first this no differebt than trimming with clippers then going over your body with an electric foil over</li>
            <li>No fear of nicks in delicate areas and so much better than a razor for the private parts..</li>
            <li>With my old Norelco, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with a few days worth of growth.  </li>
            <li>I bought a male one, even though I am a woman and it is gentle enough and with all the power I wanted.</li>
            <li>if I know I&#x27;m going to be having sex with in the next day or so because nobody wants to take your pants off and your crotch has a punch of red pimples.</li>
            <li>It is good for small touch-ups, like for those small outcroppings of hair on my ear lobes.</li>
            <li>The key with the foil end is to go slow and steady, keeping the skin as smooth as you can.  </li>
            <li>I just put it on the charger and quick charge it for a few minutes</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, but you need to shave same place some times to get a better finish, some times really annoying thing.</li>
            <li>It is long enough to be able to reach over your back and get all areas, which other groomers could not accomplish.</li>
            <li>I was using one of those Wahl haircut clipper sets for my \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; for years and would get the occasional cut here and there and sometimes in very sensitive areas</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to be able to make yourself spic-and-span from the neck down if you&#x27;re quite hairy from the neck down.</li>
            <li>But, I can confirm that battery life is a major issue.  </li>
            <li>Also, the other tends to aggressively pull hairs which can be discomforting at first.  </li>
            <li>I can usually go 3-5 complete trims before the red light will start flashing.  </li>
            <li>major concern of mine was getting cut by this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a major improvement over my use of the pop-up groomer on my face shaver as a body groomer.  </li>
            <li>You often have to go over the same area multiple times as the first pass is not enough.  </li>
            <li>This thing gives me rashes like no other.</li>
            <li>i just forget this &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; side and used the trimming side, which is also a joke.. its small and do the same job as any hair cut machine (but the haircut machine does a better job, because its bigger, so do it faster and saves ur time)  </li>
            <li>Summary: first 2 years heaven; 3rd year, starting running short</li>
            <li>no other product I have tried had work as well as this one.  </li>
            <li>Using since 2011, still working without any major issues</li>
            <li>Only Two Years Old now kaput.!</li>
            <li>And also the blades are not sharp I guess.</li>
            <li>Keeps me nicely trimmed so this Florida humidity doesn&#x27;t get me looking like a couple of round, red fire engines down below... if you get my meaning.</li>
            <li>The previous models slid right into their charging docks and stayed there, no problem.</li>
            <li>The Body Groom Pro is a solid trimmer, the weight and solid feel are just right for long trimming and grooming sessions.</li>
            <li>I notice I feel much fresher and cleaner and can dry off from a shower quicker too!</li>
            <li>The unit comes with a charging stand and small cleaning brush to help clean out any excess hair that gets stuck within it.  </li>
            <li>I received it, there was enough of a charge to give it a test drive, although the low battery indicator light was flashing about half way through.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One complaint would be that it&#x27;s easy to turn it off while using simply because the on/off switch is where you would naturally grip it.  </li>
            <li>That includes shave cream and blades, 2 other brands of electric-Mangroomer and Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Having sensitive skin this product is much smoother causing almost no skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I liked the previous model, but it broke on me after only a few months where the head attaches.</li>
            <li>to use and clean, 5 different lenghts so you can start with the longest and work down to desired hair length!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and cuts hair quickly but not the one I am looking for as It needs concentration when shaving private areas and may cause cuts and irritations if you do not stretch your skin, I am still looking for a gentle machine for such sensitive parts, starching sometime is impossible in some areas.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re smart and careful you&#x27;ll never get nicked.</li>
            <li>You still gotta be smart and be careful and take your time.</li>
            <li>You still have to be careful in certain areas.</li>
            <li>It made quick work of my Sasquatch back hair, and was long enough that I could reach all areas of my back without assistance from the wife.</li>
            <li>However, with my thick hair it comes back pretty quick and isn&#x27;t the smoothest the next day.</li>
            <li>With patience and a little skill, this product is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>wish I would have saved the trouble and frustration and gotten it in the first place!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the stand as it seems a little rocky but it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems.</li>
            <li>I used it almost daily and leave it in the shower and abuse it, so 7 years seems like a decent amount of time for it to last.  </li>
            <li>and I can get to tough to reach areas better.</li>
            <li>Felt very subtle pinch kinda feeling at first with the shaver but got used to it - not painful.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to pressure it against my skin and more importantly, no bites!!!  </li>
            <li>I used to have one of those with the vacuum function and at least that was good for preventing a mess on the sink.  </li>
            <li>Now, I would HIGHLY recommend using some sort of lather such as a shaving cream for doing the actual grooming.</li>
            <li>If you get it at a decent price, it&#x27;s decent, especially since it charges so quickly, and the LED takes away the guessing game...</li>
            <li>It seems to me, though, that the trimmer head is a little too wide to be able to line up properly with areas in the groin.</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s been 2 days since my last shower, and I still actually feel kinda clean down there.</li>
            <li>but this is versatile, water resistant and sharp without any nicks on the nooks and the battery holds a super long charge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that now it will basically last long enough to take care of the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas, and a little more -- say chest and/or stomach.</li>
            <li>The other side being more contained and smaller, has less friction thus lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Im a Believer&#x27;, and other positive reviews I decided to place my hopes on this body grommer for men.</li>
            <li>It works just like the other positive reviews state.</li>
            <li>I mean, if you take off the top few layers of skin, the hair will certainly go with it,</li>
            <li>the trimmer is great but the shaver is bad and the body groomer doesnt function correctly</li>
            <li>so I assume it does not operate on the general AA or AAA    </li>
            <li>For someone with thinner hair (think blondies generally), this should be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been a hassle to groom in general.</li>
            <li>Works well when using it to even out sideburns, and touch up hair in general.</li>
            <li>Such a huge difference and my last trimmer was not cheap.</li>
            <li>(you can bend it back if you do accidentally bend it, as long as you&#x27;re gentle).</li>
            <li>This item is really convenient as it can cut long or short hair and it has a lot of power as well.</li>
            <li>To be clear, I have only used this product four times at this time of this writing.  </li>
            <li>After nearly three years of use the batteries finally gave out and I decided to try replacing them.</li>
            <li>This was a conscious choice on their behalf as it was a standard battery holder, just with custom contacts.</li>
            <li>The Remington reduced your beard to a bare stubble.</li>
            <li>The Remington reduced your beard to a bare stubble.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s been a complete letdown.  </li>
            <li>next put in a sensitive shave gel.</li>
            <li>Second, you can truly use the shaver head on sensitive area&#x27;s without worrying about getting nicked.  </li>
            <li>Recently its completely stopped holding a charge.  </li>
            <li>this will let you get an almost bare skin look if you spend the time on it</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no regrets.</li>
            <li>I left the unit on to complete discharge.  </li>
            <li>I followed all the instruction as far as battery care went and leaving it unplugged and all that, but it still just doesn&#x27;t hold a charge properly anymore.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very versatile groomer; you just have to be careful:</li>
            <li>The hair grows back soft and does not cause loads of irritation like a razor would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never go back to doing it the old way.  </li>
            <li>Definitely something i would recommend getting if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So well, in fact, that I actually trimmed the hair far shorter than I meant to.</li>
            <li>I like to keep myself trim, and for years I&#x27;ve been using my old Remington beard trimmer to also trim my legs so that they don&#x27;t look like a human forest.  </li>
            <li>Charge lasts much longer then I expected.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>The GIANT gash in an incredibly sensitive area on my body, courtesy of using the shaving end.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use the trimmer I suppose, but I&#x27;m going back to other methods (a regular razor is better) for other grooming.</li>
            <li>Been using the bodygroomer for over a year and so far it&#x27;s made my hair related tasks</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin...and no red bumps from the use of this shaver.</li>
            <li>This thing has done everything that I wanted it too, especially on the sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I barely use it anymore.</li>
            <li>The green charging light doesn&#x27;t come on, and when I turn the shaver on, it only lasts for a second.</li>
            <li>The green charging light doesn&#x27;t come on, and when I turn the shaver on, it only lasts for a second.</li>
            <li>They both perform very well although the shaver should be used carefully, or it may hurt.</li>
            <li>and I mainly use it dry.</li>
            <li>but you do have to go over the area multiple times in some cases to completely shave the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When shaving the &amp;#34;boys&amp;#34;, this thing will bite you if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t hold its charge so I can barely get 5-10 mins out of it before it shuts off.</li>
            <li>You really have to let your hair grow for like 3 days for it to be that noticeably rough downthere...</li>
            <li>The shaver has not ONCE nicked his sensitive skin and the trimmer gives him the option of keeping his beard at different lengths.</li>
            <li>still old school when it comes to removing facial hair</li>
            <li>comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;It still pinches your ball-sack if you are not careful but that is a risk</li>
            <li>So I  placed it back in the Handle Charger properly to try to recharge itself, NO blinking green light.</li>
            <li>BUT apparently Philips doesn&#x27;t make replacement blades?????</li>
            <li>Experience far above expectations.</li>
            <li>It can cut through softer skin if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only charged this once when I took it out of the box</li>
            <li>Definitely not the shaver you wanna use on your sensitive parts of body like armpit, pubic etc.</li>
            <li>The only two cautions I have are that you must use the cradle for charging because the groomer itself cannot be connected directly to the charger.  </li>
            <li>batteries are NiMH and, according to Philips&#x27; FAQ, should be charged when nearly (not completely) empty for the longest life.</li>
            <li>My last one (a beard trimmer) stopped charging after a few years of occasional use, probably because it had cheap NiCad batteries in it.  </li>
            <li>assuming i wasnt careful enough the first time (even though in my heart i knew i was)</li>
            <li>This is my first time reviewing and i am only doing it because i expected a lot from this product.    </li>
            <li>Although its not made for use on the face I sometimes use it to trim facial hair short before using a normal razor.</li>
            <li>I bought a pretty pink bikini trimmer, buying into the promise that it was made with my female needs in mind.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to use on areas that are flatter (chest and abs) than rounder, just like a normal razor -- but still works very nicely on uneven areas.  </li>
            <li>It works OK, but is unnecessary IMO.</li>
            <li>Thus, they take up more space and can be irritating to keep organized.</li>
            <li>The clippers on the shaver side adjust but are more aggressive which can cause burns - something I never experienced with the 2020.</li>
            <li>works OK, but not great.</li>
            <li>As I said, it is able to get the job done, but at the expense of irritating you from time to time.</li>
            <li>Dont get me wrong, the shaver is nice, but I guess a was hoping for a miracle shaver...</li>
            <li>ladies don&#x27;t want you all hairy down there, more than you want THEM all hairy down there!</li>
            <li>My battery on a full charge lasts no more than 6 or 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Not great for body parts with hair routes that change a lot (facial hair) or uneven surfaces (some head shapes) but great for the body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reviewing the most expensive Bodygroom because you really need to understand something before you plunk down this much cash:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it pulls a little bit more than the previous model</li>
            <li>, also I let my nether region grow out for a long time to full length, because the girlfriend doesn&#x27;t like it bald down there</li>
            <li>( first shut down )</li>
            <li>was the first question I asked myself after using it  down there.  </li>
            <li>If you have the amazon jungle down there use the trimmer first then finish it</li>
            <li>This groomer makes it easy to get clean down there, and makes the experience much less painful, not to mention the results are much better.</li>
            <li>By mate, I mean somebody that is consensually willing to be physically intimate with me.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first, but I decided to spend a little more than I am comfortable and it has paid off.</li>
            <li>Not a single nick or cut!</li>
            <li>have tried about every type of hair removal you can try from home.&lt;br /&gt;-Nair and other hair removal creams work, but can irritate your skin and give chemical burns in certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;-Shaving</li>
            <li>Instead of the typical Norelco lay-out of 2 or 3 round heads, it uses a slim cylindrical head more often seen in Braun or Panasonic products.</li>
            <li>, you will notice that initially you&#x27;ll experience a few split seconds of mild pain as all the hair gets pulled around.  </li>
            <li>Sure it misses a few hairs now and then but other groomers miss entire patches no matter how often you go over them.</li>
            <li>Finally after about 6 months the second one really started to work slow and barely take a charge before it broke completely and just got hot when put on the charger.  </li>
            <li>first, then shave -do not push down hard -clean</li>
            <li>The trimmers on top are small, don&#x27;t stick out far, and are not really designed to do an amazing job cutting all your hair off.</li>
            <li>The light blinks green when charging and is a steady green when fully charged.  </li>
            <li>I nicked the pumpkins 2-4 times in the first half year of usage.</li>
            <li>I previously had bought the 1st generation of the bodygroom when it first came out.</li>
            <li>A stark comparison from the original Bodygroom which held the charge well and for the long haul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My initial plan was to just clean up my usual trim job</li>
            <li>It just takes such a long time till you get a decent job done.</li>
            <li>so I have a decent amount of hair on myself and its pretty thick as well,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Those are my only real complaints and relative minor ones at that.  </li>
            <li>I have attempted to use on chest and stomach---results are not consistent across the areas trimmed, armpits--works very well,</li>
            <li>Shaving other areas like in between the legs, chest and armpits is absolutely painless.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-It seems to have a much stronger/faster set of motors than any other I&#x27;ve used&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it really did shave closer than any other trimmer/shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>i love it, it is a little bit heavy.</li>
            <li>Well all of that changed some how because the heads are not the same as from the very first one I bought because the replacement heads and the head that comes with it when you be a new device are mean they hurt</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for dry use and works as it should even below the belt (not big on personal &amp;#34;bird nest&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it still has at the very least another year of life left.</li>
            <li>The BodyGroom Pro left a slight amount of razor burn in the form of raised bumps that show up a little bit when I shower, but it&#x27;s much more manageable than before.  </li>
            <li>The low rating is due to a battery that will only hold about 3 minutes worth of charge after only a year of use.</li>
            <li>Love the new design and not having the removable heads which was where the last item failed.</li>
            <li>Removal battery, seems like a great idea, especially if it goes bad</li>
            <li>But, since the good reviews far outweighed the bad ones, I decided to go ahead.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sit in its stand very well and the whole device has a shoddy build quality to it, compared to my Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut myself multiple times with it no matter how gentle or careful I am.  </li>
            <li>After I got it, it actually sat in the package for nearly a week before I tried it on various areas.</li>
            <li>Now if the Norelco engineers can just figure out how I can trim the center of my back without help, they will really be onto something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Painless, fast, no redness, can wet and you can use in your entire body (except head).</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I can only just barely get between my shoulder blades with my reach and flexibility--but barely means it does.  </li>
            <li>I would not advise to use it near male private parts unless you want to bleed.</li>
            <li>and after all the different products: waxing, hair removel lotions, different types of electric shaver, razors, this groomer by far does the job.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of different clippers and trimmers and they all have batteries that can be left charging without completely dying.</li>
            <li>But, some people might expect electronics to last far longer, and assume this will be the last body shaver they purchase in their lifetime.</li>
            <li>The most vulnerable and risky part to shave is the part of the sack directly on and below the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Always shave against the direction the hairs</li>
            <li>Save yourself the suffering of it growing back, especially if you have sensitive skin; this thing will give you razorburn like you&#x27;ve never had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Save yourself the suffering of it growing back, especially if you have sensitive skin; this thing will give you razorburn like you&#x27;ve never had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it has a few minor flaws that kept me from giving it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned before actually hair cutting performance is good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d expect a shaver that wasn&#x27;t capable of providing a close shave to be relatively safe for avoiding cutting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as complicated to own as others make it out to be if you actually READ the instructions and DON&#x27;T always leave it on the charger as the instructions tell you not to do because that will kill the battery!</li>
            <li>This thing worked ok (not great) when it actually charged but</li>
            <li>This shaver is excellent for shaving all areas, but not a true BODY groomer since it is nearly impossible to get your entire back without being a yoga expert!  </li>
            <li>so the razor will slide down past the appropriate position to be charged.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night down to the belly --</li>
            <li>It is excellent for anything below the neck;  you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li>For under sixty bucks its a great deal compared to the rest with there weak construction too many attachments biting nicking pulling crap.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I was a little hesitant, but once I started, things went</li>
            <li>Why include that when the other side of shaver includes exact same thing as you can remove the plastic part and have a very short trimmer.</li>
            <li>price is a little on the higher side for a groomer</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my second one, the first lasting two years, rechargeable batteries don&#x27;t come with a lifetime warranty on any product  - be sure to replace the foil head and cutting blades every six months to avoid razor burn or hair pulling (ouch)</li>
            <li>Its not a good enough razor that it will replace your normal face razor, but it will work in a pinch and works very well for the normal use of shaving below the neck..</li>
            <li>I usually give it a full charge every few weeks, letting the battery run pretty low before charging.</li>
            <li>You can use the adjustable trim guard to leave a lot or a little or use the other end and be completely smooth.</li>
            <li>, I now trust this blade to be able to fully bring any hair on my body down to smooth skin while having a low risk of cutting</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaver angle - I may just have never gotten used to using the shaver portion properly, but it seems like I have trouble getting either of the trimmers at the right angle.</li>
            <li>If you want absolutely no stubble in any direction - baby&#x27;s butt smooth, it falls a little short.  </li>
            <li>You do have to be careful as the fine trimmer edges on the shaver side for longer hairs can and will catch loose sensitive skin which I have done a few times.</li>
            <li>Manscaping can be a delicate &amp; downright controversial subject.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a heterosexual male, so I had no previous knowledge or experience using such a product, but everything worked out well.</li>
            <li>Seriously, just using the side trimmers by the blade (and not the actual shaver) does a SUPER job!</li>
            <li>Maybe mine was defective (considering all the rave reviews here), but this product hurt so bad I wasn&#x27;t able to use it for more than a few seconds at a time, while shaving my head.  </li>
            <li>I have actually cut my leg along the bikini line while jsut doing general maintenance.</li>
            <li>This allows for with or against-the-grain shaving that generally clears all of the hair in one pass, and without the need to use two different tools to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>though it did not catch or cut my skin, it did cause some minor irritation, but this can be fixed with moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li>There is no excuse for hard-to-open plastic packaging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is actually a situation where the few extra dollars are totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it was worth the ~$90.00</li>
            <li>first use a few minutes ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>used the shaving head a few times and cut myself with it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I got a few cuts.</li>
            <li>He said it worked well for the first few months.</li>
            <li>First one of these I owned lasted about 3 years which seemed satisfactory for heavy use.  </li>
            <li>A little on the high side as far as price, however once you use it</li>
            <li>It works well with the private parts as long as you are very careful down there, but who isn&#x27;t careful with their own private parts.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I was initially reluctant about using this groomer on certain areas of my body, especially since I had never used a foil shaver even on my face.  </li>
            <li>And if I could tape or glue the stupid head to it but be able to clean it well to keep it from falling off all the time, I WOULD.</li>
            <li>What is too long with this was not too long with older Norelco models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Straight down to the skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really does work under the shower without rusting, without slowing down or losing any effectiveness.</li>
            <li>It really gets things under control \\&quot;down</li>
            <li>Even before I cut myself, I felt very uneasy having this groomer down there, and you might feel that way, too.</li>
            <li>No matter how long or short it charges for, the trimming side always has very little battery power and the yellow light</li>
            <li>The battery lasts long enough - at least 25 minutes of shaving - and charges very quickly.</li>
            <li>Got all the body hair off although left a little stubble on chest first time.</li>
            <li>There are other decent trimmers out there by companies like Wahl.</li>
            <li>It would last a few weeks (5-6 full trims) on a single charge.</li>
            <li>It is a little scary to use until you get used to it, but the adjustable shaver is great - no losing attachments, and like I said, the other end on your sensitive bits just takes some time to learn.  </li>
            <li>The other end has a guard but it set to high for trimming hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased another one in Amazon and is great but when using it suddenly stops, and I press the button again and runs for 3 seconds and stops again &#x3D;/</li>
            <li>once again great shaver, just for me... didn&#x27;t last :(.</li>
            <li>This review is not to say this might not work for those with much thinner, or much less body hair.</li>
            <li>This review is not to say this might not work for those with much thinner, or much less body hair.</li>
            <li>I had the Philips Norelco BG2030 Professional Body Grooming System in the past and you could go to town with it using it on and around the whole butcher shop without fear</li>
            <li>I never expected it to get as close as a regular razor, but I had hoped that it would get close enough for me which it didnt.</li>
            <li>If you are not careful, while shaving private area, you will touch skin with the edge trimmer and encounter massive pain.</li>
            <li>Used a few times over the past week and a half to try and get used to it, and I must say the engineers at Philips really made a safe piece here.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a manual razor with some success, but it takes so long and was harsh to my skin in some areas.</li>
            <li>What I like to do is trim all my body, quickly, a couple times while standing in the shower, then turn on the water, take a shower, and slowly use the foil to shave.</li>
            <li>With this one, I have to go super slow</li>
            <li>At first I was a little reluctant to like this shaver but after using it for a few weeks I really have come to like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first trim the hair down if too long, then use the shaver to do the rest.</li>
            <li>For so long I&#x27;ve been struggling to trim and shave my boys (down there ;))</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get taken, there are plenty of other products on amazon that do this job and actually last a decent period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is, check the foil in case it has any dents, this could almost inevitably cause harm, and make sure NOT to push down hard while shaving.</li>
            <li>The build quality of the unit is nice, but apparently you&#x27;re not supposed to leave it on the charger 24/7, which makes it inconvenient for occasional use</li>
            <li>I replaced a $30 earlier model (first version) that I purchased a few years back.</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed it died, as this was absolutely perfect when it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, you can feel slight stubble if you rub the shaved area with your hand in the opposite direction of which the hair grows, but it&#x27;s nothing you can see or really notice.</li>
            <li>I really like that you can use this wet or dry, too.</li>
            <li>I had about half inch long hair on my chest that I had to first trim before the the thing would shave it.  </li>
            <li>The swivel head works very well for any shaving in tight spaces.</li>
            <li>It does scratch the skin (although this is minimal, and might only feel it in very sensitive skin areas)&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, my positive experience with the old Body Groom was why I chose to ignore the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li>The only thing keeping this from getting a 5 from me is that fact that it&#x27;s large size makes it a little cumbersome.  </li>
            <li>not a good clean shave on any part of the body.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re afraid that your soft skin (Im an easy bleeder) will not tolerate an electric snipper, you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>They all use the same foil unit and the fixed head might actually be easier to use, particularly dry.</li>
            <li>The self-contained comb works well and is a vast improvement over separate combs for each length on prior versions of this device that could easily be lost or broken when snapping them on and off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still not comfortable doing that without thought and attention paid while focused on certain areas.  </li>
            <li>One thing a little unusual is that the instructions state that the shaver should NOT be charged after each use.  </li>
            <li>By the time you&#x27;ve done that, hopefully your landing gear will be up due to the cold air on them, the skin is tight, and you can have an easy and safe shave.</li>
            <li>I put off my trimming for a couple of weeks in search of a new groomer, due to</li>
            <li>As a cyclist I mainly purchased this to shave my legs for which it does an above average job.</li>
            <li>I got this product mainly for manscaping down there.</li>
            <li>YES, this product was purchased mainly for the bush down south....</li>
            <li>Somehow, no matter whether I prep the area to be shaved by leaving it as, pulling it tight, or anywhere in between, the foil manages to create the sensation that the skin is being pinched in that area hundreds of times per second, and ultimately the friction and pinching result in cuts to my skin, blood, pain, buyer&#x27;s remorse, resistance of the urge to break the product in half and burn it in occult celebration, and longing for the original Body Groom that I threw away when I bought this one (although not necessarily in that order).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually use a non-electric razor and cream, and after being nicked one too many times, and having my skin feel raw after using it, I went back to the low-tech version.</li>
            <li>It works great and is waterproof so don&#x27;t be afraid to get a little</li>
            <li>Overall a little pricey for what I really needed or use it for</li>
            <li>This product had a very high rating and based on a few reviews, I purchased it.</li>
            <li>But with the new one, It feels very rough after grooming and feels like</li>
            <li>It can be a little difficult to shave some parts, but overall it does a good job of what it advertises.</li>
            <li>(though I&#x27;m amazed the tech hasn&#x27;t advanced much since we shaved with sharpened knives) and is well-shaped; however, the charger is un-necessarily large, fiddly and non-secure, and the battery life is awful by modern standards.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad trimmer once the blade wears down a little bit.  </li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend this product to all men that want to groom themselves down there, on chest no problems on with nicking the nips or just your face</li>
            <li>I have high expectations, and I believe I won&#x27;t be let down.  </li>
            <li>there is also a larger ridge than the multigroom, which makes it hard to get into the intimate crevices, and leads to some unexpected bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I thought the handle to be cumbersome but after using the product it actually is an advantage having the large handle because it helps to reach those odd and hard to reach areas of your body.</li>
            <li>Terribly stupid design flaw in an otherwise great</li>
            <li>Nothing good or bad about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good and bad thing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as closely as I would like, and the teeth-like part edges of the razor is almost painful in more sensitive areas.</li>

            <li> body groomer is excellent and is great for downstairs like everyone on here</li>
            <li> May not be ideal for those with thick/coarse hair.</li>

            <li> I bought this because lady shavers aren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> The product itself does a great job.</li>
            <li> The idea is great</li>
            <li> The adjustable length setting is great, and doesn&#x27;t slip like</li>
            <li> It was great while it worked ,  it stop working  </li>
            <li> then that works great</li>
            <li> But, looks aren&#x27;t what make this a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is a sturdy, great product that does the job.  </li>
            <li> The holder is not so great.</li>
            <li> I am happy that I did my research and read all the reviews....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> great idea</li>
            <li> This groomer is great in that it gives you a sense of safety.</li>
            <li> Ergonomically it is not so great either</li>
            <li> Great while it works, but none of three product I had lasted a year.   </li>
            <li> The trimmer part with adjustable comb length is great also.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job removing hair from places you don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> It also works really great</li>
            <li> Great price, delivery and product.</li>
            <li> this is a great trimmer to do &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; below the belt.</li>

            <li> This does a great job at trimming those \\&quot;special\\&quot; areas</li>
            <li> a ape lol     </li>
            <li> lol.....    </li>
            <li> This unit is also replacing a trimmer, and for that it does a really great job.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> I bet it&#x27;ll do a great job.</li>
            <li> This does a great job.</li>
            <li> It would be great if you could shave your face.</li>
            <li> However, for body hair, the shaver works great.</li>
            <li> and I experienced all of the pain and torture involved with the use of each one.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job all over.  </li>
            <li> Works great for getting a &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; cut on your tender areas but if you want it &amp;#34;razor smooth&amp;#34; you will still have to use a razor.</li>
            <li> It is designed for the body and it works great for keeping myself trim in areas all the areas that I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the great performance of the shaver, I commend Philips on the design.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of shaving those &amp;#34;private areas.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Sleek handle, great grip.</li>
            <li> If Philips Norelco lost the the trimmer blades or made them fully retractable this product would be GREAT.</li>
            <li> This works as a great trimmer, great close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that I now know what it feels like to be hairless.  </li>
            <li> Great product, pole, pouch, and starfish approved.</li>
            <li> But because I was so happy with the BG 2020, I took the dive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The lower pubic region head does an ok job wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the power it had, and I trim often</li>
            <li> this is really handy and works well!</li>
            <li> And for all that, where/when i was able to get it to work its best</li>
            <li> looks really good and the controls are great -</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS, best I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> This thing does a great job of shaving fairly close....but not close.  </li>
            <li> I used to always look for the latest and greatest in this area...</li>
            <li> Ore excellent presence and work better Mmatoukat</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good razer, holds a charge, works well in the shower and does a great job with my manscaping</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for the trimmer, which works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Guys this is the best shaver for the scrotum area, without the worry of knickin the nuts:)</li>
            <li> Excellent, priced fairly, wonderful product, exactly as described,  zero misrepresentation....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it many times, used it both in and out of the shower, and it has held up great!</li>
            <li> bought this product about 2 weeks ago specifically for my groin area and more, and it trims perfectly.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works on all parts of the body without pinching, in all directions, and leaves a nice stubble length trim (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re shooting for!)</li>
            <li> I used to use a pair of scissors and disposable razors to keep my underarms and nether regions \\&quot;hair-free\\&quot; and in the process had experienced my fair share of cuts, burns and frustration.</li>
            <li> shape is great to hold and the pivoting head can navigate through the treacherous regions like a good 4WD off road vehicle.</li>
            <li> Design is perfect and the performance is top notch.</li>
            <li> I thought the trimmer worked most excellent, but I would advise taking the time to trim longer body hair with scissors before using the trimmer on this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many trimmers in the quest for an excellent trimmer I can rely upon.</li>
            <li> I read many of the glowing reviews here, and decided to drop the cash and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> you need to trim in the nether regions, and want to make sure you the process is pain-free, this is the best one out there that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The aluminum body is a nice touch!</li>
            <li> for this price it is best deal. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried many groomers and this the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This should be called the bikini area deluxe trimmer and shaver!  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband he uses the manscaping side for just that and the beard trimmer too nice to have it all in one!</li>
            <li> ok it works perfectly all over.</li>
            <li> The one plus is they look good on my bathroom counter, design is very nice looking.</li>
            <li> It shaves perfectly and well, charges nicely on the handy charger stand, and also has convenient trimmer choices.</li>
            <li> Great buy, quick shipping !!!</li>
            <li> Now it is doing a great job very pleased with this shaver</li>
            <li> Very elegantly designed and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Cool design, excellent quality and works great.  </li>
            <li> Easily the best electric razor on the market.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am impressed by the design and quality of this product and can easily recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product, As easy as 1-2-3!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this excellent trimmer made the process easy, painless, and my life didn&#x27;t flash before my eyes in terror while using it.  </li>
            <li> It is easy the best razer that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Getting rid of body hair is easy on the skin and the result is superb.</li>
            <li> Is easy to handle and works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the design is perfect and easy for use .</li>
            <li> Works perfectly as described ands is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is perfect, it has 5 lengths, but I think it is plastic maiden, and I think it might break easily.</li>
            <li> This is great because you can use it in so many ways!</li>
            <li> This product looks very good and the razor shown at the bottom of the photograph works ok...</li>
            <li> Very good no nasty skin abrasions</li>
            <li> * The&#x27;ve used in all (really all) parts of the body where hair out and offered me the best result, very good.</li>

            <li> Great shave, amazing battery life</li>
            <li> This thing is great, and the battery life is amazing.</li>
            <li> Thier really good quality machines.</li>
            <li> Really good product.</li>
            <li> I researched this item for months, bought it, loved it,</li>
            <li> It took a couple days before it stared to to do a good job.</li>
            <li> I knew that wasn&#x27;t a good idea.  </li>
            <li> It may take a bit longer this way but you are insured a good result.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll dispense with the pro forma encomiums of praise for this gadget&#x27;s grooming properties: they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Reviews were really good</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a good 50 minutes.</li>
            <li> does not shave any part of your body good.</li>
            <li> all it is good for is shaving your arms &amp; legs a bit closer.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been good.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable guard is good quality (stays locked in at desired length, isn&#x27;t too flimsy)  2)</li>
            <li> Npt that good - might be good for the balls</li>
            <li> good product.  </li>
            <li> but i think that can be a good thing.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of good review i decided to order this.  </li>
            <li> it worked well, I loved it.</li>
            <li> Its a really good system.</li>
            <li> Once you figure out that perfect angle it works great, nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Good for trips.</li>
            <li> Has some good heft to it</li>
            <li> and you can tell its of good build quality.  </li>
            <li> I cant complain about this product, it works really good</li>
            <li> performance and battery life are really good.</li>
            <li> The guard is plastic, but it seems to be of good quality, and I don&#x27;t see it ever</li>
            <li> One end is good for giving a close shave.</li>
            <li> electric razor is good.  </li>
            <li> So awesome that my armpit is so smooth like I shaved with a razor.  </li>
            <li> your all good.</li>
            <li> The battery life is good.</li>
            <li> Still a good unit.</li>
            <li> and battery life it good too.  </li>
            <li> But to be fair, it is advertised as a body trimmer and not a beard trimmer, so</li>
            <li> i would recomend it to anyone who is looling for a good men&#x27;s body groomer</li>
            <li> The razor work good though I don&#x27;t care for the swivel head because it folds over when you use it.</li>
            <li> Its good if you don&#x27;t have these.  </li>
            <li> Still a good product.</li>
            <li> every good thing said was truth.</li>
            <li> Manual shaving works good</li>
            <li> /&gt;The adjustable clipper works without nicking, and has a good selection of trim lengths.  </li>
            <li> Good.....</li>
            <li> a good product</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s usually a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I found out that I did not charge it, I was amazed on how good it worked.</li>
            <li> Loved it for the 5 months of battery life it offered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple times now and it seems well built and works good.  </li>
            <li> so there was no razor that was going me anywhere close to a good shave without pulling and hurting.</li>
            <li> I threw away a perfectly good unit.  </li>
            <li> Good tool for grooming.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> The battery is also superior.</li>
            <li> Keeps good charge...</li>
            <li> Fairly inexpensive in the range.&lt;br /&gt;Design.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> which was surprising.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a good choice.</li>
            <li> It works as stated and is a good quality shaver.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the reviews had me</li>
            <li> a good concept</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for some time now and gotten good use out of it.  </li>
            <li> The handle is nice and sturdy and shaving head works great.</li>
            <li> Which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I can use with shaving cream, in the shower, I can use it without water and it still shaves good.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s a fair reason for a one star review.</li>
            <li> exception to a shortened battery life (I have to recharge before use), it still operates and looks as good as the day I received it.</li>
            <li> We appreciate quality products at fair prices.</li>
            <li> We appreciate quality products at fair prices.</li>
            <li> Good looking practical well constructed Trimmer/shaver.</li>
            <li> It does a good job</li>
            <li> Really good bodygroom</li>
            <li> I do like the trimmer side much better, great for touching up the eyebrows and &#x27;stache, just not as impressed with the shaver as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> but the guide is too rounded to get hairs to stand up for a good cut.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s always a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Good luck to those deciding</li>
            <li> Good charge, design results.</li>
            <li> It has a good nonslip grip, that works well even in the shower.</li>
            <li> Shaves good and the pros end there.</li>
            <li> Does EVERYTHING a good groomer should do and then some.</li>
            <li> Good battery.</li>
            <li> well and good,</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband and he loved it</li>
            <li> This product is just as good for women.</li>
            <li> Cuts fairly close as well.</li>
            <li> Good buy</li>
            <li> buy the optimum one compare to your budget, quality, brand, life time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you can set the length from zero to 5, which allows you to cut your hair and mantain your beard looking good without removing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good product</li>
            <li> The was a good investment.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery lasts for a good 1/2 hour of trimming&lt;br</li>
            <li> good battery</li>
            <li> The good side for this item is it&#x27;s battery powered and works in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer available for trimming those &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas.</li>
            <li> ITS that good.</li>
            <li> The battery life is good, and the trimmer works well.</li>
            <li> all accompanied by that wonderful whirring sound to let you know that it is indeed powered up and that you are not just imagining that you turned it</li>
            <li> When it is charged, it works fairly well</li>
            <li> The shaver is good....</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it is as good as using the Braun shaver I had been using.</li>
            <li> this works good.</li>
            <li> Good for travel or keeping at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loved</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will never buy another Remington smooth and silky or Phillips bikini perfect.</li>
            <li> , it is as good an option you can find out there at this price.    </li>
            <li> Good battery life.</li>
            <li> It is a good shaver when it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> SAVES MONEY DOES A GOOD JOB</li>
            <li> The fact that you can use it in the shower makes it even more ideal.</li>
            <li> The foul side is working as good as ever.</li>
            <li> Anyway the trimming is really smooth and the results are excellent with no irritations at all.</li>
            <li> Good razor, versatile.</li>
            <li> It has a good battery charge and has done anything I&#x27;ve asked of it with regards to hair maintenance.</li>
            <li> Works good not going to sugar coat anything i bought this as to trim my pubic area.</li>
            <li> all I think it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good body groomer that could also function as a shaver.</li>
            <li> This tool is so handy, sturdy, and attractive.  </li>
            <li> I have, however, garnered a good sense of it&#x27;s capabilities and drawbacks.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It does a good job getting all the hair, but as you &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; it over your skin, the hair it is shaving sort of collects under the buzzer and then causes the blade to start nicking your skin a bit.  </li>
            <li> This body groomer does a good job.  </li>
            <li> There is a market for a good bodygroomer</li>
            <li> If you shave every day, this is a good tool to use, as it gets a good close shave.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t review this item per say, because there are some good reviews preview to mine.</li>
            <li> This product is really good..</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> you shaved it with a razor, thats how good of a shave</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge fairly well and is convenient to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> a good body groomer.</li>
            <li> when i read the reviews, i thought it was to good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is good.  </li>
            <li> -in-all a good groomer.</li>
            <li> good deal, but can&#x27;t shave close</li>
            <li> Good trimmed and groomer</li>
            <li> Hits all areas good.</li>
            <li> loved it .</li>
            <li> Not a close shave but good</li>
            <li> BEWARE of those good reviews.</li>
            <li> The batteries were good for about 3 months, and that was with once-weekly use.  </li>
            <li> Good battery life.</li>
            <li> very nice i liked  it</li>
            <li> $ I thought I would have a rich mans shaver but its best to pay for something cheaper like the cruzer 6 by gillete or not since replacement blades are pricy for the cruzer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The Phillips Norelco Body Hair Trimmer is the most superior shaver I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s my favorite trimmer I&#x27;ve had, good for necklines, sideburns, chest etc...)!  </li>

            <li> this is an awesome tool for all your grooming needs, it recharges quickly and holds the charge for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> The best of the best, after try like 4 different shavers this one is definitely the best I ever try, and the best part is It can be used on the shower.</li>
            <li> But the best improvement is in the blades, which cut well and quickly.</li>

            <li> So many 4 &amp; 5 reviews looked great.  </li>
            <li> but ither than that if u have better luck than me, the side that works works great</li>

            <li> Worth buying it for perfect body grooming..</li>
            <li> Great product, i love it</li>
            <li> I also own the BG2020(Which is good as well)</li>
            <li> Good to carry in travel pouch, battery charging period is just nice.</li>
            <li> When I asked him how much he liked it and what should I put on the review he said, and I quote \\&quot;Good s</li>
            <li> The trimmer portion is good, and its nice that it is adjustable</li>
            <li> It is a very good grooming product, but I did not find that upgrading from the lower priced model was a significant increase in quality.  </li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer with many functions.</li>
            <li> Because of the guard lengths, it hasn&#x27;t made a very good versatile trimmer for keeping the sides clean and tapered for me.  </li>
            <li> this product is a very good body groomer, I use it very often and every time is a pleasure, great results</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do a perfect job (which is why I gave it 4 stars), but I was definitely happy with it as it gave me a very good shave in less time vs a Gillette Razor.  </li>
            <li> Great Shaver, awesome design allows for quick trimming and comfortable skin afterward.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver to shaver the full body</li>
            <li> So this is a very competent razor with a great handle and easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> more than four times!No Joke!</li>
            <li> SAFE!</li>
            <li> Works perfect,  does exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> If it takes many passes sometimes - who cares!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> What i like most about it is that you don&#x27;t get cut and scratched while you are removing hair 99% percent of the time(even in the groin area!).</li>
            <li> I love this body groomer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!!</li>

            <li> I LOVE this thing!  </li>
            <li> First, this is the best grooming product I have used to-date.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fact that you dont have to keep it plugged in for ages to clip two inches of hair!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> love this thing!</li>
            <li> This is truly a fantastic beautiful device.</li>
            <li> I really love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this Philips Norelco for self-grooming (I&#x27;m loathe to use the term &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34;) and have found it to be superbly designed.  </li>
            <li> I like the easy adjustment of the trimmer settings which work great on my sideburns.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t experienced any nicks yet and handle easily.</li>
            <li> This shaver is easy to use and it does a great grooming job.</li>

            <li> easy to use works great.</li>
            <li> It was OK when it worked, but the battery isn&#x27;t very good and the foil breaks easily.</li>
            <li> Close and smooth shave, and extremely easy to use for perfect lines and edging.</li>
            <li> Having both an electric trimmer and shaver on one razor is incredibly convenient, and given how quickly and effectively this thing works</li>
            <li> I have found this BodyGroom Pro to be effective, easy to use and a joy to use.</li>
            <li> Always very smooth and a good looking cut.</li>
            <li> Very smooth results as well, but expect to spend some quality time on yourself if you want to look good.</li>
            <li> VEry nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is both a very good product and a very good bargain.</li>
            <li> But this is an absolutely amazing product.</li>
            <li> So alot of people have been saying how this is amazing</li>

            <li> Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> so my son now has his own.</li>
            <li> That was nice to not have to worry about that.  </li>
            <li> You have two ends, each with their own on/off controls.  </li>
            <li> If you use this in the shower, you will need shaving cream with warm</li>
            <li> shaver/trimmer comes with a nice charging stand.</li>
            <li> 3-The shaver/trimmer comes with a nice charging stand.</li>
            <li> and honestly I thought I would wake up with razor bumps all over my nether-regions from this shaver.</li>
            <li> In all, I think I&#x27;ve own about five or six.  </li>
            <li> In all, I think I&#x27;ve own about five or six.  </li>
            <li> my husband liked this gift.</li>
            <li> Nice 2 in 1.</li>
            <li> I had a \\&quot;body bare\\&quot; shaver before this that was nice and compact</li>
            <li> Keeps a nice charge going as well.  </li>
            <li> I like it a lot and would recommend this product if this is the kind of appliance you are looking for.    </li>
            <li> side trimmers cause their own issues.  </li>
            <li> It had no trimmer side like the Pro does, and of course it had its own design issues, but compared to this one...</li>
            <li> I use the close shave side to get rid of my neckbeard, and the trimmer side to keep it at a nice length.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still loving it.  </li>
            <li> Pros  Water proof design and nice charging contacts  </li>
            <li> a nice uniform shave  </li>
            <li> Although it takes practice to get used to its multi-functional design, the Bodygroom Pro Grooming System is quite an efficient body hair shaver for the hirsute among us who want to stay nicely clipped before laying claim to Darwin&#x27;s theories of evolution.</li>
            <li> No nicks, cuts, or gashes of any kind.</li>
            <li> Nice product to have and to use.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s still the best bodygroomer on the market, and being waterproof really puts the selling point on this item.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it&#x27;s just one unit</li>
            <li> They just want to let you figure out by your own after buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No nicks or scratches of any kind.</li>
            <li> I honestly had no complaints at all with this product.  </li>
            <li> end has its own on/off button</li>
            <li> The shaver is cordless and fits slides into a nice charging stand.  </li>
            <li> it was effective.  </li>
            <li> I cut my own hair</li>
            <li> I also liked the weight, seemed sturdy (go figure).  </li>
            <li> I also liked the design which in my opinion helped me to &#x27;reach&#x27;</li>
            <li> I liked this product, however after a month or two the foil head broke on the machine.</li>
            <li> I placed the trimmer on the charger and once it was fully charged, I began to tackle the treacherous terrain of my own body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice close shave with the foil end, and basically no chance of Knicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> The Philips is nice.</li>
            <li> It also did a really nice job on my beard.  </li>
            <li> Nice charging station.</li>
            <li> Kind of a rip off for a $70 trimmer basically.&lt;br</li>
            <li> also gives a nice, close shave when wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice razor&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t the fault of the groomer but a fault of my own.</li>
            <li> I have had friends tell me that they shaved their nuts- and that their girlfriends REALLY liked this-</li>
            <li> am the kind of guy who shaves and always gets that irritation after</li>
            <li> NICE PURCHASE</li>
            <li> Nicely updated version.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice how you just rest it on and take it off when you want it...  </li>
            <li> This gives you this nice, fold out stand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really nice</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the BEST all over body shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own against the linoleum.</li>
            <li> No pulling at all at hairs or any kind of irritation at all.</li>
            <li> This body groomer is twice as nice.</li>
            <li> nice close cut without having to worry about nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li> nothing spectacular</li>
            <li> Waterproof is a nice touch, too.</li>
            <li> If you want a mole rat with matching luggage,  I recommend this handy tool.</li>
            <li> What i really liked about the BG2040 is that all the attachments are on the shaver.</li>
            <li> (So no switching required) is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> but it does a nice job and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin.</li>
            <li> Everything in one piece is nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a person paid to give a review to this product or anything, this is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This gives you this nice, fold out stand.</li>
            <li> Let me be honest with you guys.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this groomer a lot, and it is the absolute best.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the shave function, but the trimmer is excellent.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the product...but ...not the design....</li>
            <li> The adjustable trimmer length is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> the trimmer on the bottom is nice.</li>
            <li> Nice for body shaving.</li>
            <li> I wanted to splurge and get my husband a nice razor for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Loving it.</li>
            <li> This machine is honestly a godsend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a nice looking thing if nothing else.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is good shaver is ok</li>
            <li> and I can say its a good and safe product to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Coming from the Wahl with 19 bazillion attachments, it&#x27;ll be nice to not have to carry a separate ziplock bag with the attachments whenever I travel.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly, as soon as I opened it, I tested it in my body, it has no pulling-feeling, and it&#x27;s really gentle with the skin.</li>
            <li> The minute I received the machine, I used it for three hours non-stop and it didn&#x27;t even get warm.</li>
            <li> I do not buy this kind of objects because i think they are ripping me off but this one truly works.</li>
            <li> It actually kind of adds to the decor of my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Okay so I was a bit pessimistic even though this product had plenty of good reviews....</li>
            <li> Philips CSR was polite, understanding and effective.</li>
            <li> If I keep going over and over the area it does a nice job.</li>
            <li> the charging stand is nice</li>
            <li> the tend to bog and even kind of tug at the hair.</li>
            <li> I would recomend it for anyone looking to tidy up any place you that needs it.</li>
            <li> Although the design is nice the performance is lacking.</li>
            <li> The dual purpose heads on either end are really handy.</li>
            <li> nice shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that you can take it into the shower with you, and I like that you can get a nice close trim with it...</li>
            <li> after you stop it&#x27;s kind of</li>
            <li> I own a Phillips beard trimmer as well.</li>
            <li> I used to own the BG2020 until it died.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it can be rinsed out,</li>
            <li> so honestly it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the trimmer just couldn&#x27;t handle my type of body hair.</li>
            <li> so honestly it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the trimmer just couldn&#x27;t handle my type of body hair.</li>
            <li> Really liked the body groom razor, would recommend this item.  </li>
            <li> They do not cut the skin so they were honest there</li>
            <li> For this kind of money wouldn&#x27;t&#x27; you think they could have put in a lithium battery?</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer side (bottom of the device as pictured) is excellent and works very well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own and not returning it to the charger until it wouldn&#x27;t turn on again.</li>
            <li> Best in class, easy to use and keep it clean.</li>
            <li> Was a nice gift for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I thaught that i can depend on phillips an thought that phillips is a good and famous brand.</li>
            <li> it gets a nice shave.</li>
            <li> it is $50 and might seem pricey, but come on a good razor costs $15 or more</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give me a razor like finish like I had kind of hoped for</li>
            <li> Does not seem as effective in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> i ordered this to some of my friends and co-workers and they all liked it.</li>
            <li> I liked the design</li>
            <li> Maybe one with a corded option would be nice as well?</li>
            <li> I also own a Phillips Norelco which I have had for over two years.</li>
            <li> It has a good curved shape that allows you to reach most places.</li>
            <li> And I have to admit, I was loving on it for about a month or two.</li>
            <li> I do my whole body and it does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the micro blades much because I prefer a razor, but the trimming edges are perfect if you want to leave some stubble on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they were all honest reviews.</li>
            <li> Nicely designed body groomer,</li>
            <li> /&gt;the edge trimmer is nice works</li>
            <li> Really fantastic razor and trimmer; it does a very nice job on everything below the face.  </li>
            <li> Excellent beard and moustache trimmer and the shaver keeps the parts you want smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> It looks great, but it doesn&#x27;t fit in there very easily.</li>
            <li> Well, I was a happy owner of the ORIGINAL Bodygroom, BG 2020.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to purchasing this product, I had the original bodygroom and it worked great on the jewels.</li>
            <li> I own this, and a Sonicare toothbrush from Philips and am impressed by the high quality.  </li>
            <li> He said the razor is very comfortable and easy to use and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> It works great - close clean shave and no irritation.</li>
            <li> had the best price for this particular item.  </li>
            <li> Does a really nice job no matter where you use it, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> He shaves all the time now, and I must say he is mighty smooth :) Happy husband, happy wife.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it for men looking for this type of product.</li>
            <li> Perfect so far no complaints!!</li>
            <li> I am still very satisfied with the product and more so after seeing the how it was put together, but there are some caveats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And great for full shaving your man parts.</li>
            <li> Great Produt, great built, battery last a good time.</li>
            <li> so I can really give the razor a chance to either be a screw up Or be the AMAZING shaver it truly is!!</li>
            <li> Because Man has a new best friend!!!</li>
            <li> had many reviews but who knows maybe the top five commentaries are always paid by some organization to write a good review for product.</li>
            <li> Good and easy</li>
            <li> designed, has a good feel to it, easy to use.</li>
            <li> The Bodygroom cleans easily and it&#x27;s charging stand makes a good holder when not in use.</li>
            <li> if good, cleaning is easy.</li>
            <li> This is ok it works fairly well but still could work better.  </li>
            <li> I have used many trimmers/shavers targeted towards women and really haven&#x27;t been impressed.</li>
            <li> Does a quick, great job.</li>
            <li> Good battery life, shavung head stays in place well, easy to hold, close shave.</li>
            <li> awesome clean fast, and a really good price</li>
            <li> Not used as my every day shaver but great when I need it for traveling or a quick trim.</li>
            <li> isn´t a perfect tool, but I´d say it´s really close, and definitely better than anything I´ve tried that is a machine.</li>
            <li> Holds a good charge n is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The pivoting head makes it very easy to work.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and wont irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to adjust the length and even though it says to not use without the guard, I do it all the time...unless it voids my warranty, because then I don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle.</li>
            <li> it breaks very easy</li>
            <li> Cleaning is very easy.</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and reliable.  </li>
            <li> Removes longer hair very easily but still does not shave as close as a razor and takes quite a while to shave effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Ps it is very easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li> best groomer on the market, wish you change your own batteries but overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have been able to groom those areas (TMI: and more!)</li>
            <li> Fantastic for manscaping lol, just got this baby this morning and first impressions are great.</li>
            <li> shaving cuts, no long-time shaving sessions, a pretty wonderful battery life, and&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s able to be using under shower (waterproof), and more of features.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right now, I&#x27;m smooth where I want to be and perfectly groomed elsewhere!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very smooth, effective shave when trimming hair under your arms.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and effective.  </li>
            <li> wow very nice &amp;#62;&amp;#62; the great bodygroom machine</li>
            <li> VERY NICE GROOMER SHIPPED QUICKLY BY SELLER.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very happy,the transaction was veri excellent,the item is very very good.</li>
            <li> very good thanks for sending greetings from Venezuela all</li>
            <li> This is a very good one, I shave my arms and it works very well</li>
            <li> this one by far is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used .</li>
            <li> Ultimately it is a safe and effective razor.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that this is by far the best one I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> SO far, its the best grooming tool i have ever had.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly helpful  to have in the shower to trim my body hair to a reasonable length.</li>
            <li> let me just say this is by far the best body shaver i have ever owned ......   </li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s the reason I still give it three stars): out of the electric razors I&#x27;ve tried, this is the best one so far.  </li>
            <li> By far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Perfect for hard-to-reach, sensitive and \\&quot;wife mandated\\&quot; areas.  </li>
            <li> Okay this shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far the best of either type I have ever owned, being about my fifth one over the years.</li>
            <li> Like most products of its kind made today, it has no replaceable parts (except the shaver head)</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by this product because of the dual heads, being able to switch from trimming to the foil shaver with a press of a button is amazingly convenient.</li>
            <li> and - with removing the plastic guard I am able to get a nice close-ish shave of any part of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Suitable for thinning hair from around the body</li>
            <li> Fairly powerful and has great battery life.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with this</li>
            <li> This thing is as good as everyone else says it is, but the dial to adjust the trimmer length feels extremely cheap.</li>
            <li> But, it is the best shaver I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent so far.</li>
            <li> So far i had used dozens of body hair shaving and grooming products, but this one is the best .</li>
            <li> This is by far the best body grooming product I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with this razor so far.</li>
            <li> This is far and away the best groomer you can purchase and not feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best razor out there .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of body groomers and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li> But honestly, while ur at it, buy a better one..</li>
            <li> So far it has been awesome.</li>
            <li> Its a great change and its definately worth it.</li>
            <li> I will stick with my good ol&#x27; Wahl Chrome Pro clippers and just trim it all!sue; smooth as glass.</li>
            <li> The device is excellent and meet my expectation, it is as is described, and it is doing his functions professionally</li>
            <li> One of the best body groomers I have used so far.</li>
            <li> My experience so far has been excellent.</li>
            <li> more so my own skin...</li>
            <li> This is the best sensitive area shave I have ever used</li>
            <li> Tried a number of Bodygroom models and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Great product definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you want to rid yourself from the hair completely waxing still is the best way.</li>
            <li> many strikes to be minimally effective</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, have used a couple times ,1st use was good</li>
            <li> When the first shaver had a charge it shaved flawlessly and was comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly easy, incredibly fast, and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;re done and it&#x27;s done right, you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect great results in that area when it tells you right on the box</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair on my torso and the comb on the trimmer</li>
            <li> this is still going strong!</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, fast shipping, good fit.</li>
            <li> It does what is says it does, is a easy to operate product, no additional pieces that you may loose and compromise the usage of the item, does a perfect job, even on \\&quot;that area\\&quot;, and at a great price..</li>
            <li> This is just good for trimming large areas like chest, pubic area, and good for butt with a lot of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This item is as good as advertised, I&#x27;m not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I had the original Bodygroom (no longer sold) and loved how it worked for over 6-7 years.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got this, thinking it would glide right across my sack taking the hair with it, but no!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good, high quality engineering on this device.</li>
            <li> this razor is decent at best, i havent really been able to find a great shaver for manscaping since i used my roomates in college one.</li>
            <li> The body shaver head works great and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I find this to be a great product and will be happy to continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li> Tried many body groomers, this by far is the best.</li>
            <li> battery life is great, the low charge indicator is a great feature, lets you know when your about to run out of juice.</li>
            <li> I keep it well charged and in good, clean condition.</li>
            <li> So far this thing is awesome, no nicks on da nutz any more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this great product if you need to&lt;br /&gt;a reliable, convenient, comfortable, and smooth grooming shaver.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> works great and gives a very very close shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very much body hair, but this thing works great on my chest and leg hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and does a very good job cleaning up my neck in the spots that my other electric razor doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Overall, its great, well worth the cost, and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> but I must say this is a great product, it performs exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The trimmer while it holds the charge for the first year is great..</li>
            <li> happy with this and hope it lasts longer then the battery did in the first one.</li>
            <li> I am pretty happy.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful but not by much</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with the product until it just stopped working on the cutter end.  </li>
            <li> First, it works great as a bush whacker, no blood</li>
            <li> trimmer/shaver is great gets really close without irritation and its powerful, this part alone is what made me happy</li>
            <li> For the first year of so this was a great product.</li>
            <li> so you can say I am pretty happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a full charge at home, I am good for 10+ day trips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s leaves a great, clean, &amp; smooth cut for me,</li>
            <li> Good quality, strong, easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works fine!</li>
            <li> It gives a very smooth shave to the tenderest parts with no nicks or pinches.</li>
            <li> time skin is not burning, very smooth.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The blades are rounded making it very smooth and</li>
            <li> It has a very smooth shave</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, very comfortable to use</li>
            <li> its really nice and easy to shave ur body</li>
            <li> Nice product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> But it has a good grip and you get used to it really quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good shaver and it&#x27;s really handy</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and can tip over easily, given the groomer itself has a nice weight to it.  </li>
            <li> Durable, good and quick shave.</li>
            <li> If you want to buy this and pretend to get a super close shave, it isn&#x27;t for you because, it do a really good job, but you could feel a litle bit when you pass over with your hand...</li>
            <li> This thing must have been made by the gods so that we mortals could be as smooth and sexy as them!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed that impressed me was that, unlike my hair clippers, this could go right over my nipples without nicking them.  </li>
            <li> Nice that is is waterproof, so trimming in the shower is fine.</li>
            <li> The effect made certain others happy.</li>
            <li> It is very good for those sensitive areas...</li>
            <li> Very good for sensitive skin and shaving close without any shaving cream.</li>

            <li> i love it and my wife loves me for using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too many electronics now a days are designed to be disposable.</li>
            <li> Fabulous investment!</li>
            <li> some others.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver side is ok.</li>
            <li> Top reasons its bad&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also bought some more Nair, but just for my netherparts since I didn&#x27;t trust putting a razor to that area . . .</li>
            <li> It was more spray-on than like a foamy, whipped type that I had used before.  </li>
            <li> solid product, i guess best at the market now adays</li>
            <li> u will really love it</li>
            <li> Razor doesn&#x27;t cut anything more than 2mm in length  2.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s agree: shaving is more than an act of maintenance.</li>
            <li> I have a beard, and I&#x27;m able to take care of more things with this tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I want to add one more thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to take care of the extras, and that&#x27;s a difference</li>
            <li> Ah, the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that has all changed, and now men need more out of their shaving system.</li>
            <li> Well, that has all changed, and now men need more out of their shaving system.</li>
            <li> This is much better.</li>
            <li> I went to my local stores (Best Buy, Target, Walmart, BedBathAndBeyond) and they all had the Philips BG-2040.</li>
            <li> and I was able to use it today in the shower.</li>
            <li> and I was able to trim with ease.</li>
            <li> This is perfect because I like to use the lowest possible setting when using the trimmer.</li>
            <li> charging portions is OK.</li>
            <li> the manual states that the shaver/trimmer should never be put on the charger after your using it and never leave it on for more than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> able to use the shaver while plugged in</li>
            <li> able to leave the shaver in charger overnight</li>
            <li> thought the shaver cant be left on the charger, this is an excellent product for what it does.</li>

            <li> Outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Bodygroom Shaver and it shaved OK.</li>
            <li> I Love it.  </li>
            <li> They range from cordless to cords, beards to top hair to pubic hair.  </li>
            <li> That intermediate one will bite sometimes without a guard, so I just use its better guard lengths.  </li>
            <li> Maybe once or twice a week at most.      </li>
            <li> That intermediate one will bite sometimes without a guard, so I just use its better guard lengths.  </li>
            <li> The stand looks nice and supposedly the razor will fit inside the curve while being charged.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> It does give me a nice smooth feeling when I am done using it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone, man or woman who wants to trim, cut or groom below the neck.</li>
            <li> it shaves more because it bends closer to the blade.</li>
            <li> 50 mins sounds like a lot, but I seem to be charging it more than I want.</li>
            <li> , it would be even better if it collected the shavings.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> one more try</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love both features.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed getting him something practical</li>
            <li> even attempted to swap out the stock batteries with a much better brand.  </li>
            <li> but now that I did, I am glad.  </li>
            <li> will have to try \\&quot;further\\&quot; when I have more time.  </li>
            <li> Where I did shave, I was pleased with the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> Over all, I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased to say that he loves and it and uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> (if I need to spell it out, you shouldn&#x27;t be buying this for yourself) and stay on top of keeping it trimmed, because the foil trimmer part is a lot easier to use on &amp;#34;those areas&amp;#34; than the sharper razor and blades therein.  </li>
            <li> I made sure the battery was fully charged.  </li>
            <li> i paid a lot of money for this and used it on my nether regions, like youre supposed to be able too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just something that you will get better with as you use it more.  </li>
            <li> This one is surely the most convenient.</li>
            <li> No hassles... Works like magic...</li>
            <li> is:  my Gillette Fusion 5-blade razor can&#x27;t shave me better than this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for all the male parts.</li>
            <li> Most electric face shavers</li>
            <li> but otherwise it&#x27;s agood  water proof and touching button</li>
            <li> The foil requires a slower hand, and requires you to hold the body groom perpendicular to your hair, and move it more deliberately.     </li>
            <li> You end up charging it more than you use it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this shaver.</li>
            <li> but i still love the item itself.</li>
            <li> thought this would be a better alternative to using a trimmer -&amp;#62</li>
            <li> I simply love this product.</li>
            <li> It is a quality product of Phillips, which is serving my purpose satisfactorily for more than a year now.</li>
            <li> This model of the Norelco Body Groom is drastically better than the BG2020 model.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, they should lower the price to make it a better deal.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now</li>
            <li> thanks for good and nice product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to report it&#x27;s still working really well.    </li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can \\&quot;manscape\\&quot; without pain.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m enjoying this purchase.  </li>
            <li> so most trimers take me awhile to use but out of all of them</li>
            <li> nice and smooth...  </li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews I felt confident this item would handle my grooming needs.  </li>
            <li> Did I get better with practice?</li>
            <li> This was the part I was most worried about.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer :)</li>
            <li> Glad I bought these.</li>
            <li> This thing is magic.</li>
            <li> At the top is the groomer, which consists of a pivoting shaving head that floats according to the contours and curves of your body no matter how contoured it may be.</li>
            <li> What I appreciate most is how both the shaver foil and the trimmer are made of hypoallergenic material so as to prevent the possibility of skin irritation, allergy, or rash.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re only looking for a trim, it works great!    </li>
            <li> I need more to power through my ahem...</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this item.</li>
            <li> I wanted them to show better</li>
            <li> I love mine and have had it for about 2 years now.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re gonna spend the money anywhere why not on your most prized appendage?</li>
            <li> A razor works much better</li>
            <li> We both enjoyed the closeness of the shave and that it was able to reach all areas - as another reviewer described - the nuts, bolts and sack</li>
            <li> I feel completely safe using it</li>
            <li> and it produces really sexy results.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be sack, shaft, and [...] safe.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this razor to any man looking to feel sexy and safe.</li>
            <li> There must be a better way to design a charging stand.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> but I have used it many time and it has not dulled the blade.</li>
            <li> Worth all the $$ and works as good in the shower.  </li>
            <li> For many men, part of this grooming includes trimming and/or shaving body hair, on ALL parts of the body.</li>
            <li> When I was through, I was amazed at the results, and so was my wife, whom immensely enjoyed the well trimmed look as well as the baby-smooth parts.  </li>
            <li> Glad that we bought it, and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This really gets a close stubble which made the razor shave great (eliminated a lot of post-shave razor burn too).</li>
            <li> Overall, this is the best unit I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This was one of the better purchases I have made in a while.  </li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the 1 star reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am sure glad I did.</li>
            <li> The Bodygroomer is a sleek and stylish product that works as well as it looks.  </li>
            <li> The groomer comes with an equally stylish charging stand.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I have used it for various areas of body hair and have been very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Let me answer the most pressing question guys ask when considering a trimmer like this.</li>
            <li> Even with those nicks every once in a while it&#x27;s a hell of a lot better than using a manual razor to try and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s just okay for beard trimming</li>
            <li> Was able to shave in the no-no places with ease and comfort.</li>
            <li> its a great razor that you can use on those intimate areas without fear, whether you&#x27;re a man or a woman.  </li>
            <li> love to have this product...</li>
            <li> I bought a wired Wahl, and I&#x27;ll see if that one works better.  </li>
            <li> This 2040 does have a better trimmer though.</li>
            <li> Love this product, except I dropped it in the shower and the flexible top part broke off.  </li>
            <li> The model below this one was better IMHOP.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> But I already did and was hoping for a lot better trim.</li>
            <li> Make sure to follow the charging instructions as this unit uses a NiMh battery, not a Lithium one</li>
            <li> What I like most about this product is the battery life.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer does not work well whatsoever, and I am amazed that others seem to be satisfied with the performance of the product.</li>
            <li> After reading many review I took the risk and bought the item.</li>
            <li> Anyways; its better if you mail Norelco $10 and save yourself pulling hairs and a headache than ordering this for much more, and adding the headache.</li>
            <li> I have tried using a hair trimmer, electric shaver, and manual shaving and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with any of it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> decided to &#x27;upgrade&#x27; and purchased, what I thought, was a better model.</li>
            <li> While it works, and gets the job done, I don&#x27;t feel as &#x27;safe&#x27; using it around the nether regions.  </li>
            <li> So much better than using a blade razor.</li>
            <li> For the most part it works well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No awful bleeding or anything though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is probably effective for someone with light body hair.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, the product is great, a 10/10</li>
            <li> that, for lack of a better description, Manscapes.  </li>
            <li> THE BEST personal grooming tool EVER!</li>
            <li> With that I am well pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love this groomer.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing the body trimmer, most reviews suggested it was meant for men....</li>
            <li> It shaves the MOST tender areas without any nicking or grabbing.</li>
            <li> Since the latest cradle fell apart, I&#x27;m having to do some wacky workarounds to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Razor/foil probably should to be replaced more often than once a year, which is the recommended.  </li>
            <li> It turned me from a hairy chimp-like creature, to a more human-like creature.</li>
            <li> Safe as some say for stomachs and chest</li>
            <li> The close-shave part worked just &#x27;okay&#x27;, although I have nothing else to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Wish I had read more reviews before purchasing this groomer.</li>
            <li> I get better results with a 2 blade razor than I do this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a groomer for two years and this one is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times now, and could not be more pleased with the performance.  </li>
            <li> I believe there has to be a better product out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t be able to comment on that part.</li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> /&gt;He was able to trim his beard, shave his chest (for me.</li>
            <li> Works even better than the cheaper ones that work well also.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> If I was you I would consider some of the lower cost options which are much better to handle and do a better job in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am several months in and have very, very happy with it.    </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cute though Norelco followed the induction charging fad with this one.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Wish it would cut better, but I guess you get what you pay for????</li>
            <li> give it a try, youll love it....</li>
            <li> given it includes free shipping, which this is why i like to shop on Amazon and no tax !</li>
            <li> Well it can go most places for me</li>
            <li> Works MUCH better on my body than my Braun Synchro, which is made for your face.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll LOVE it.</li>
            <li> The foil end also does a great job of cleaning up areas after the clippers where you want a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Its ok, I do like it for the groin area</li>
            <li> Great sleek design and very portable.</li>
            <li> Really works great.  </li>
            <li> but this one is much better.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never used a better shaver.  </li>
            <li> Works good and worth a buy..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple tools to help in this area, and this is the best.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just better for everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking baby smooth!</li>
            <li> Seller: 5 Stars Product Quality: 3 Stars  </li>
            <li> It works, it&#x27;s one of the better devices for trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> I will say that this product does do what many have described.</li>
            <li> a better shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re confident and competent with a blade, go that route, it&#x27;s cheaper and faster.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten better use out of a Conair groomer than I did out of this thing, and for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> After reading on with most of the reviews I realized that most people had a faulty product that just needed to be exchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I EXPECT TO BUY THIS BRAND MORE OFTEN</li>
            <li> It is ok there</li>
            <li> Better than a razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, for 50 dollars you can&#x27;t get anything better.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box I was immediately pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I used it straight out of the box and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I have not found a better option.</li>
            <li> have used the trimmer for many man-scaping expeditions and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has provided many days of baby  butt</li>
            <li> Bottom line, this does many things, non of them well.</li>
            <li> and I am really satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> and I love the dual ends.  </li>
            <li> After using it just once, the springs under the switch (and the plastic on top) fell off.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ve been thoroughly impressed with the quality!&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once satisfied, I can switch over to the shave-end and take care of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> trimming/shaving, be confident.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> Most shavers and trimmer have just the unit itself and a cord for charging it.</li>
            <li> Hence, unless you love the idea of displaying your bodygroom pro on your counter, you will have to keep track of three things, not two, and get out three things, not two, when you want to charge the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ok all i can say is this works perfectly for that zone above your knees and below your waist</li>
            <li> I was amazed by how close the groomer was able to trim.  </li>
            <li> was expecting more from you</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and it is durable, dependable and gives a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Shared by me and my boyfriend and we love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li> I am able to get 1.5 -2</li>
            <li> Love this BodyGroomer.  </li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I have made recently.</li>
            <li> Safe for those tender regions</li>
            <li> I will detail for better understanding:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since so many people are complaining about this, Philips Norelco MUST know that they have a problem with the battery.  </li>
            <li> I love every bit of how it shaves and how it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe to use in</li>
            <li> This is the best appliance I have purchased in the last 10 years:</li>
            <li> But, I wouldn&#x27;t trade the trimmer length adjuster at all, unless it got better.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t stand the clip on goofy type.</li>
            <li> Love and so does my wife.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The BG2040 feels more sturdy than my BG2020.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is an ok product.</li>
            <li> For the price, it should have been a much better and premium product.</li>
            <li> elaborate, it trims EVERYthing</li>
            <li> This machine -- and it is a MACHINE -- does the job quickly, safely and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> and here I am now, with what is probably the most hilariously patchy and razor burned pubic region in all of America.  </li>
            <li> love it .</li>
            <li> I guess, I was expecting more as I love Norelco</li>
            <li> I like it, I love it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced absolutely zero pulling or nicks using both ends of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It was ok to use.  </li>
            <li> I have two different shavers made by them and very happy with both.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Ok product.....</li>
            <li> but I would say it is better as a trimmer than a shaver....</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product!!</li>
            <li> I was able to go bald in about 20 mins.</li>
            <li> Also combines the best of both worlds with a adjustable trimmer and contact mesh trimmer on opposite sides.</li>
            <li> I am surprisingly pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> but overall this is the best product I have used.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job, all around useful tool, not as close as I would like</li>
            <li> Have not cut my self yet even in the more sensitivity man areas.</li>
            <li> my body look sexy and attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stylish, it&#x27;s light-weight, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Well built and stylish.</li>
            <li> And it really does a great job all over.   </li>
            <li> This one cuts the skin more.</li>
            <li> Their model below this model works better.  </li>
            <li> And the trimmer worked again for a couple more days before it quit again.  </li>
            <li> for the unit itself for doing its job, I guess it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Still wish for a plug-in mode, so it has more power.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overall the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Awesome features, including individual controls for each end, battery indicator, and pivoting head.</li>
            <li> is there anything more that needs to be said.</li>
            <li> I shave most all my body For that &amp;#34;smooth Look&amp;#34; and thi is the product to do it.</li>
            <li> and I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> Both the shaving and grooming end have a top quality sturdy feel and perform well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I Love It.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m baffled that this thing isn&#x27;t marketed more to men.</li>
            <li> More of us need to hear about this device.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be confidently recommending this one to all my guy friends, including you</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this purchase and the price I paid.</li>
            <li> 8)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not always a lot of surface area to work with, and the designers of the product should have accommodated that circumstance better.    </li>
            <li> I love the ability to flip it around for trimming v. a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Best combo personal grooming tool I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> The more times you charge it, the longer you can use it.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cheers smooth body friends!</li>
            <li> are notoriously better made than women&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;3/5 - Okay shaver.</li>
            <li> It works ok as a body groomer</li>
            <li> I use a wahl clipper set for this task since it has a much better guard.  </li>
            <li> The shaver part is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Most shavers and trimmer have just the unit itself and a cord for charging it.</li>
            <li> Hence, unless you love the idea of displaying your bodygroom pro on your counter, you will have to keep track of three things, not two, and get out three things, not two, when you want to charge the device.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better.</li>
            <li> The best combo for me since all I need is to trip my facial hair with one end and body hair</li>
            <li> My girlfriend appreciates it too! :-)</li>
            <li> It scratches more than others</li>
            <li> The results on my leg were much better then anticipated.</li>
            <li> I love the Body Groom Pro and the features it has.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am impressed with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have had several trimmers over the years, and this has to be the best I have</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> so this helps with chaffing and I am now able to shave whenever I desire.</li>
            <li> Great product and very affordable.</li>
            <li> My wife would like me to shave off all the stubble more often.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I just keep writing more because i am trying to reach the minimum limit...</li>
            <li> actually I give this tool to friend and he was very happy with it</li>
            <li> I love this thing, I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Shape is perfect for reaching the pesky lower back hair - you can reach all the way, almost to your spine.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> there are many things out there</li>
            <li> Using the foil end is ok,  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done for the most part.</li>
            <li> It should be much better to travel with too.</li>
            <li> Does not hold more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have an outlet you can designate to this if you decide to purchase.</li>
            <li> I am pleased that I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am pleased that I will no longer have to suffer razor burn or irritation again.</li>
            <li> Best personal groomer!</li>
            <li> My rating will probably get better</li>
            <li> Safe for all body parts.</li>
            <li> okay..</li>
            <li> Shaves nice and close leaving a smooth surface.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is how many hours could I have saved over the years</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the BodyGroom for several years now and is the best thing since slice bread for manscaping.</li>
            <li> Do yourself and those you love a favor and buy one of these.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, it is \\&quot;shaft, sack, and starfish\\&quot; safe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for a better alternative.</li>
            <li> Top quality product.  </li>
            <li> As the product name states this trimmer is great for the whole body.</li>
            <li> As a pilot, I am on the road more often than not.</li>
            <li> I love it and would give it 5 stars if I could shave my face with it.</li>
            <li> so I have not used on the boys just around them, which I am still satisfied with .</li>
            <li> last thing.. this product might be perfect for a hairy guy..</li>
            <li> i feel like there are better trimmer out there for a better deal</li>
            <li> This is the best male ball, taint, ass shaver in the business.  </li>
            <li> Anywhere else this does the trick better than any of the others i have tried.</li>
            <li> This is most definitely the best Bodygrooming device that I have used.</li>
            <li> It will operate better, and pregrooming will reduce hair from pulling or tugging, or clogging the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is well built and does a much better job without razor burn or hair pulling.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect to be able to do a couple days in a row, without charging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i was able to shave it quite well.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine a better off to college gift.</li>
            <li> , it was better not to have the 3D Pivoting Head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s able to trim on all surfaces no problem at all.</li>
            <li> Thanks Philips for another great</li>
            <li> As for the shaving(top) part, It does an ok job.  </li>
            <li> I just tried it once, and I am already pleased with this</li>
            <li> and/or the more the skin folds, the lighter pressure you should apply.</li>
            <li> Your girlfriend or wife will agree :)</li>
            <li> Im torn with this, its ok.</li>
            <li> They would probably do a much better job &amp;#34;downstairs&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like a Wahl trimmer much better if you are looking to trim and not shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> most foil shavers, it is loud.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with the purchase, here are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I haven&#x27;t found anything better on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product gets close and is able to be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> If I had known this was so much better</li>
            <li> Bought this for as a Christmas present for my wonderful son</li>
            <li> You have to go over everything many times and even then you still find stray hairs and have to use a razor.</li>
            <li> i owned many BG2030</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> then I will get more cuts and bump..</li>
            <li> BG2030 WAS BETTER...</li>
            <li> trimmer by itself is ok could be wider&lt;</li>
            <li> For 70 dollars I expect a better quality than this.  </li>
            <li> Its perfect for, ahem, sensitive skin, and the guarded trimmer on the bottom of the shaver prevents nicks.</li>
            <li> do think this could have been a much better product if some improvements were made.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and he just feels better.  </li>
            <li> eight more words to allow this to submit</li>
            <li> but I love it for body shaving...</li>
            <li> leaves razor bumps (which I, along with many others</li>
            <li> hate!).&lt;br /&gt;-Waxing hurts the most of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s WAY better</li>
            <li> does ok, it doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave</li>
            <li> probably should have sent mine in for a replacement, but at this point I am going to look elsewhere for something that better suits my needs.</li>
            <li> But not any more.  </li>
            <li> All in all I would recommend this to anyone and guarantee that you would be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure the battery would have given out by now</li>
            <li> Even used in shower then tossed out on the rug on many occasions.</li>
            <li> , if you are looking for a wonderful electric toy with which to satisfy the deep masochist you are, then by all means...get this one!&lt;br</li>
            <li> like it -- not in love with it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad now, because I use it all the time and gives me the results I want.</li>
            <li> Does an okay job.  </li>
            <li> But it sounded more like an electric razor than a smoke alarm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The feel is smoother and it seems manufactured better.</li>
            <li> but i thought maybe there is a better way.</li>
            <li> This does a way better job :)</li>
            <li> I love this &amp;#34;groomer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already gone to Costco and purchased another Philips Norelco groomer that seems to have a more rugged comb system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this Body Groomer.</li>
            <li> This model of the Norelco Body Groom is drastically better than the BG2020 model.</li>
            <li> I feel completely safe using it</li>
            <li> and it produces really sexy results.</li>
            <li> I find it to be sack, shaft, and safe.</li>
            <li> I recommend this razor to any man looking to feel sexy and safe.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the end-all-be-all of body grooming tools, but I don&#x27;t think I could&#x27;ve found a more reliable combo for the money.</li>
            <li> but I feel that I am able to convey his opinion.  </li>
            <li> and now I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> this one is better.  </li>
            <li> favorite think about Phillips bathroom electronics are their simplicity and length of time before I have to plug them in and charge them again.</li>
            <li> irritate my skin with the appropriate shaving gel and works well in the shower.</li>
            <li> Love it . .</li>
            <li> /&gt;this one is nicer on your counter, but the multigroom is better for close quarters &amp; travel.</li>
            <li> Need I ask for more?</li>
            <li> With some more patience I could probably get rid of the leftover stubble, but I don&#x27;t mind it since it isn&#x27;t so</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll have to buy him one too. :)</li>
            <li> I should have known better but nothing ventured nothign gained right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beyond this I can&#x27;t review the item any more than my preliminary experience.</li>
            <li> Again, I am sure it would work for many</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beyond this I can&#x27;t review the item any more than my preliminary experience.</li>
            <li> Again, I am sure it would work for many</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave!</li>
            <li> Love that I can use it in the shower, too, if I want.</li>
            <li> Ok, let&#x27;s stop beating around the bush.</li>
            <li> Whatever, all of that stuff happened to me and more...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery could be better</li>
            <li> but it can be better.</li>
            <li> One of my many Philips hygiene products.</li>
            <li> and I love this thing.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this groomer and it works well most of the time.</li>
            <li> It removes unwanted body hair efficiently and safely - on any area of your body.  </li>
            <li> Heck even my Gillette Fusion Pro Glide with the built in clipper setting does a better job (at trimming).</li>
            <li> better just to buy one that has a quality battery or allows you to replace them.</li>
            <li> One, you will get better at finding a technique that works for you.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer stated, this device truly is shaft, sack, and starfish safe.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 4 weeks, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> but you better don&#x27;t need to replace the shaver&#x27;s head ( $20 )</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t reach most of my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m going off on a tangent here</li>
            <li> I will update my review once I have more info.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li> The shaver head is just OK.</li>
            <li> Now it seems much more like an extended disposable.</li>
            <li> I read Wahl has better warranties.</li>
            <li> I got the most effectivity out of the trimmer without its guard.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t have so many parts you have to keep track</li>
            <li> Simply the best groomer.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review years later as I have bought another one(at Best Buy which I paid more for) because this one suddently quit.</li>
            <li> My husband used to love his bulky corded Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> It was OK.  </li>
            <li> Your girl is gonna love it, trust me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;ve used this for a while, I&#x27;ve gotten to &#x27;learn&#x27; how and when use the various cutter lengths and am now very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> Fantastic body groomer!  </li>
            <li> The foil shaver gives a nice close shave and leaves the skin smooth almost like a waxing.  </li>
            <li> Many months between charges for me.</li>
            <li> Way better then</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but it wouldn&#x27;t be able to cut through it in one, two</li>
            <li> what more can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better quality than others I&#x27;ve purchased including Wahl.</li>
            <li> just looking at this trimmer (fully charged) makes my precious marbles crawl up in their sack trying to hide from this blood hungry monster.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is not however safe to use on either your scrotum or shaft.  </li>
            <li> As for the Amazon services, I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the shipping</li>
            <li> Please consider the Aussie market, you&#x27;ll have many buyers.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t got any cuts, just make sure how to move it against your body</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, for now.</li>
            <li> I would also not trust the top trimmer to be used in your &amp;#34;ahem...area&amp;#34;, it catches skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> yet I&#x27;ve always nicked myself so many times.  </li>
            <li> It works better out the water, in this way it doesn&#x27;t get stucked with foam an hair mix, saving lot of time!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> This is the latest in their line of groomers.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a design that would work better all around.  </li>
            <li> but then again it&#x27;s more for the body hair trimming purpose</li>
            <li> i LOVE IT</li>
            <li> One of the best part being an international traveler is, it has supply voltage range!</li>
            <li> Sure beats the heck out of what I was trying to use before.  </li>
            <li> It seems like its more of a 1 1/2 or even 2 than a 1.  </li>
            <li> After one year, the battery no longer holds a charge for more than 5 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> I decided to go through with the purchase because I could return it if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li> If they make a hybrid product like the groomer 7100 where the body trimmer is excellent but the trimmer is low powered and does not give a stubble look.&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li> If you trim &amp;#34;EVERYWHERE&amp;#34; you will love this..</li>
            <li> My son uses it to shave his shoulders and chest and othe areas that get more hairy as the months go by.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband for Valentines day :)</li>
            <li> Now i just have to find similar one for his face, the rest of his body is perfect with this Norelco.</li>
            <li> I must say I love it.  </li>
            <li> This works better than the womens version.</li>
            <li> awesome for my private parts!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> and Wahl&#x27;s (wired) does a better job trimming.</li>
            <li> I love the versatility to use either side of the razor.</li>
            <li> It does everything I need and more.  </li>
            <li> groomer is totally sexy.  </li>
            <li> And yes I&#x27;m including the penis and testicular area as well as it is safe to use around there.</li>
            <li> Yes, I use it to shave my face mostly.</li>
            <li> While the groomer will remove most hair, it takes 3-4 passes to get everything thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It really holds a charge and does a great job trimming and shaving.  </li>
            <li> , i am sure she will repay your efforts with something</li>
            <li> ok,</li>
            <li> its ok anyway.</li>
            <li> not that good&lt;br /&gt;Trimming part could be better</li>
            <li> /&gt;3/5, could be better.</li>
            <li> Opening the unit is ok, but may break the waterproofing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m smooth for days!</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get it and enjoy!</li>
            <li> my husband love this Philips shaver.</li>
            <li> he said it&#x27;s the best for shaving around the back of the neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is probably my favorite thing about it.  </li>
            <li> Love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I think this may have been more of a problem with my hair than the buzzer itself.</li>
            <li> There is an instructable found online to replace the batteries with better rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll love this thing.</li>
            <li> Retains sharpness even after many uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had much better luck with a $12 trimmer from Walmart, followed by shaving with a blade.  </li>
            <li> It worked well but eventually lost most of its charge and the head would keep snapping off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say more like 8 hours</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I have it and Prime two day</li>
            <li> I love mine -</li>
            <li> and she had said that it&#x27;s better to buy an electric razor for men for the legs.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I listen to that review</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li> I love the thing.</li>
            <li> hair gets almost all over this product if you use it like I do, and if you want to maintain it you have to take it apart and make sure all the hair is out.</li>
            <li> better than any razor on the market.</li>
            <li> in all I love this product</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very strong and cuts hair from all over the body easily.</li>
            <li> It was a great decision and the first use was amazingly easy and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof, holds a good charge, has a nice shaving foil side, and the trimmer side is great too for beard and other body hair maintenance</li>
            <li> Glides right through with a good trim without clogging up the blade.   </li>
            <li> holds a charge good, razor burn is very minimal, works good in the shower, works as good on the tree as the yard.</li>
            <li> One end is great for shaving my face, and the other end is great for trimming hair on my body, even the lower extremities.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when my package arrived.</li>
            <li> Very friendly customer service.  </li>
            <li> variable length selection is a great, but I mainly just use the shortest</li>
            <li> If you have the older model and it&#x27;s still working great, I see no reason to upgrade to this.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time and being able to use it in the shower on softened skin make it the best man hi-gene tool.</li>
            <li> I took the leap per the reviews and am just as happy with this one as I was with the older one.</li>
            <li> now it is good for about two minutes after a full charge and the the light starts blinking.</li>
            <li> Over all this is a great razor for the money I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for the good handling and shipping speed and product quality</li>
            <li> so many others have already said, this thing is great when it is new.</li>
            <li> Works great love my new trimmer</li>
            <li> It gives a very clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaves very clean, almost to the skin.</li>
            <li> Feels very comfortable on my hand and does its work easily.</li>
            <li> battery life is pretty good on this model.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good razor.</li>
            <li> The clippers on the head with the screen are pretty good</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job and is convienent.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> so I find that to be pretty good.</li>
            <li> The BodyGroom Pro is a pretty good unit for any sort of trimming or shaving needed below the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave is fairly close, it doesn&#x27;t get hot and doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> Holds the battery charges pretty good too.</li>
            <li> But it does cut the hairs pretty well and makes you look good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a good product so far, nice trimmer but could have had lower sizes for the trimming part in order to be more helpful.</li>
            <li> it comes to the first, you can use any pair of hair clippers to do just as good of a job (and</li>
            <li> This trimmer is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> so the first ones, while good, needed some improvement.  </li>
            <li> Excellent battery that retains charge for quite a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This  thing really is worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I still use this, and should probably get a new one, but this one has been great.</li>
            <li> but I was still not 100% happy so this time I just bought a brand new one</li>
            <li> think this time Norelco hit it off great this time with this new line of the men&#x27;s BodyGroom.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of cleaning up the more sensitive areas we bought it for.</li>
            <li> shaver on top is great for removing hair completely - and it doesn&#x27;t pinch, cut or leave ingrown</li>
            <li> It looks nice and charged quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a handy quick grooming device that gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer is effective and quick.</li>
            <li> a doubt I would recommend this to any man looking to safely, quickly and effectively manscape.</li>
            <li> Strong battery, stays charged for more then one session.</li>
            <li> Easy safe body shaving</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof so you can use it in the shower, though I suggest you don&#x27;t cause it works best on dry</li>
            <li> best dry.</li>
            <li> It is safe and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, safe and can be used everywhere.</li>
            <li> really easy to use, shaves well and is generally safe to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and looks nice on the its charger.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and has a nice place to store it.</li>
            <li> This product lasted me for not even one charge, so I really hope I am able to get a replacement, as it seemed to be a good product during the hour that it was functioning.</li>
            <li> but I can say this razor does a much better job and gives a much closer shave than the lady fair feminine trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This is much more comfortable to use and does a better job.</li>
            <li> The Bodygroom Pro is effective at trimming as advertised, and comes with a handy charging stand so you never need to worry about whether or not it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li> I researched available products on the market extensively and this one seems to be the best.</li>
            <li> It simply does not provide neither good trim, nor a good shave...period.</li>
            <li> This thing works great and is far better than a razor.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a good quality razor to shave the more intimate areas and men&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> It is a personal item, but if you are comfortable giving it, this gift is perfect for the guy who has tried or would like to try trimming things up.  </li>
            <li> Great product, simple and effective on the tricky to reach places.</li>
            <li> It looks good, with its stylish induction charger/stand, and it cuts through hair really well.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to try this out myself, it works just as they claim, very easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean.    </li>
            <li> Plus since its waterproof its very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean up and holds a charge longer than the directions indicate.</li>
            <li> This product has been very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> they are very easy to detach and clean.</li>
            <li> It must still be given the credit that it deserves, however, as it is still the best electric shaver I have used to date even though it does not get every single hair.</li>
            <li> I thought with all the positive reviews this would be a good shaver for a man</li>
            <li> With this \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; trimmer, I now have to use two separate trimmers to get what my first one has done for many years with great success.  </li>
            <li> With this \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; trimmer, I now have to use two separate trimmers to get what my first one has done for many years with great success.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth ignoring the top side of the shaver if that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re after!</li>
            <li> I will emphasize that this item is very smooth, easy on your skin and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice clean shave ANYWHERE on your body, easy to use, easy to handle and very easy to clean after each use.</li>
            <li> It works very smoothly and accurately.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I just got it for ma friends who needs to have a clean one everywhere!</li>
            <li> still its ok and will shave your body fine</li>
            <li> The long/thick hair buzzer seemed to struggle a bit more with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy clean up of your downstairs (good bye swamp butt).</li>
            <li> And then I read all the wonderful reviews on this product by other Amazon customers who came before me (my favorite thing about Amazon).</li>
            <li> All in all, he has only used philips shavers/trimmers - and he believes it&#x27;s good value for the money! :)</li>
            <li> It takes me from hairy beast to sexy stud quickly!  </li>
            <li> Good quality, smartly designed and does not geth hung up on anything.</li>
            <li> After reading many good reviews I decided to buy this particular trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the razor I got was just a defective one out of many good ones, but for about sixty dollars for a razor I would have rather used my money to get a decent blade</li>
            <li> Gets a nice clean, smooth shave with ZERO bumps or razerburn.  </li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s been a very good unit doing everything I&#x27;ve needed it to.  </li>
            <li> Very good on those scraggly hairs around your back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> final verdict is that it is a very good body groomer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited, because I finally found a body shaver (mostly for bikini area) that doesn&#x27;t leave bumps/redness &amp; grows in nice without any of that mind blowing itching!!</li>
            <li> The charging stand is aesthetically pleasing on the counter top which is kind of a nice unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li> Best $70 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> Really great product, not sure why they say not to use it on your beard or goatee, but I have and it works really great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for shaving everything below the neck, if youre gonna shave in the groin area use a sensitive shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I just used the razor as I feel more comfortable with that.</li>
            <li> I am not giving it 5 stars because it does not work perfect once you are wet which I was expecting before buying it.</li>
            <li> The foil shaver, however, works best while wet - like anything you need to make a close shave with.    </li>
            <li> , I assume to make it more comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> I can say that I&#x27;m pleased with the results, while not \\&quot;smooth as a babys</li>
            <li> I get better results from a cheap beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using a cheap beard trimmer for 10 years or more to do the job</li>
            <li> more importantly, the groomer never worked again.</li>
            <li> My cheap 20 buck buzzer from Walmart worked 1000x better.</li>
            <li> If you want to be smooth wherever or just some touching up, this is the gadget for the job.  </li>
            <li> I have found it works best as a wet shave in the shower using</li>
            <li> I already have a basic bodygroom, but this one was great, more power and more battery</li>
            <li> It seemed to do the job around 75% of the time, but many spots wouldn&#x27;t shave smooth.</li>
            <li> All in all this is exactly what I needed in the most convenient and effective design.</li>
            <li> Has the ability for trimming and shaving and is great on areas with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> But after some usage, you will get more comfortable and the hairs will not pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;ve been really happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; technique is the most important.</li>
            <li> Great so far.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, and most importantly is in battery life.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product, was everything I expected</li>
            <li> It worked great for those, but that is as far as I would go for face use.     </li>
            <li> This thing has given me the closest and most comfortable shave and trim that I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Great upgrade from the old style.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, it charges in a way that requires the stand, which you must fully unfold and set on a nice even surface, where it&#x27;s still pretty unstable.</li>
            <li> Also is great to trim up the old &#x27;stach.  </li>
            <li> It provided a more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> , it was amazing the hair came off like a breeze with no pain, and just fell into toliet, this product I definitely recommend to all men it is amazing!</li>
            <li> More importantly ...</li>
            <li> This device makes me feel more comfortable about my body</li>
            <li> Even works great in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> this is your first time to use this kind of product, it&#x27;s better to read the attached instructions&lt;</li>
            <li> Be sure the light is lit up and stays lit so it charges.</li>
            <li> Was in the market for a much easier and superior trimmer for my</li>
            <li> I have found that a good solution for this problem is to gently pinch the areas where the hair is not being removed and go over them with the shaver head.</li>
            <li> It charges relatively fast, and that is always a good thing.    </li>
            <li> You really feel that this is a good quality piece of machine from the minute you hold</li>
            <li> I feel that this device is a very close-to-skin trimmer and may not/won&#x27;t be as good as shaving.  </li>
            <li> It really does a good job.</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t shave the boys with the clipper end, the foil end is much safer and does a good job.</li>
            <li> I chose it because it was supposedly good for the whole body.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for your whole body but still doesn&#x27;t work as well on the groin area.  </li>
            <li> Have searched all over for a good quality trimmer and this really fits the description.</li>
            <li> Dosent shave fast or good.</li>
            <li> It really does a good job doing that.  </li>
            <li> To summarize, if you are looking for a body groomer that shaves very close, is forgiving of its use, doesn&#x27;t cut, pull or irritate your skin, this is a good one.  </li>
            <li> To summarize, if you are looking for a body groomer that shaves very close, is forgiving of its use, doesn&#x27;t cut, pull or irritate your skin, this is a good one.  </li>
            <li> fast delvery and good product</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shaver and yes, it is the best option for trimming down there.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for crack clean up as I had an ex who liked to...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as smooth as my face feels right after a good shave; smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> This is easily overcome though by repeated uses, and becoming more comfortable with handling the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer and groomer with many improvements over previous models from Norelco.  </li>
            <li> works great and super fast.</li>
            <li> Any experienced man-scaper is familiar with the erect and stretch methodology of shaving this sensitive area, but this product is not even safe to be used with that method.  </li>
            <li> This shaves and trims, and feels great in the hand, the design feels very natural and comfortable,</li>
            <li> Also I have yet to nick myself with this trimmer, which is very nice when you shave sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normal disposable razors and a steady hand work the best for that.</li>
            <li> I bought it to originally be used mostly for my chest, but I thought I could use it all over my body if need be.  </li>
            <li> As for other man-areas, very good!  </li>
            <li> I have owned 3 other types of body groomers, and I&#x27;m here to tell you that the \\&quot;Philips Norelco BG2040/34\\&quot; is THE best on the market.</li>
            <li> The other end with the screen does the job flawlessly on the twig and berries.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Build quality is top notch and mine has been running off the original charge for 2 weeks now.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, who complain about the design of the groomer and the side trimmers of this groomer, in my opinion, it has a perfect design.</li>
            <li> Like others have said one of the downsides is when it arrives its not charged and the charging time is a full 8 hours!</li>
            <li> my husband can use the clipper end for his bread which is the only good part of the shaver!</li>
            <li> Other than that, its awesome.</li>
            <li> That being said it&#x27;s the most groin friendly shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The trim feature on the bottom is great, perfect length settings and has enough umph that you don&#x27;t expect it to give out for a long while.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other two bodygroom products and I think that this is the best.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this product are TRUE!</li>
            <li> This is not like an electric razor for your face; a little more finesse is needed for best results.</li>
            <li> I am more familiar and skillful with the groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comparing to other that I used, this was the best.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Other than that I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li> but Philips Norelco is definitely the superior one!</li>
            <li> best body groomer i have found after trying other.</li>
            <li> I own the previous version but the charger good fried while I was traveling in Asia!</li>
            <li> To my surprise it was easy to take apart except the batteries are soldered in.</li>
            <li> Given the cost and being otherwise so easy to take apart</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, its great to be able to achieve the bald eagle look without the skin troubles, or even to just keep the hair short with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Both sides of the Norelco pop off or up (in the case of the trimmer) to allow for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to get carried away and this unit does it all...</li>
            <li> It would be all too easy to bump into and end up trimming where you didn&#x27;t want to.    </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean/wash-off since it is water resistant.</li>
            <li> As I stated earlier, I have used it 2 more times &amp; am still happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Love it, easy to use, easy to clean</li>
            <li> Hell, it was so easy</li>
            <li> Easy to use for both men and women.</li>
            <li> I disagree, its well designed and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy as that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be so easy to make a routine out of keeping things trimmed.  </li>
            <li> I can only assume that this thing does work great for some people and they love it.  </li>
            <li> Amazon honored the 30day money-back return policy and made returning it fairly easy although I did have to pay about $6 for the return shipping.  </li>
            <li> Easy to locate and push</li>
            <li> I did not feel any snagging and it easily followed all contours even under the chin.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is just as easy as shaving.</li>
            <li> Prior to my purchase, I waxed and shaved with great results, albeit more effort required.     </li>
            <li> Easy handling.</li>
            <li> It is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use with battery which lasts hours.</li>
            <li> With the Philips Norelco BG2040, my manscaping is made easy.</li>

            <li> My old and cheaper Norelco bodygroomer did just a good of a job if not even better.  </li>
            <li> strongly recommend it.</li>

            <li> This is NOT a professional clipper, but it is a very good clipper for the money and being portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ladies - get this one for your man and enjoy the adventure of shaving him clean!</li>
            <li> top trimmer had a real problem catching my fine chest hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well ,does take some time to recharge but over all very pleased.</li>
            <li> A smooth and more importantly PAIN FREE trimming experience.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my first time to buy a body groom, and tbh this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> The shape and the design are very appealing, and very manly.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it can be used in the shower is pretty nice also.    </li>
            <li> I had a couple of pulls but nothing remarkable or unexpected.</li>
            <li> A full charge takes about 4-5 hours and still the trimmer won&#x27;t work more than 3-4 minutes, however the shaver would work without a glitch.     </li>
            <li> AND the points are now rounded so that they do not irritate the skin, which is the most important improvement over the original.</li>
            <li> Great product..works well and does it exactly what its supposed to do battery life lasts long as well.overall good  product</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself does an average job at best.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it, I like to use it for full body grooming.  </li>
            <li> It works just as well as the day I first received it which is spectacular.</li>
            <li> Sure that are better shavers and better clippers, but this thing does both well and is very versatile.</li>
            <li> The way the charger works is pretty nice,</li>
            <li> I am first time user for this kind of product</li>
            <li> The trimmer side is pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> I liked the older model better.  </li>
            <li> The best body groomer I have ever owned hands down.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best damn trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can recharge this thing, which is so nice (pretty quick too!)</li>
            <li> Charges fast and does a good close clean shave in all areas you need to shave</li>
            <li> The Norelco Bodygroom Pro is hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> this is a great body groomer, works great for chest hair, and works really good below the waist line, if your woman likes you trim and proper down below, this will work great for you, even if you want to go totally hairless, just take your time</li>
            <li> It is also the most economical and has the best BANG 4 the BUCK rating compared to other shavers of this type.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s too soon to determine how the battery will hold up with this new generation, it&#x27;s performance is just as good</li>
            <li> Once in a while is fine but</li>
            <li> The trimmer part is fine; it gets the job done, which is why I&#x27;m giving the product a two-star rating, but it&#x27;s nothing</li>
            <li> It is unexceptional, and works fine.</li>
            <li> For shaving your face, you will have to go over the fine details with a disposable just to touch up.</li>
            <li> Using it is easy and very much secure.  </li>
            <li> On the legs and arms the trimmer works just fine no problems.    </li>
            <li> Tonight the shaver quit working (trimmer still works fine)</li>
            <li> Me and my wife uses it regulary now and it works fine.</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs is coarser and it did a fine job neatening it up.</li>
            <li> but it is fine product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to report I used it for the first time last night and did NOT have that \\&quot;OH</li>
            <li> this razor is the best i&#x27;ve seen, i&#x27;ve had it for years now and have only changed the razor head once, stills works as the first day.</li>
            <li> concentrate and you will be fine.     </li>
            <li> Designed to fit your hand, easy to manage and maneuver.</li>
            <li> I can run it freely with no guard, without worry on my chest and stomach (the ends of the teeth are rounded and don&#x27;t bite easily),</li>
            <li> I was able to successfully use my regular electric razor to get the smoothness I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> The fact that you need to replace the blade every so often is fine....</li>
            <li> Shaver side works fine</li>
            <li> But if you do, you&#x27;ll be fine.   </li>
            <li> Smooth shave, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much buy a disposable razor for a close shave and use this to trim... Happy Cleaning</li>
            <li> but you will probably still need to go in with the razor for some fine tuning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine, no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m uncertain about it&#x27;s shaving but, being Norelco, it should work fine.</li>

            <li> I purchased this over a year ago had it about a week or two and seemed to work fine, then it came on by itself, wouldn&#x27;t turn off until it drained the battery fully</li>

            <li> It lasts 10 minutes at the most (from the very first day</li>
            <li> If they can get the battery life to last 3 years plus then i&#x27;ll be more than happy to give it a full 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed right out of the box because it was easy to open, and the form fitting tray holding the unit was actually high tech molded paper, so most of the packaging was recyclable.&lt;br</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s a huge step up from it.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a huge plus</li>
            <li> This is a good razor that is comfortable to use, but it will &#x27;pull&#x27; hairs in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> The reviews of this product are accurate.</li>

            <li> Follow the instructions and diagrams for close comfortable trimming and shaving.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not going to go to town on them, but I feel comfortable not avoiding them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, that i am better at maneuvering it and in the rare event</li>
            <li> Does it take a few passes sometimes, yeah, but nothing is perfect in the world.  </li>
            <li> and yeah u can clean ur privet place like the ball so easy and</li>
            <li> (Reminds me of going into a barber shop and asking for a &#x27;light trim&#x27; and walking out as if I had just joined the Marines.)    </li>
            <li> Besides I would think you wouldn&#x27;t want to risk irritation, redness, snags, pulls, or scratches, in order to be cheap, sooooo</li>
            <li> You can have a smooth shave or a trim.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it is really easy to clean.</li>

            <li> have been fortunate not to experience any gashes or &amp;#34;craters&amp;#34; while using this shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is ergonomically designed and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It has a nice captive adjustable plastic guard you can set the length with.</li>
            <li> and I can certainty say it shaves smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cuts well and fits in my hand comfortably.</li>
            <li> After reading some mixed reviews, I can say that this item works great.  </li>
            <li> it did a fantastic job on my chest/stomach and below.</li>
            <li> Flimsy and too light charger/holder  </li>
            <li> its easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> No pinching no nicks nothing just baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li> The ease with which the blade guard can be installed, adjusted, removed is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The adjustable trimmer on the opposite end is a great feature too.</li>
            <li> but everything was going so well and looking so smooth</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean .</li>
            <li> However, I still had to risk the use of a manual razor because it just didn&#x27;t get it as smooth as I would like.</li>
            <li> and it is so smooth it even feels</li>
            <li> It is very well designed, fits in the hand nicely, and trims well.</li>
            <li> The comb on the cutter head is cheap and flexes.</li>
            <li> my nether regions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried multiple electric groomers, some work great, others just slice and dice.</li>
            <li> The groomer is lightweight and curved perfectly to fit your hand.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I am quite happy with this shaver and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for trimming the back of your neck between haircuts.</li>

            <li> The plastic parts looks cheap and non durable.</li>
            <li> Since this was purchased primarily as an electric shaver for the face we are returning.</li>
            <li> The instruction says to use up all the juice in the battery before charging, but I have used it 4 times now and the indicator light has not come on yet.</li>
            <li> With the Bodygroomer I have just smooth skin and no irritation in the nether regions.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves the skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>

            <li> This is a great tool for any male to have!</li>
            <li> Both foil and electric parts easy to clean.</li>
            <li> there are many kinds of products like this out there, but I have toy say, that this, is totally worth it</li>
            <li> But the BG charger/cradles are cheap.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic.</li>
            <li> It shaves smoothly and has never once nicked my balls or cock.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Followed all the instructions in regards to not charging the battery until the light indicates it&#x27;s time and waiting until it&#x27;s fully charged.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect groomer, I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I can see how this would be great for larger areas of hair..</li>

            <li> Now daddy is a smooth customer</li>
            <li> It is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li> Smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> Works great for body hair, but not as well if you want to use it to keep stubble on your face (was hoping to only have 1 razor).</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great for the trimming of key areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient in the sense that both heads trim hair and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and no pulling at all..</li>
            <li> He really likes it and says it has a nice weight to it.</li>

            <li> I am used to getting the cheap trimmers from Target or Walmart for under $20 -</li>
            <li> Use it repeatedly without recharging until you see it&#x27;s indicator light flash orange -</li>
            <li> It seems a bit cheap</li>
            <li> Great improvement over the former model which was antiquated and not durable.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave any cuts and works smoothly.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for baby bottom smooth, ditch the razors and just use Nair.    </li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I shave my skin smooth for athletic purposes and dealing with the summer heat at work.</li>
            <li> Its very flexible and handy.</li>
            <li> A great tool for the obvious ----</li>
            <li> Shaving smooth my chest hair</li>
            <li> I moved to my lower area where I am smooth also.  </li>
            <li> The thought of taking a razor to my body didn&#x27;t sound manly.</li>
            <li> I have used it for the last 3 months and it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> fairly secure</li>
            <li> The rounded edges of the guard, on the trimmer, slide smoothly over skin without scratching or pinching.</li>
            <li> The pivoting head provides a comfortable shave in curvy areas.</li>
            <li> While the \\&quot;manual\\&quot; says it&#x27;s not intended to be used above the neck, it does still also work great for trimming your beard or side burns.</li>
            <li> To get the rest though, it will take some time, if you want it to be baby smooth.</li>
            <li> Sometime it will sound as if it&#x27;s going to die soon, but it will still go for a bit longer.</li>
            <li> It will just take some finesse (and perhaps some satisfaction of not getting SOME areas as smooth as you&#x27;d like)</li>
            <li> The actual device and how it functions was great.</li>
            <li> The actual device and how it functions was great.</li>
            <li> The groomer works fantastic.</li>
            <li> The charger stand takes about 30 seconds to get used to/figure out how to fit the shaver on it, but I didn&#x27;t read the instructions that came with it either.</li>
            <li> Not plasticy or cheap feeling.  </li>
            <li> the edge trimmer to lightly skim the skin of the sack.</li>
            <li> Smooth skin every time.</li>
            <li> Compact and easy to use will recomend it to any bear who likes to be shaved in..easy to clean and store</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a FANTASTIC groomer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t buzz smooth to skin.</li>
            <li> Close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> i am using it regularly and its works great.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and mantain both heads of the product.</li>
            <li> Keep the skin pulled taut and tread lightly until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> The bottom is great for trimming my goatee, and has 5 different length settings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great... not practical for back neck shaving (according to my wife)  </li>
            <li> that isn&#x27;t smooth and</li>
            <li> and there is a charging light on the device.</li>
            <li> It is very waterproof, and it glides nicely using body wash as shaving cream.</li>
            <li> My whole body is looking nicely groomed, since I started using the Norelco</li>
            <li> Smooth as eggs with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> Great product and obviously a beast.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is also more economical as it is priced below $20.</li>
            <li> Will get you smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Very well built and looks nice.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I saw the ominous blinking light of my Philips Norelco Bodygroom razor.</li>
            <li> BodyGroom Pro models avoids flaws A through D, and actually has not detachable pieces, which is great.</li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because the battery life isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> Now you have to realize a shave will never get you a smooth shave like a razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and charge.</li>
            <li> This thing makes me a silky smooth honey badger.</li>
            <li> Easy to charge, use and clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> On some areas of my chest and stomach, it chopped the hairs off no issue; smooth as glass.</li>
            <li> This item was for my son, who thinks it is a great trimmer, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> My legs are so smooth, along with everything else I&#x27;ve shaved.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if it isn&#x27;t pink or dainty looking or that it doesn&#x27;t have a girly name.</li>
            <li> The shaving end does not work as well, but will provide a smooth and painless shave with some effort.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t light up when you put it in the charging dock</li>
            <li> In the questions area there is a tip on replacing the cheap rechargeable batteries with 2 AAA batteries.</li>
            <li> but I have used it trim my beard, and used electric shave with it to shave my face and was just as smooth as proglide and faster</li>
            <li> Great motor that powers through coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Fifty bucks for a year of shaving, not such a great deal.</li>
            <li> Even then it never gave me anything close to a smooth effect.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts forever it seems, and the device is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It works well as a hair clipper and beard trimmer, and cuts all body hair gently and effectively.</li>
            <li> Leaves you smooth like a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> so they look and feel smooth.</li>
            <li> The blades are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The product is definitely sleek and attractive.</li>
            <li> The groomer is easy to clean, you just pop off the head and rinse it off with water.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculously smooth.</li>
            <li> It will not get it as smooth</li>
            <li> This thing worked great, did everything as advertised until about 18 months of occasional use when the battery stopped holding a charge.</li>
            <li> It clips body hair smoothly without pulling.  </li>
            <li> and it is completely smooth and silky, tis all.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a baby smooth finish then just stick with a razor.</li>
            <li> like they said get the skin nice and taut haha..</li>
            <li> As a big guy with my share of chest hair that i wanted gone i can say this groomer works great.</li>
            <li> It is great on the arms and legs, chest and back and under arms.</li>
            <li> REMEMBER that area has not seen the light of day since you were 11 yr.</li>
            <li> It takes some finess to get comfortable, but this thing rocks.  </li>
            <li> But never expect silky smooth, anywhere, with this shaver.</li>
            <li> This means that it is fantastic for smooth skin, but not for wrinkled skin.  </li>
            <li> I definitely enjoy the product and will continue to use.  </li>
            <li> Those reviews made it sound as if one would be taking an electric hacksaw to his nether regions.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for male grooming.</li>
            <li> it is great that it trims only what it is intended to trim.</li>
            <li> Initially when I get each time the battery is great.</li>
            <li> It shaves and trims smoothly without any problems.</li>
            <li> No rash, no pain, no itching, just smooth, hairless areas.</li>
            <li> Easy to charge, clean and store.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job when it is charged.</li>
            <li> However, I think I got too comfortable with the groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> groomer itself is comfortable to hold and use, and the shaving head can be used moving in either direction.</li>
            <li> I do feel comfortable using it though, just don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The larger part of the shaver is great for shaving your balls.</li>
            <li> trimmer side is both effective and gentle enough to use anywhere on your body, and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the actual grooming, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> it makes them so smooth</li>
            <li> the battery is good also if its near to end its will light orange</li>
            <li> I seen this shaver and heard several good reviews, so I gave it a shot, and i&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> However, with most trimmers/clippers, if you want a very close trim or near-shave, you will need to remove the plastic guards, and that&#x27;s when you start being able to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> The repair man should in all good conscious wear gloves.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Does a good job so far in aiding in my metro endeavors.  </li>
            <li> Lets just say that, after suffering through a whole host of similar products, over the years, this one works PERFECTLY, with no rashes, nicks,</li>
            <li> I find it works pretty good in the shower if a body wash has been applied first to lubricate the skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a must buy for the man who wants to stay perfectly groomed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t in good conscious recommend this product to anybody.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> not all that good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s vital to stretch out the area you are shaving, as that will result in the most effective trim.</li>
            <li> Its also classy and looks good whiles being charged.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It is also a sturdier product that feel better in the hand and looks better, with the stainless finish, too.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Save time and money just using your good old razor blade.</li>
            <li> Explaining to me the BG2020 was discontinued she immediately shipped out the BG2040, which is superior in nearly every metric to the BG2020.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BG2040</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Good product, but as with most gadgets in my house its currently collecting dust.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> good if you have sensitive skin as you can shave every day if you want and it leaves no rash at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> seems good quality so far</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> i could not have made a better choice, its easy to use, comfortable on the skin and it does exactly what it is advertised in the product description.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve found the right product so buy it and get those smooth goods you want!</li>
            <li> However, right when I used it, I fell in love.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I just waited until I NEEDED it, and then just charged it right before, it would be better on the battery.</li>
            <li> This is the most efficient product of its nature in the market right now.....</li>
            <li> Also make sure you put it in the charger the right way or it wont charge.</li>
            <li> So this is a very good razor/shaver except the other day I was shaving my head</li>
            <li> I thought it will be clean and fine shave any where on the body.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is easy to use, easy to clean, charges quickly</li>
            <li> FAST Shipping!!!</li>
            <li> A regular razor will LITERALLY do a better job at shaving than this!!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t something where you just grab a shaver or razor and master the first time!!</li>
            <li> Very worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The trimmer on the side opposite the shaver is very handy for shortening leg hair, etc.</li>
            <li> However, that is very rare.</li>
            <li> clipping end (with adjustable size) gets clogged with hair very easily, making it a pain to clip large areas at a time</li>
            <li> What makes the design unique is how it allows a comfortable shave without the risk of skin irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the original Bodygroom and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> The original batteries were cheap junk.</li>
            <li> But other than that it&#x27;s still the best groomer you can find right now.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that both sides of this shaver are perfect for different purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver side actually does a great finishing job on my face</li>
            <li> Works fine on women too! ;)&lt;</li>
            <li> The clipper end did better, and got most of the busy bits out, but the trimmer just couldn&#x27;t finish the job, even on my legs, which should be easy.</li>
            <li> The shaver head is a bit of a pain to keep clean, but the waterproofing is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> My skin is as clean and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> He got it and says he loves how easy it is and how it makes grooming quick.</li>
            <li> It has a pretty good battery life,  but what I really got it for was for shaving those \\&quot;other\\&quot; areas of my body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a leap of faith the first time you apply it to your junk and rake it across, but when you feel how smooth the trim is and how it does not cut or burn your tender bits, you will groom more aggressively.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, I found what I wanted, ordered it, and am very pleased with my Philips Norelco Bodygroom.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He said it doesn&#x27;t pull on his hair when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is easy to charge, and quick to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quickly and easily cleans up below the waist with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, cleaning is also quick and easy.</li>
            <li> If you want to take care of body hair quickly and easily, give it a try.</li>
            <li> For most of my life, I&#x27;ve been pretty cheap about grooming.</li>
            <li> I own both the Mangroomer (older model) and</li>
            <li> /&gt;This really is a perfect shaver - I spent 60 bucks on my first electric shaver because I trusted people buying this from Amazon, so hopefully you can trust my two thumbs up here too.</li>
            <li> It works great and is so much easier and quicker than using a normal razor.  </li>
            <li> you have hair you want to get rid of, would like something easy that works well and recharges quickly</li>
            <li> This groomer has a nice, solid feel and is very easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, well constructed body shaver at a fairly reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with the ease and pain-free way that I&#x27;m able to virtually eliminate all of my hair down there.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quality, effective pair of \\&quot;body\\&quot; clippers; theseare definately highly recommend by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have a bunch of parts separate from the unit, which makes this the best for no clutter and taking up very little room.  </li>
            <li> An orange light also blinks when the unit is about to die and that light comes on fairly quickly even after it&#x27;s been charging for hours.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, easy, and safe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes off really easily to wash, and so far works like a charm during warm showers.</li>
            <li> It recharges quickly and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> At no point have I experienced any more itching than is typical when unshaven.  </li>
            <li> I experienced any more itching than is typical when unshaven.  </li>
            <li> but you have to make sure the light goes on, there isn&#x27;t a positive click or anything when you rest it on the cradle.    </li>
            <li> It is a good trimmer, but it will pinch your skin if not careful.</li>
            <li> The Nair for Men I had originally used never gave me any issues when putting it on my junk even when leaving it for 15+ minutes on there.  </li>
            <li> First, for touching up the sides to stay within regulations, then for the nether regions soon after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty unstable, it could be better.</li>
            <li> I would leave the unit charging but it would never get a full charge according to the light on it.  </li>
            <li> Friendly</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the original BodyGroom because the blade kept falling out and the battery was dying.  </li>
            <li> For the most part, you can be pretty reckless with this thing and not hurt yourself.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I bought this about 9 months ago and for the first 6 months it worked, mostly.</li>
            <li> I originally set it on the longest setting, as a bit of a precautionary thing.</li>
            <li> My son had no trouble at all using the Phillips Norelco BodyGroom Pro and is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed with this one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It has a modern a suitable design.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I lost 24 pounds and was excited to try this shaver.  </li>
            <li> wrote my original review on this product in January 2011.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this, you&#x27;re probably as excited about this product as I was, after reading all the glowing reviews of it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s lowest setting its leaving a significant amount of hair, and if you take it off you&#x27;re going to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unique  features and</li>
            <li> thats a small price to pay for awesome though.</li>
            <li> worth it´s price!  </li>
            <li> This is the ultimate groom solution for any man who wants to keep his body&#x27;s hairs tidy and looking good without waxing or using scisors &amp; etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t perform as well as the original.  </li>
            <li> I became used to flying through my manscaping on the original.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it just took more getting used to that I was willing to give it.</li>
            <li> This unit tends to pull and snag and has a significant ouch factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> charge cradle is small and fits perfectly in my medicine cabinet sideways with the Razer in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure my husband will want to use this now though.</li>
            <li> I know this is kind of a pricey item but worth far more than what you can get for $20 cheaper.  </li>
            <li> You can see my original review below.</li>
            <li> After about 6 months it began to weaken significantly to the point</li>
            <li> I wanted this for a long time and was so happy I did.</li>
            <li> I am still using the original BodyGroomer</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately though, I was able to replace the batteries in my unit with much higher quality rechargeable batteries and now it works like a dream.</li>
            <li> Yes, I know most people would have stopped the first time it sank</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> I have used it on the MOST tender of areas, and I think you have to be pretty reckless to receive a nip from this one, regardless of which end you are working with.  </li>
            <li> However, the shaver part seems to grab/pull hairs which I never had a problem with the original.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Beyond cleaning it under tap water, I haven&#x27;t tested the waterproofness of this, although I understand that might be a significant factor for some.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good, but I&#x27;m not jumping up and down about how good it is.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, comfortable, no snags...lasted about 2 years, buying another right now.</li>
            <li> b) Make sure you clean up first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many of the other BodyGroom models, and this model is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> other option is buying two, good and cheap trimmers than this one, better but costly.</li>
            <li> Works great, hold a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> great machine and the battery lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> u clean ..    </li>
            <li> This product will have your skin super smooth though.</li>
            <li> Makes quick work of hair, but doesn&#x27;t cut quite as smooth or close as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> Rounded foil head is a godsend keeping those leg/torso junction areas neat and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can adjust the depth of the one end to trim my goat, adjust the depth again to trim my eyebrows, then flip it over to clean up the perimeter of the goat, my sideburns, and remove anything on my neck and ears.  </li>
            <li> I can reach it, I can trim it cleanly and painlessly with this unit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that the trimmer works great; I have another trimmer and used it in various \\&quot;areas\\&quot; with some success, but also with some problems that I haven&#x27;t had with this one.  </li>
            <li> The shaves aren&#x27;t perfectly smooth or even, but it&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t provide a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I have purchased and used all kinds of personal grooming devices and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I also take the guard off to clean up my neck before using a razor.</li>
            <li> But overall, it&#x27;s a nice product :]</li>
            <li> This takes care of the issue quickly and leaves you smooth and silky without causing razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Dry, it works great.  </li>
            <li> But since the quality of the trim is good, the simple adjustment isn&#x27;t a huge inconvenience.   </li>
            <li> Just pop the trim selector off and wipe it clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit, as my primary electric razor from Braun really isn&#x27;t up to the task of shaving the rest of my body, and this seemed much more convenient.  </li>
            <li> I quickly became comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is, take a shower and really clean your self    </li>
            <li> Both heads detach to clean out any hair that might have gotten stuck.</li>
            <li> Provides a clean and neat shave without cuts or irritation.  </li>
            <li> So, after jumping in the shower, soap up and clean rinse yourself off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The biggest and most important flaw is this shaver doesn&#x27;t get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Quality is good, it feels very solid and comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> or it would bite me, and found I had to keep going over places again and again and again before they were clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous shavers, from manual to electric, and this is by far one of the best.  </li>
            <li> My daughters had great fun shaving papa bear back and then talcing me up.</li>
            <li> You must be careful though, because its still blades moving really fast, but it&#x27;s the best yet.  </li>
            <li> to clean the head I will sometimes take the head off and use a can of compressed air</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t know how to pull the head off in order to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, but the last one I had lasted a good 3-4 years before it ate through the razor guard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If youre looking for a clean shave, trust me, this isnt it.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> , like me, you clean out this tool after each use, that means that you also take off the Comb Guide as well.</li>
            <li> I like to use it to trim my bear and keep my neck clean.  </li>
            <li> The idea is good in having a blade on each end but the handle is only comfortable when using the rounded end.  </li>
            <li> It really works great, doesn&#x27;t nick you up even in the sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> but there is no product that can clean as well as</li>
            <li> Well designed and clean groomer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaver doesn&#x27;t give a clean finish and shave</li>
            <li> I have to couple of times to get clean shave or groom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several others and this is by far the best body trimmer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Lightweight easy to use, powerful with a close cut.</li>
            <li> I have tried to clean it thinking</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide a super close shave, but it&#x27;s a really quick and easy way to take care of the job.</li>
            <li> All I do is replace the head and blades once a year, clean and charge the unit.</li>
            <li> Since i am an owner of 3 different kinds of Philips Norelco products The bodygroomer 7100 , Norelco Click and Style and the old G bread trimmer i can say that Norelco will NEVER make the perfect product.</li>
            <li> Glides smoothly and removes hair quickly.</li>
            <li> It irritates my skin after shaving and it doesn&#x27;t give a perfectly clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just remove the shaver or trimmer as instructed and clean away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Somewhat tricky to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different groomers and this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> and i like it alot and thanks and good bye and thanks again</li>
            <li> The features it has are all well and good, the cool charging cradle works well, and it&#x27;s very nice to be waterproof, but the plastic adapter that covers the bottom part is simply too big</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to be able to speed up grooming around the special bits, and still maintain a fairly close shave with minimal pain and difficulty.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on Amazon (mostly positive) I decided to pull the trigger and test this out.</li>
            <li> but most were positive.  </li>
            <li> but after reading many positive reviews, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have experience with other razors like this, but this one is easy to use and is very effective.</li>
            <li> I mostly use the hair trimming side (the end that has the adjustable length guide) since I only want to keep things tidy rather than go for the full bald effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for trimming and keep body hair neatly in check, especially in areas that can be intimate spots for some special person!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has exceeded my expectations of fair and works excellently.&lt;br /&gt;Wet or Dry, this trims well, cleans easy, charges fast and is an all-around good</li>
            <li> much easier to use and very smooth trimmer.</li>
            <li> I wish the clipper attachment was a more sturdy kind of plastic, it does bend fairly easy so be careful</li>
            <li> After my SO refused to express an opinion on body hair, I decided to go for the full clean shaven look, it went over</li>
            <li> I had the original, loved it, then lost it in a move, and wasn&#x27;t in the financial ballpark to buy another.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d more readily buy the original.</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to catch up before a shave, and 1 second later trims my beard perfectly, then under the faucet for a rinse.</li>
            <li> Replacing the old one with a new one; having the shaver + trimmer all in one was pretty nice, and it did a good job.</li>
            <li> It works great in all the hard to reach areas and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Specially for those who want legit trimmer.      </li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I use to have an older version of this product, but after 2 or 3 years, is out of order and needed to replace, I tried so far two times and I am quite happy with it.       </li>
            <li> This mode is much easier to clean and does a much better job at trimming armpit hair.</li>
            <li> Its a very good everyday tool.</li>
            <li> First time you use it, it may take a little longer until you get the best flow and direction for use of the device.  </li>
            <li> I read all the glowing reviews on here and was super excited to try this out.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about this newer, supposedly improved, version of the BodyGroom.  </li>
            <li> It works great for Male genital area and is very gentle.</li>
            <li> Works great a little heavy to maneuver the underside of groin area but with help it is perfect!</li>
            <li> The trimmer side is much more effective when dry (great for trimming underarms) and the shaver side is great both dry and wet.</li>
            <li> Any guy willing and brave enough to test drive a body groomer on their boys</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be throwing them away after not much use because the quality really isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> Great body gromer, works as expected even after two years of purchase</li>
            <li> Does a great grooming job, just need to be careful as then edges</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pity.. could be a great product...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so ticked off because I gave this device great praise when I first got it the first time, I praised it thinking I had found my miracle for grooming those sensitive area&#x27;s without the fear and pain of getting bit or cut and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Clean easily with hot water.</li>
            <li> for all who try the old model they know its really nice</li>
            <li> That makes sure I don&#x27;t take off too much.  </li>
            <li> started shaving the top part of the shaft with the trimmer and it went really well up until (GULP)</li>
            <li> I was cool.  </li>
            <li> I use it full body, and I don&#x27;t pinched or nicked.</li>
            <li> I love the stainless steel, that it&#x27;s made out of too.  </li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s a clean shave (as close as a razor, but with much less attendant ingrown hair irritation) or a meticulous, even-haired trim, this product&#x27;s one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame since the overall quality of the shaver is quite good otherwise.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it, I felt much more comfortable with it and felt I did a better job.    </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good purchase</li>
            <li> What everyone here is saying is true, this electric razor is da bomb.  </li>
            <li> Looks good on my shelve next to  my sink.</li>
            <li> Good for trimming only.</li>
            <li> the bottom is a more intense trimmer designed to cut longer hair for refined grooming.</li>
            <li> The pivoting head is great for sensitive areas, Ive never gotten such a close and SAFE shave on the hanging twins.</li>
            <li> This COULD have been a really good personal shaver.</li>
            <li> Oh and chicks dig a hairless package as much as we dig their hairless area :)</li>
            <li> I have to say the BG 2020 lasted me a good 6 years, being in the shower constantly, only coming out to be charged.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, modern men like to groom themselves more than ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth mentioning I am not a hairy person, but I do like to keep a couple of areas completely free of any hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After an hour between the shower and bath, the only thing I found this good for was just the areas I had razor bumps on and the &#x27;starfish&#x27; area.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed it so much that I decided to purchase one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bump Patrol cool shave gel that I get through StockNGo</li>
            <li> The pivot head is one of the Key additions that makes the model superior, reduces any possibilty of cuttes or close calls.</li>
            <li> but i would stick to the razor for more gentle areas.</li>
            <li> WHY are the reviews on Amazon so often full of lies?  </li>
            <li> Was able to trim my &amp;#34;lady parts&amp;#34; neat and get a very close shave on my legs.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, sturdy, overall nice.</li>
            <li> Safely cuts real close to remove unwanted body hair.</li>
            <li> , I really could not ask for more from a product.</li>
            <li> We use it for our more intimate areas.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could return it for a full refund.    </li>
            <li> It really does charge in 50 minutes, which is one of my favorite things.  </li>
            <li> I also like the styling of it and the battery last for a good while.</li>
            <li> It was simple and felt like good quality.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the batteries are not quite as good as they should be but last a good while.  </li>
            <li> a no thrills electric razor that isn&#x27;t good enough for your face, nor does it give a close shave anywhere else on your body.</li>
            <li> I have opted for full body waxes instead.</li>
            <li> It does not shave the face, the clippers are the only thing good on this product</li>
            <li> still doesn&#x27;t cut my sideburns or trims close enough to make it any good.  </li>
            <li> its true</li>
            <li> /trim is good and is built to last.</li>
            <li> it looks that cool.</li>
            <li> It trims very well, probably better than the 2020.</li>
            <li> It really is a full body trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to have as a back up, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I would charge it until full, take it off and leave it alone until use.</li>
            <li> You do need to go slow &amp; take your time until you figure out which direction works best for you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that the preference varies among the user how close or how much you want to be groomed, so I didn&#x27;t feel the need to knock off a star or take that into account when reviewing the product.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, to my bewilderment, this thing really works, and better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> I loved that trimmer when I returned to the states I used my universal converter</li>
            <li> The dual ends is cool.</li>
            <li> I walked out into my living room after shaving where there was natural light coming through the window and the light made hairs show up like magic that I couldn&#x27;t see before in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> how soft and nice the shaved area after using this machine.</li>
            <li> It cuts close enough to the skin and is good at edging.</li>
            <li> This is solidly constructed shaver that feels good in your hand.  </li>
            <li> Even though the instructions state not to use the foil shaver above your neck, I have been using it on my face and it works good.    </li>
            <li> I have had at least three groomers and this Norelco is the best.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll of course get the best results when you take things slow when using this.</li>
            <li> full shaved ..amazing alll around body groomer</li>
            <li> I would recommend to any man keeping a beard full and neat.</li>
            <li> Worked fairly well for trimming unwanted body hair, but the battery life vanished after several months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found there&#x27;s a nice rocking action to the shaver end</li>
            <li> This sucker works great!</li>
            <li> man!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That may be true...</li>
            <li> This product is as stated in the Ads, a good groomer where you can maintain different areas the way you like.</li>
            <li> you really have someone in mind that you&#x27;d just love to give them this as a \\&quot;gift\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x60;t used more than 20min with my legs, very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it comes with a more modern looking base.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is that I&#x27;m returning both guides for full credit and will retire my Bodygroom.</li>
            <li> I heard good things about the 2040 and decided to just go to the next level.  </li>
            <li> For instance, the screen-end doesn&#x27;t save any time over shaving with a good standard multi-blade razor.</li>
            <li> a 20 minute recharge at most and it is ready.</li>
            <li> It had a full charge after that.  </li>
            <li> it will keep this shaver in top condition and really get rid of the stuble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you know if it is charging or not, it lights up when the battery is full</li>
            <li> This one is nice and working well so far.</li>
            <li> this is a good product, the only thing there may be a question about</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s safe to admit that I was really scared.</li>
            <li> and the full charge lasts about 5 shaves for me.</li>
            <li> I have been a true Philips Norelco fan since beginning - but this product made me vouch for it to all buyers..</li>
            <li> I have a Panasonic ES-LA63 full size razor that I use for my face and some on my body</li>
            <li> But overall it does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li> This thing is the champ of body hair remover, faster than a razor and a quick clean job and the wife sneaks it to trim her peach to.</li>
            <li> Love it, it really works.</li>
            <li> It runs something like 5 minutes on a full charge and then requires a recharge.</li>
            <li> The shaver is really gentle and the Bodygroom Pro has a countouring/pivoting head that moves making for a better shave.</li>
            <li> and while it worked fairly well (only one nick with foil&#x27;s comb, which the trimmer in the BG2040 helps to mitigate happening again), I couldn&#x27;t stand the charging routine that NiCad batteries require.  </li>
            <li> If you have been reading the reviews on this they are all true.</li>
            <li> Having two layers of trimming power really makes this product worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> When I started my research for a versatile body groomer for my sensitive areas, I first looked at Norelco products and this one had good reviews.</li>
            <li> Not a bad razor at all..</li>
            <li> Its not bad.</li>
            <li> not a bad thing but not my preference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a whole new one hoping it would work as great as the first one I purchased before replacing the head on it.</li>
            <li> Well, this sleekly designed and easy to use body groomer is just the ticket to safely and professionally get the look (and feel) that we want.</li>
            <li> So, as a lady, I have previously owned and loved a Panasonic lady&#x27;s shaver, but wanted to see if I could find something that was shaped better - ie.</li>
            <li> is a noticeably better made product superior in manufacture and use (the motor vibrates less and is quieter</li>
            <li> It is simple to operate, easy to manipulate and effective.</li>
            <li> This is the first full body groomer that I have used worry-free!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Resuming:: it is one of the best electronic products I&#x27;ve ever bought, the cost/benefit is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> The razor works better than the other models and the 2 different sides are perfect for triming and shaving.</li>
            <li> Gaining confidence from other reviewers, I used it and am very pleased with the results!  </li>
            <li> and I mean everywhere and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom all over and my ego is through the roof right now.  </li>
            <li> when i was read the positive responding i was enthusiastic to much of the product.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Charging is pretty easy --</li>
            <li> Charging is pretty easy --</li>
            <li> First of all, the plug comes out easily, so if you pick up the cradle the plug may fall out.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to trim the verge quite easily and quickly with the old model.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer on the back with the guard removed helped to clean up the areas missed but not as smooth as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comes apart easy after you figure it out the first time for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can hold the guard in place pretty easily so it doesn&#x27;t move if you are nervous about that.</li>
            <li> A quick charge on the stand was all it took for a full charge and there wasn&#x27;t a nick on me afterward.</li>
            <li> Parts remove easily for cleaning and it does exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take any risk if you are grooming your private parts, with this one you do it secure and fully confident!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s tight and let this great trimmer mow it smooth.  </li>
            <li> A regular   old razor is much more effective, quicker, and you get a better shave.  </li>
            <li> For the most part, this is the best product I&#x27;ve used for shaving my testicles &amp; genital area as razors are tedious, but I am very cautious and keep the skin pulled smooth!  </li>
            <li> This shaver leaves the skin super smooth when used right.</li>
            <li> So... read other reviews to confirm this is an uncommon issue.</li>
            <li> I had the original BG2020 when it was released and rarely used it.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it works great</li>
            <li> However every other area it is great.</li>
            <li> Other guys have given it great reviews</li>
            <li> this its a great groomer because has 2 sides to select if you dont want anything of hair or select the other side to control the lenght</li>
            <li> The BodyGroom Pro is so much better than the original BodyGroom that Philips should have chosen a new name for this product.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best trimmer I have ever owned, and I only buy top of line electronics.  </li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream or even be in the shower, this is extremely helpful for quick touchups on the fly and convenient.</li>
            <li> The two different heads, work very well and gives a very nice shave, easy to use and very fast..</li>
            <li> For the new ones getting into trimming and more so shaving please PLEASE PLEASE:  - clean yourself well  - go in one direction (for now)  - take your time (go in stages)  </li>
            <li> This is must have for every man care about his clean and keep the smell fresh.</li>
            <li> Using actively twice a week, great shaver and trimmer.</li>
            <li> This shaver is super fast for body shaving and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The cutter is constructed of cheap material, and the motor does not turn fast enough to warrant a good, clean and even trim of my goatee.  </li>
            <li> Yes its safe for your most private parts.</li>
            <li> Quick reCharge.</li>
            <li> The product shipped and was received quickly with out any troubles.    </li>
            <li> a quick word on the &amp;#34;3D Pivoting Head&amp;#34; that they advertise.  </li>
            <li> I quickly learned that there was nothing to worry about.  </li>
            <li> Great Product, Price but battery is already dying fast after only about a dozen uses.</li>
            <li> did what it was supposed to do quick, close shave.</li>
            <li> Seems to be well built especially the attractive stainless metal and rubber grip housing.  </li>
            <li> It recharges fairly quickly and holds its charge well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working out recently and after starting to see some awesome results, the hair all over just wasn&#x27;t complementing me.  </li>
            <li> But after a month - and after the time to get the item returned - the battery just quickly faded.  </li>
            <li> It glided effortlessly through all parts doing the job quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the older model, but people are really satisfied with it.    </li>
            <li> I quickly gave up and just decided to return it.  </li>
            <li> It will also help clean out the hair from the razor head by absorbing any skin oil/moisture and thus the hair can just be blown/brushed out easily for cleanup.      </li>
            <li> However, I feel that the cheaper older models work better; giving me a smoother closer shave.</li>
            <li> Typically I am a loyal Norelco user.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(You can also take the guide off to quickly shave longer</li>
            <li> This razor took care of that problem; you can get a quick shave</li>
            <li> Just go slow on the family jewels, otherwise, welcome to a more hairless world.</li>
            <li> I can get an even smoother shave if I spend a great deal of time (10-15 minutes), but this really isn&#x27;t practical for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 7100 is a striking improvement over the older model.</li>
            <li> I found it was working quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> It might be ok for trimming beards, but a proper trimmer will do better.</li>
            <li> the older one is better.  </li>
            <li> The build seems adequate</li>
            <li> That one the battery died rather quickly in my opinion.</li>
            <li> If you move too quickly it will pull on your skin and cause irritation.</li>
            <li> It even shaves better than the older model.  </li>
            <li> The older models were better.</li>
            <li> and this is my quick view on this product.</li>
            <li> I am super hairy below the neck</li>
            <li> received my product quickly.</li>
            <li> I was lucky</li>
            <li> : The trimmer is decent, but could be better.</li>
            <li> I was able to reach most of my back which has always been a problem.</li>
            <li> so I can give myself a quick shave when in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Really seems like the battery life should be better for a rarely used groomer.  </li>
            <li> : Requires multiple passes with the razor part to get all hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an awesome product for all necessary body-hair grooming needs!</li>
            <li> The pivoting head on the larger end is a welcome feature I did not know I needed and makes for a much safer, smoother trim.</li>
            <li> I use it for a quick face shave if I don&#x27;t have time to shave with a razor.</li>
            <li> The cost from Amazon was also a plus and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Very practical and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Cuts quickly and zero pulling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky if I can trim my chest before it dies on</li>
            <li> So, I decided to buy the latest model since the charger for the older one was about $13.</li>
            <li> Until we got this Norelco BodyGroom Pro which is Super</li>
            <li> You want that nice smooth look, especially the boys, this is your go to.  </li>
            <li> Eazy to handle and quick to charge.  </li>
            <li> overall strategy is that I have begun using this as a day-to-day in the shower to keep hair neat and under control, and will periodically use a razor to get a nice, smooth finish.</li>
            <li> You do need to be careful in sensitive areas because no shaver will be perfect.</li>
            <li> I decided to get something actually made for multi-use and that was claimed to have better a better battery-type that also hopefully didn&#x27;t take hours to charge.  </li>
            <li> For those men that like to keep the bonsai (as Philips Norelco calls it) looking nice there is no other choice than this.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle and light pressure required.</li>
            <li> But given its obvious purpose as a groomer for MEN, particularly the hirsute subgroup, it seems remarkable that the design team omitted to consider that men are no more able to shave their backs alone than fly without wings.</li>
            <li> The trimming end works great to tame armpits and bikini areas, and the shaving end gives a close but comfortable shave elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This product on the other hand is very very effective.</li>
            <li> The shaver portion does a great job on the &amp;#34;boys&amp;#34; and I love the smooth feeling there and am addicted to it now.</li>
            <li> I used the trimmer side to trim the hair short and then applied baby powder so that the foil can glide more easily, and then the shaving side shaved it clean off.</li>
            <li> my razor bumps from normal shaving cleared up and smoothed out my skin a bit, this shaver is doing better.  </li>
            <li> The shaver did a fantastic job on most parts but not very well on the more contoured areas.</li>
            <li> It is also waterproof making clean up easy, especially for me since using it in the shower means not having to lay out towels on the floor and sink top to catch all the falling hair.</li>
            <li> Results: after the first day of use, the hair was still smooth</li>
            <li> willing to return it and buy a cheap haircut machine that is cordless.  </li>
            <li> normally write humorous reviews, just to be an a-hole.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very glad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one of them, so that might be the reason why using normal razors are better for</li>
            <li> For the first couple uses it works fantastic</li>
            <li> The clippers work well, but I recommend just buying better quality hair clippers for a lower price, and then using a normal 4-5 blade razor for shaving.</li>
            <li> First body groomer that I enjoy using.</li>
            <li> I just trimmed the very top of my chest and back of</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for body grooming, scissors, razors, other grooming tools from Amazon, this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> If you do not care about how long it can hold a charge, I would recommend you buy it because it is a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> Fair price to equipment value (far cheaper than many facial shavers)  </li>
            <li> I wanna say that this is an overpriced product, but then I&#x27;d be saying that it&#x27;s worth buying at a lower price, which isn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;chrome looked not so good after long period of using</li>
            <li> If this describes you, don&#x27;t buy an electric body groomer at all and find some really good sensitive skin shave cream plus a fairly expensive razor because this will give you the best results.</li>
            <li> Good , but if you have long body hair there may be some pian</li>
            <li> this shaver works good and it holds a charge for a long time before you need to plug it in.</li>
            <li> keeps charge for long time and good grip.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good groomer for a long time and got the Norelco Bodygrom Pro after reading the reviews at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the result that i had very smooth on my body &amp; remarkably great in my groins area and my other sensitive places , I&#x27;ve never used bodygroom before until i got this product..</li>
            <li> This little buddy is a fantastic solution to keeping a smooth, safe groom that you (and your lady) will love.</li>
            <li> As advertised this is a great razor for the neck down.</li>
            <li> it worked great and trimmed the length of the hair down</li>
            <li> Great shaver for the face and down south.</li>
            <li> I bought it for grooming down below and it works great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great neck down trimmer.</li>
            <li> The trimmer work great and works particularly well for trimming leg hair (different lengths can be selected) or bushy chest hair.</li>
            <li> I clean myself up every few months and feel great.</li>
            <li> great for trimming down there and arm hair and arm pit but does not do so well for legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a lot of hair so trimming down under and on the stomach worked great.  </li>
            <li> , I experienced this as well, however I figured out that you must trim the hair down with the razor</li>
            <li> , I also shave down under and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use and very portable.</li>
            <li> , I am a hairy guy and this does a great job for all other areas!</li>
            <li> Its quite easy to use once you get a hang of it (which doesn&#x27;t take long) and it has been, for me,  the most comfortable way to remove all the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> This has not cut me a single time and since there are some pretty sensitive areas, that&#x27;s an awesome thing.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does seem to make a good every other day basic trimmer, but doesnt even come close to waxing, razor shaving, or even a good electric razor.</li>
            <li> and I love the new man-scaped version</li>
            <li> most new Philips shavers</li>
            <li> new version holds a charge much better and the head stays put.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Norelco BG2020 and got great use of it for about 2 years.</li>
            <li> The waterproof feature is od great help for cleaning which was my problem with my previous model.</li>
            <li> I owned the previous version of this item and it worked great</li>
            <li> But this shaver was easy to use and worked very well.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth $60 for a quick trim and shave whenever needed.</li>
            <li> Great product it works really well and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> After a while it seemed too easy, so I really got after it, and still nothing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- the shaving blade seems to be better quality, and also seems to operate at higher speeds then the 2020, shaves seemed much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For 4 years of use, I feel like I got my moneys worth in the long run and dealt with good customer service....</li>
            <li> The head (side) that has the shaver works fine, except that if your hair is more than 2 inches long it would hurt a bit and won&#x27;t work smoothly.    </li>
            <li> Thanks for the easy return Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy.</li>
            <li> very practical and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> While this gets a very close and easy shave you still need to take your time.</li>
            <li> Overall pretty good.</li>
            <li> I keep an extra pair of head, for sometimes in a pinch, I have even shaved my face with it, and it did do a pretty good job there too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Philips Norelco BG2040 Body Groom Pro is a pretty fair tool for shaving my back and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> My wife dislikes body hair just as much as I do and this trimmer makes it easy to keep it all under control.</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job on my upper legs.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Bodygroomer is easy to hold and works very well.  </li>
            <li> Gentle, easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t irritate?</li>
            <li> Now I know that electric razors in of themselves aren&#x27;t perfect, but even if it didn&#x27;t cut FULLY I would at least expect a consistent cut if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Now I know that electric razors in of themselves aren&#x27;t perfect, but even if it didn&#x27;t cut FULLY I would at least expect a consistent cut if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> It has a blade for every part of your body and is reasonably quite as well as provisioned with a strong battery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the original BodyGroom for years which I loved other than I seemed to replace every year or two.  </li>
            <li> its look nice and really easy to put it in bag for travail ( its dont have bag ) and its really look clean after many used and heavy work  ..    </li>
            <li> I also own the smaller Norelco with all the different attachments and find it&#x27;s not only more effective and versatile but does a better job as well.</li>
            <li> problem (at least for me) is: I have very fine hair, not a lot, but gotta keep the edges trimmed so the lawn looks good.  </li>
            <li> nice skin tight and very smooth</li>
            <li> Easy to use, great price; purchased one previously and paid more for the same brand and model.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be back for more!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product because it has all the features in one!!!  </li>
            <li> , its  more like completely hairless-yay!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> According to the directions, it needed to be charged first - dang it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I can use this thing on my most sensitive areas without worrying about nicks or scratches!  </li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Just gotta make sure you follow the instructions to keep this great manscaping tool working for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and recharges pretty fast (about an hour or so).</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty legit, I can use it everywhere/ anywhere with out getting cut!</li>
            <li> For something like this to get 5 stars it would have to come with a hot chick (or guy if that&#x27;s the way you swing) to do the shaving for me!</li>
            <li> Works very well!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I did though Knick myself where the sun don&#x27;t shine, very minor, but at the same time you cant expect a product that is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how protected the blades were yet I was able to get a quick and close shave/trim everywhere (including the \\&quot;Kiwi\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t cut or pinch even in folds, leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It was about half the price, and I liked it much better.  </li>
            <li> This is great for something quick and convenient, or for getting rid of hair where you don&#x27;t want to use a blade, but it&#x27;s just not a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Double sided, makes it nice for a quick change between trimming and shaving.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not using it everyday or more than once a week.&lt;br /&gt;cleans easy, and pulls apart quick and easy too.&lt;br /&gt;trims clean and even&lt;</li>
            <li> Good for chest an back, not so good for down below..</li>
            <li> I recommend buying it, but just be prepared to spend at least more than an hour doing a full shave if you want it looking perfect (arms, legs, armpits, feet, private area, and belly button area).</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use the shaver in really sensitive areas but once you get the hang of it you can get a very smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to clean,  long lasting charge.</li>
            <li> I have a cordless beard trimmer that I got when my first one started to not hold a charge well that I use for keeping the sides clean</li>
            <li> I have a cordless beard trimmer that I got when my first one started to not hold a charge well that I use for keeping the sides clean</li>
            <li> I can even clean up my hairline pretty well between haircuts.  </li>
            <li> First time using it shaved me clean with no issues.</li>
            <li> The smaller end more easily navigates nooks and crannies and suits my needs better than the old BG2020 with attachments.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works pretty good dry but with some shaving gel and a hot shower this thing is smooth</li>
            <li> So, I purchased this great little Norelco BodyGroom</li>
            <li> I suppose if your hair is more fine than coarse.</li>
            <li> The dual buzzers by the shaver help to make it more comfortable and easy because it cuts longer hairs down and then has the shaver right there to shave it clean.</li>
            <li> but I found it to be slow and takes time to have a very good shave.</li>
            <li> For the first time, I can really clean up the most sensitive of body parts without any discomfort, pain, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regardless, it finally fully charged, and I used the trimmer a little later that day on the shortest setting and it done a good job, so I was very happy about that part.  </li>
            <li> Jack of all trades  easy to clean  switches between functions super fast  super sweet rocking action on the shaver</li>
            <li> blade on the trimmer will remove any kind of hard hair, it works smoothly and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It’s comfortable and trims very wellskin-friendly shave.</li>
            <li> It also did an amazing job on the back door!  </li>
            <li> This thing has been an amazing investment for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was born particularly hirsute, so much so that it would be easy to mistake me for a wild animal</li>
            <li> Does not create produce baby smooth skin, but very close.</li>
            <li> The supplied plastic stand feels somewhat cheap and isn&#x27;t very stable.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a really close and silky smooth shave, this isnt the product for you.</li>
            <li> What I found was it does get a smooth skin finish, but it comes with all the downfalls of using a straight edge razor (ie: ingrown hairs).</li>
            <li> I have worked very well, perfectly smoothly</li>
            <li> Worked great for a few weeks and now it doesn&#x27;t charge anymore.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this to anyone who wants that smooth feeling anywhere below the neck.</li>
            <li> You have to be patient using it, not going too fast, and it does give a close smooth shave without nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> The shaving end cuts very close, leaving you with smooth skin after you are finished.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it because it does get very close to the surface and stays smooth for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this cause of a review stating that it was an amazing personal ball hair cutter.</li>
            <li> The picture is accurate, in the portrayal of the motion necessary to remove foil shaver, but a bit more direction in regards to this would be helpful.</li>
            <li> When I ordered Philips Norelco, I expected it to be much better than those cheap things, and fortunately it was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it works great....</li>
            <li> Like any electric razor, you are not going to get a razor-blade close shave, but the difference is negligible unless you absolutely need to be baby smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned it for a few weeks now and it works great.</li>
            <li> even in the most sensitive places</li>
            <li> i was used the old model for more than 1yr or 2yr ,,    </li>
            <li> its auto stop charging after full but close ur power as soon as u can after full charge     i really recommend it</li>
            <li> I had to return the item and use the regular razor blades, which gives me better control with a close, smooth shave without the nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> You can go in all directions with it and has a comb and then a close shaver to make sure you are as smooth as possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried women&#x27;s bikini area trimmer/shavers and they don&#x27;t work worth</li>
            <li> Your review was informative, enlightening and, yeah, at times</li>
            <li> First, it looks cool.  </li>
            <li> Worth the investment in every way</li>
            <li> The charge lasts about 10 minutes when fresh.  </li>
            <li> It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the cost for something that does its job this well.</li>
            <li> Now, for the more sensitive parts of the body, the 3D pivoting head is a charm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice that only one end will operate at a time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely \\&quot;frank and beans\\&quot;safe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the shape/bulkiness of the groomer.  </li>
            <li> And THAT is worth alot to anyone.</li>
            <li> groomer itself is heavier and bigger than the BG2030 and fits more comfortably into my hand when using it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is surprisingly effective at getting through hairy areas and the plastic guide has 5 settings without needing to use different plastic attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall if you&#x27;ve been using the BG2030 and could use a trimmer attachment this model is worth the $10 incremental cost.</li>
            <li> The design is so good that I was able to reach my upper back all by myself without any assistance.  </li>
            <li> The price is extremely fair for such a wonderful product, so, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The product clearly says that it is not for facial use, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> I had the old model of this before with the changeable heads which broke after too many drops on the tiles.</li>
            <li> Foil end of groomer gets surprisingly close with not really much irritation.  </li>
            <li> Overall a nice package.</li>
            <li> I just kind of figured all body trimmers were created equal.  </li>
            <li> This thing is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Well worth it</li>
            <li> No switching attachments, decent battery (but no indicator) and really easy to use.    </li>
            <li> Make sure to run the batteries completely out before recharging for another 10 hours and never leave it on the charger for days on end if you care to have it work for years to come.</li>
            <li> so far, this seems to be better built then</li>
            <li> Well worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I used to regularly maintain my body hair with Gillette Fusion razor and shave gel before i was driven to Gove it all up altogether for my own wellbeing.</li>
            <li> Kind of big in size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer with the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; is kind of fragile.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the coin.</li>
            <li> The shaver side is only good for areas with very sparse hair.    </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t worth your money at ANY price.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s the same idea.</li>
            <li> If it provided the shave it provides now, but saved 80% of the shaving time, it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Kind of a short life span, however.</li>
            <li> this shaver, wish I would of had this all my life, simple and effective at removing body hair</li>
            <li> Initially, my husband and I liked this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> worth every penny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only kind my fiance will use.</li>
            <li> Okay so far.</li>
            <li> Contours to any part of the body, even the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> looks like a fresh waxing or shave without the razor bumps..</li>
            <li> I shave almost every thing in my body, Just don&#x27;t apply pressure in more sensitive areas, take your time</li>
            <li> To clear any doubts, this is solely a bodygroomer and as such is a great piece of kit.</li>
            <li> the fun part.</li>
            <li> Worth the $50 just buy it</li>
            <li> This electric razor will do far more damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought in from Amazon Austria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had much success with the shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> Clearly, others love this device</li>
            <li> Have fun</li>
            <li> I have a wet/dry Panasonic electric shaver that is far better.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth the $30-40 bucks you can save on having it do a lot of razor work.</li>
            <li> , I think I&#x27;ve spent good amount of $$</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful as I would like</li>
            <li> Feels cheaply made, and does the job only ok.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for sensitive areas mostly.  </li>
            <li> The manual that comes with it doesn&#x27;t clearly indicate how to pull off the top.</li>
            <li> I have owned a few body razor&#x27;s for men and so far I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money invested.</li>
            <li> The old one lasted more than a decade and cost me $37 (bought in 1999, died in 2012).  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually do an exact measure, but it&#x27;s around the neighborhood of 30 minutes per full charge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job on all the remote areas.</li>
            <li> (worth the money)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thus far, I have used this device twice, the trimming function works well, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It was definetely worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I liked it enough to get another.  </li>
            <li> Clearly, others love this device</li>
            <li> This is ok, but not great, the shave isn&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li> This is much better than the old version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth it to upgrade to this version of the BodyGroom, over the cheaper versions.</li>
            <li> The razor side does remove easily , but again to my mind the diagram is not as realistic as I would like.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re deciding between the 2, this one is worth getting just for</li>
            <li> According to my husband the face trimmer isn&#x27;t worth anything.</li>
            <li> He uses that to shave with before he uses a straight razor and he says its not even good enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I contacted Philips and they were kind enough to still send me a replacement handle.</li>
            <li> However, I contacted Philips and they were kind enough to still send me a replacement handle.</li>
            <li> When you open the box it has to charge, but it is really nice.</li>
            <li> real user friendly--the pivotal shave head is very convenient and far better than the Remington I was using.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m really satisfied so far with this product.</li>
            <li> It is WELL worth the money.</li>
            <li> then it would be a useful things.</li>
            <li> I debated returning the product but decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle and am still using the product.  </li>
            <li> luck and have fun</li>
            <li> but I think it is worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worth</li>
            <li> This is better than a razor and it worked better than expected.  </li>
            <li> The BG2020 was a simple and effective unit and after it died after 11 months I requested warranty repair via phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT is it worth the risk?</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase definitely money well spent.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This is much better than the cheap kit I used to have with a bunch of different plastic</li>
            <li> one does not only look better, more modern</li>
            <li> Well worth your money.</li>
            <li> No knicks so far and the battery life is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it looks nice, and has a very solid</li>
            <li> worth every penny...</li>
            <li> Not terribly inconvenient, but I knew it was just a matter of time before</li>
            <li> Well worth it.  </li>
            <li> it is worth to have.</li>
            <li> Clearly there must be better values out there.</li>
            <li> That said, the beard trimmer does such a nice job</li>
            <li> If anyone could recommend a good back shaver that is not the Mangroomer, thanks in advance.</li>
            <li> but I defintaley got my moneys worth out of it.</li>
            <li> Not in the fact that it cost me a lot, but for the amount of times I use it and how useful its been, heck yes</li>
            <li> Far better than the VS Igroom</li>
            <li> spectacular in everything but the following downsides:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> But, if you already have a 3 head Norelco, I can&#x27;t say this is worth getting, unless you don&#x27;t like the idea of using your face shaver elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I had come to realize that that pain wasn&#x27;t worth it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> If you are more infrequently than that, stay far away from this.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this thing, it is well worth the money</li>
            <li> ...totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> And believe me it is worth your money....</li>
            <li> It does not cut as close as I had hoped and requires way more than one pass to clear hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to complete the process</li>
            <li> charger is nice too, only thing to be improved must be the price.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> trimmer is useful</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The battery charge seems to last for a good while, much longer that the trimmer I replaced.</li>
            <li> , however the shaving end takes many passes to remove the stubble in sensitive areas causing some irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the BodyGroom Pro once so far, but it did a great job.</li>
            <li> It works great for preventing razor bumps in the man region but as far as closeness it doesn&#x27;t beat a regular Quattro blade.  </li>
            <li> You still need to be careful but it does the job almost as good as a razor.  </li>
            <li> Makes manscaping soooo much easier especially in the lower areas which you need the most concentration..:)</li>
            <li> Its extremely easy to use, safe on ANY region of your body, and not very loud at all.</li>
            <li> Solid construction, easy to use and a zip to clean!</li>
            <li> It is very good at getting a very close shave, and I feel safe enough to use it for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas, which I can only assume is the main purpose of this product.</li>
            <li> Will nip you if you&#x27;re not careful but overall does a good job and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my new shaver for the past couple of weeks and this thing is the best!  </li>
            <li> If you have more hairy areas, you can knock it down quickly and efficiently with the bottom part of this device, and then follow up with the top part to get it</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Philips Norelco Bodygroom Pro Grooming System, Black / Silver]]This product is great value for money and does exactly what it says on the box.</li>
            <li> The other end works better and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It was pretty good on the original as well, but this new one seems to be lasting longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I researched other products and models and this was definitely the best buy.</li>
            <li> While this razor would make a great beard trimmer, it is lacking in the body trimmer section, mainly because it doesn&#x27;t provide a very close shave, especially with the buzzer side.</li>
            <li> The flip side is awesome for shaving neck and back hair or virtually any other hair below the nape of the neck.</li>
            <li> It allows you to clean up and look smooth and hair free in a short time.</li>
            <li> The clipper is ideal for trimming, and the shaver is close enough for body work (but is neither intended for, nor would be sufficient to shave one&#x27;s face; the directions flat out tell you not to in fact).</li>
            <li> I owned the previous version of this groomer and found this to be a more efficient less bity version that works excellent everywhere</li>
            <li> I have since used this on 2 other occasions to equally good success.  </li>
            <li> At first I was pretty but not totally disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> The battery charged up quickly the first time</li>
            <li> but the next couple of shaves &#x3D; nick free, pain free and pretty smooth.  </li>
            <li> So nice work better than expected and expectations were high</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have dabbled somewhat in manscaping before, which mainly involved using Nair for Men all over my body, which worked very well even for my netherparts.  </li>
            <li> And most times, you&#x27;d have to go through the same area a couples of times to get a clean cut.  </li>
            <li> Also make sure to clean it regularly after each shave.  </li>
            <li> The side with the adjustable fins is great for trimming down regular body hair and, contrary to the instructions, is great for trimming facial hair to that 3 o&#x27;clock shadow look if you take the guard off.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have is taking off the top to clean it.</li>
            <li> But when i shaved my upper arms and tried to clean up the top of my chest</li>
            <li> and i really like how it feels and shave a lot better then the older model.  </li>
            <li> I think works best when your hair and skin is a little moist, but not wet.</li>
            <li> Trying to shave a weeks worth of growth on my legs or arms with a razor is a nightmare, but if I go over it with this shaver first it shouldn&#x27;t take much time at all!!  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as good as i was hoping from other reviews.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested primarily in trimming hair outside of the groin, then fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have been using for a long while now, and I&#x27;m still glad I purchased this!  </li>
            <li> Good clipper on the other end though.</li>
            <li> Like the other people have said, this shaver is good for practicably anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> Forget all the negative comments if you focus below your nrck &amp; this will prove to be a good buy!</li>
            <li> honestly, I still use it on my face and it certainly does a better job than my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> I will definitely try it while being dry the next time because I might get better results that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is awesome</li>
            <li> Even going very slow with the razor required me to make 2-3 passes to get successfully trimmed up; the &#x27;pre-trimmers&#x27; were doing a better job than the razor under the foil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> what its about right?</li>
            <li> The feel is just right with the razor.</li>
            <li> you knew that was coming right?    </li>
            <li> &quot; so the trimmers will lop them right off.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the right one</li>
            <li> So, then I charged it for 8 hours-ish, then used it right away.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Just when you&#x27;re cruising along, the head will catch on something, pivot, and the side blades go right into your nether bits.</li>
            <li> Like all things in life you have to pay attention to what your doing if you want it to come out right.</li>
            <li> Bonus, the 2040 model has all the attachments built right in</li>
            <li> This product was defective right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> The light indicates charging, low battery power and full battery, great to know since most of these devices can malfunction if left charging to long.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it right away</li>
            <li> right out of the box</li>
            <li> And then you have to position the shaver just right</li>
            <li> It says so right up there in the instructions.  </li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> but hey if it works it works right?</li>
            <li> This was even though i used an after shave moisterizing lotion on it right out of the shower and then again before bed and the morning after.</li>
            <li> having all the tools attached right to it</li>
            <li> right.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I made the right choice on this tool.</li>
            <li> The right tool for the job.</li>
            <li> Oh that&#x27;s right, it bends.</li>
            <li> Oh that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get right to it.</li>
            <li> Fits right on ones hand.</li>
            <li> so I would suggest charging right away.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the charging stand is cumbersome and the shaver does not always set right in it.  </li>
            <li> Believe all the hype, use it right</li>
            <li> It should be right?</li>
            <li> Which is wierd because I usually do it right after the shower, so there shouldn&#x27;t be anything to clog my pores.</li>
            <li> says it is- shears hair right off like</li>
            <li> I tried everything to get it to sit right</li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> I can put lotion on right after using</li>
            <li> works as I expected, easy to use, easy to charge, can be used to shave most of the body hair, highly recommanded</li>
            <li> This new one seems much more solid and shaves even better.</li>
            <li> still prefer my Norelco SensoTouch 3d for shaving my face... but the Bodygoom 7100 has won me over when it comes to transforming my winter Chewbacca coat to a smooth physique that allows me to stay MUCH cooler during the hot Texas summers.</li>
            <li> I had the older version with interchangeable blades and this is a HUGE step up.</li>
            <li> This thing worked great for the first few months.</li>
            <li> They charge quickly and are easy to keep clean and put away so you won&#x27;t gross your wife out with the pubic hair balls all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for keeping areas clean for taping, massage, etc.</li>
            <li> It gets everything looking clean, trimmed, and ready for a night out.</li>
            <li> The beard accessory is kinda flimsy, as another reviewer wrote it tends to go the the default 1 setting when held normally,  this is good for people like me who like to keep short goatees, but for those that don&#x27;t it could be an issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very east to clean.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, don&#x27;t expect to be able to do your whole body on one charge after using this on a normal basis for a year.</li>
            <li> The instructions said, that you have to get used to the machine, and your shaving will improve in several weeks, If it is true It would be better than a razor.</li>
            <li> This thing has the capabilities to power through dense hair growth without the need to constantly clean out a razor blade, and has the added benefit of not irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> This can get a decent smooth shave in just about any location on the body.  </li>
            <li> Cut my body grooming down from an hour to about 10 min, which is perfect for last minute date nights.</li>
            <li> This baby works perfect and without a doubt better than some other trimmers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> One end for bulk removal and the other end for a nice clean finish.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to any guy who has a lady friend who loves it when the balls are smooth as silk and there is no risk of a cough up.</li>
            <li> You will feel clean and your significant other will love the polished look.</li>
            <li> It works very well on all the special parts.  </li>
            <li> Very useful &amp; decent value.</li>
            <li> However, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t go quite short enough - I would have liked two more settings further down to get that &amp;#34;shaved two/three days ago&amp;#34; look, instead of the &amp;#34;shaved a week ago&amp;#34; that is the best I can get with it.</li>
            <li> Grooming my beard to specific length was easy and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve noticed that the clipper end has always been weaker and looses power much more quickly and than the foil shaving head even after coming off the charger after several hours.</li>
            <li> Super quiet though, and love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I tried again with very very light pressure and had a little better result, but basically i don&#x27;t let the shaver foil touch my skin.  </li>
            <li> You can trim comfortably around the groin area without so much as a slight nick - and get a very clean shave!     </li>
            <li> from a woman&#x27;s perspective, I have never been able to find an intimate shaver that actually made me smooth but this shaver does the job and doesn&#x27;t leave cuts.</li>
            <li> My husband used this on a small area of his chest, and it worked great, though because of the space between the teeth, I don&#x27;t think the shave was as close as a handheld razor would provide, but it did the job.    </li>
            <li> The clipper end would be better if you could cut closer as well, while still leaving the guard on for a clip shorter than 1/4&amp;#34;, but longer than bare skin.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s worth discussing the bottom of the device - the \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; trimmer or clipper part.</li>
            <li> you are holding the shaver as it will nick you, and most likely in the most sensitive area too (as it did me).  </li>
            <li> At first this razor made shaving fun again.  </li>
            <li> Works well but thought I was buying a FULL body shaver capable of trimming &amp; shaving all areas.</li>
            <li> Worked well for about a year then it stopped charging normally (the light ceased indicating charge level).</li>
            <li> Most recently I started to shave my legs, ( actually spilled some hair remover on my legs and liked the look</li>
            <li> The shaver on both sides are easy to clean and it feels good in your hand; the opposite side does not interfere with the other side.  </li>
            <li> Saved considerable amount of time grooming, and offers outstanding pain free shaving results.</li>
            <li> but i Did a full shave (even areas where before i wouldn&#x27;t DARE) and not a nick,pinch, or oopsie the whole time.</li>
            <li> Apparently the trimmer end requires a significant amount of power to run, or it has its own battery that is defective, because no matter how long I charge the device, it starts to blink an orange warning light when the trimmer is running.  </li>
            <li> I realized this might burn the whole apartment building to the ground, so I took it out and stared at it for a full minute.</li>
            <li> This is so cool with it&#x27;s settings: you really can&#x27;t make a mistake on grooming levels for your hair all over your body.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different body groomer and this one is clearly the best.  </li>
            <li> It takes much longer than 1 hour to get a full charge.</li>
            <li> Pretty good shaver, seems to be as sharp as ever, doesn&#x27;t tug on my hair or anything like that.</li>
            <li> Will have more to offer on prolonged use but right now, I have not a single regret.</li>
            <li> This was a great trimmer while it lasted, but the battery has failed after 18 months of very light usage.  </li>
            <li> My wife just commented this am, how good i look down there.  </li>
            <li> The foil side works well for smoothing out the pubic area, chest and &#x27;starfish&#x27; without worry about nicks, cuts or razor bumps.taking the hair down to a good level which can then be smoothed out by the foil side.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s touted for use from the neck down, but I&#x27;d bet it would do a fair job of shaving one&#x27;s head, if that&#x27;s your thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the one model down is equally good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut body hair good at all even when you trim it down before shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Neither end does well in the water, which sounded good when reading the reviews, but makes no sense, since you want the hair sticking up, not laying down, stuck to your skin under the adhesive and cohesive forces of water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The upper part seems to get stuck a little when shaving, the trimmer works excellent though.</li>
            <li> i would like to have a little more power and better battery life and pivoting head</li>
            <li> the trimming end left me with a freaking gash on my obliques and red marks all over stomach, it&#x27;s alright though, pretty cool body groomer, shaved my balls with the shaving side successfully</li>
            <li> The foil side is perfect for long hairs, but has lots of trouble cleaning up shorter hairs, takes several passes to get cleaned up nice below the waist.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been  looking for this kind of body groomer for a long time!</li>
            <li> and I thoroughly enjoy the new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but once I lathered up the first time and put it to work the hair just came right off of me.</li>
            <li> It also just wouldn&#x27;t be consistent right on my pectorals and I could feel hairs longer than the others that it just wouldn&#x27;t want to grab.</li>
            <li> It also just wouldn&#x27;t be consistent right on my pectorals and I could feel hairs longer than the others that it just wouldn&#x27;t want to grab.</li>
            <li> the first time was a bit tricky getting the right angle</li>
            <li> The hair on a guys body grows in so many different directions that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to be able to get a perfect finish.  </li>
            <li> it regularly -I found using it dry was better than wet, so I use it before I shower and then shower up afterwards  2 very happy customers!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, solid device.</li>
            <li> The battery has held strong thus far.  </li>
            <li> Unless the current model (GMT189RGB) of the one I had has changed any, it made a great personal and beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The battery has held strong thus far.  </li>
            <li> Unless the current model (GMT189RGB) of the one I had has changed any, it made a great personal and beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Care instructions are clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> I love being able to take care of it in the shower and not get the counter all messy.</li>
            <li> Not only does it keep you well groomed, the Bodygroom itself is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> This was quick and much easier.</li>
            <li> but more like every 4 months if you are using frequently because the blades do wear out fast.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I cut myself a few times before I figured out the best way to use</li>
            <li> It is heavier then the earlier models, has buzzers on both ends which can have only one on at a time (great incase ur absent minded like me at times).</li>
            <li> Have had it a short time and only a couple of uses but as discussed was great for the nether regions of the body that we&#x27;re all trying to shape up.  </li>
            <li> if you just wanted a quickly done shave without needing a really close shave, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have tried waxing, traditional razors, and epilators, and this is by far the superior choice.</li>
            <li> One charge lasts about half an hour which is plenty of time to cover a fair amount of space.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of getting a close shave around the next and back.</li>
            <li> Overall, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The side that has a trimmer with a comb is what is most useful, but that can be replaced by the trimmer on my face shaver (currently a Braun series 7 790</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not designed to do the heavy lifting of a mans beard Shaver, although with a better battery (Li-ion), and a better foil, it could have been a all in one</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product, I recommend this to any guy who wants to have balls you can grip like two ripe grapefruits or raisins.  </li>
            <li> Allows more frequent trims which take much lest time than the semi-annual hair fest you are staging in your bathroom now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price this thing is worth it and all things considered I like it better than the last shaver I had</li>
            <li> BodyGroom produces a very close shave similar to the kind of shave</li>
            <li> The charge really holds and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re super hairy, just straight up.</li>
            <li> It really gives you a quick and close &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; of everything you will need to use it for.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts for a good while as I shave once every week and a half it has lasted me for two months before charging.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying to help keep up with day to day needs, but keep in mind you will likely need to supplement with something else if you want a smooth, irritation free finish.</li>
            <li> Easy and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t cover as much surface area as quickly.</li>
            <li> but I have to tell ya please if your interested and wanting your boys nice, clean and shavin down there</li>
            <li> long.&lt;br /&gt;the power stays consistent for a cordless device compared to other devices, very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I am unsure as to why so many people said it was a bad shaver because this shaver is actually pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well very satisfied with purchase</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty nice, but it&#x27;s really the only thing I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> but now that I&#x27;m using it on a consistent basis, I&#x27;m glad that I made the investment and believe that over time I&#x27;ll definitely get my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver for for body hair with long lasting battery charge complete with brush</li>
            <li> minor suggestion : that trimmer is kind of useless because that shaver end is so god damn excellent that the trimmer has a subduded role here !</li>
            <li> ** out of luck, your disposable item goes right in to the landfill, and it&#x27;s back to Amazon to drop more $ on another product.    </li>
            <li> It does get you clean shaven all over but just be aware that you can&#x27;t speed shave downstairs like you could on the older model.</li>
            <li> Using powder will also reduce friction between your clothes and shaving areas, so this is particularly good for athletic folks or anyone who wears tight clothes.</li>
            <li> That attachment at the top can cut the hair anywhere on your body (i lost mine, so I have ordered a new Replacement Trimmer/Shaver Foil which is great because when you take it out to clean it, and your careless like I was you can lose it.</li>
            <li> I shave my entire head to a 2, and the settings on this are a little shorter than normal trimmers, so I place the setting to a 3 and am able to get a nice shave on the top of my head and beard.</li>
            <li> I would very much recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Wears our very fast.</li>
            <li> However, ultimately it will leave a VERY smooth finished product that will not lead to ingrown hairs, razor bumps, burn etc.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> While I am not an excessive &amp;#34;manscaper&amp;#34; it has worked very nicely for keeping my privy parts pretty.</li>
            <li> The battery charges very fast, about 2 hours from 0% to about 100%.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> No pain, no bumps, and very fast.</li>
            <li> and like it very much.</li>
            <li> The comb is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> Even save on the \\&quot;hoo-ha\\&quot; No nicks or pinches and it would get very very close.</li>
            <li> Very light and quiet.  </li>
            <li> I got amazing results using it dry, by the way!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve got kinda sensitive skin and its fine with no creams/gels/forms or anything</li>
            <li> When the screen popped a hole,I was able to find the replacement screen,so I got 2 new screens and one new razor</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews I convinced myself to just try it; and write an honest review for all the skeptic guys out there (like me) that don&#x27;t believe there really could be a device that could actually work for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will have to admit that even with the good reviews I was still a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work as advertised.  </li>
            <li> shaver part is really good, trimmer part size adjustment little bit ineffective.</li>
            <li> also it was easy to clean and comes with other accessories for full grooming from head to toe.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t live in Siberia, this is a significant problem because the ladies (below the arctic circle) don&#x27;t like this sort of thing.</li>
            <li> first off, the Norelco Bodygroom is a very, very well made piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> I just bought this nice little shaver and so far I am pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> the new charging station and self clean..</li>
            <li> /&gt;The feel was very comfortable in my hand, not too heavy and easy to hold with a lite grip</li>
            <li> Love the 2-in-1 for different lengths.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t last more than 5 minute at a time anymore.</li>
            <li> Very versatile!</li>
            <li> , I deliberated that it would be proper to get something more permanent and reusable than a bottle of Nair.  </li>
            <li> Yes, getting pinched in the bag at first hurt.  </li>
            <li> Really works well , worth the price</li>
            <li> It can take hair out of those funny places that didn&#x27;t use to grow hair, but now they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It wasn&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li> to hot water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the first go, I was a nervous wreck...</li>
            <li> After searching reviews and different products online and eyeing every trimmer I came across in stores on and off for a couple of months, this one came towards the top and was priced not too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut myself more times using this trimmer than times I&#x27;ve been cut using anything else, for my entire life even.  </li>
            <li> I will say, the water proof feature is nice and it&#x27;s been the easiest to clean--mostly because I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting something wet</li>
            <li> and I still use it to bridge the gaps of this one for the more \\&quot;personal grooming\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even cut my neck with this nonsense--a first for any trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> Now I will say, the water proof feature is nice and it&#x27;s been the easiest to clean--mostly because I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting something wet</li>
            <li> and I still use it to bridge the gaps of this one for the more \\&quot;personal grooming\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even cut my neck with this nonsense--a first for any trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> I plan on buying more from Philips in the future...  </li>
            <li> and, you&#x27;ll never be the same all over...  :)</li>
            <li> Not one for writing reviews but had to say that I was somewhat apprehensive at first in buying this.</li>
            <li> However, it faded after I used it the first time.  </li>
            <li> The first go</li>
            <li> first take a hot shower, it opens up the skin pores.</li>
            <li> I was able to do the frank and beans, leather cheerio, upper legs, chest, arm pits, and feet within 10 minutes.    </li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver that has worked on my beard.</li>
            <li> and it fact the charging light goes off completely even when in the charger.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a guide if you&#x27;re interested.  </li>
            <li> first time it chewed into some skin...</li>
            <li> It gives a pretty close shave, but it does miss hairs, but so does a razor.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be the first shaver and trimmer that would work on the groin area</li>
            <li> This is exactly what every guy who likes to keep the downstairs grass trimmed or shaved needs...</li>
            <li> Worked well for the first couple years.  </li>
            <li> I charged it 100% before the first use, and got about 4 uses out of it before the battery died.</li>
            <li> The top is the close shaver side and bottom is for buzzing off larger quantities of hair at once.</li>
            <li> but I was able to figure out how to disassemble the shaving head easily enough without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most trimmers only offer this functionality.     </li>
            <li> The top of the device is a rotating head, with two short trimmers and an electric shaver foil in-between them.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as I would expect and would recommend it to anyone who likes to trim their beard in the shower.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I charged it for about 10 hours and then used it</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t pulled or tugged or ripped out any hair and is pretty boss.</li>
            <li> and I love the physical design.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to shave chest, groin, and even further below with no nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li> No wonder Philips confidently gives a 45 day money back guarantee, no wonder why!</li>
            <li> It pulled a hair or two the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> love the fact that there is only one removable attachment</li>
            <li> I first used the trimmer end to trim the longer hair then switch to the shaver end.  </li>
            <li> It is aesthetically pleasing and has a modern look to it, so I&#x27;m not afraid to leave it on the bathroom counter at times.</li>
            <li> even a light rug on your back ain&#x27;t cool.  </li>
            <li> to to repeat, so I have switched back to shaving most of my netherregion with a Gillette Sensor.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work equally as well for women.he shaving head.</li>

            <li> This product may seem somewhat expensive at first however the thing does a great job where it needs to!  </li>
            <li> I have used many different shavers.  </li>
            <li> first thing you notice when you get the groomer out of the packaging is that the charging stand is rather clunky and unstable.</li>
            <li> It costs just a bit more than lesser products, but would be a bargain at twice the price with its ergonomics, ease of use, functionality and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Used the trimmer first to shorten the hair and then the shaver foil side.  </li>
            <li> Actually its more than that</li>
            <li> I bought this for the same reason many of you are looking into it:</li>
            <li> For shaving the face it just isn&#x27;t as close as the regular razors,  it&#x27;s better if you wanna keep trimmed.  </li>
            <li> For first timers like me you&#x27;ve got to be patient with this thing</li>
            <li> will give this product a couple of weeks to see if/how the results improve from regular use, but after my first night using it, I was not overly impressed, and if I didn&#x27;t believe in second chances, this would be going back to Philips</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the product in the brief period</li>
            <li> I first used this model before I purchased one by borrowing my father&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This is the first razor or shaver that I have ever used that didn&#x27;t either pinch, draw blood or leave a razor burn.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I purchased a BG2020 (the cheaper model by Phillips) about a year ago.</li>
            <li> After charging for 4 hours, I went to remove the product from the charger, and it was burning hot.</li>
            <li> It was so hot it could have burned my hand, but</li>
            <li> Its much more comfortable than using a razor and hair grows back soft.</li>
            <li> first trimmed my beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have had a product like this.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s always about a millimeter of stubble left no matter how many times you go over</li>
            <li> This is something to be aware of if you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing.    </li>
            <li> took me a couple of shaves* and the first I did nick myself on the first shave</li>
            <li> but pretty close.  </li>
            <li> In terms of cuts, dings, gashes, etc, it is definitely possible but more so from not paying attention, taking your time and planning what you&#x27;re going to do (think about it - do you think your barber just hacks away??</li>
            <li> If you are not accustomed to shaving/trimming and venturing in this area for the first time, then:    a) Talk to a woman (someone you trust); they&#x27;ve been doing this for years (think about it)</li>
            <li> Battery lasts long time, and its easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I really love this thing especially since its water proof it makes my life a lot easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Bodygroom since it first launched years ago and have been upgrading as Norelco improves the product.  </li>
            <li> boys\\&quot; at first</li>
            <li> First of all, I Will tell everyone who reads this.  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this site and many others before I decided to finally pull the trigger and make the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, You can&#x27;t just run rampid and reckless and not get a bit nicked up.</li>
            <li> I mostly use this on my face to keep my beard trimmed very short.  </li>
            <li> I followed the direction exactly.  </li>
            <li> I owned the first one that came out BG2020</li>
            <li> The dual heads are a great idea in one unit because you really need different approaches to different body parts.</li>
            <li> primarily use the trimmer for sensitive areas and to shorten up some of the hair on my gorilla arms</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I read the manual when I first got it</li>
            <li> The battery life is more then sufficient for an entire body use (~35mins fully charged).</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it combines the different trim heads into one that glides along skin.</li>
            <li> In one year&#x27;s usage I never got more than ten minutes.  </li>
            <li> Today I woke up and shaving was the first thing I did.  </li>
            <li> The foil shaver end does work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> ;-).</li>
            <li> Quite a few nice features, and well made, with a nice solid feel.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sweetie who is pretty hairy.  </li>
            <li> at first.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Norelco!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> As one who is an avid shaver of unmentionable parts</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hairy, buzz cut that junk first and use this as a detailer.....</li>
            <li> so it takes more time than my last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of you are probably thinking of one specific area that you would rather not injure while trimming/shaving.</li>
            <li> First it&#x27;ll pick your hair a bit.</li>
            <li> Much higher quality than the cheapo 20-25 dollar units you see in retail stores.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions (being my first time shaving), and started with my stomach.</li>
            <li> First stroke, no hairs pulled, just shaved.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d stick to a manual razor or use something a bit higher up on the quality totem pole than this.</li>
            <li> After reading many different reviews about many different groomers I was hopeful that this one would work out.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to recycle the battery responsibly and discard the shaver!</li>
            <li> MUCH better than the similar product made by Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous at first to use this on my man-hood, but after a couple times the nervousness has subsided.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything better than this currently on the market now.</li>
            <li> Sheesh I don&#x27;t grow hair that fast!</li>
            <li> Over the last couple months  I&#x27;ve scoured the internet as most probably had, looking for a \\&quot;best\\&quot; groomer.</li>
            <li> If your hair is too long, you will need something more powerful or you will spend all day.</li>
            <li> This was my first bodygroom product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews in products, but I finally found a razor that&#x27;s water proof and works perfect in groin region.</li>
            <li> My first one was over 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> Using it in the hot shower with gillette body shaving gel</li>
            <li> Ive decided to give it one more try two weeks from now and if it finally does what it says I will come and change this</li>
            <li> No uncomfortable nicks.</li>
            <li> The blades do not last forever so be sure to order replacements.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m actually quite pleased.</li>
            <li> Take it slow and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> , it will stop taking a charge between 6-12 months after first use.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> and I was weary at first to try an &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Overall, I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase and would recommend to any guy that is trying to get into some body hair management.</li>
            <li> Maybe mine is a dud, but why can&#x27;t it last more than thirty minutes?  </li>
            <li> First of all...when you venture below you you can nick yourself and yes when you do it bleeds and bleeds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had much better luck by powdering prior to the shave.  </li>
            <li> The body is pretty solid metal construction and looks to be able to survive a drop (although I cannot confirm this yet).  </li>
            <li> First let me state</li>
            <li> entire body has been shaved in 15 min :).</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have ever bought where I felt compelled to leave a review.   </li>
            <li> I charged it and used it three times before putting it back on the charger and could have used it more before recharging it.</li>
            <li> The first one I received was not holding a charge</li>
            <li> When I First Had Body Hair.</li>
            <li> first experience:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was able to trim a lot of areas on my chest, back, and no-no zone that needed some tending.</li>
            <li> I just did that (for the first time) and it fully recharged in exactly one hour as advertised.  </li>
            <li> For the first year I got about 20-30 minutes of use before the unit needed to be recharged.</li>
            <li> Well first off, I&#x27;m not a guy</li>
            <li> but it feels so much safer!  </li>
            <li> Probably better off just getting a trimmer and not paying extra for the shaver.</li>
            <li> So I was planning on using this to make it a better, happier place for her to visit but after nicking myself grooming my crotch, no way was I gonna try to turn myself into a Chinese contortionist to groom my butt crack.</li>
            <li> Battery life was more than enough for armpits, front torso and nether region.  </li>
            <li> Also the shaver end could be higher quality.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a replacement sent to me more than once, and each of the units have the same exact problem.</li>
            <li> Just as many reviewers (who initially convinced me to try this groomer) have said, this thing works wonders.</li>
            <li> It can safely be used almost anywhere, except it indicates it&#x27;s not made for the face or private areas.</li>
            <li> Most of the time it doesn&#x27;t bother me except when I wear a collared shirt with chest hair popping out or a short sleeve shirt with arms that look like they need combing.</li>
            <li> The first one stopped working for no reason after about 8 months.</li>
            <li> My first electric razor was a Norelco.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the end all be all to making your junk pretty</li>
            <li> Nothing has worked for me to get rid of the &amp;#34;itch.&amp;#34; After using this, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve been hairless &amp;#34;there&amp;#34; and have had no itch.</li>
            <li> They were not wrong.</li>
            <li> only thing better is that it had the trimmer attached, which I use often to trim my beard</li>
            <li> Consistent with those who suffered a battery/charge problem with this unit, my battery died as well.</li>
            <li> I love this no problem at all, and its actually waterproof.</li>
            <li> Well, I used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> but I feel its more work for an ok result, not a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I was glad this model had the double sided setup, cause</li>
            <li> First time using it</li>
            <li> It can cut pretty close if needed.</li>
            <li> (could be the amount of time since my last shave though), but cuts better, closer and reaches farther.  </li>
            <li> The battery outlasts the Wahl model I have owned for years, and the size of each head, clipper &amp; shaver, allows more nimble navigation than a standard clipper or face razor.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect a pain-free, nick free experience, you&#x27;ll be painfully surprised.</li>
            <li> Today I used it for first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shave where it counts with it ;)</li>
            <li> this is a pretty good trimmer with a few flaws, theres 3 trimmers for this 1 for longer hair for months of hair growth , 2 the trimmer for closer cuts after you used the one by itself...</li>
            <li> This shaver does exactly what you want it to do.</li>
            <li> If the blades on the &amp;#34;pre-trimmers&amp;#34; were closer together they wouldn&#x27;t be able to grab your skin and nick you (only an issue when manscaping).</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied!</li>
            <li> First use....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave everything, and maintaining crisp lines with this tool is</li>
            <li> When I purchased the first Philips Norelco BG2040</li>
            <li> does exactly what it needs to do below the belt.</li>
            <li> I probably would have given this product four stars had it not failed about three months after purchase.  </li>
            <li> I was shaking with fear when at first attempt.</li>
            <li> Very well designed product and worth the higher price</li>
            <li> It seems to work better when shaving at the sink when your facial hair isn&#x27;t softened by the hot shower water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> both ends work exactly as needed and</li>
            <li> The BG2040 is safe to use on your private area no problems at all.</li>
            <li> I was able to exchange it at Bed Bath and Beyond for a replacement, but 18 months is too short of a battery life.</li>
            <li> me on one of the first uses...</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was the smoke detector.</li>
            <li> Now when I plug it in it gets REALLY hot</li>
            <li> first and then use the shaver.</li>
            <li> part felt a bit more solid when it&#x27;s rubbing against the skin.</li>
            <li> This shaver does exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it runs low on charge if I have been using it for more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever electric body razor</li>
            <li> Not everything i wanted in a razor... trims and shaves pretty well</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that it had a warrantee, it still would have been a lower graded review since of the inconvenience having to deal with a defective item in the first place.,</li>
            <li> First off, I must say that if you don&#x27;t know HOW to use the razor to shave your Kiwis you WILL cut up your twig-n-berries, this is not an opinion, this is a fact.</li>
            <li> It does shave your sausage and meatballs pretty close, pretty DAMN close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From my experience, the shaver wasn&#x27;t entirely consistent.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it was worth paying that much for what I ended up using it for so</li>
            <li> Great product from Norelco that should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I read complaints about it not shaving close enough, like shaving your face make sure the pull the skin taunt and again take your time,</li>
            <li> , firstly, there is no carrying case included, so you&#x27;ll have to take that in mind if you want to protect your shaver from accidental damage, or even just to store until you need it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this one as a replacement for the first one I had, after buying replacement heads it&#x27;s started to bite and cut in the area</li>
            <li> i only wish i could plug it into an outlet i would be able to use it longer</li>
            <li> Comfortable, doesn&#x27;t nick sensitive areas........</li>
            <li> As a groomer, this one works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> After years of being nicked by electric razors, I&#x27;m glad to have finally found this product.</li>
            <li> The design is great, works in the shower, 5 different length settings and makes total body grooming much quicker and faster than you might imagine.  </li>
            <li> with this product is it exactly as described and works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> And I absolutely love the different shavers or groomers.</li>
            <li> Then the plastic apparatus holding the top blade on the trimmer broke - it&#x27;s a simple pop out blade, (just apply pressure to the blades with your thumb after removing the plastic thing that controls closeness of the cut)</li>
            <li> I simple love this BodyGroom because it doesn&#x27;t procuce irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rarely trying to get really close on body parts</li>
            <li> That was better than the actual shaver.</li>
            <li> The trimmers are handy but buyer beware: the shaver is about as rough a shave as you can imagine.</li>
            <li> Smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> So the BodyGroom is definitely the better product for</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll most likely need the Mangroomer.</li>
            <li> so therefore it was better on the back.  </li>
            <li> Overall, you can&#x27;t do better in my opinion if your wanting to keep your body well groomed and don&#x27;t want hurt yourself in the process.</li>
            <li> My husband is pretty hairy</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to get too hot like some trimmers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I came across the BG2040 on Amazon, and after seeing the glowing reviews for it took the plunge and purchased it (Not from Amazon, I found a better deal locally)  </li>
            <li> Dont by it, it was a second most expencive machine online</li>
            <li> So first off, let&#x27;s talk man to man.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first time I&#x27;ve EVER used an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I would find a similar product, with more convenient charging options.  </li>
            <li> I used the trimmer first and then flipped it over to the shaver to finish it off.  </li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s like most shavers the battery will last well for the first part of its life but like all cordless things out there the batteries are going to deplete over time.  </li>
            <li> and i can say it does a great job in delicate areas</li>
            <li> shaver/groomer  performs exactly as described in all the five star reviews predicted.  </li>
            <li> The top one cuts the hair really short causing skin irritation and redness, sometimes the edges trimmer causes me to bleed too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This tool is exactly what a men&#x27;s body grooming device is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> the 3D pivoting head can still have improvements especially when handling the groin area, one should take his time and get used to maneuvering/handling it more.</li>
            <li> Economical price, found as described and fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;Strongly recommended, will deal again in future for sure.</li>
            <li> It is safe to use on the pelvic area, upper thighs, and the crease of your thighs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got quite an ergonomic design and overall I&#x27;d rate it as outstanding.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to replace the head yet and it still works as well as when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> Definitely pay more to get the swivel head like this one has.  </li>
            <li> It is therefore tempting and logical to want to put the shaver in the cradle when done with it.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a wax job, you won&#x27;t get it.ore tempting and logical to want to put the shaver in the cradle when done with it.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has an awesome return policy so if your not satisfied you can always send it back.  </li>
            <li> The comb doesn&#x27;t fall out of place (which makes trimming a lot faster and safer(, it is much smoother, and there are now 5 trimming sizes opposed to 3!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and very sturdy build</li>
            <li> Youll feel safe and gets it close enough without making you bleed.</li>
            <li> On the first one the trimmer didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and I hope Philips/Norelco use better quality batteries in future models.</li>
            <li> The battery life is more then enough.</li>
            <li> 10 minutes at most even when you are being extra</li>
            <li> Purchased over 3 years ago and have been using it about once a week consistently.  </li>
            <li> you see a pattern?&lt;br /&gt;Norelco will keep you coming back for more</li>
            <li> This is the first body shaver I have ever purchased and</li>
            <li> but it seems I wanted it to work too much!</li>
            <li> I have a $20 facial trimmer than works much better than this product.</li>
            <li> You´ll get some cuts here and there, but no scary ones, unless you decide to go all lumberjack on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it perform?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has two sides, one that lets you trim a specific length, and another that´s more for &amp;#34;get</li>
            <li> but it leaves you a bit of &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; hair, which isn´t exactly the nicest thing to touch, and hair</li>
            <li> A lot better than using a facial trimer for grooming but was hoping for it</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesistant to purchase the Norelco Bodygroom Pro at first.</li>
            <li> my first try</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Battery back up is quite okay.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> However, as with all of the Norelco Bodygoomers, the foil doesn&#x27;t last more than 8-12 months.  </li>
            <li> Replacement foils are not expensive.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, this thing does not hold charge.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re the type to let your hair grow out on your body, this is pretty neat to use.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Even then the nicks weren&#x27;t enough to draw blood and were more like a carpet</li>
            <li> I never had an issue with the charge the first 10 times</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to quit using razors, but soon realized that razors are just much better in every way possible, except the price.</li>
            <li> The metal contacts on the plastic dock and the unit don&#x27;t like to stay touching properly all the time!</li>
            <li> Could&#x27;ve been better if battery lasted longer or it was possible to plug it in and use it.</li>
            <li> I hope it works as good as now, in a few months.</li>
            <li> Definitely good to be able to trim down all those neglected long hairs at first though</li>
            <li> and it was effortless and most importantly painless to shave down there.</li>
            <li> Got this because like so many other men here, needed something to clean up on the parts we are all too embarrassed to talk about.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with its performance down there.</li>
            <li> The other side is great for trimming long hairs and is recommended if you&#x27;re very hair and want to go completely smooth - use this side first.</li>
            <li> user must use slower strides and careful on the angle using the fine clippers on either end of the main (top) head of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very smooth to use in shower or just sitting on the toilet and going at it.  </li>
            <li> I like this product and use it frequently on all but the most very sensitive of areas.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit tricky to get the &#x27;pouch&#x27; perfectly smooth due to the hair growing in different directions, but with practice this becomes more easy.  </li>
            <li> least I have the original, which I am very satisfied with.</li>
            <li> The groomer worked effortlessly and I was very happy with the clean look it left behind.  </li>
            <li> works good wet or dry and can easily be washed off after you&#x27;re done by running it under the</li>
            <li> I use this up and down stairs, it does a fine job, but takes much more time as you must move at a much slower pace in order to elude pinching.</li>
            <li> It took less than an hour to charge fully right out of the box, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> Multiple blades make finding the right cut easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as smooth as a babies bottom now which the little lady very much enjoyed.  </li>
            <li> This thing shaved poorly, never held a charge for long enough used it twice before giving up, greatly diminished my opinion for Philips</li>
            <li> But other than that, it works quite nicely.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as epilating, but it&#x27;s comfortable and effective.  </li>
            <li> Other than the shaver foil itself, everything is well built and nice materials.</li>
            <li> I love it because it can be used safely and without help from mom by a teen boy to trim long leg hair if that&#x27;s an issue.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp trim and</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need to clean my foil with some rubbing alcohol or something, because I aftershave down their already just to make sure I don&#x27;t get bumps and for some reason</li>
            <li> So far I am very satisfied with product and hope that it will last me for a very long time :-).</li>
            <li> I was able to clean up those pesky single hairs that my normal Braun electric razor could not get.    </li>
            <li> The trimming edges are also SUPER safe on skin - I didn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;nicked&amp;#34; once, unlike other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great shaver / trimmer, though user might want to be careful not to swing/move it too fast as the shaver unit is not very secure, comes off rather easily.</li>
            <li> Obviously you can&#x27;t go zooming with this thing at mach speeds, but the trimmer end (the flat pivoting head) is really great at simply contorting to your shape, and it smoothly shaves around any object you put in it&#x27;s path without damaging anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the rest of my hair is simply too fine for this to work with, or perhaps I wasn&#x27;t doing something right.  </li>
            <li> but she enjoyed paying special attention down there.</li>
            <li> The tilting head really helps get the taint and ass area baby smooth, in complete comfort.  </li>
            <li> Charge lasts longer then expected and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Have used it for several months and have never been nicked or otherwise harmed, which is an amazing do to the nature of the sensitive parts that must be trimmed.</li>
            <li> Ok, same as the previous models - which I liked.</li>
            <li> Another issue i have noticed is the battery power is not as strong when i bought it, but hey I cannot complain I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years, but i would say it can last for 20mins which is more than enough time for me.</li>
            <li> , my skin is just too sensitive to handle being shaved clean to the surface, I&#x27;ll stick with my beard trimmer to trim deeeeeeeez nutttssssssss.</li>
            <li> It is actually has a quite stylish and modern look to it</li>
            <li> The trimmer on my face shaver is far, far better.    </li>
            <li> I know shaving my face with a blade works better if the hairs have softened, so I took a long, hot bath and lathered myself</li>
            <li> I had the personal groomer before, which was simple and good.</li>
            <li> The foil shaver was pretty good, used to remove a small chest patch I have.</li>
            <li> when.it was at least mostly away and decided to give it one more try.</li>
            <li> Far superior to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I just came back here to read the specs, and laughed when I saw its supposed to last 50 minutes.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good enough for 15-20 minutes of use, but you definitely need to charge between uses.</li>
            <li> a nice cut without cutting the skin...and a good battery life</li>
            <li> I also loved how you don&#x27;t only have to go in one direction because the head pivots which allows you to go back and forth until the forest is</li>
            <li> Everything you need to get the precise trim/shave you are seeking is right there on one little unit, and it is truly easy to use.</li>
            <li> We both enjoy this product and highly recommend it to everyone, males, females, couples and all bipedal species that choose to live a hairless, or &amp;#34;less hairy&amp;#34; lifestyle.</li>
            <li> If you have never groomed \\&quot;below the neck\\&quot; but are considering it, then I highly recommend buying this groomer and getting it done right the first time.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and goes over personal areas very gently.  </li>
            <li> In short, I am very pleased with this product as I was able to shave \\&quot;the below area\\&quot; entirely hairless after my second try with this groomer.</li>
            <li> This is the only body groomer that I have used so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it against, but overall I find it to be pretty good.</li>
            <li> After a few months is cut perfectly, but I guess at least annually or should do little more head change can be achieved very easily here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I prefer the previous model for better results!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just whilly-nilly jam it into your more sensitive areas, but if you&#x27;re careful, it&#x27;ll do just fine.</li>
            <li> Comes with a small brush to clean off the hair, and it&#x27;s easily detachable to clean with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Specially when your shaving sensitive areas you don&#x27;t want the head to move.</li>
            <li> I used to own the basic version, and in order to cut to a length, you had to clip one of three cheap plastic covers that were hard to take off and broke or got lost easily.</li>
            <li> Whenever I left the teeth on one area for too long, it did pinch me a bit which wasn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li> I needed to shave my neck quickly and this is the first electric shaver I could use on my sensitive neck skin without it tearing it up.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is everything that the positive reviews claim it to be.  </li>
            <li> But I splurged on this product because of all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I ordered this groomer after reading a lot of positive reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then continued to all the positive reviews given to this product</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews I decided to go for this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading lots of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable and easy to use for all hair control needs from the eyebrows on down.</li>
            <li> The shaver head will indeed get rid of your hair and make your skin nice and smooth (and WITHOUT any irritation, to boot!), but as stated, it will take quite a few passes before it can remove all the stubble that was left from the trimmer end.</li>
            <li> Fantastic as a general hair groomer.  </li>
            <li> I just use the general grooming side for all my body except I use the foil side to smooth out my arms</li>
            <li> I shopped for a long time looking for a body groomer, and I am extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> How long has this been available!  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works great, but is insanely sharp and it has cut/nicked my manhood on several occasions.</li>
            <li> My other Norelco shaver irritates my neck but this does a great job; no irritation even when used daily.</li>
            <li> Shaving underarms are a lot better with this versus the 2020 by a long shot and the added length from having the electric trimmer &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now and have had some very interesting experiences with it.</li>
            <li> It has clippers on both sides of the foil, so you can pretty much come from any direction and get results.</li>
            <li> The pivot head is just enough flex to get the curves of my chin and face and the trimmer on the other end is great for a stubble week.  </li>
            <li> I found myself using the two side mini-clippers most of the time shaving as close as possible with those, then trying to get a smooth finish with the middle shaver.</li>
            <li> This pretty much makes those issue non-existant.  </li>
            <li> On one end is a regular shaver that is great for just trimming up my body hair, and on the other end is a close shaver/foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the people who rate this lowly because of almost cutting off their balls, I would never suggest using this product to shave your junk; however, as a body shaver it works most excellently.  </li>
            <li> I trust this thing pretty much everywhere.</li>
            <li> Title pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with clippers of this type but they do cut pretty close.</li>
            <li> It dies pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Will be interesting to see how long this one lasts.</li>
            <li> Pretty much a six o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> so you pretty much always have to keep it on the charger.</li>
            <li> been looking for something like this for a long time, and love the functionality.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ll be able to use this unit for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does pretty much anything you need except a close shave.</li>
            <li> What can I really say, it&#x27;s a shaver that does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do</li>
            <li> Even in intimate parts you will have good results, but I warn you to be careful and not make it into the wild because it can hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have listened to others but bought it because it is small and looks really good.</li>
            <li> I tend to believe that if you follow cleaning , maintenance, and charging instructions, that electronics usually hold up fairly well over time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I took the time to write this one because the product is that good.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how good of a job it will be for u men</li>
            <li> Other Norelco products that I have owned over the years have far superior battery life that this &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; body</li>
            <li> I wouldn´t use this in my face, although it could probably do a good job if you´re just trimming small</li>
            <li> I recommend it  for those who like to stay sharp and clean!!</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve only done my torso and arms and it leaves everything pretty smooth and clean looking.</li>
            <li> After working fine for about six months, the second one has now also lost its ability to hold a charge as well, just like the first one.  </li>
            <li> To be honest I don&#x27;t trust this one down by the privates.</li>
            <li> The height adjustable trimmer is a much better solution than the different level blade guards the older model has.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t rush the job it works great, just go slow and steady.</li>
            <li> Decent shaver, bought it primarily to use in the shower, no issues so far.</li>
            <li> I searched the net for a while to find a decent machine but many of the reviews were discouraging and conflicting.</li>
            <li> but if you want a nice electric shaver for your head&lt;br /&gt;and want it down to the skin like a razor this one is the one you want.</li>
            <li> 3 months in the large trimmer stopped working and after 6 months the battery needed to be charged pretty much after every use.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, it&#x27;s the best by far.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t apply any pressure at all near the thinnest, most fold-ey, most vulnberable skin, the shaver should skim a millimeter above such skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I prefer using it dry, which is a breeze to be honest, the fact that it is water proof is only an added advantage and makes it that much easier to clean</li>
            <li> And I very much like the way I can adjust the trimmer with what I think are a lot of settings... more than I had expected.  </li>
            <li> will also note that I have used this as a facial shaver &amp; it works great, but takes a while to shave compared to conventional gel &amp; razor shaving.</li>
            <li> While this razor can cause some slight drying out of the skin it really is amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s meant for below the neck, but you can easily trim above the neck as well.  </li>
            <li> I think it works better dry but works in the shower as well.</li>
            <li> I owned the previous version of this groomer, and of course now own this one as well.  </li>
            <li> , guys if you think this makes it easy to trim your back yourself, think again.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve discovered that it works better dry.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer on zero can cut you if your not careful but it gives you a very close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Works better dry than it does in the shower.    </li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use.</li>
            <li> only had problem with the US/Europe pluging system; I couldn&#x27;t find a plug adapter easily here...</li>
            <li> Sprinkle the powder over the area you&#x27;re going to shave first, then gently rub it in so the powder covers the whole area evenly.  </li>
            <li> I think one of the cheaper models without the floating head would work better for this, since you could keep the foil level even on dry</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are only $12, and are so easy to replace.</li>
            <li> It protects sensitive areas and cuts super close to the skin.</li>
            <li> Not only is it easy to use, but it&lt;br /&gt;leaves</li>
            <li> it is easy to trim up the entire body.</li>
            <li> Think it works better when hair is dry.    </li>
            <li> Trimmer works better dry</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd different Phillips Norelco BodyGroom and am very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Not the closest shave, but it does the job of several shavers and you can easily use it in the shower.    </li>
            <li> gel is better than shaving dry.</li>
            <li> those of you that are, this shaver would work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to hold, and operate with 1 hand, and I do like the double ended Shaver/trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> charges easily and seems to last even through longer</li>
            <li> Solid feel and easy to hold and control</li>
            <li> The cutter end flips open for easy cleaning</li>
            <li> also like that it has independent switches for either end, and that the charging stand is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Luckily I hadn&#x27;t tossed my old razor yet and reverted to using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All-in-one device that makes grooming as easy as possible.  </li>
            <li> I use it mostly dry before showering as I have found that it works better that way.  </li>
            <li> If I charged it and then let it sit unused it would completely lose the charge quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it both dry and while in the shower, but I can&#x27;t decide which is more effective/comfortable.</li>
            <li> It can be used in the shower or out; however, I find it works better on a dry body.  </li>
            <li> I had tried the Body Bare shaver, but it is only effective as an after-the-shave shaver and managed to nick me.  </li>
            <li> Each end turns on independently, and the built in guide is easy to use and saves the hassle of attachments.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Charge lasts as advertised and the unit feels very solid and is easy to handle the shaving part of this unit is</li>
            <li> I can use it without meeting any type of shaving cream or water it works better on my skin dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;update: 2.5 yrs later, this thing is still going strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beards - This has been a great tool for keeping my beard neat and even without letting myself go full blown scare the women away with my mass of scary face hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;3- Motor/mechanism strong enough: does not snag or hesitate while cutting&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant on using this product on certain area of my body, I know it says it can be used pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li> Fairly large but does hold enough charge for a 3-4 day trip easily.</li>
            <li> battery life seems more than adequate in my limited use so far    </li>
            <li> it really feels like a high quality product and it does the job right</li>
            <li> My navel, chest, pits, shoulders, back, and \\&quot;down south\\&quot; were all shaved in no time and looking great.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have great motor skills, then I personally wouldn&#x27;t attempt to shave down there.    </li>
            <li> Also great for mowing down your unnattended armpits and back and shoulder hair for all those Chewbacca&#x27;s like myself.</li>
            <li> after a few months it turns itself on, running down the battery (best case)</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say how many uses you will get out of a single charge.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how many uses you will get out of a single charge.</li>
            <li> Problem is, it is built at a large scale.</li>
            <li> , it is large and can be quite cumbersome in certain areas.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a large gap in the length range going from no guard to the closest guard setting.  </li>
            <li> nothing worse than trying to balance a piece of buzzing equipment near your features, this works great on all sorts of body hair and is much better than a plain razor, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I would charge it before doing anything large like your head.  </li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer specifically to trip a certain part of my body.</li>
            <li> measurements, it&#x27;s either pure blade or a noticeable gap.</li>
            <li> this means that if i want to use the comb attachments to shave hair to a certain length i don&#x27;t have to hunt for or even change anything on the shaver.</li>
            <li> I would certainly buy this again in a heartbeat</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco Bodygroom BG2040 is fairly large.</li>
            <li> but I could certainly see room for improvement.</li>
            <li> If most of your hair is on your upper back and your shoulders then the BodyGroom is definitely the better product and the right product for you.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I bought this for the adjustable large trimmer not for body shaving.  </li>
            <li> If your trying to do large areas of your body like your chest, legs etc.</li>
            <li> and they sell for about $40-50 used or new (everywhere!!)</li>
            <li> This could be a product that should fit the needs of most men, but there are a few major limitations that prevent it from being worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> with the new one, I do not see this happening as it seems more solid.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the mechanism that holds the foil unit in place gave out and I decided to re-up and get a new one and went with the Pro, thinking it would be better than the original.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The BodyGroom is good but the foil/shaver head does not last a year like they say it does, and it does not hold a charge for very long</li>
            <li> Nice quality, only complaints is that I like to have a longer length setting for the beard trimmer, and the stand is a little easy to tip over.</li>
            <li> I have used it a ton and it works great dry or wet.  </li>
            <li> I tried it both wet and dry, and I got great results for both.</li>
            <li> Overall, a very well built and strong device.</li>
            <li> Made shaving my balls less mutilating and more fun.</li>
            <li> Very usefull, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;-Battery is only 50min</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and it does a dang good job using it dry style.</li>
            <li> And, of course, the warranty on the first one (after their refusal to extend it for the new replacement) has now (just) expired!  </li>
            <li> First it&#x27;s great but...not last more than two years, A disposable equipment is of poor quality , do not buy!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so most attempts to get rid of body hair has left me with rashes and razor burn.</li>
            <li> It will last 5-15 minutes at full charge, and die - pending a new full charge.</li>
            <li> I will always love that old trimmer but this new upgrade after the old ones death is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now back to the entire body smooth look and have to say with this shaver it is an easy task.</li>
            <li> also used this to \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; my entire head/scalp for the summer, and it worked just fine for that.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a few seconds and would get very hot.</li>
            <li> It even says in the manual not to use it for your face and head, but it works fine enough if you have patients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first use was on my face, and the foil shaver did a decent job, so for those wondering, you can use it on your face.</li>
            <li> just got it yesterday shaved my legs with it and it did a pretty decent job..</li>
            <li> The first is that the unguarded main razor will cut into your flesh and the battery life is now dismal.</li>
            <li> Very high quality device</li>
            <li> Very high quality blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very high quality, cuts chest hair, groin hair, thigh hair</li>
            <li> For those of us who like to keep our bodies as well as our faces groomed, I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality and precision product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more success with disposable single blade razors for sensitive skin that I bought from CVS.</li>
            <li> While this might happen in some instances, the foil itself is actually responsible for the large majority of injuries I have sustained.  </li>
            <li> and it works really well on large expanses that I keep hairless.</li>
            <li> Beard trimmer half is great for toning down those hairy legs without full shaving.</li>
            <li> Also despite the nice aesthetics and good overall quality, some of the plastic parts, especially the plastic trimmer blade guard look and feel kind of cheap, and I am always a little worried I might brake it, rendering the trimmer pretty useless.  </li>
            <li> I did get experience a little nick, but that was my own fault.</li>
            <li> However, I normally use a Wahl Hero T Blade, or Andis T-Outliner trimmer if I&#x27;m not shaving clean, so it&#x27;s kind of hard to compare to those.</li>
            <li> Its best to let your skin soak in warm water in order for the hair folicles to relax, however its easier shaving the sack when its cold, which causes the skin to pull tight.</li>
            <li> As an avid manscaper, I highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li> The second time I used it did not leave any cuts just pure smooth baby</li>
            <li> I think I nicked myself once while shaving the pubes, but it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt much and within a minute I corrected myself and haven&#x27;t nicked much since.</li>
            <li> Very nice it can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Worth paying a little more for the quality.</li>
            <li> charging stand works well for the 1 hour it takes to charge it, and it folds away flat for easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> An elegant finishing, a little bit heavy, good price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you really want that clean clean shave, you nust use a razor but other than that, To me it worked.</li>
            <li> But even on the shortest setting I noticed it didn&#x27;t really cut evenly and I had to go back and forth several times for the easiest of trimming on some arm hair which is very fine and light and easy to cut typically with my hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> (give me the old James Bond not the new clean</li>
            <li> What used to take me a half an hour now takes 10 minutes with a smooth, clean finish.</li>
            <li> Then I started venturing around more and more, gaining more confidence in this bad boy with each swipe.  </li>
            <li> It is plastic and it should be removed carefully and more gently.</li>
            <li> Myself, I like a clean, smooth feel (perhaps I was a Roman in a previous lifetime) and have relied on my razor for decades.  </li>
            <li> Another huge plus is the utter lack of attachments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair clippers (more powerful and not reliant on a dead battery) for tougher jobs or when I let my body/face hair grow out.</li>
            <li> Does a much better job that expected</li>
            <li> It does what it is designed to do really well---when the battery is charged.  </li>
            <li> This version has a very s***ty battery that takes forever to charge and discharges within a couple minutes of use.</li>
            <li> It did the job well and gave me a very close shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1.re-grown hairs around groin area are very troublesome to re cut</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it too much.  </li>
            <li> i have so much  heir in my body</li>
            <li> I really do.</li>
            <li> What it is, though, is very flexible.</li>
            <li> This is a very nimble device.</li>
            <li> Running my hand across the shaved area in the SAME direction of which the hair grows feels and looks smooth.</li>
            <li> and I had nippleitis (HAHA).</li>
            <li> I told my wife I do this as much for me as it is for you.  </li>
            <li> Works really well, shaves very close.</li>
            <li> It really works on all areas.</li>
            <li> It shaves very close &amp; the battery lasts alot longer before you have to charge it up again...  </li>
            <li> Very well made &amp;</li>
            <li> After much research, i decided to purchase the bodygroomer for my boyfriend for xmas.</li>
            <li> I really like about this model</li>
            <li> Replacement blades are only needed once a year and are cheap here on Amazon (under $12).</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t as close as I expected, but I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This worked very well on my bikini line as well, and the waterproof casing allowed me to take it into the shower.    </li>
            <li> I REALLY like about this product,</li>
            <li> Its very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like the fact that you can use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I would highly suggest using this body trimmer!</li>
            <li> So far, well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> real problem here is the shaver side.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it that much, maybe once or twice a month.  </li>
            <li> this works very well for trimming body hair in your arm bits and nether regions.</li>
            <li> This item feels like it is built very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas... being a woman, I really don&#x27;t know about body groomers</li>
            <li> The 2040 feels solid and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go really close to your skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I would pay that much again.  </li>
            <li> Real close shave and grooms your body realllllly well.</li>
            <li> i have so much body hair</li>
            <li> why     it dose cut a very close shave i do have to say that the 1st time i used this trimer</li>
            <li> i was going to fast</li>
            <li> but i found out if you take your time this will give you a really close shave</li>
            <li> Once I was ready to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; the Philips actually did a really nice job (chest, stomach, the boys, butt, and back).  </li>
            <li> There were no snags, the shaved area felt smooth &amp; there was no irritation later.  </li>
            <li> I really like this electric razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It shaves very well with no scars or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and without any blood associated with straight razors.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> very smoothly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not one of those guys that likes to have baby-smooth skin on my whole body, and this shaver won&#x27;t do that for you.</li>
            <li> You need to really work through your skin with this one.  </li>
            <li> I shave my whole body with this shaver.</li>
            <li> yes, every where else not so much.</li>
            <li> This thing is always leaving patches of hair as well as it pulls the living daylights out of my legs, not so much the arms.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> think if they did not add the integrated pre-trimmers located on both sides of the shaving head it will be much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for trimming body hair it works really well and gets a very close shave with no irritation</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the razor shaves really close.</li>
            <li> Very simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> of course that all depends on how much it costs!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really nervous to try and use an electric razor around my manhood and backside, but it worked fantastically.  </li>
            <li> I really like the style and the charger</li>
            <li> This is a very well designed groomer that does the job without the pain, discomfort or anxiety of wondering if it will \\&quot;bite\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This thing really does it.  </li>
            <li> The comb and guard edge (settings for desired length) are very well amde</li>
            <li> I use it to trim my man regions and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Until now, I didn&#x27;t really consider myself a hairy guy.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you are using the center of the foil shaver to trim the hair.</li>
            <li> This thing really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very simple to use, virtually maintenance free, and does what is advertised.</li>
            <li> thanks philips for this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this thing for a while and never had as much as a pinch.  </li>
            <li> i have very course body hair and doubted it get the job done.</li>
            <li> Did the job much</li>
            <li> It was so gentle on all body parts calling it</li>
            <li> None really for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a whole lot that I can write that others haven&#x27;t already said.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t make much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> but with thisand the mangroomer &#x3D; I really don&#x27;t need anyone to do any shaving for me now.  </li>
            <li> Like the description says this really is an \\&quot;all in one grooming</li>
            <li> from all i could find out before i purchased this i expected better.</li>
            <li> MUCH BETTER than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For $50 here on Amazon with free shipping, it was cheaper than my local store.  </li>
            <li> The comb attachment at the end is really nifty -- it slides for length adjustment, or you can just take it off for closer mowing.</li>
            <li> Making short, smooth movements helped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;5/5, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Make sure to replace blades roughly every six months</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was very cautious around \\&quot;the</li>
            <li> but it just really worked well in taming my jungle.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> REALLY, REALLY works well.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t let the Forest overrun the Tree to much</li>
            <li> or it really gets difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but still I was very iffy on trying it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut very close either.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works very well but needs a closer setting.</li>
            <li> ER also used to cut hair on head and pubic area, works very well for both.</li>
            <li> absolutely painless and no pulling of hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well in all areas, except face, which it&#x27;s not meant to be used for anyway.  </li>
            <li> This item works really well--until it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to give this 4.5 stars.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this Norelco to anyone who has some manscaping to do!</li>
            <li> But after that, you are ready to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effortless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it really can be used all over and not just on the body.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to get into too much detail on this one.</li>
            <li> Some months, I really let myself go.</li>
            <li> She uses it for the same reason I did; to trim the lower region and this one will not pinch or cut and shaves smoothly.</li>
            <li> For areas that I wanted to be smooth, this left a lot of stubble.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made and intuitively designed.</li>
            <li> The shaver/trimmer end works very well</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much of a bump to get that piece to pop out either.  </li>
            <li> or the whole thing will fall over.</li>
            <li> Works really well and gets the hair.</li>
            <li> This product performs very well.</li>
            <li> And the whole body means the mustache</li>
            <li> But who wants to?</li>
            <li> Really exellent product.it is used for both shave and trimming.while shave</li>
            <li> For the money I expected much better quality.</li>
            <li> That part really does not bother me at the slightest, any shaver you buy you need to replace the blades on it after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They say you&#x27;re supposed to stretch your skin straight but the pivoting head makes it so you don&#x27;t really have to focus on getting everything straight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this product isn&#x27;t really something I&#x27;d recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this product worked very well, I would really appreciate its design and ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted to find one that worked well.</li>
            <li> Really does the job.</li>
            <li> not work very well on the face&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cut is much closer and no pain at all.</li>
            <li> shaving end cuts very close</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not getting is the light to come on....</li>
            <li> Really wanted 2 dedicated devices that specialize in each.</li>
            <li> I was happier with that result but on that I expected a bit more a well.</li>
            <li> The product is safe to use if you are slightly careful.</li>
            <li> In addition to getting $10 credit with Phillips Norelco after registering the product warranty, it works very well.</li>
            <li> Husband uses to manscape which really prevents skin irritation since he&#x27;s a runner.  </li>
            <li> Closest thing to a real shave.</li>
            <li> this is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I am not talking about thirty straight minutes without turning it off.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for returning with no problems.</li>
            <li> The shaving head can both pivot and telescope; Thus it can follow the body curvature very well.    </li>
            <li> Everything works very well.</li>
            <li> Has worked really well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product performs very well.</li>
            <li> There really are few things better than a freshly shaved nether region.</li>
            <li> This has made the process much easier.</li>
            <li> I like to write my product reviews after I&#x27;ve owned a product for a while since in the modern era, things don&#x27;t seem to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it has very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is built very well</li>
            <li> Thanks to Philips.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about this product.</li>
            <li> i really dont like buying shavers with like twelve attachments...</li>
            <li> it works really well....</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, thanks amazon.&lt;br /&gt;2nd</li>
            <li> The battery really does not hold the charge well.</li>
            <li> Combine all those designed flaws, and you get a unit that can tip over very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t really like the shaver as it doesn&#x27;t seem to work well on my hair compared to the trimmer.</li>
            <li> When I am buying an electric RAZOR that I plan to use very close to my nether regions</li>
            <li> This gadget does everything, trims and shaves all body parts, very well.  </li>
            <li> The purpose for this groomer is to care for intimate areas.  </li>
            <li> The rotating head on the shaver is a very much appreciated comfort item and also increases the effectiveness of the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I really like this and plan to get one for my son for Christmas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very close shaving razor</li>
            <li> Has lasted me years and trims very well.</li>
            <li> Fast forward one day; shaver fully charged.</li>
            <li> In fact, it worked so well, so fast, I couldn&#x27;t stop myself.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY DOES.</li>
            <li> But really, EVERY MAN NEEDS THIS, PERIOD.</li>
            <li> What I like about this product is now I can trim the groin and underarm areas without any nicks or cuts very closely.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference between the two styles.</li>
            <li> So let me get this straight</li>
            <li> And it wasn&#x27;t too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really encourage you to think about what you want from this product before buying it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> It also works very well on the privates, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Works very well in the shower.  </li>
            <li> but it works very well and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Using this outside of the shower is not as smooth.</li>
            <li> - this really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> trimmer has been used twice and works really well.  </li>
            <li> and I can confirm the comments about not being capable of a close shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> High-quality very versatile</li>
            <li> I tried the trimmer part, but it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I really understand how to use the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it multi-functionality.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to get a close enough shave that feels smooth, this works.</li>
            <li> can sometimes nick, charges fast and the charge lasts a while</li>
            <li> It gives a very close cut and does the job</li>
            <li> I never realized that a smooth shave on the body in any area was possible with an electric razor, but with this one, it is.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Better than i expected.</li>
            <li> While you do need to take your time with this groomer around sensitive regions, it is forgiving and rarely hurts</li>
            <li> This is not for shaving facial hair but is instead a body groomer primarily designed for men.</li>
            <li> very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> If you body groom very often this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li> much resistance so am reluctant to pull to the extent of breaking the unit.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it was just too much work to try and maintain.</li>
            <li> much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> The results for the shaver may be better under wet conditions</li>
            <li> Both the trimmer and foil shaver open easily (including the removable guard) and only take about a minute to clean.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really seem to &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; that well into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really sodas pointed when I got it.</li>
            <li> All I can say is just really take time.</li>
            <li> Yes I bought this about 3.5 years ago, so I can&#x27;t complain much,</li>
            <li> and the comb is much smoother, that is, it doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin as I use it.</li>
            <li> Very strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and there i don&#x27;t mind so much.   </li>
            <li> I was very leary about buying an electric shaver for the downunda&#x27;s if you get my drift.</li>
            <li> I am a very hairy guy, so I put it to the test.  </li>
            <li> You can get really close with this and can skip the shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the adjustable groomer part</li>
            <li> Really durable and also doesn&#x27;t pull like cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> Before this I had bought two cheap trimmers that have different heads for nose, etc.</li>
            <li> It is safe, but it still gets the skin folds if they are too folded, no bleeding yet, but be careful.</li>
            <li> It is very sleek</li>
            <li> Works really well, thanks</li>
            <li> I think you, Philips, and my manscaping-insistent girlfriend thanks you</li>
            <li> razor holds a charge very well, too, though I tend to just keep it on the stand.</li>
            <li> This really feels like a quality product.</li>
            <li> I would have purchased it much sooner.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy in your hand as well.</li>
            <li> Charges fast.  </li>
            <li> it clearly works as stated on the advertisement and its worth a piece one should have.</li>
            <li> As a whole product, very well put together and got it in time.</li>
            <li> It works very well, still have not had to recharge, and no nicks or cuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This model really works at mowing though unwanted hair.  </li>
            <li> tap.&lt;br /&gt;The top is for grooming everything else, and the heads pivot to make it follow your body contours, just be careful when manscaping as the &amp;#34;pre-trimmers&amp;#34; can nick the dangly bits and make you bleed.</li>
            <li> You really have to watch how you hold</li>
            <li> works very well, very versatile.  </li>
            <li> It worked really will.</li>
            <li> This one feels much sturdier and still works well after being dropped a couple times.</li>
            <li> I am what you can consider a really hairy man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have used cheap trimmers and electric shavers before, but I would always have to go over the same spots over and over again.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> It does not give the very closest shave, however.</li>
            <li> Would much prefer a straight plug in the bottom.</li>
            <li> The Norelco gives me the same results I got when I used a razor, a smooth shave all around and no pain.</li>
            <li> Then it gives a not so gentle tug on your follicles</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very intimidating to use anything electric on your genitalia...</li>
            <li> I would just reccomend to anybody purchasing this item to check the charge before throwing away the packaging as you very well may have to return, which I no longer have the luxury of doing.</li>
            <li> I prefer very close shaves and this doesn&#x27;t get me there.  </li>
            <li> Works very well...</li>
            <li> I thought a lot about the change between the different options currently available of the bodygroom.</li>
            <li> , it trims very well because of its 3-D shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product is very noisy and vibrates a lot.</li>
            <li> I belive the shaver is intened for men who feel they have too much body hair.</li>
            <li> It would probally work very well for that purpose.</li>
            <li> They have improved on this model so much.</li>
            <li> It does all of this very well.  </li>
            <li> and it is ready to use again.</li>
            <li> All I&#x27;m saying is, be gentle...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have purchased a corded trimmer, this one gave me more skin irritation than I expected.</li>
            <li> Really &amp;</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t notice anything unusual while you&#x27;re using it, but</li>
            <li> the quality of the product is certainly better than expected.  </li>
            <li> Buy this if you really need it.</li>
            <li> I used it straight out of the box after about an hour charge.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle even when using it without the length</li>
            <li> This thing is a beast, but a gentle one.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is to be used on the whole body below the neck!&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> ** niggah\\&quot; hahahaha.</li>
            <li> He likes it, and it shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the head does not pivot as much as i would like it to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the Norelco BG2040 Bodygroom</li>
            <li> shaver works well and replacement blades are reasonable.</li>
            <li> if you are gentle you can replace them, but they are not meant to be replaced</li>
            <li> This product is better than expected.  </li>
            <li> A couple things really stood out to me.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to have this with the shaver</li>
            <li> It works very well on all areas including the face.</li>
            <li> Even on the lowest/shortest setting on the clippers I never snag my skin and can work so much faster without that worry.  </li>
            <li> Very well engineered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;...let&#x27;s just say it works best when the bathroom is cold.</li>
            <li> Unless of course you consider 12 dollars per shave reasonable.  </li>
            <li> It really yanks on hairs...</li>
            <li> You would really have to be trying to cut yourself with this groomer</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> Close shave with the foil and the trimmer really does the job and has a variety of length adjustments.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> The shaver now - I think it works fantastically with cream, not so much.</li>
            <li> Prior iterations of the BodyGroom had a detachable head that you could swap out for clipping versus shaving/trimming, and detachable combs to fit onto the clipper to control the length of clipping.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really prep my pubic area or the razor</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still running like the day I bought it, which is much appreciated.</li>
            <li> For this to work without injury you must pull your bag very taunt.  </li>
            <li> and you just lie back and enjoy.</li>
            <li> It is really convenient to use on your body.</li>
            <li> Would not pay this much for this product again.  </li>
            <li> Using it for really anything caused tug and pull on the hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the razor.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t stand that...</li>
            <li> and my skin got really irritated)</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> i was very suprised when i used this.</li>
            <li> Having said that, it gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Try it, I really don&#x27;t think you will regret it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as often as I could, but it&#x27;s always charged and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> It takes a whole night charge the thing.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really know.  </li>
            <li> And they are not ingrown hairs either, they are just straight up pimples.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the smooth finish, she&#x27;s the final judge.</li>
            <li> It shaves almost the whole hair.</li>
            <li> Makes it so much cleaner and easier</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to fix an off haircut, shave if i run out of razors, trim, erase, etc, and don&#x27;t have to worry about getting anything wet and having it malfunction</li>
            <li> It will up the intimate regions with ease.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to stay well groomed and ready to go.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t regret it, i was a amazed on how fast it arrived</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t make much noise.</li>
            <li> ; side has a pivoting head which is really helpful since the head follows your body so you won´t need to go inch by inch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed it is much easier to nick yourself in the shower than while dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, and very well.</li>
            <li> Trims very well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Mind you, I have really hair legs</li>
            <li> No razor burn and better cut than expected.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you just want to dedicate extra time and get a detailed shave.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t grow in as fast.</li>
            <li> Neither look was really working for me.  </li>
            <li> really pulls hair when you shave</li>
            <li> Works well and holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Men should be gentle around the &amp;#34;coin purse&amp;#34; if you use it without the detachable guard.</li>
            <li> The the trimmer side does work really well as an eyebrow trimmer.  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> This shaver is gentle and does not leave nicks and cuts, but neither does it shave really close.  </li>
            <li> The trimming end has a built in height adjustment that works very well.  </li>
            <li> That was really scaring me until I read the #1 review for this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;1-I have not been able to read anywhere online about this, but the 5 setting trimmer end, the head actually comes off completely which</li>
            <li> After my old trimmer finally died after many years of use, my search began for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> The product is safe to use on sensitive area such as the groin and testicle region.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will say though that the mini-clippers gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, but it also took me more than 2x as long to shave (when compared with using normal hair clippers).</li>
            <li> Does alright for trimming, but for actual shaving, my 5 year old electric shaver does a much better job with</li>
            <li> The top of the unit doesn&#x27;t pick up hair very well and doesn&#x27;t provide anything remotely resembling a close shave.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t nearly do the job that a blade does but decent if you want a quick shave out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It might not be enough juice for a full body grooming for some of you, so be aware of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me recreate for you what happened most of the time I used the shaver, when I wasn&#x27;t busy getting a giant cut</li>
            <li> This is far better and easier than using a regular shaver.</li>
            <li> While the shaver dual head design and charger is nice, the battery life dwindles after a few months.</li>
            <li> Meaning you can not fix the dead batteries on your own.</li>
            <li> It drew blood (both sides of the tool) on multiple occasions from my most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite impressive at giving you a very close trim (without the guard) in the pubic region without cutting.  </li>
            <li> The shaving end is simple and I did not get any pulling or burns - even in the most sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> Good battery life as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after using it like a year... Battery is NEAR to Dead.</li>
            <li> This is however a very good substitute for those of us who are a little bit too scared of the pain that comes with waxing and all the other work you need to do to prepare and finish a wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So when you have the quick touch up before special times you won&#x27;t be sure it will have enough charge and of course if you rush you will arrive with a few wounds.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the comb part doesn&#x27;t seem to lift the hairs that need to be trimmed very well, which means that it takes a very long time to get a nice consistent cut.  </li>
            <li> It worked great up until week 3, where the foil that guards the shaving end developed a small hole which grew larger quickly, leading in cuts.</li>
            <li> It will bring you right back to the days when smooth was natural...</li>
            <li> (I mean most important point is what style(s) do you need ?</li>
            <li> I can say is, Wow!!!  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to shave super close to my...more personal areas, but I had no issues at all.</li>
            <li> i mean really good.</li>
            <li> The charging is cord-free, and the battery has yet to give me any troubles in terms of holding its charge or running out before I was done, and it typically takes a good half an hour or more to complete one</li>
            <li> Nice design, holds a charge really well, does seem to do a decent enough job of facial hair</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and google &#x27;Philips Norelco BG2040 ifixit&#x27; to see the type of maintenance you will have to perform or be willing to buy a new one every six months</li>
            <li> --it feels a little flimsy but is quick, easy and stable.  </li>
            <li> I wish it captured the shaver more securely but it is more than adeqate with a cord length long enough to string across my double sink and mount it opposite side of my plug.    </li>
            <li> I like a stubbled look and this cuts down to almost clean shaven (yet not fully clean shaven for those of you hoping for that)</li>
            <li> the charging cradle, though it looks nice, is not well balanced, only holds the trimmer when on a flat surface and cannot be mounted on a wall.  </li>
            <li> Also, it really doesn&#x27;t do anything any better than any other shaver.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a high performance, durable material and easy to use this product will work for you, the price its a little bit higher but the shaver really worth it .</li>
            <li> Even though I never re-charged until the red light came on, and did a complete discharge/recharge from time-to-time, after a couple of years, my first unit would require as much as 5-6 hours of charging time to yield maybe 10 minutes of usage.  </li>
            <li> The fact of the matter is that we&#x27;re all unique, and the skin and the grain of the hair growth (in odd directions) on my face and neck simply doesn&#x27;t seem to be suitable for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I had the lower model, but the battery wore out really quickly and it got jammed with hair quickly.</li>
            <li> This tool works fine, but it takea a long time to charge and then discharges fast.  </li>
            <li> I mostly used it to trim my thick leg hairs without them looking stubbly or clean</li>
            <li> The charge seems fine as long as you&#x27;re not trying to do your whole body at once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year, its been decent for trimming, but definitely does not give a smooth feel at all for those who are hairy.</li>
            <li> main problem with it though, is that I don´t think it shaves smooth enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had it pull more on that end than other shavers.  </li>
            <li> that he actually got excited</li>
            <li> I think the other reviewers have said most of what I&#x27;d planned to say, so I&#x27;ll try to add comments that fill in some of the gaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But back to the original...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve nicked part of my body with a host of other products.     </li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s because of the other side - the top.    </li>
            <li> i like the design of this better than other electric shaving machines.</li>
            <li> The 1 seemed to trim more like a 2 compared to other trimmers.</li>
            <li> This is better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s longer than other units.</li>
            <li> Went to use it today and it would not work for more than 10 seconds due to no battery charge.</li>
            <li> After using 2x of the original BodyGrooms 2020 models *which in my opinion are junk overall</li>
            <li> I love having the convenience of the groomer on the other end.</li>
            <li> Pretty soon, after you go slowly the first few times, you&#x27;ll get more confident and get an even closer shave!</li>
            <li> As many other reviews have said it does what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> i think the guard needs more settings amongst other things..</li>
            <li> Like every other guy that&#x27;s sure to be reading this review, I was looking for easier ways to keep.... things... cleaned up.</li>
            <li> other end is ok to shorten hair</li>
            <li> Just as many other reviewers state, you can shave EVERYTHING with this groomer.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close shave better than some other razors that I have tried.</li>
            <li> This model does however work while in the shower if needed which is a plus over most other models.</li>
            <li> I guess, their original advertisement indicates its for body only.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy this razor again, but not before looking around at my other options for something better.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on other areas of the body to trim hair and it works just as well, usually better.</li>
            <li> The shaving part is sharp and safe.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Highly accessible to all your private parts, making life simpler..!!!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;i&#x27;ve had other groomers this in the top 2 i&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> I shave my torso with this, and so far it is good battery last long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough for me, but please don&#x27;t expect perfectly smooth skin if you have typical \\&quot;man hair\\&quot; in various \\&quot;man places\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave is VERY close to the skin and leaves it super smooth; my bf&#x27;s facial hair took a couple days to grow back to his shadow.</li>
            <li> When Purchasing this product I read the reviews and the guy who gave the indepth, detailed, book long body imprint of personal male grooming, gay display of how it feels to utilize this product., and ordered it for my huisband, and what was said was 100% true in terms of product ability.</li>
            <li> I use the trimmer to taper down all my hairy body parts to a respectable length and the shaver part to keep my back baby smooth and pre-adolescent.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because when I groom down below with a normal razor, I get ingrown hairs and razor burn very easily.  </li>
            <li> It is very good for sensitive areas, I used bad products as well, so I can easily compare.</li>
            <li> It shaves cleanly, trims nicely, and it takes a sharp razor blade out of your hand and away from anything that should really never be touched by an edged blade.</li>
            <li> i researched very carefully all the groomers and this one was supposed to be one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful and make sure you have the angle</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, now pumped full of rage, endorphins, adrenaline, and an overall contempt for having to do this in the first place, I&#x27;m now ready for my wild night with the woman!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that I went ahead and purchased this trimmer and in the next few years, if it lasts that long, I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> But for down under it is the best I have used, and ample for body contours that are hard to shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often go for the clean shave, just a short length.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for 7 months now and the battery barely lasts more than 20 minutes now.</li>
            <li> I am going to clean it well to remove my pubes and take it by the local battery joe to see what they can do.  </li>
            <li> You can choose to either simply brush everything clean with the included brush, or you can do a combination of brushing and rinsing under the faucet.</li>
            <li> You can choose to either simply brush everything clean with the included brush, or you can do a combination of brushing and rinsing under the faucet.</li>
            <li> you must pass over the same spot a lot to get a clean shave, but doesn&#x27;t everything.  </li>
            <li> $29.99 retail for the older BG2020 was a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> (at this point let me re-iterate, makesure you clean yourself properly).  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy, keeping your private areas clean is a must.</li>
            <li> Both sides are useful and necessary ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a simple body hair trimmer, and use a safety razor when I want a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I trimmed the hair on my chest and arms which is not a lot, but enough that I like to keep things clean.  </li>
            <li> so I still have to use a razor blade to clean edges up, but it handles the rest of my facial hair.  </li>
            <li> , this has eliminated the need to groom outside of the shower, and thus, the need to clean up.</li>
            <li> you dont mind going over the same spot 5-10 times to get that clean shave, by all means get it.</li>
            <li> also haven&#x27;t managed to remove the foil end to clean it properly.</li>
            <li> I had the same experience as others here, I&#x27;ve used past models, they shaved great but the blade kept falling off.</li>
            <li> The price of the second one was worth it because I like this groomer THAT much!</li>
            <li> u can take it the shower with u and do all ur grooming and clean it at the same time</li>
            <li> While I do not use it in the shower, the ability to run water over it to clean is terrific.</li>
            <li> you want a clean shave, this shaver doesn&#x27;t work as well as a traditional razor like mach 3 with foam...</li>
            <li> Really did come out smooth and didn&#x27;t take long at all.  </li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; part about it is that it&#x27;s a hassle to clean...</li>
            <li> but of course when getting down around more sensitive areas it&#x27;s wise to use a little more caution and pull the skin tight a bit just in case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an unusual feeling to have no hair down there, and I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works good on the down low area</li>
            <li> Going up my legs was so easy, one single pass from foot to knee where it took three or four strokes</li>
            <li> i figured it would be like all the other razors... its seriously the best ive ever used... not cuts and no burns</li>
            <li> The most important lesson I learned is to really take it slow on the sensitive parts.</li>
            <li> I guess for the price I expected it to be perfect for me and have a stronger motor, sharper cutting action and assumed (I know I should never assume) more length setting options.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend it to anyone looking for an all-around groomer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this machine will be very gentle and as efficient with sensitive body parts.</li>
            <li> really like, shaved fine, non-irritating after shaving, the only thing to remember is to not disturb while shaving is that it fully charged, because when you need load it hurts and sometimes it hurts, but it does what it offers.</li>
            <li> these days.&lt;br /&gt;The battery last a long time between charges, it&#x27;s water proof and super easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li> This is because it only took 5 minutes on the phone with Philips Norelco to get a new one shipped via Fed Ex for free.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s not the case for most due to the number of high reviews</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sleek looking, more so than the previous models.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it isn&#x27;t super fast.  </li>
            <li> trimming end works well enough, but also gets clogged easily requiring frequent brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easier to handle than its predecessor and does a good job of cutting, However, watch the placement of the teeth sides, they will cut skin easily.</li>
            <li> No fuss, no complicated things to set up or super long manual to read/memorize.</li>
            <li> I enjoy being thorough in product reviews so that others can reap the benefits and know what they are in for when it comes right down to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Holds a charge for a very long time, I can go on vacation for a week and be fine on battery when I return.</li>
            <li> After using it a while you will know where the problem spots are and take a little more time in certain area than others.  </li>
            <li> No more living by the seat of your pants trimming your kiwis, as the original Bodygroom advertising detailed.</li>
            <li> it takes a long time to get smooth skin on abdomen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the battery life for this one yet as I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I was able to do a full trim (15-20 min) basically straight out of the box even though the manual said to charge it for 10 hours first.     </li>
            <li> Hair grows way too fast for me to want to use a razor that frequently around my genitalia, and if you use this shaver every day then it will be smooth enough.</li>
            <li> night--this is true--I woke up to this strange buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> It cuts the long hairs off, then shaves smooth.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well it cut and trimmed with almost no irritation even on the first use.</li>
            <li> This requires me to strategize and divide my trimming sessions across the week, as it&#x27;s barely possible to trim my beard on one charge - let alone my full body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With my first use, I didn&#x27;t get one nick, pull or bite in any of the highly sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and everything I have used to shave below the neck has just caused irritation .  </li>
            <li> It is also pretty loud.</li>
            <li> At first was leery about sensitive areas but after using it there is no concern.</li>
            <li> I have used this several times and it holds true to the claim.</li>
            <li> The body bare shaver is worth having though.  </li>
            <li> Two complaints - full metal body is heavier than necessary for airline travel.</li>
            <li> I frequently had to replace them resulting in much higher cost over time.  </li>
            <li> The longest charge this razor has held was 15 minutes prior to needing a full recharge.</li>
            <li> When you initially purchase it, you&#x27;re supposed to let the groomer charge for a full hour before using it.  </li>
            <li> I have to give it a 5 because the product is GREAT and the cost is more reasonable than the other expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I just charged it yesterday for the first time, as it says to let the battery die completely before charging.</li>
            <li> So far, I have only used it twice, I find that a wet safety razor does a superior job.  </li>
            <li> As long as the clippers were kept at a normal angle there were no nicks or rubs at all even against the most sensitive skin areas.  </li>
            <li> Its light, doesn&#x27;t have a ton of attachments to loose and modern.  </li>
            <li> The best way to groom your junk is do not pull the skin tight and go slow.  </li>
            <li> No real issues after the first use, and following the instructions made things pretty straightforward!&lt;br /&gt;The blades on the shaver especially are oh-so safe, and although it does take a pass or two at the right angle, the damn thing does its job really, really well.</li>
            <li> I came back to Amazon to order a replacement and see what other models might be available, but I would have been fine ordering this model again</li>
            <li> item is as described, it&#x27;s quality made, so far it&#x27;s holding fine and looks like it will last for some time.</li>
            <li> pull ur hair :) its will shut down</li>
            <li> but it SAFELY takes the hair all the way down to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this groomer because I wanted a better alternative to a razor for shaving down there.</li>
            <li> You can use the bottom to shave down longer hair and use the top to finish it off.</li>
            <li> is hands down a lot more</li>
            <li> Works better then any other I have bought!</li>
            <li> Having first hand experience with customer service, I am very confident that if anything goes wrong Philips will make it right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also too large and unwieldy to use between the cheeks, another area where the simple razor blade wins again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble getting a clean shave on my first try, so make sure to give it some time!</li>
            <li> he says he likes it ok, but sometimes it pulls the hair a little too much</li>
            <li> Always register your new items!</li>
            <li> I have used it now for 3 years and it still delivers as new!</li>
            <li> THE NEW LOOK ALSO!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain, gave a quick once over dry, shaved it pretty close, still would recommend using a manual blade for that ultra-close shave, but only after using this and only if needed :)</li>
            <li> : get the speed cream next time, which looks similar and probably is the Nair I had originally had success with.  </li>
            <li> but if you use this shaver daily or every other day even, you&#x27;ll be happy with the smoothness it achieves especially considering the alternative</li>
            <li> They are sharp blades and for obvious reasons accidents can happen but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Not much pulling and easily maneuverable.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the road periodically, so being able to pack less is always welcomed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the road periodically, so being able to pack less is always welcomed.  </li>
            <li> Works so much better than my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> There is a slight learning curve to the shaver side like many say</li>
            <li> This will create a smooth, dry shaving surface so the blades can cut close but will lessen the risk of nicking the skin.  </li>
            <li> My previous Phillips manscaper (I have had it for 6 yrs now) was much more maneuverable.</li>
            <li> ....far better than the previous model which the blade kept falling out of it</li>
            <li> Which is why the top half of my thighs are also hairless now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to grip and use even when wet.</li>
            <li> All I am saying, is that I could easily see someone unintentionally damaging foil head because the directions are not very clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy to use, Wet and dry, smooth touch</li>
            <li> the shaving head goes more or less unused.</li>
            <li> It was part of a morning ritual, along with John Gambling on WOR and the percolator&#x27;s steady steam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an 18 year old female who was looking for something to get me smooth and hairless without the irritation.</li>
            <li> If quickly remove it from the charger and put it back</li>
            <li> Works quite well, does not cut your balls and gives a decent shave.</li>
            <li> The instructions state to fully charge before first use, so I charged it for about 6 to 8 hours the first day, then unplugged it before bed and plugged it up the next morning before college.  </li>
            <li> The foil shaver aspect is decent.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and sensitive skin, but it gave me a smooth shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li> I went to charge it back up, and sure enough, it doesn&#x27;t charge...at all.</li>
            <li> but the head kept popping off while shaving and felt cheap, which is the last thing you want to feel when putting a razor to sensitive parts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smoother side of the Bodygroom allowed me to take care of my underarms and private areas quickly and painlessly...</li>
            <li> It was a decent shaver for a couple years, but crapped out soon after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this groomer, just make sure to follow the \\&quot;obvious</li>
            <li> Bought to replace an older version.  </li>
            <li> I even used it for a quick facial shave (It was an emergency) and the results weren&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am actually quite surprised I use and enjoy using this groomer as often as I do.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m moderately furry, and trim everywhere except my back (which is mostly hairless)</li>
            <li> The shaver just wasn&#x27;t able to get close enough to trim these hairs as short as I neeed.</li>
            <li> I used it on several highly sensitive areas and received smooth skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li> ask for advice for your particular situation    </li>
            <li> the shaving, it takes multiple passes with the long-hair trimmer to get the hair actually cut shorter, and after that it takes even more passes with the close shaver all for an end result of stubble.</li>
            <li> After looking up reviews online this particular model received the highest praise for that area</li>
            <li> It nicked the sack once already, my older bodygroomer never once did so.</li>
            <li> My older $20 Remington still work after 5 years and the battery stays charged.  </li>
            <li> For me, the 2020 does everything I need, and does it better than it&#x27;s more expensive cousin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> I decided to opt for the more expensive option hoping it will do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> mainly use the trimming head to shorten my body hair.</li>
            <li> The shave is much smoother than the old model and it handles very well.</li>
            <li> Decent design.  </li>
            <li> any sensitive part should be taken care of gently no matter how smooth the product is cause its not cut proof!</li>
            <li> The reviews were decent.</li>
            <li> recommendation would be to skip this particular model.  </li>
            <li> I had an older version of this.  </li>
            <li> The beard trimmer works well compared to the older Wahls that I had.</li>
            <li> The top part, for shaving the private area, includes a very short trimming edge on both side.</li>
            <li> I owned the older Phillips bodygroom razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavier and more solid to hold, there are no attachments and it has an indicator letting you know when battery is low.  </li>
            <li> It does a decent job with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the ultimate for grooming your most private area.  </li>
            <li> But I found, particularly in my groin area, that the trimmer didn&#x27;t always work.</li>
            <li> I normally shave with a razor but tried this electric shaver instead... took me 1.5 times as long and wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I like.</li>
            <li> Love this product i just wish it will last longer or the battery  will last longer</li>
            <li> Particularly the section that says once charged you&#x27;re supposed to use it until it dies before charging it again?</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t give a soft smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> This body groom is really good, but after few moths the battery had problem, but I bought the same one again because I like it</li>
            <li> My older Norelco 3-headed shaving razor is older and still has plenty of life.  </li>
            <li> There is definitely a lot to the bodygroom, and it does most things well enough, but none quite as well a dedicated tool.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older unit I had.</li>
            <li> but you might have to run through the same patch of hair more than once and in some cases in different directions..</li>
            <li> electric razor is well designed but it has two main design flaws.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not simple, you have to gingerly pull the contacts off the batteries which are soldered on and then make sure the battery connections are in place and the battery pack is making all the necessary connections along with the connections to the charging prongs.</li>
            <li> They allow for a better looking (if you ever have a habit of missing a few hairs these rarely miss a beat) and faster shave (they cut the hairs shorter allowing them to easily be cut by</li>
            <li> It was an upgrade after my older one would not hold the blade any longer.</li>
            <li> the head begins to lose the main net,so no way to continue</li>
            <li> However the main problem is the lifespan of the device.</li>
            <li> I use it on legs mainly.</li>
            <li> You need a steady hand around some body parts because this one is not forgiving....</li>
            <li> Never really seemed to do anything great but was serviceable in a few areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaving/trimming head is improved compared to the prior version, as the head is now articulated (it swings forward and back) to better match the contour of your body.  </li>
            <li> I think I red most of the reviews last year when I bought this piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, after a year or so the batteries don&#x27;t charge and it&#x27;s only good for a few minutes of underpowered clipping.  </li>
            <li> Since most such electronic devices suggest only perodic run-downs, it&#x27;s a bit of an annoyance.  </li>
            <li> Since most such electronic devices suggest only perodic run-downs, it&#x27;s a bit of an annoyance.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;The main flaw is the battery.</li>
            <li> This product efficiently and quickly trims and is really a solid device.</li>
            <li> Removed hair without cutting sensitive skin or causing razor burns; is also easy to clean and feels good in my hand-easy to manipulate around the shaving area and leaves public area skin silky-smooth.  </li>
            <li> shave itself is decent.  </li>
            <li> and I never had that issue with the older model.  </li>
            <li> However, Amazon was lower than the local &amp;#34;mega lowmart&amp;#34; and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an older model of the BodyGroom.</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t easily drop it to the floor when showering and your hands are wet and soapy, which the older model had.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so this works very well for me, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all with it....  </li>
            <li> first philips product for me, sounds nice and as described , a bit soft on skin , sometimes u need to press hard to get it all out, but</li>
            <li> It lasts me a really long time and it charges back up very quick too!</li>
            <li> The Trimmer: The guard on trimmer side easily falls down to the lowest setting, so I only use it on the lowest setting now, limiting its versatility significantly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive than most groomers, but is still cheaper than many.</li>
            <li> Though I have considered just letting the whole thing go natural, a la Seventies!</li>
            <li> To shave smooth, I have always used a Norelco 3 head shaver, AND a beard trimmer first to shave close enough so the razor can then be used without going over and over longer facial hair.</li>
            <li> but the top blade pulls at my hair, not cool . . .</li>
            <li> I got this since other shavers in the past had always cut me and took much longer to make everything just right and nowhere as good as this does.</li>
            <li> In the wild world of manscaping one must be willing to try new ideas, and sometimes suffer the consequences.  </li>
            <li> do find that the battery runs down quickly, and that the shaver isn&#x27;t very secure in the charger, but those are minor gripes.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the original Body Groom emitted only a moderate noise, just strong enough to give me confidence that it was going to get in, get the job done, and get out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, it does work great for beards and other less sensitive body real estate.</li>
            <li> This was not so, in fact the skin down there is as smooth as can be and I am completely comfortable into the next day.      </li>
            <li> I was recently shaving the top of my penis close to the base and the shaver took a pretty good bite (1/8 diameter) of skin which took a while to stop bleeding... not to mention it looked like it might be some other kind of</li>
            <li> No cuts, no nicks, no blood, no pain (just make sure you pull the skin tight and perform on dry/clean skin).</li>
            <li> OH, one other thing, I BET your partner put you up to this, isn&#x27;t that right!!</li>

            <li> Highly recommended without reservation.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have yet to return the BG2040 to Philips and discover how they handle warranty claims, but it is one of the more expensive options available on Amazon, so I would have expected better durability.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The Norelco did not work for me, therefore, I cannot rate it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing weigh training and high intensity interval cardio for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> You can tell it is made with high quality parts.</li>
            <li> But I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone and already have.</li>
            <li> I think some people are setting their expectation way to high for a $50 shaver.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The foil side does a good enough job that I don&#x27;t have to use my traditional wet razor very often anymore.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item to those who have to keep their body hair in check like myself.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for shaving body hair all around.</li>
            <li> In my experience, the battery life is only good for a few days before it needs charging, which sucks because the charger stand is kind of an eyesore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I opened it up and saw that Philips uses cheap NiMH batteries (not decent at all).</li>
            <li> As long as you keep it clean</li>
            <li> Clean up is a snap and battery lasts a long time during use.  </li>
            <li> It grooms extremely well the lower area allows you too nicely groom the area above and cleans up well the hair around the boys.</li>
            <li> The design makes it incredibly easy to trim all of the hair from your back and shave it smoothly with just a few passes.</li>
            <li> but like I said before, if you are careful it will be fine.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it offers both the &amp;#34;close shave&amp;#34; on one end and the adjustable trimmer on the other.  </li>
            <li> Mangroomer on the other hand produces the same kind of shave you can get if you were shaving your face with a hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> The shaver cuts close enough to cause minor razor burn on tender skin, but otherwise is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I like this electric shaver a lot, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is just because the shave isn&#x27;t excellent, and the battery life didn&#x27;t seem to be the specified 50 minutes on a full charge, but as long as it last long enough to do the job once, then I don&#x27;t mind putting it on the charger to refill for the next time.</li>
            <li> It could use a little better documentation</li>
            <li> The most I can use it for anymore is to trim my little goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want to be just a little hairy you will love this</li>
            <li> and I believe that the shaving on that was a little bit better, but it died.</li>
            <li> i will update this rating after i use it a little bit more.</li>
            <li> Wish there was a little more protection for drops thogh</li>
            <li> That could use a little more engineering.</li>
            <li> , I thought maybe a little trim would be okay.</li>
            <li> The shipment took a little longer that it should have but that was okay.</li>
            <li> be a little more flexible.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time and blades clean easily and stay sharp.</li>
            <li> It was a little more than what I planned on spending at the time</li>
            <li> it could have be a little more ergonomic to be used on the face but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Extremely satisfied with this product, I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a year I think.</li>
            <li> Worked great when it was new, but began using less as the battery became less and less potent.</li>
            <li> This groomer works extremely well, cleans easily, and has a sleek design.</li>
            <li> I guess that goes without saying, but from all the other reviews I had read I thought it was just gonna be a relaxed easy going experience with these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The body shaver side does cut very close to the skin, also without nicking, and has a dual sided fine trimmer as well to knock down the hairs.  </li>
            <li> It casts a large shadow so it should be used in a well lit bathroom, preferably where the light is coming in from different sides of the room or directly above.     </li>
            <li> I cannot speak yet on if it is worth the price over the lower end models, but it feels very solid and high build quality.</li>
            <li> It gets everything the first time and is so quick compared to other ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> even when I used it on the most tender parts, and I even used the shaver end it on everything down yonder!  </li>
            <li> this is the first body grooming sistem that i can use with totally confidence that i will no get hurt... very high recommended</li>
            <li> One thing that others haven&#x27;t mentioned: It actually LOOKS GOOD on the bathroom counter and takes up very little space.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this new body groomer to replace the older model before this one.  </li>
            <li> I had the older BG2020 before upgrading to this new trimmer.</li>
            <li> All other positive reviews are true.  </li>
            <li> The micro trimmer is great, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> Like many others who have written reviews, I chose to ignore the negative reviews that detailed horror stories of cuts, gashes, and &amp;#34;craters&amp;#34; left in the wake of this product.  </li>
            <li> Helpfully, it&#x27;s waterproof which gives you the flexibility to use it in the shower, and the curved shaft between the groomer and the trimmer has a rubber grip that allows a secure hold even when the Bodygroom is wet.</li>
            <li> where near gonna be as fast as a razor.      </li>
            <li> I have only charged this item 2x in the last 5 days which was amazing compared to the 2020 which after a shaving session, I would have to charge daily.  </li>
            <li> The stand is really cool-looking and the dual action allows me to get the shave I need.</li>
            <li> spent hours researching the perfect all-around shaver that wasn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> Any sensitive area like obliques or your ass, be ready for some rashes.</li>
            <li> Great hair removal,  lousy</li>
            <li> I was surprised how close of a shave it really was.</li>
            <li> Then, I tried an epilator (which looks like a shaver, but just pulls the hair out completely), and while this is the best removal method, it&#x27;s painful and very time-consuming.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Really frustrated is the best way to sum it up.  </li>
            <li> I really like this model so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the item holds its initial charge for quite a while and that it&#x27;s one of the few shavers/groomers that&#x27;s really easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> Fantastic battery life does everything I expected it to do</li>
            <li> Use light pressure and make several passes (much like using a regular electric shaver on your face).  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco Bodygroom stopped working after much use and 4 or 5 years time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Helps to keep you really trimmed and professional looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, trims your body hair to display a man that takes pride in his presentation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the shaver part much at all, but use the trimmer frequently.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s just my tastes, but the foil side snags far too much when my beard is on the longer side (1/4th inch) and cuts way to close regardless.</li>
            <li> However, if you want to shave in the &amp;#34;more sensitive places&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m very scared about what might happen.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but reading all the great reviews from users like myself</li>
            <li> Great groomer, works as expected, like the dual sides, don&#x27;t be afraid of it. :)</li>
            <li> but if u still need to cut few more u can click to start again</li>
            <li> I really like the small edger on the top and bottom of the trimming area.</li>
            <li> No grooming tool for men worth its salt can be sold on the premise that shaving must be a two-person operation if the entire body is to be tended to.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally like to write these things, but I thought I would give it a shot.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t decide between the models, spend the extra $, it&#x27;s well worth it to get the 2040.  </li>
            <li> Replaces my normal face shaver and body trimmer  </li>
            <li> Now that it was ready to use I proceeded to use the &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; side first on the #1 guide setting to cut the hair short before switching to the &amp;#34;shaver&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Normally, after trimming and then shaving with a manual, I&#x27;d end up with some razor burn/irritation 1-2 days after.</li>
            <li> I like the dual heads, but I would have rather had a smaller, more agile groomer with removable settings than this larger, more awkward setup</li>
            <li> I recently began growing a beard, just for fun.    </li>
            <li> actually prefer to use the basic body groom from Norelco far more than this one.</li>
            <li> Ok, one thing; battery last really long.</li>
            <li> Then, I get 10 minutes at most of use before it goes dead.  </li>
            <li> It is good for getting into small areas such as groin or in the crevice of your chest (the sternum).  </li>
            <li> The charger stand is small and appropriate, doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li> However, if you are not careful (don&#x27;t go too fast!)</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> When he first received it he was a bit unsure but now that he has had time to actually use it he really likes it.</li>
            <li> (you can make it slip with excess pressure) and holds well under normal use.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but you need to know this before getting it.</li>
            <li> The maximum length setting (5) is more than long enough for anything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably just bring a normal razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver works almost as a razor, the shaving is pretty close, but if you use it  in different direction it has nothing to envy to a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Light soft hairs that grow long on my chest.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re never 100% sure it&#x27;s set in correctly and there is no light letting you know either.</li>
            <li> Overall, its worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will last long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about it at all, but can&#x27;t send it back.</li>
            <li> I suppose I can&#x27;t be too annoyed since I did get 3 years of good use out of this shaver.</li>
            <li> It is a good razor for body hair, but not great for your face or beard.  </li>
            <li> The main shaving and trimming parts easily break down for cleaning.</li>
            <li> It has a very cool charger, very modern and sleek looking, if a bit larger than some of our other trimmers.  </li>
            <li> BTW I did not use the other end, so that might work fine for all I know.</li>
            <li> I was lucky, otherwise one will need to go to a department or local store to see if they sell one small oil lubricator and pay more</li>
            <li> One thing I will miss about the Wahl (at least when it was new), is the amazing battery life.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised (I only tried it dry) and does a much better job</li>
            <li> It is not effective underwater, as it was advertised to be, but it is versatile on dry skin and is great for neatening up.  </li>
            <li> It is good but Less than expected</li>
            <li> I am able to safely and efficiently trim down the hair, and then subsequently shave it off with the other end.</li>
            <li> The precision trimmer, similarly, works well enough that I&#x27;m not complaining, but not quite as good as other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I mean can you honestly blame me?</li>
            <li> It is water proof so in the shower is so much easier and no mess.</li>
            <li> I mean, if you somehow eunuch-ize  yourself with this, it&#x27;s probably your own fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right out of the package this shaver has a solid feel to it.  </li>
            <li> The price was right and a rebate added the final touch.</li>
            <li> I had been contemplating this purchase for awhile, and finally made a decision when the price was right.</li>
            <li> But, the last time I dropped it it hit just right and bent the blade head.</li>
            <li> right next to number 2 trimmer is  trimmer 3 which is like</li>
            <li> We are in the 21st century right?</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time and is really quick to refill at just around an hour.</li>
            <li> Luckily I have long arms.</li>
            <li> If this is your first body trimmer, you don&#x27;t know if it can be better or worse for certain.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first but man, it is great!</li>
            <li> (i mean come on who hasn&#x27;t lost some of the 800 attachments other products provide) and the combination of the trimmer and foil gives you nice smooth results.</li>
            <li> Very nice, got tired of the waxing pain!</li>
            <li> I took it slowly, cutting down the forest first with the close shaving end, only to find out it was better to shave down most of it with the guarded side first, which brought down the hair much more quickly.  </li>
            <li> proper lubrication, the razor does a pretty decent job, comparable to a Gillette Trac-II blade razor (which costs under $1).  </li>
            <li> This one has been going strong for almost a year with no issues and no signs of slowing down.</li>
            <li> but it certainly was a disappointment for me because the convenience of the product is great</li>
            <li> The Remington neatly fit into an assortment of other men&#x27;s care products:</li>
            <li> The Remington neatly fit into an assortment of other men&#x27;s care products:</li>
            <li> The other end, however, is noticeably sharper, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it below the belt, but it&#x27;s great for other areas such as the chest or neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Another thing is that this shaver or most electric shavers in general are a lot more difficult to shave in between crevices or curvy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much harder to shave the boys using this as compared to the original model.</li>
            <li> the other end is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I primarily bought this to use on my man parts but trim chest hair and some other spots too.  </li>
            <li> :  It does an admirable job of shaving smoothly and closely everywhere in the nether regions, without nicks or other drama.  </li>
            <li> When I would stumble out of bed to turn it off, I&#x27;d find it very hot - about to start a fire hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The other end is a razor which can be used to smooth over stubble.  </li>
            <li> It charges well and and has a nice appearance, so overall it works well but is a little aggressive for me.</li>
            <li> So basically you have to solder contacts on NEW batteries</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco is for that new man.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco is for that new man.</li>
            <li> After using the Panasonic ER224s for years, I wanted a new one that could be used in or out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;After looking for a trimmer to shave my chest and lower region in the shower, I came across the Philips BG-2040 and Remington BHT-650.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li> I like the new dual-head design and improved ergonomics of the handle.</li>
            <li> I am new to using a shaver in the shower</li>
            <li> a new foil for the shaver end and works as new.  </li>
            <li> And it had been awhile since I had performed any grooming because I was looking for a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I returned the item to Amazon and have since received a new groomer that thankfully charges as designed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is still just like new.</li>
            <li> Philips sent me new one.  </li>
            <li> So it work like new again.</li>
            <li> Will need to buy new foil head.</li>
            <li> So.. after i got this new body groomer, i tried it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need to get a new one.</li>
            <li> EDIT- Customer Support provided me a brand new shaver and for that I will have to give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Swapped the new shaving foil ($12?)</li>
            <li> and I went looking for a new body hair removal device.  </li>
            <li> the market for a new one this weekend, and</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco is my new shaving brand.</li>
            <li> this IS her NEW Groomer....</li>
            <li> Mine stopped charging after a month or so, but Norelco customer service got me a new one in about 3 days in a painless warranty process.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new shaver...</li>
            <li> So I plan on buying a new eventually.</li>
            <li> I can live with that for the convenience of using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> We live, we learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the new one and charged it and brought it with me on a business trip out of the country.</li>
            <li> but I need new blades where do I</li>
            <li> put the brand new guide on the Bodygroom, and -- (drum roll, please)</li>
            <li> My husband used 9ne for 3 years and I just got him a new one.</li>
            <li> I talked to Philips customer service and they send me out a new one.</li>
            <li> Basically...needs a new after every 2 uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this new razor I got.</li>
            <li> It runs out of battery a bit faster than it did when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably just going to purchase a new one instead.</li>
            <li> I tried the new one and zap.</li>
            <li> but with the new charging cord.  </li>
            <li> I am going to buy a new trimmer, just not this one.</li>
            <li> I need a new one</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be looking for a new product that has a battery that doesn&#x27;t tie after 10 charges.</li>
            <li> I honestly tried about 5 different angles and approaches and I could not cut any hair, and would probably still be standing there trying to trim if I did not get out my old Wahl and limped it along to knock the tall hair down.  </li>
            <li> The charger stand also folds flat which makes the entire system easy to store or pack for travel.  </li>
            <li> Every man should own this product, whether you just want to trim you facial hair, or shave it completely, this product will not let you down.</li>
            <li> So far, I have not had any issues with the adjustable trimmer sliding down to the lowest setting when trimming hair and the trimmer is by far my favorite side of the groomer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far safer and easy to use than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> after the battery died after nearly a year, I called Norelco to see how to get a replacement and because I registered this product they sent me a new item - no questions!</li>
            <li> So, I tried putting the blade from the old one into the new one and looks like blade from the older model</li>
            <li> I have used it both wet and dry, but for me dry use is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am &amp;#34;naturally tan&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s a challenge finding something that will leave a clean canvas minus the nicks.</li>
            <li> The only downside I have found is it really does need to be fully charged to really get the job done.  </li>
            <li> only complaint may be that is that shape wise</li>
            <li> my last Norelco had multiple combs, none of which was ever the precisely correct length.  </li>
            <li> Be careful of drops because once you break the top you only have the side burn end that will work.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re on the go fast you can simply brush a towel gently across the area and that&#x27;ll get rid of the excess powder, too.  </li>
            <li> people who have issues with it most likely rush or are a bit too rough on it.</li>
            <li> The main reason I purchased this was for smoothing out the old twigs and berries, so the misses doesn&#x27;t get bark in her teeth.  </li>
            <li> Nice heavy balanced feel for a personal groomer.  </li>
            <li> The red light at the back of the shaver flashes when I try to turn it</li>
            <li> The charger works fast; the charger only takes about an hour to fully charge and you&#x27;re ready for another 50-60 minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still able to get the fade, I just have to take the comb off and be extra careful.    </li>
            <li> Smoothly handling the most difficult places to shave,&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I tend to shave my body so this shaver really only gets you so smooth before you have to switch to an actual razor.  </li>
            <li> * your private areas will be safe including the boys, i&#x27;d recommend that area being wet</li>
            <li> I loved this product at first, but was seriously disappointed by how quickly it died.</li>
            <li> it is good in the shower and so far I have not experienced the charging and holding charge issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t entirely the body groomer&#x27;s fault, obviously, but I figure if the thing&#x27;s job is to trim body hair (and we all know what specific region of body hair that most buyers are interested in trimming), then it better be designed in such a way as to make that a little simpler.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it highly to anyone wanting to go clean down below.</li>
            <li> Capable of shaving almost my whole body on a single charge makes this very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Every single time I have used it to try to shave my most sensitive area, however, I have been left bleeding and in pain.  </li>
            <li> thing I do find a little bothersome is that the fella runs out of juice pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I had the previous model, and like any tool after learning how to use it have found that there&#x27;s really no other or better option for your \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These blades will work fine if you shave a flat-surface area like your legs for example, but any other areas that are curvy and sensitive like your groin, they will cut your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> You can get a very, very close shave with the pivot head, but it won&#x27;t be the same as using a razor, waxing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I only had one problem and Philips took care of it very fast.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Some how they&#x27;ve changed this thing so that it can shave very sensitive areas without any pain or nicking at all.</li>
            <li> I mean you can&#x27;t really get any better than this.  </li>
            <li> I could live with all this if the initial cost wasn&#x27;t higher.</li>
            <li> The shaving side takes a little practice and getting used to, but overall works very well and does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li> Where it really shines is taking down a full blown hairy area, and getting you down to smooth.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 2 weeks, then blades seemed to dull and the battery last very very shortly, especially when you use the beard groomer.</li>
            <li> The screen side doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I&#x27;d like but still better than any lady shaver I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Bigger, better, smoother than the smaller one with the blue handle.  </li>
            <li> I first started shaving \\&quot;below the neck\\&quot; while deployed to Iraq because it was the only way to prevent \\&quot;desert</li>
            <li> This means you can just wave this thing all over your body, in many lazy passes, without having to worry about nicking or hurting yourself.</li>
            <li> This thing is LOUD!  </li>
            <li> Now where exactly will I be shaving since not everyone will shave the same spots.</li>
            <li> The first unit I ordered from Amazon simply would not charge.</li>
            <li> I like to keep the package they hang out in completely hairless, this groomer does it!</li>
            <li> This razor is so fearless, you could allow your significant other to use it on you, or you could use it on them.  </li>
            <li> However, I miss my old 2020 for one reason - this one bites!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thoroughly enjoyed using this unit for the past 6 months.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this is the shaver for you!</li>
            <li> The Philips BF2040 is my first personal groomer.</li>
            <li> A must by if interested into personal grooming men and women alike.</li>
            <li> I bought my first back in 2010 while living in Italy!</li>
            <li> THIS SHAVER NEARLY BLED ME TO DEATH!  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my significant other; he loves it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> Although the shaving head is exactly the same as the one on the BG2020</li>
            <li> Wow..!</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have owned after the first one stopped charging.</li>
            <li> You definitely need to trim with the blade guard first.</li>
            <li> I sent the first one back</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li> Pretty simple.</li>
            <li> I had two of these, the first got left at a hotel</li>
            <li> Much better than other similar products.</li>
            <li> Who knew hair grew in so many different places other than your head?</li>
            <li> I will not shave the pits again, as there is other issues with that area, i will only trim there and feel confident this unit will do well.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if that will be better or not for me.</li>
            <li> Well worth trying it out as long as you remember to take your time.</li>
            <li> I find myself having to go over areas more than I would on the other model to get the same result.</li>
            <li> Exactly 2 years later</li>
            <li> Exactly 2 years later</li>
            <li> The skin-protecting shaving head is made from hypo-allergenic materials, and you can see the difference after having, you don&#x27;t get any rash or itching due to the shave, again this is important for the sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also a gift for my significant other.</li>
            <li> but honestly, it&#x27;s pretty darn close enough.</li>
            <li> However it needs its dock for charging and this creates a need for a more than usual space for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used this consistently &amp; its actually exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is probably the most expensive product on the market, yet its performance is lousy at best!  </li>
            <li> That was the first and last time I will use a Norelco product.  </li>
            <li> I thought this model would be a significant improvement over my three year old Bodygroom, but not really.  </li>
            <li> They either tug the hair and cause pain, barely trim, or leave really scratchy stubble.</li>
            <li> The trimmer end, even on the closest setting, does not get close enough to cut the skin, which is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2YR5TCUXZR33P]]This is my second Norelco Bodygroom product, and just like the first one, it stopped working about a year after the warranty</li>
            <li> (here) is probably more efficient for trimming as the clip-on combs require lots of repetitive strokes from all angles, but my review has to do with the shaver portion.  </li>
            <li> Seemed to worked pretty well when it actually worked, but don&#x27;t know what to do now.</li>
            <li> I was able to correct this to a small extent by repeatedly turning on the unit and leaving it running until it stopped on</li>
            <li> Mine is broken( top part of the shaving head, secure net to protect you from blades)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works exactly the same as if you used a razor and cream.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is that it can&#x27;t hold a charge, and it takes FOREVER to charge it in the first place.  </li>
            <li> ; This is a quality shaving unit, and will complete any of your body grooming tasks!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd unit, I replaced the first one after the battery life dropped to about 5 minutes per charge.</li>
            <li> Able to reach my back and works well on all the other parts of the body (chest, groin).</li>
            <li> this has become my first and only option for body shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used many of shaver in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not huge, the battery life is good enough to trim your body and facial hair, can be used in the shower, and doesn&#x27;t take any space.</li>
            <li> My hair trimmer does a good job over all of trimming body hair but is bulky and running a cord and extension cord all around is not ideal.</li>
            <li> and it was replaced under warranty with a new one but with the clear proviso that the warranty would not be extended for the new model.</li>
            <li> I have blonde/brown facial hair that doesn&#x27;t grow to thick or fast on my face so this actually works very well for easy, quick trim/shave.</li>
            <li> as long as you&#x27;re careful down there and pay attention to what you are doing it works great.</li>
            <li> , in my humble opinion, nothing can beat a normal (but good quality) razor to shave down there.</li>
            <li> After owning many trimmers where you had to be very very careful not to nick the boys, I approached these with the same caution.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking a little larger than expected.</li>
            <li> Was so easy that I got a little bite carried on a got the legs</li>
            <li> /&gt;While $50 might seem a bit high for the actual item received, it is only a few dollars more than you might wish to pay, and if it works for at least 2 years it will be a good value.</li>
            <li> The only problems are: 1) it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long; and 2) the plastic comb piece that attaches to head tends to break easily.</li>
            <li> Tried it on my upper arm, shoulders, back, lower neck and got a clean result.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product on a daily basis to trim my facial hair (I like it at about a 4) and clean up any unwanted stubble, this despite the fact that it is not intended for use on the face.</li>
            <li> What it doesn&#x27;t do well is get things really clean in tighter and harder to reach areas (like directly under my nose).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using things like this for about ten years for the clean head effect and they used to last a couple of years.</li>
            <li> So I took the plunge and bought this in town and what can I say even though the instructions say for neck down Only this thing works great for keeping my head shaved down almost as close as a traditonal razor blade but without the cut&#x27;s and irritations.  </li>
            <li> It trimmed my body hair and left me as clean as a male porn star.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it keeps me baby smooth down there for her.</li>
            <li> every where else, I feel comfortable when using it down below and haven&#x27;t had any nicks, scraps or cuts.  </li>
            <li> , I prefer a smooth shave down there, as does my wife, so I turned the trimmer end off, and switched to the razor end.</li>
            <li> Primarily I use it for shaving some unwanted chest hair and for trimming down there.</li>
            <li> it will give you a smooth shave down there, but it does have it&#x27;s flaws.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any issues other than trying to figure out how to clean it.</li>
            <li> Now I have this new one and it kicks my old trimmers butt.</li>
            <li> The new one&#x27;s battery life has lasted one year so far and the battery life is now diminising</li>
            <li> Naturally, I wanted to show off the new physique.</li>
            <li> long as you are sensible, and don&#x27;t put the side trimmers at a right angle to your skin, you will never even feel it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use small, gentle, 1-2\\&quot; strokes for areas of dense hair, and broader strokes for just a light dusting of hair.  </li>
            <li> It has 5 different measurements for your beard and can easily shave the neck (or any other place) to a smooth surface with the other side.</li>
            <li> and the guide moved easily to the shortest setting creating a uneven cut.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer will easily remove the hair that&#x27;s been there for a few months.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s easy to get Impatient</li>
            <li> This product is most definitely not worth the extra $25.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and operates as expected.</li>
            <li> It balances on a silly holder that is just built to look cool on your sink top.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a predecessor to this groomer and was skeptical to buy a newer version since I liked the older one so much.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t turn as many RPM&#x27;s as the full size razor which means it has trouble with the occasional single , longer than stubble, hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I find the handle design is good and long, allowing me to reach all sections of my back, with a little stretch.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It might take a little bit of getting used to, but it works just fine after a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Every few years we buy a new one bc the battery poops out, but we always get this brand because of the quality performance and that it&#x27;s great in wet and dry environments.</li>
            <li> I bought the BG20240 based on positive reviews, but cannot personally recommend.</li>
            <li> When you plug the charger in, the indicator light will flash green while charging;  when fully charged, the light shows steady green.  </li>
            <li> had it long enough to guage battery life, but I am overall pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The only thing i can tell is that the battery does not last so much, so you have to recharge very often, however, this product is excelent!</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if it is necessary but as cheap as it is I feel like it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> and like most batteries they don&#x27;t last long enough for a shave after two years.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, I returned it to Amazon, as it&#x27;s just not powerful enough to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, gets the job done, looks cool.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite grooming tool, at least during lake season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> Used it very rarely, maybe once a month or even less.  </li>
            <li> Also, the trimmers are less effective when your hair is wet.</li>
            <li> The shaver sits in the holder less securely than the old model.</li>
            <li> Ultimately I decided to pay a bit more than the BD2028 or the BG2038 thinking that the previous one had lasted over 7 years.</li>
            <li> I use it more dry than I do when wet.</li>
            <li> The battery problems were typical for 3 year old (cheap) rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> I most likely will be buying the previous version of this again.  </li>
            <li> I do not use this on my shaft or scrotum, razor is much better for that area and much less likely to get cut.</li>
            <li> Trimming of body hair (after your initial grooming) only takes two quick passes to maintain your desired results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This device has two sides with different functions: one (the upper side) was built to eliminate any kind of hairs without irritation in EVERY area of the body, including that one down there.</li>
            <li> I remember reading reviews and comments over a year ago before choosing this unit, some quite entertaining and some rather awkwardly juvenile descriptions of \\&quot;your junk\\&quot; which were were also sometimes entertaining, as least as far as being in a locker room can be.  </li>
            <li> Some areas are more fragile and require a little technique... Or a soft touch!</li>
            <li> These batteries held up long enough for me to use it one full session before recharging when it was new.</li>
            <li> The back end is OK for trimming but still is not full size and the #1,2,3 adjustable part does not lock well and slips halfway through using it giving you an accidental shorter cut, so it is disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just over an year after I purchased it, the trimmer part is dead, though the groomer works fine.</li>
            <li> The charger stand is a bit gimmicky, but works fine.  </li>
            <li> but, just like the trimmer, it&#x27;s not as good as other electric shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> The saver works fine, it can hurt a little if the hairs are too long, so I suggest using the trimmer first</li>
            <li> You have to fold it a certain way to get the power supply cord in and then fold it a different way in order to get the groomer in the charging cradle.</li>
            <li> I had originally tried using both my hair clippers and my electric razor for my face on my chest, which worked to some degree, but it either didn&#x27;t get the hair down as far as I&#x27;d like, or I would have razor burn.  </li>
            <li> trimmer guard still seems a little cheap</li>
            <li> trimmer is good for thicker hair but is worthless for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> And, I think it actually hurts a little more than a razor &#x27;cause it plucks a</li>
            <li> only with the guard on first for the major cut.  </li>
            <li> better reach for hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> it is oddly curved and very large for trimming the intimate areas.  </li>
            <li> Before my shower, I sat down on my favorite throne (aka &#x27;toilet&#x27;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little strange looking and the charging stand is pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li> Using the guard on the 4 or 5 setting is nice for keeping leg and arm hair in check, but doesn&#x27;t shave it enough to be &amp;#34;noticeable&amp;#34; and I use it on 1 for my underarms to avoid nicking myself on the hard angles.</li>
            <li> As a wife that cleans her hubby up - I not only needed it to be easy to use - I needed it to work on him without the nicks, cuts, or other dangers involved when shaving this sensitive area.  </li>
            <li> The cost of the new complete charger is $55, the same price of the new unit!</li>
            <li> In contrast to other positive reviews, I do not find this electric shaver works very well on either armpit hair or the pubic region.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the reviews got better as the better model presented itself,  the price increase didn&#x27;t shoot up that bad.  </li>
            <li> Bad in you won&#x27;t get perfectly smooth with this, but good because then your skin won&#x27;t get as irritated from the hair braking back through.</li>
            <li> I fault Amazon for not making this clear in its description of this shaver.</li>
            <li> I used it on my Italian sweater that I had been wearing my whole adult life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They make a big deal about the advances like the 3d pivoting head, but it&#x27;s not really that smooth a shave.</li>
            <li> It seems to last much longer than my old nimh.  </li>
            <li> I still have to resort to a regular wet razor for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quite fiddly to keep in the cradle for charging, and the thing can&#x27;t be plugged directly in, so even if it&#x27;s only the charger that died, the whole thing is now unusable.</li>
            <li> (Maybe Norelco has improved the battery life since mine is 2+ years old now?)</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with nicks or cut while trimming sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> However, the only issue I&#x27;ve had with it is the guard on the razor itself doesn&#x27;t guard very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oddly loud, too.</li>
            <li> This is much better.en was solid, not fancy.</li>
            <li> After that, the manual states that the shaver/trimmer should be used twice a year where you let it die completely where the motor stops working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After that, the manual states that the shaver/trimmer should be used twice a year where you let it die completely where the motor stops working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that it&#x27;s just a first-time marriage that needed to break-in and was going to work itself out (..at least, I hoped....lol).  </li>
            <li> how do i get it fixed or replaced?</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my current all-around trimmer for almost a year.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s been a complete letdown.  </li>
            <li> The groomer itself actually works really well.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and every time I used it the \\&quot;please charge me\\&quot; light blinks on.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it thus far.</li>
            <li> I find anything with batteries wares out far too soon.</li>
            <li> With this upgraded model, they&#x27;ve apparently fixed that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , however it occasionally nicked things (ouch) and it didn&#x27;t hold a charge very well at all.  </li>
            <li> regular razors is so much simpler</li>
            <li> I have used this electric shaver two times so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trimming and shaving frank and the boys for about a year now using an old beard   trimmer and Gillette Fusion razor.  </li>
            <li> On my old Body Groom, for whatever reason, this was never an issue and never caused any pain.  </li>
            <li> On this one, the friction that results from contact with sensitive skin hurts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About that old Body Groom I owned.  </li>
            <li> How I rue the day I bought this and threw the old one in the trash.  </li>
            <li> what you gain is a complete assurance thatyou won&#x27;t cut yourself.</li>
            <li> It has two ends - one for trimming body hair and another for shaving (including sensitive areas) without any cuts or scratches on the skin.</li>
            <li> He used to break out when he used his old body groomer</li>
            <li> The only thing I really hope they eventually do is add the ability to dispense lotion, which my face razor does.</li>
            <li> and there that really stand out next to closely shaven skin.  </li>
            <li> But the battery life dropped so rapidly to near unusable that I cannot recommend this item.</li>
            <li> And there&#x27;s no avoiding them as far as I can tell...</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with this razor is that you can&#x27;t plug the cord directly into the razor.</li>
            <li> though this shaver is a body groomer and not advertised as a facial hair trimmer, I do use it to trim my beard, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I blame myself not the machine for the cut, i was just going to fast thinking I wouldn&#x27;t have enough time to cover everything in 50 minutes</li>
            <li> It works well in those sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Thanks Philips for the brushed metal finish.  </li>
            <li> The battery life truly surprised me.  </li>
            <li> Charger automatically shuts off when charging is complete.  </li>
            <li> Never have i received an item that I am so completely blown away by.</li>
            <li> times there was blood coming out when trying to shave in the sensitive place.</li>
            <li> When it came time for me to replace it, I went with this since you naturally want to go with the \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li> I suppose it wasn&#x27;t really intended to be used for facial hair.  </li>
            <li> it far exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel it did a much better job and in at least 1/10th</li>
            <li> This shaver doesn&#x27;t cause as much irritation or nicking as I got when I tried a regular old face shaver, but there&#x27;s still some, and it doesn&#x27;t get anywhere near as close as the face shaver.</li>
            <li> This constantly nips my skin and doesn&#x27;t shave very close.</li>
            <li> For the Man that worries about shaving the Chest and Forest below and knows how sensitive those areas are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nick-free and it frequently pinches in places that you don&#x27;t want it pinching.  </li>
            <li> I frequent</li>
            <li> Use it all over even on sensitive skin areas.  </li>
            <li> I never had much pubic hair since I also purchased the Personal Shavers Men Package..</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t want to be completely hairless...</li>
            <li> I found a refurbished version of my old Remington beard trimmer here on Amazon, and will buy that for both beard and body.  </li>
            <li> My old Philips Norelco Bodygroomer worked</li>
            <li> I ditched the old one and purchased this model.</li>
            <li> I spent more than 4 times to remove it properly so it might be different situation from man to man!</li>
            <li> have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I took the head off of it and stuck it on the old model I still have.</li>
            <li> I only nicked myself twice in this area and it was because I was going fast and rushing through.</li>
            <li> Tested on legs and arms so far.</li>
            <li> You cannot plug it directly in; you have to use the charging cradle.</li>
            <li> part is its not to loud and is usable in shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I only use it for 15mins in shower depending how much I have to shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be direct here and tell you</li>
            <li> No complaints at all so far</li>
            <li> Just works, unexpectedly well in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note; when you remove the foil for cleaning, read the directions on how to handle it.  </li>
            <li> It does nip sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Just shave &#x27;em with an old fashioned razor like everyone else does, it&#x27;s easier.</li>
            <li> As far as longevity goes I csnt say.</li>
            <li> Since I happen to have one from my old trimmer</li>
            <li> I am only giving four stars as I have not had a chance to use it that much..</li>
            <li> So far this is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really the only issue anyone could have with this device.</li>
            <li> It takes 2 separate uses to complete a beard trimming.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have with the 2040 is that it tugs on longer hair if I move to fast, which is something I never had a problem with on the 2020.</li>
            <li> really want to return it but cannot as I am leaving for a trip tomorrow and wont be back for</li>
            <li> It was my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my old Norelco BodyGroom.</li>
            <li> This is completely the razor you want if you want to shave your man bits.</li>
            <li> I ended up using my old Braun shaver instead.</li>
            <li> A couple of times I&#x27;ve gotten nicked, but overall it works very well for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> Now as far as shaving \\&quot;below the border\\</li>
            <li> When my old Norelco sideburns trimmer died on my, I was researching for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Got this for Valentine&#x27;s Day for my boyfriend to replace his old shaver.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have soft supple skin</li>
            <li> Oh, why did I toss my old Bodygroom so hastily?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try the last possible angle available to me, short of bending the space-time continuum. 9)</li>
            <li> : When I use this shaver, either it cuts so close that it makes a crater in my skin, or it&#x27;s so far off</li>
            <li> It gets the job done so much faster than the regular shaver.</li>
            <li> It died last year which really saddened me for it</li>
            <li> I really like the brushed metal body.</li>
            <li> It cut hair evenly and has not nicked my skin, even in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Removes the hair completely.</li>
            <li> Norelco does it completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough around the manly areas so don&#x27;t worry about that.</li>
            <li> Complete junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructions are rather sketchy as far as removal of the shaving foil head.  </li>
            <li> The groomer comes complete with a charging stand and charges the groomer within one hour.  </li>
            <li> The foil side has cut me often in some sensitive places.  </li>
            <li> have an old trimmer (19.00) one that I got at Walmart and am toying with getting another of that brand.  </li>
            <li> Meh.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving end doesnt shave completely at all,</li>
            <li> I think most of the negative feedback regarding this product revolves around the life of the battery.</li>
            <li> if that happens, then this shaver will have far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> ...works well for the sensitive parts of your BODY...</li>
            <li> My old razor had an attachment that was about 1/2 the length</li>
            <li> :  The one thing the bodygroom absolutely excels at is its sheer versatility.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning and charging is a breeze, and have had no problems thus far.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not to say grab it and go wild</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any male who wants to trim body hair.</li>
            <li> and I nearly broke</li>
            <li> Before buying this trimmer, I researched reviews, hoping to find one that would not cut me in sensitive places.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen many negative reviews about the charging/battery.</li>
            <li> almost* completely gone, but not as close as a razor and cream.  </li>
            <li> so I was looking for something to remove my natural snuggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> That actually made it work really well today though.</li>
            <li> just pain old</li>
            <li> Mine takes over 12 hours for the green blinking light to go out after usage.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Frequently Bought Together</li>
            <li> I do not expect it to perform a shave like my Braun razor, but I would like for it to trim side burns and shape my beard a bit, but both of those tasks are far beyond its capability.  </li>
            <li> Or at least a system that&#x27;s geared more toward function than form.  </li>
            <li> The quality and style of the Norelco far exceeds what you would expect in a Body Groomer.</li>
            <li> Complete loss of words.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband who has a very hairy back.</li>
            <li> First we use the trimmer to get rid of the long hair</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> does not shave smoothly or completely like a razor would.</li>
            <li> Works very well for facial hair shaving/trimming and for &#x27;manscaping&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I am a female and I can&#x27;t stand women&#x27;s trimmers - they just pull too much.</li>
            <li> I love the unit, but the stand sucks</li>
            <li> The shaver was much too big and clumsey for her.</li>
            <li> I took it out the box, charged it up and completely shaved everything but my face in under 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> The BG2040 Body Groom Pro does the job but tends to pull hair in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for nearly a year now</li>
            <li> I got this body groomer for my husband because his old one went out after 5 years of service.  </li>
            <li> Buy the replacement head, but don&#x27;t change it too early</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as they make it out to shave.</li>
            <li> For those of us who are very hairy, I&#x27;d recommend just doing some manscaping with clippers with a short guard or no guard with maximum taper.</li>
            <li> For those of us who are very hairy, I&#x27;d recommend just doing some manscaping with clippers with a short guard or no guard with maximum taper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old and suffered through women&#x27;s razors all my life.</li>
            <li> It can be used everywhere and anywhere including your sensitive parts.  </li>
            <li> I received mine a few days ago and have already used it, simply the best thing I ever used to shave my coarse and thick hair without any cuts or bruises.</li>
            <li> My guess is these quality batteries will last much longer than 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The design is very sleek and solid, so I look forward to using this for some time!</li>
            <li> So far I like the body-groom, even though I haven tested all its features.  </li>
            <li> Shaves everything below my waste with no irritation and leaves the skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> battery completely quits 2 years and two months from purchase.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old trimmer with this for use as a beard/stubble trimmer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake of leaving it on the charger when not in use, the battery seems to form a memory and will start to lose power near the end of grooming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 20 year old guy, and I&#x27;m Indian.</li>
            <li> And my hair grows back really fast.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s completely bricked, won&#x27;t even charge when plugged in.</li>
            <li> For those of you that are apprehensive about using this device in sensitive areas - don&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li> Fearless body hair grooming, including sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> old.</li>
            <li> Recommended 100% built to last does it&#x27;s job very well and for its price could be considered a steal don&#x27;t think twice</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had it for 8 months.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all about making a fast buck, make a product to last</li>
            <li> but it did feel like it pinched the more delicate areas as per my sweetie&#x27;s critique</li>
            <li> Far below the neck.  </li>
            <li> end first if its too long for the foil side to handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> By far the best.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Purchased in February 2012, and they battery completely died in January 2015, which puts it out of warranty range.</li>
            <li> The unit seems well designed and works well so far.  </li>
            <li> use it sensitive areas between my thighs, under, on the scrotum, between</li>
            <li> And when you think about all the functions this item offers it&#x27;s not overpriced.  </li>
            <li> As the old saying goes, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin soft after shaving.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use the bottom part without the guard for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> No bite in the sensitive shave areas.</li>
            <li> I had an old razor that I</li>
            <li> but it does not cut you or leave razer burn in your sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS ANYWHERE ON OR NEAR YOUR BALLS.</li>
            <li> the real problem is that it wouldn&#x27;t sit in its charging station properly so it would never charge.</li>
            <li> Works really fast (only a couple of passes did the trick).</li>
            <li> Maybe my face is just too soft, but never had this problem before.</li>
            <li> However, I do think using the clipper edge with the guard removed is by far the riskiest proposition.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with nicks or cut while trimming sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> The blades are unprotected and touch directly on your skin.  </li>
            <li> also am one to be known to have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I love this manscaping tool, however the battery is beginning to die and only holds a charge for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It was worth that for the experiment and potential and maybe you want to take a similar gamble</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this shaver is well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> and he started shaving - let&#x27;s just say he looks like a newborn every time he shaves, not to mention his constant need to nick himself more than a few times while shaving.</li>
            <li> this one is heavy, and the silver seems nicer, but the weight means it&#x27;s more likely to slip out of your hands in the shower.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A tad more expensive than I would have liked; I&#x27;ll forgive that if it continues to perform for a few years</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m portuguese but my hair isn&#x27;t that thick.  </li>
            <li> After one use, I would say, it was good product, but still chest area for men difficult to remove hair.</li>
            <li> If you go slow and are careful you will get good</li>
            <li> While that&#x27;s not a huge problem when trimming facial hair or the hair on your head, it&#x27;s a dicey situation when trimming in the more \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have been using the original Norelco Bodygroom BG2030 for just about a year and the head finally became so loose that it was no longer usable.</li>
            <li> Third, it goes through the hair quickly and smoothly even if it&#x27;s a little long.      </li>
            <li> that in FOUR different attempts it can&#x27;t even shave two little hairs that a normal razor could easily pick off?</li>
            <li> Also, make sure to keep your skin tight and the foil flat against your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall i am very comfortable using this, and i don&#x27;t have to constantly be carefull not to cut myself as i did with other triming devices.</li>
            <li> I does what it says on the box, much beter than a previous non philips model i had, and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> well, I did since its easier to clean the mess.</li>
            <li> This being my first electric (dry) shaver I can only compare it to the disposable razors that I&#x27;ve been using since I turned legal age.  </li>
            <li> When it was working, a full charge would last a long time!  </li>
            <li> But he says that you should be sure to &amp;#34;stretch out&amp;#34; the boys when going near them with the groomer or else it grabs them in a mean way.</li>
            <li> Would give 5 stars, but the battery doesn&#x27;t seem to stay strong long enough, but then maybe it isn&#x27;t made for daily use as I use it.</li>
            <li> So, naturally, the first thing I did with this razor was try to shave dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time between charges, gives ample warning if low charge, and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> Also my bathroom has no, and I mean no, counter top space</li>
            <li> It is \\&quot;shaft, sack, and starfish\\&quot; safe, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I love it takes less than 5 mins in the shower (using a shower mirror of course) and gets right down next to the scalp without any irritaions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> read the other reviews, and it is even better than i expected.</li>
            <li> Within a year, after a full day&#x27;s charge the battery lasts for less than 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li> And then last week the Comb Guide on the new unit broke and Philips wouldn&#x27;t send me a new guide.</li>
            <li> A little more than I usually drop for a body groomer, but it is definately worth the money.  </li>
            <li> What they do is trim very effectively, without almost any possibility of cutting yourself.     </li>
            <li> After only 1 use, I went back to using my normal hair clippers as the irritation coupled with the 2x time trimming wasn&#x27;t worth it to get such a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It would last long enough most times but had to be constantly charged.  </li>
            <li> Using even more precaution with pre shave oil and the shave gel it cut one part of my shaft raw and the next day had a bunch of bumps..</li>
            <li> I typically use a razor to shave, but I&#x27;ve found I can actually razor shave every other day by banging out a quick shave with the foil end, if I don&#x27;t have an important meeting at work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not gentle by any means and certainly doesn&#x27;t glide over your skin like a normal trimmer.  </li>
            <li> You can take it in the shower no mess, no cord.  </li>
            <li> NO MESS</li>
            <li> Was cautious at first because of how other products left flesh wounds, but after a couple weeks if use, I am confident in the performance of this product and take little time to trim and shave.  </li>
            <li> The groomer portion (as opposed to the trimmer) is very similar to the prior version and if anything actually seems to be slightly less effective.</li>
            <li> The waterproof thing is a gimmick, it doesn&#x27;t cut wet hair very well, so using it in the shower is highly ineffective.  </li>
            <li> a manscraper sounds harsh but it really does the job so very gently.</li>
            <li> i dont trust myself waving a double sided high speed reciprocating blade anywhere near my bunghole.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the trimmer end first, to knock down the high stuff.</li>
            <li> The orange light is supposed to mean that there are 10 minutes left, but ever since I first started using the tool, the trimmer has not run longer than 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well those reviews were right, after just a few times using the buzzer it only holds a charge for about 20 mins and becomes noticeably weaker within the first 5 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> For such a high price , one would think that Philips /Norelco Company will at least like many other brands ad a small plastic oil lubricator per their own recommendation to lubricate the trimmer before 1st use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You can more or less blindly shove these anywhere and come out ok.</li>
            <li> I love this product it takes care of all my grooming needs in one simple to use device, and  works wet or dry</li>
            <li> OK, let&#x27;s be serious.</li>
            <li> With my old ones I used to get small cuts and they were not so precise.</li>
            <li> I had an older version that finally petered out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m female and it took FOREVER to find a decent groomer.</li>
            <li> After that, short hairs will be guided through the foil holes, and the covered main trimmer will shave your body without any problem.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up and ordered another, choosing the more expensive version in hopes it would last better, but it turned out just to offer an extra type of clipper which is of no use to me.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I am not sure I could go back to shaving my body without it.</li>
            <li> Amazon, this is about the third time you have sold me something that is exactly the opposite of what I asked for in the search</li>
            <li> It works decent enough for your under carriage, but I just prefer to use a safety razor in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I tried shaving for the first time earlier this year with a standard razor like what ladies use, and I tore myself up.  </li>
            <li> However I have only used this maybe a five six dozen times in the many years I&#x27;ve owned it and barring the first few times used, it could never last long.  </li>
            <li> The charge seems to last a decent amount of time as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to use mainly like a regular electric razor.</li>
            <li> It cuts his body grooming in half with a close quick shave.</li>
            <li> The foil is decent enough that it gets the job done</li>
            <li> I upgraded from the older blue model to this one.</li>
            <li> was ok, but the other side had sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> For those wishing to shave these particular areas, you&#x27;re going to want to stick with the razor blade or standard electric razor head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe and has guards to protect against nicks -- although, even without the guards, I&#x27;ve found the teeth to be small enough to avoid nicks.</li>
            <li> The machine doesnt almost shawe your body it only cuts a litlle bit of hair ( with the wide part ), its not a bad product but -  for Philips and 2014 technology</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product which makes removing body hair task easy but this body groomer is not very good in that.</li>
            <li> I can shave smooth or use the trimmer to shave down to short stubble.</li>
            <li> But for the last THREE times I&#x27;ve done this, the shaver/trimming head falls off and PLOOP right into the toilet!  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to ensure the battery would last as long as possible, but whenever I took the razor off of the charger, sure enough the red light would flash to indicate the battery was almost dead.  </li>
            <li> This sounded cool, but it hurt a little when I did my chest.  </li>
            <li> As long as you do things their due justice, this shaver should do the job just fine.</li>
            <li> Then switch to the other side for the final clean up.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend purchasing updated version and recycling earlier Norelco Bodygroom device.</li>
            <li> For now though, highly recommended for manscaping and daily use!</li>
            <li> so I figured a regular razor was out so, after seeing the high reviews on the norelco bodygroom</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for shaving in those private areas.</li>
            <li> will give one tip though, on the more sensitive areas I would say be careful and go slow if you are using the shaver side, if you go too fast</li>
            <li> Sent me the new one and a return label to send the old one back.  </li>
            <li> specially since its not a cheap product.</li>
            <li> I wish the clipper head was a little bigger like the shaver side, it takes a while to do larger surfaces, like my BALLS :)    </li>
            <li> Makes manscaping much easier, and whole lot less risky.  </li>
            <li> It works wet or dry, but seems to work better dry as a first step if you wait to long between shearings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty hairy, and I&#x27;ve struggled with certain areas for most of my life, and this device makes it a little easier to trim up in those tough areas.</li>
            <li> The fine (close shaver) is a little to big for my girlfriend to use.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if there was a little longer length setting, otherwise the battery still holds a charge and it cuts cleanly (I&#x27;ve never had it pull once).</li>
            <li> It took probably 15 minutes the first time, but, long story short, I ended up with a completely shaved netherworld, and it was done without drawing blood or nicking myself.  </li>
            <li> Takes a long time to take hair off of whole body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few days and no red rash, no bumps just smooth soft skin.  </li>
            <li> The body bare was alright for stubble but would not touch the longer hair and the included clippers with the package I had purchased with it, irritated skin and don&#x27;t even think trying to use any of them in sensitive areas unless you want to have a sex change</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into the head changing (and they usually are really cheaply made).</li>
            <li> the only con so far after two uses is that the foil blade seems to not cut very well, especially in the shower.</li>
            <li> Against bare sensitive skin it can cut you.</li>
            <li> Long battery life, waterproof for shower use, and hasn&#x27;t done much damage yet.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time and trims really close.</li>
            <li> It works very well, battery lasts an amazingly long time (I also used this to cut his hair after it started growing out).</li>
            <li> It works really well, and stays charged for a long time.  </li>
            <li> No more Knicks and cuts just smooth.</li>
            <li> Works very well and holds charge for a long time</li>
            <li> I no longer work as a performer, but my hair continues to grow back faster and thicker, so I finally resorted to hair clippers once every couple of months and decided that getting a close shave on my body was more trouble than it was worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no back hair, my chest hair wasn&#x27;t over grown, my arms were normal compared to a lot of my friends, my legs were probably hairier than some.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m overreacting since this is my first time shaving my body, but I expected babysmooth skin.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> So, if you try using any setting longer than 1 (the shortest), and you apply normal pressure to your skin, the comb will get pushed back to the shortest setting.  </li>
            <li> Now for the graphic parts, after putting shaving cream where you are going to be working, take the Bodygroomer and just use it like you would a normal razer.</li>
            <li> Superb cut, slick design, battery long enough for cutting full head</li>
            <li> At first, I spent half-hour just to take the blade apart, and I cleaned the sideburns trimmings, which I thought to be the issue.  </li>
            <li> First off, I recieved this product faster than expected and have opned it for a couple months now.  </li>
            <li> It is not as soft and smooth as other more expensive brands</li>
            <li> However, even with a full charge, this trimmer is still not lasting long enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> To put it simple, If I were traveling and had to bring either this or a normal razor, I wouldn&#x27;t depend on this one alone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different products that claim to work better than they actually do.  </li>
            <li> last but not least</li>
            <li> After having used this full body groomer, won&#x27;t be going back to any other brands.  </li>
            <li> Irritation is pretty minimal...</li>
            <li> If your worried that this Norelco won&#x27;t give you a close shave and get all the hair, put all that aside, because this Norelco really does work great at removing the hair in all areas, whether you have thick or thin hair.</li>
            <li> Go slow, keep your skin tight, and you&#x27;ll be good.</li>
            <li> I used it wet and dry to test, and so far dry is better for me.  </li>
            <li> i figure that if I&#x27;m gay, and even I am unable to use a grooming product successfully, then there&#x27;s no hope for all the straight guys out there, and the product&#x27;s gotta be flawed.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s a very advanced anatomy joke, most of you idiots won&#x27;t get it).</li>
            <li> The other shavers I&#x27;ve tried have not worked as well as shaving, but the Norelco Bodygroom Pro is now my favorite tool for trimming or shaving down there.</li>
            <li> I also found that a little shampoo or body wash facilitated the shaving tremendously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I have bought ever ,it has tow ways of use one for the small hair and other one for long, you can use it for body shaving or face shaving , very long battery life ,light and thin .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I only have to be clean shaven on average twice a month).  </li>
            <li> and I can only use it for a few minutes on my decidedly fine body hair.</li>
            <li> If you want to trim certain sensitive areas, it works, just be careful.</li>
            <li> at first I was skeptical and I was very scared to use this product in a quick manner, but now I use the trimmer to shave my genitals every 5 days with no worries or cuts or bleeding or bumps.</li>
            <li> The one plus for this shaver is that it has a strong battery which lasts longer and trims hard till it</li>
            <li> I like having as few trimmers as possible and this has pretty much replaced my old beard and hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing trimmer wet or dry, for the body...neck down.  </li>
            <li> or whenever they become dull (you&#x27;ll notice you have to push harder and sweep over areas more frequently with dull blades, and will tend to get more nicks).    </li>
            <li> I use the trimmer end if its longer hair, then i go back over it with the other end to get it super close.</li>
            <li> But few weeks ago the razor just completely refused to charge itself, even when placed correctly with the electrodes touching each other.  </li>
            <li> When I turned the new one on, I was actually startled.  </li>
            <li> I got in my new Philips about 5 weeks after my last trimming session.  </li>
            <li> With all new confidence I could only  suggest every man to Buy it.  </li>
            <li> I got brand new replacement and after another 2 years the same thing happened and it won&#x27;t charge anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway second time around they didn&#x27;t give me another replacement of course but they did offer me 15% off a new one.</li>
            <li> A defective brand new BG-2040 underscores my suspicion that the entire line of Philips/Norelco bodygroom shavers are lemons.  </li>
            <li> when i got this nothing on it worked, so i sent it back and got a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick with regular clippers and the new gillette mach razor.  </li>
            <li> And replacing a $5 dollar battery will require you to open the unit and SOLDER on the new battery.</li>
            <li> It has yet to wear out, it keeps the same charge it did as it was new, and I&#x27;ve performed *</li>
            <li> They intentionally crested defects likely for the purpose of getting you to buy a new one.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to do when dry.</li>
            <li> As well as Dry, much closer shave.  </li>
            <li> I tried it both dry and with some shave gel and much prefer shaving with the gel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies, be sure to keep your thin, sensitive flower petal parts out of the way, pay attention, and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, the battery last a really long time between charges.  </li>
            <li> I have been trimming my beard hair, head hair, and using the razor to trim my neck for a few months now and the product has worked better than expected.  </li>
            <li> say they did (thanks for that), but it did not work and definitely showed the potential to cause harm.  </li>
            <li> battery didn&#x27;t last long in my case after I followed instructions and had it first charged for 10 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it to shave mainly the pubic area and since I use this machine, the area looks clear without the red spots left by the blade shavers.</li>
            <li> This shaver is really designed for trimmiing up the chest , legs, and back on hairy individuals (trimming being the key word here).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It performed FANTASTIC for those few short weeks though!  </li>
            <li> I have persuaded my hubby to trim a bit more.....and this jewel makes it simple and fast enough that he does not complain about using it.  </li>
            <li> The blades are a micro-factor when it comes to distance between them, only separating enough to really get hair fibers in between them to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The directions for the first charge were followed and he never left it sitting on the charger too long.</li>
            <li> My husband will most likely be returning this item if it is not too late to do so.</li>
            <li> is just a regular ol foil over norelco with blade that pinch and pull long hairs first this no differebt than trimming with clippers then going over your body with an electric foil over</li>
            <li> No fear of nicks in delicate areas and so much better than a razor for the private parts..</li>
            <li> With my old Norelco, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with a few days worth of growth.  </li>
            <li> I bought a male one, even though I am a woman and it is gentle enough and with all the power I wanted.</li>
            <li> if I know I&#x27;m going to be having sex with in the next day or so because nobody wants to take your pants off and your crotch has a punch of red pimples.</li>
            <li> It is good for small touch-ups, like for those small outcroppings of hair on my ear lobes.</li>
            <li> The key with the foil end is to go slow and steady, keeping the skin as smooth as you can.  </li>
            <li> I just put it on the charger and quick charge it for a few minutes</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, but you need to shave same place some times to get a better finish, some times really annoying thing.</li>
            <li> It is long enough to be able to reach over your back and get all areas, which other groomers could not accomplish.</li>
            <li> I was using one of those Wahl haircut clipper sets for my \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; for years and would get the occasional cut here and there and sometimes in very sensitive areas</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to be able to make yourself spic-and-span from the neck down if you&#x27;re quite hairy from the neck down.</li>
            <li> But, I can confirm that battery life is a major issue.  </li>
            <li> Also, the other tends to aggressively pull hairs which can be discomforting at first.  </li>
            <li> I can usually go 3-5 complete trims before the red light will start flashing.  </li>
            <li> major concern of mine was getting cut by this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a major improvement over my use of the pop-up groomer on my face shaver as a body groomer.  </li>
            <li> You often have to go over the same area multiple times as the first pass is not enough.  </li>
            <li> This thing gives me rashes like no other.</li>
            <li> i just forget this &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; side and used the trimming side, which is also a joke.. its small and do the same job as any hair cut machine (but the haircut machine does a better job, because its bigger, so do it faster and saves ur time)  </li>
            <li> Summary: first 2 years heaven; 3rd year, starting running short</li>
            <li> no other product I have tried had work as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> Using since 2011, still working without any major issues</li>
            <li> Only Two Years Old now kaput.!</li>
            <li> And also the blades are not sharp I guess.</li>
            <li> Keeps me nicely trimmed so this Florida humidity doesn&#x27;t get me looking like a couple of round, red fire engines down below... if you get my meaning.</li>
            <li> The previous models slid right into their charging docks and stayed there, no problem.</li>
            <li> The Body Groom Pro is a solid trimmer, the weight and solid feel are just right for long trimming and grooming sessions.</li>
            <li> I notice I feel much fresher and cleaner and can dry off from a shower quicker too!</li>
            <li> The unit comes with a charging stand and small cleaning brush to help clean out any excess hair that gets stuck within it.  </li>
            <li> I received it, there was enough of a charge to give it a test drive, although the low battery indicator light was flashing about half way through.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One complaint would be that it&#x27;s easy to turn it off while using simply because the on/off switch is where you would naturally grip it.  </li>
            <li> That includes shave cream and blades, 2 other brands of electric-Mangroomer and Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Having sensitive skin this product is much smoother causing almost no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I liked the previous model, but it broke on me after only a few months where the head attaches.</li>
            <li> to use and clean, 5 different lenghts so you can start with the longest and work down to desired hair length!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and cuts hair quickly but not the one I am looking for as It needs concentration when shaving private areas and may cause cuts and irritations if you do not stretch your skin, I am still looking for a gentle machine for such sensitive parts, starching sometime is impossible in some areas.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re smart and careful you&#x27;ll never get nicked.</li>
            <li> You still gotta be smart and be careful and take your time.</li>
            <li> You still have to be careful in certain areas.</li>
            <li> It made quick work of my Sasquatch back hair, and was long enough that I could reach all areas of my back without assistance from the wife.</li>
            <li> However, with my thick hair it comes back pretty quick and isn&#x27;t the smoothest the next day.</li>
            <li> With patience and a little skill, this product is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> wish I would have saved the trouble and frustration and gotten it in the first place!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the stand as it seems a little rocky but it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems.</li>
            <li> I used it almost daily and leave it in the shower and abuse it, so 7 years seems like a decent amount of time for it to last.  </li>
            <li> and I can get to tough to reach areas better.</li>
            <li> Felt very subtle pinch kinda feeling at first with the shaver but got used to it - not painful.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to pressure it against my skin and more importantly, no bites!!!  </li>
            <li> I used to have one of those with the vacuum function and at least that was good for preventing a mess on the sink.  </li>
            <li> Now, I would HIGHLY recommend using some sort of lather such as a shaving cream for doing the actual grooming.</li>
            <li> If you get it at a decent price, it&#x27;s decent, especially since it charges so quickly, and the LED takes away the guessing game...</li>
            <li> It seems to me, though, that the trimmer head is a little too wide to be able to line up properly with areas in the groin.</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s been 2 days since my last shower, and I still actually feel kinda clean down there.</li>
            <li> but this is versatile, water resistant and sharp without any nicks on the nooks and the battery holds a super long charge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that now it will basically last long enough to take care of the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas, and a little more -- say chest and/or stomach.</li>
            <li> The other side being more contained and smaller, has less friction thus lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Im a Believer&#x27;, and other positive reviews I decided to place my hopes on this body grommer for men.</li>
            <li> It works just like the other positive reviews state.</li>
            <li> I mean, if you take off the top few layers of skin, the hair will certainly go with it,</li>
            <li> the trimmer is great but the shaver is bad and the body groomer doesnt function correctly</li>
            <li> so I assume it does not operate on the general AA or AAA    </li>
            <li> For someone with thinner hair (think blondies generally), this should be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been a hassle to groom in general.</li>
            <li> Works well when using it to even out sideburns, and touch up hair in general.</li>
            <li> Such a huge difference and my last trimmer was not cheap.</li>
            <li> (you can bend it back if you do accidentally bend it, as long as you&#x27;re gentle).</li>
            <li> This item is really convenient as it can cut long or short hair and it has a lot of power as well.</li>
            <li> To be clear, I have only used this product four times at this time of this writing.  </li>
            <li> After nearly three years of use the batteries finally gave out and I decided to try replacing them.</li>
            <li> This was a conscious choice on their behalf as it was a standard battery holder, just with custom contacts.</li>
            <li> The Remington reduced your beard to a bare stubble.</li>
            <li> The Remington reduced your beard to a bare stubble.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s been a complete letdown.  </li>
            <li> next put in a sensitive shave gel.</li>
            <li> Second, you can truly use the shaver head on sensitive area&#x27;s without worrying about getting nicked.  </li>
            <li> Recently its completely stopped holding a charge.  </li>
            <li> this will let you get an almost bare skin look if you spend the time on it</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no regrets.</li>
            <li> I left the unit on to complete discharge.  </li>
            <li> I followed all the instruction as far as battery care went and leaving it unplugged and all that, but it still just doesn&#x27;t hold a charge properly anymore.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very versatile groomer; you just have to be careful:</li>
            <li> The hair grows back soft and does not cause loads of irritation like a razor would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never go back to doing it the old way.  </li>
            <li> Definitely something i would recommend getting if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So well, in fact, that I actually trimmed the hair far shorter than I meant to.</li>
            <li> I like to keep myself trim, and for years I&#x27;ve been using my old Remington beard trimmer to also trim my legs so that they don&#x27;t look like a human forest.  </li>
            <li> Charge lasts much longer then I expected.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> The GIANT gash in an incredibly sensitive area on my body, courtesy of using the shaving end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use the trimmer I suppose, but I&#x27;m going back to other methods (a regular razor is better) for other grooming.</li>
            <li> Been using the bodygroomer for over a year and so far it&#x27;s made my hair related tasks</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin...and no red bumps from the use of this shaver.</li>
            <li> This thing has done everything that I wanted it too, especially on the sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I barely use it anymore.</li>
            <li> The green charging light doesn&#x27;t come on, and when I turn the shaver on, it only lasts for a second.</li>
            <li> The green charging light doesn&#x27;t come on, and when I turn the shaver on, it only lasts for a second.</li>
            <li> They both perform very well although the shaver should be used carefully, or it may hurt.</li>
            <li> and I mainly use it dry.</li>
            <li> but you do have to go over the area multiple times in some cases to completely shave the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When shaving the &amp;#34;boys&amp;#34;, this thing will bite you if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t hold its charge so I can barely get 5-10 mins out of it before it shuts off.</li>
            <li> You really have to let your hair grow for like 3 days for it to be that noticeably rough downthere...</li>
            <li> The shaver has not ONCE nicked his sensitive skin and the trimmer gives him the option of keeping his beard at different lengths.</li>
            <li> still old school when it comes to removing facial hair</li>
            <li> comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;It still pinches your ball-sack if you are not careful but that is a risk</li>
            <li> So I  placed it back in the Handle Charger properly to try to recharge itself, NO blinking green light.</li>
            <li> BUT apparently Philips doesn&#x27;t make replacement blades?????</li>
            <li> Experience far above expectations.</li>
            <li> It can cut through softer skin if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only charged this once when I took it out of the box</li>
            <li> Definitely not the shaver you wanna use on your sensitive parts of body like armpit, pubic etc.</li>
            <li> The only two cautions I have are that you must use the cradle for charging because the groomer itself cannot be connected directly to the charger.  </li>
            <li> batteries are NiMH and, according to Philips&#x27; FAQ, should be charged when nearly (not completely) empty for the longest life.</li>
            <li> My last one (a beard trimmer) stopped charging after a few years of occasional use, probably because it had cheap NiCad batteries in it.  </li>
            <li> assuming i wasnt careful enough the first time (even though in my heart i knew i was)</li>
            <li> This is my first time reviewing and i am only doing it because i expected a lot from this product.    </li>
            <li> Although its not made for use on the face I sometimes use it to trim facial hair short before using a normal razor.</li>
            <li> I bought a pretty pink bikini trimmer, buying into the promise that it was made with my female needs in mind.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to use on areas that are flatter (chest and abs) than rounder, just like a normal razor -- but still works very nicely on uneven areas.  </li>
            <li> It works OK, but is unnecessary IMO.</li>
            <li> Thus, they take up more space and can be irritating to keep organized.</li>
            <li> The clippers on the shaver side adjust but are more aggressive which can cause burns - something I never experienced with the 2020.</li>
            <li> works OK, but not great.</li>
            <li> As I said, it is able to get the job done, but at the expense of irritating you from time to time.</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong, the shaver is nice, but I guess a was hoping for a miracle shaver...</li>
            <li> ladies don&#x27;t want you all hairy down there, more than you want THEM all hairy down there!</li>
            <li> My battery on a full charge lasts no more than 6 or 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not great for body parts with hair routes that change a lot (facial hair) or uneven surfaces (some head shapes) but great for the body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing the most expensive Bodygroom because you really need to understand something before you plunk down this much cash:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it pulls a little bit more than the previous model</li>
            <li> , also I let my nether region grow out for a long time to full length, because the girlfriend doesn&#x27;t like it bald down there</li>
            <li> ( first shut down )</li>
            <li> was the first question I asked myself after using it  down there.  </li>
            <li> If you have the amazon jungle down there use the trimmer first then finish it</li>
            <li> This groomer makes it easy to get clean down there, and makes the experience much less painful, not to mention the results are much better.</li>
            <li> By mate, I mean somebody that is consensually willing to be physically intimate with me.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but I decided to spend a little more than I am comfortable and it has paid off.</li>
            <li> Not a single nick or cut!</li>
            <li> have tried about every type of hair removal you can try from home.&lt;br /&gt;-Nair and other hair removal creams work, but can irritate your skin and give chemical burns in certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;-Shaving</li>
            <li> Instead of the typical Norelco lay-out of 2 or 3 round heads, it uses a slim cylindrical head more often seen in Braun or Panasonic products.</li>
            <li> , you will notice that initially you&#x27;ll experience a few split seconds of mild pain as all the hair gets pulled around.  </li>
            <li> Sure it misses a few hairs now and then but other groomers miss entire patches no matter how often you go over them.</li>
            <li> Finally after about 6 months the second one really started to work slow and barely take a charge before it broke completely and just got hot when put on the charger.  </li>
            <li> first, then shave -do not push down hard -clean</li>
            <li> The trimmers on top are small, don&#x27;t stick out far, and are not really designed to do an amazing job cutting all your hair off.</li>
            <li> The light blinks green when charging and is a steady green when fully charged.  </li>
            <li> I nicked the pumpkins 2-4 times in the first half year of usage.</li>
            <li> I previously had bought the 1st generation of the bodygroom when it first came out.</li>
            <li> A stark comparison from the original Bodygroom which held the charge well and for the long haul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My initial plan was to just clean up my usual trim job</li>
            <li> It just takes such a long time till you get a decent job done.</li>
            <li> so I have a decent amount of hair on myself and its pretty thick as well,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Those are my only real complaints and relative minor ones at that.  </li>
            <li> I have attempted to use on chest and stomach---results are not consistent across the areas trimmed, armpits--works very well,</li>
            <li> Shaving other areas like in between the legs, chest and armpits is absolutely painless.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-It seems to have a much stronger/faster set of motors than any other I&#x27;ve used&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it really did shave closer than any other trimmer/shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> i love it, it is a little bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Well all of that changed some how because the heads are not the same as from the very first one I bought because the replacement heads and the head that comes with it when you be a new device are mean they hurt</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for dry use and works as it should even below the belt (not big on personal &amp;#34;bird nest&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it still has at the very least another year of life left.</li>
            <li> The BodyGroom Pro left a slight amount of razor burn in the form of raised bumps that show up a little bit when I shower, but it&#x27;s much more manageable than before.  </li>
            <li> The low rating is due to a battery that will only hold about 3 minutes worth of charge after only a year of use.</li>
            <li> Love the new design and not having the removable heads which was where the last item failed.</li>
            <li> Removal battery, seems like a great idea, especially if it goes bad</li>
            <li> But, since the good reviews far outweighed the bad ones, I decided to go ahead.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sit in its stand very well and the whole device has a shoddy build quality to it, compared to my Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut myself multiple times with it no matter how gentle or careful I am.  </li>
            <li> After I got it, it actually sat in the package for nearly a week before I tried it on various areas.</li>
            <li> Now if the Norelco engineers can just figure out how I can trim the center of my back without help, they will really be onto something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Painless, fast, no redness, can wet and you can use in your entire body (except head).</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I can only just barely get between my shoulder blades with my reach and flexibility--but barely means it does.  </li>
            <li> I would not advise to use it near male private parts unless you want to bleed.</li>
            <li> and after all the different products: waxing, hair removel lotions, different types of electric shaver, razors, this groomer by far does the job.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of different clippers and trimmers and they all have batteries that can be left charging without completely dying.</li>
            <li> But, some people might expect electronics to last far longer, and assume this will be the last body shaver they purchase in their lifetime.</li>
            <li> The most vulnerable and risky part to shave is the part of the sack directly on and below the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Always shave against the direction the hairs</li>
            <li> Save yourself the suffering of it growing back, especially if you have sensitive skin; this thing will give you razorburn like you&#x27;ve never had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save yourself the suffering of it growing back, especially if you have sensitive skin; this thing will give you razorburn like you&#x27;ve never had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it has a few minor flaws that kept me from giving it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned before actually hair cutting performance is good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d expect a shaver that wasn&#x27;t capable of providing a close shave to be relatively safe for avoiding cutting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as complicated to own as others make it out to be if you actually READ the instructions and DON&#x27;T always leave it on the charger as the instructions tell you not to do because that will kill the battery!</li>
            <li> This thing worked ok (not great) when it actually charged but</li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent for shaving all areas, but not a true BODY groomer since it is nearly impossible to get your entire back without being a yoga expert!  </li>
            <li> so the razor will slide down past the appropriate position to be charged.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night down to the belly --</li>
            <li> It is excellent for anything below the neck;  you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> For under sixty bucks its a great deal compared to the rest with there weak construction too many attachments biting nicking pulling crap.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I was a little hesitant, but once I started, things went</li>
            <li> Why include that when the other side of shaver includes exact same thing as you can remove the plastic part and have a very short trimmer.</li>
            <li> price is a little on the higher side for a groomer</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my second one, the first lasting two years, rechargeable batteries don&#x27;t come with a lifetime warranty on any product  - be sure to replace the foil head and cutting blades every six months to avoid razor burn or hair pulling (ouch)</li>
            <li> Its not a good enough razor that it will replace your normal face razor, but it will work in a pinch and works very well for the normal use of shaving below the neck..</li>
            <li> I usually give it a full charge every few weeks, letting the battery run pretty low before charging.</li>
            <li> You can use the adjustable trim guard to leave a lot or a little or use the other end and be completely smooth.</li>
            <li> , I now trust this blade to be able to fully bring any hair on my body down to smooth skin while having a low risk of cutting</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaver angle - I may just have never gotten used to using the shaver portion properly, but it seems like I have trouble getting either of the trimmers at the right angle.</li>
            <li> If you want absolutely no stubble in any direction - baby&#x27;s butt smooth, it falls a little short.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be careful as the fine trimmer edges on the shaver side for longer hairs can and will catch loose sensitive skin which I have done a few times.</li>
            <li> Manscaping can be a delicate &amp; downright controversial subject.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heterosexual male, so I had no previous knowledge or experience using such a product, but everything worked out well.</li>
            <li> Seriously, just using the side trimmers by the blade (and not the actual shaver) does a SUPER job!</li>
            <li> Maybe mine was defective (considering all the rave reviews here), but this product hurt so bad I wasn&#x27;t able to use it for more than a few seconds at a time, while shaving my head.  </li>
            <li> I have actually cut my leg along the bikini line while jsut doing general maintenance.</li>
            <li> This allows for with or against-the-grain shaving that generally clears all of the hair in one pass, and without the need to use two different tools to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> though it did not catch or cut my skin, it did cause some minor irritation, but this can be fixed with moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> There is no excuse for hard-to-open plastic packaging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is actually a situation where the few extra dollars are totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was worth the ~$90.00</li>
            <li> first use a few minutes ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> used the shaving head a few times and cut myself with it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I got a few cuts.</li>
            <li> He said it worked well for the first few months.</li>
            <li> First one of these I owned lasted about 3 years which seemed satisfactory for heavy use.  </li>
            <li> A little on the high side as far as price, however once you use it</li>
            <li> It works well with the private parts as long as you are very careful down there, but who isn&#x27;t careful with their own private parts.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I was initially reluctant about using this groomer on certain areas of my body, especially since I had never used a foil shaver even on my face.  </li>
            <li> And if I could tape or glue the stupid head to it but be able to clean it well to keep it from falling off all the time, I WOULD.</li>
            <li> What is too long with this was not too long with older Norelco models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Straight down to the skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really does work under the shower without rusting, without slowing down or losing any effectiveness.</li>
            <li> It really gets things under control \\&quot;down</li>
            <li> Even before I cut myself, I felt very uneasy having this groomer down there, and you might feel that way, too.</li>
            <li> No matter how long or short it charges for, the trimming side always has very little battery power and the yellow light</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long enough - at least 25 minutes of shaving - and charges very quickly.</li>
            <li> Got all the body hair off although left a little stubble on chest first time.</li>
            <li> There are other decent trimmers out there by companies like Wahl.</li>
            <li> It would last a few weeks (5-6 full trims) on a single charge.</li>
            <li> It is a little scary to use until you get used to it, but the adjustable shaver is great - no losing attachments, and like I said, the other end on your sensitive bits just takes some time to learn.  </li>
            <li> The other end has a guard but it set to high for trimming hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased another one in Amazon and is great but when using it suddenly stops, and I press the button again and runs for 3 seconds and stops again &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> once again great shaver, just for me... didn&#x27;t last :(.</li>
            <li> This review is not to say this might not work for those with much thinner, or much less body hair.</li>
            <li> This review is not to say this might not work for those with much thinner, or much less body hair.</li>
            <li> I had the Philips Norelco BG2030 Professional Body Grooming System in the past and you could go to town with it using it on and around the whole butcher shop without fear</li>
            <li> I never expected it to get as close as a regular razor, but I had hoped that it would get close enough for me which it didnt.</li>
            <li> If you are not careful, while shaving private area, you will touch skin with the edge trimmer and encounter massive pain.</li>
            <li> Used a few times over the past week and a half to try and get used to it, and I must say the engineers at Philips really made a safe piece here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a manual razor with some success, but it takes so long and was harsh to my skin in some areas.</li>
            <li> What I like to do is trim all my body, quickly, a couple times while standing in the shower, then turn on the water, take a shower, and slowly use the foil to shave.</li>
            <li> With this one, I have to go super slow</li>
            <li> At first I was a little reluctant to like this shaver but after using it for a few weeks I really have come to like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first trim the hair down if too long, then use the shaver to do the rest.</li>
            <li> For so long I&#x27;ve been struggling to trim and shave my boys (down there ;))</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get taken, there are plenty of other products on amazon that do this job and actually last a decent period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is, check the foil in case it has any dents, this could almost inevitably cause harm, and make sure NOT to push down hard while shaving.</li>
            <li> The build quality of the unit is nice, but apparently you&#x27;re not supposed to leave it on the charger 24/7, which makes it inconvenient for occasional use</li>
            <li> I replaced a $30 earlier model (first version) that I purchased a few years back.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed it died, as this was absolutely perfect when it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, you can feel slight stubble if you rub the shaved area with your hand in the opposite direction of which the hair grows, but it&#x27;s nothing you can see or really notice.</li>
            <li> I really like that you can use this wet or dry, too.</li>
            <li> I had about half inch long hair on my chest that I had to first trim before the the thing would shave it.  </li>
            <li> The swivel head works very well for any shaving in tight spaces.</li>
            <li> It does scratch the skin (although this is minimal, and might only feel it in very sensitive skin areas)&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, my positive experience with the old Body Groom was why I chose to ignore the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> The only thing keeping this from getting a 5 from me is that fact that it&#x27;s large size makes it a little cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> not a good clean shave on any part of the body.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re afraid that your soft skin (Im an easy bleeder) will not tolerate an electric snipper, you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> They all use the same foil unit and the fixed head might actually be easier to use, particularly dry.</li>
            <li> The self-contained comb works well and is a vast improvement over separate combs for each length on prior versions of this device that could easily be lost or broken when snapping them on and off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still not comfortable doing that without thought and attention paid while focused on certain areas.  </li>
            <li> One thing a little unusual is that the instructions state that the shaver should NOT be charged after each use.  </li>
            <li> By the time you&#x27;ve done that, hopefully your landing gear will be up due to the cold air on them, the skin is tight, and you can have an easy and safe shave.</li>
            <li> I put off my trimming for a couple of weeks in search of a new groomer, due to</li>
            <li> As a cyclist I mainly purchased this to shave my legs for which it does an above average job.</li>
            <li> I got this product mainly for manscaping down there.</li>
            <li> YES, this product was purchased mainly for the bush down south....</li>
            <li> Somehow, no matter whether I prep the area to be shaved by leaving it as, pulling it tight, or anywhere in between, the foil manages to create the sensation that the skin is being pinched in that area hundreds of times per second, and ultimately the friction and pinching result in cuts to my skin, blood, pain, buyer&#x27;s remorse, resistance of the urge to break the product in half and burn it in occult celebration, and longing for the original Body Groom that I threw away when I bought this one (although not necessarily in that order).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use a non-electric razor and cream, and after being nicked one too many times, and having my skin feel raw after using it, I went back to the low-tech version.</li>
            <li> It works great and is waterproof so don&#x27;t be afraid to get a little</li>
            <li> Overall a little pricey for what I really needed or use it for</li>
            <li> This product had a very high rating and based on a few reviews, I purchased it.</li>
            <li> But with the new one, It feels very rough after grooming and feels like</li>
            <li> It can be a little difficult to shave some parts, but overall it does a good job of what it advertises.</li>
            <li> (though I&#x27;m amazed the tech hasn&#x27;t advanced much since we shaved with sharpened knives) and is well-shaped; however, the charger is un-necessarily large, fiddly and non-secure, and the battery life is awful by modern standards.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad trimmer once the blade wears down a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend this product to all men that want to groom themselves down there, on chest no problems on with nicking the nips or just your face</li>
            <li> I have high expectations, and I believe I won&#x27;t be let down.  </li>
            <li> there is also a larger ridge than the multigroom, which makes it hard to get into the intimate crevices, and leads to some unexpected bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I thought the handle to be cumbersome but after using the product it actually is an advantage having the large handle because it helps to reach those odd and hard to reach areas of your body.</li>
            <li> Terribly stupid design flaw in an otherwise great</li>
            <li> Nothing good or bad about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good and bad thing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as closely as I would like, and the teeth-like part edges of the razor is almost painful in more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> The adjustable side is much better but with no guard on it has trouble powering through my rather thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> The long handle makes it easy to reach tough areas.  </li>
            <li> Men be very careful putting this thing anywhere near your boys as it can tear them up!</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it loses a charge pretty quick.  </li>
            <li> Cut my shaving time in half and almost the same results as a normal razor.</li>
            <li> The cutting head on this newer model seems to be very sturdy and hold it very tight unlike the older model, it popped out too easily sometimes during shaving.  </li>
            <li> I think this is just poor design because when you want a silky smooth look, the trimmer end does a decent job of trimming down long hairs to about 1/10 of an inch</li>
            <li> I bought this along with Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Nose/Facial Hair Trimmer, and I have everything I need for trimming and shaving.  </li>
            <li> As much as I enjoyed having everything neat and clean, it rarely stayed that way for 2 days before the awful razor burn, ingrown hairs, and just plain discomfort set in.</li>
            <li> If you want to trim body hair and groin hair, then this is a decent product, but know that it can get a little tricky when it comes to trimming groin hair.</li>
            <li> Also, the main reason for this update is that I have noticed while it is charging, the razor will actually TURN ITSELF ON for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is on both sides, right next to the main screen.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works fine dry, but for shaver you probably want shaving cream or at least wet conditions.  </li>
            <li> I have used other trimmers and got cut on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Dosen&#x27;t hold a charge for too long, you can&#x27;t leave it alone for 2 weeks and expect it to be ready for you to shave a second time, leading me to have to leave it plugged in, which wastes energy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know firsthand that it gets pretty uncomfortable with too much of it when it&#x27;s not only on your head or face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hairy guy back there, but it found some strays!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, &#x27;A friend of mine&#x27; told me not to use the flat end on your &#x27;berries&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I dont consider myself a high maintenance guy, and i give PLENTY of chances for this shaver, but this thing is the ABSOLUTE WORSE if you need are in this situation:&lt;br</li>
            <li> to long to get a clean shave an my balls or chest, and got cut or scratched multiple times in the process.&lt;br /&gt;Switched to a regular safety razor and received much cleaner results, without cutting myself in the process.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It was almost as if it were an overheating problem, and it would start to blink shortly after starting up, and then shut down completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to trust this shaver at first, especially when in my case when it had already \\&quot;bitten\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Just be sure that you&#x27;re very cautious if you use this because it does have the capability of cutting your skin even with the guard down.</li>
            <li> my DAM hot water went to cold water real fast</li>
            <li> It shaves easily without pulling or cutting especially around sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> It obviously won&#x27;t work as well as a manual shaver which I was hoping by some miracle it would, but it gets the job done fast with no more scars.</li>
            <li> The shaver looks kinda cheap and the comb trimmer does not cut small hair, instead it leaves the hairs uneven.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, you pretty much have to try to get this thing to bite you (</li>
            <li> I laugh at that fact alone on how ridiculous of a rip off it is.</li>
            <li> so it really just left me with an ungroomed lazy look.</li>
            <li> lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery seems to last long enough for me</li>
            <li> The only problem is that once it is fully charged it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I thought it would</li>
            <li> It also CUT ME this last time just before it fell into the toilet again.    </li>
            <li> My only issue is it tends to take a long time to actually shave.</li>
            <li> Now that i have some time u can truly say it, the upper head doesn&#x27;t last a long time.</li>
            <li> it sliced my skin, and now I&#x27;m on the toilet as I type this trying to stop the bleeding on the family jewls)&#x27;:, plz if u care for ur groin at all do not get this, use a regular razor and save urself the pain!!!</li>
            <li> The second one only lasted 3 months and today decided not to turn on no matter what I did or how long I charged it.  </li>
            <li> only so long so that ppl have to go out and buy another within a short time frame.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order the &amp;#34;body groom&amp;#34; because it was not real clear on the result re: &amp;#34;when using on &amp; around private parts&amp;#34; but it swayed toward satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> Well, the unit never gets a steady green anymore</li>
            <li> The only downside is that if you are pretty hairy and slow going you may run out of juice before you are done.</li>
            <li> trimmer portion is worth the $10 upgrade if you like to quickly trim your chest hair without completely shaving yourself to the point of having that annoying prickly chest for 3 days.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, so with a standard razor,  I&#x27;d get all kinds of irritation, razor burn, bumps, and ingrown hairs down there.</li>
            <li> It has been about 4 days since I shaved and it seems like I will need to redo everything a little sooner than normal too looking at hair growth.</li>
            <li> After \\&quot;grooming\\&quot; areas that most men are probably down right afraid to try let alone allow anything sharp to come within a foot of, there were no nicks, not cuts, no razor burn.  </li>
            <li> As stated in all the other reviews this product is amazing, I didn&#x27;t buy this off Amazon, but I wanted to put my 2 cents in, because this where I got my review for this review, I was a bit skeptical because of some of the negative reviews but all the positive ones helped encourage me to buy it</li>
            <li> Accordingly, this otherwise excellent tool gets a grudging 3 stars from me, as I had to purchase an entirely different product merely to cater to my back hair.</li>
            <li> Lesson learned....be very very deliberate and go slow to avoid that mishap.  </li>
            <li> its will give u few sec work with same full speed and shut down      and after its fully end</li>
            <li> I tossed the razor a few months later and got a new one as a gift</li>
            <li> The charge seems to last a very long time and the shaving head is replaceable which is definitely a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You still have to be a little careful but not nearly as careful with a normal electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Time and patience is key when using foil head over sensitive areas, plan a little extra time and you will be amazed with your results.  </li>
            <li> That alone cuts the time needed to clear such expanses in half as well as eliminates the need for a separate manual razor.     </li>
            <li> Second, your skin will change and be less sensitive to the trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The foil shaver does an adequate job; the shaver does leave some stubble behind but it is only noticeable if someone is a foot away from you.</li>
            <li> using the foil end was a little scary at first, but I became very comfortable after a few strokes.  </li>
            <li> Again, very unfortunate because on paper, this is an amazing product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I started looking at my options, and initially I was terrified to make an attempt - horror stories of badly conducted traditional shaving methods and waxing are abundant online.  </li>
            <li> This was advertised to be a clean shave, but at least for me it leaves a bit of stubble whether I use it wet or dry, against or with the grain, with or without shave lotion.</li>
            <li> Also the shaver part doesn&#x27;t get quite as smooth a result as a regular electric shaver, and definitely not as good as a wet shave, but I guess the latter is to be expected.</li>
            <li> But the hair growth after completely shaving was not fun.  </li>
            <li> exception was it did the arm pits very well, not sure why it had a problem with my chest hair.</li>
            <li> usually leave it standing on the charger ready for whenever I need it.</li>
            <li> The battery life seems average so far.</li>
            <li> This one is pointless, really.</li>
            <li> I got this relatively fast, as usual with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I could still use the razor for a duration long enough to get the job done at that time.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had the problem with the battery charge not lasting long.</li>
            <li> After hesitating for a long time to purchase this groomer and reading all the reviews here, I finally made the purchase.</li>
            <li> The charge last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I thought well maybe it is because I didn&#x27;t charge it long enough etc.</li>
            <li> and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I also have sparse long back hairs</li>
            <li> From trimming back, chest armpits (not nearly as itchy as it was with the clippers) to shaving below the belt</li>
            <li> The charge lasts for about 4 hours of continual use, which is plenty long enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry if it&#x27;s long, the Foil shaver on the opposite end will cut it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The level 1 cut is just too long, and if I take the guard off it cuts my beard too short.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully this one will last as long.</li>
            <li> for the next trimmer I want one that last a long time and can handle all of my monkey fur</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaver arrived well packaged and the battery life seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably give it 4.5 stars if the battery worked long enough for a &amp;#34;grooming.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t even realize it had been so long since it still works well</li>
            <li> I would charge it for however long it would take, and then shave as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li> The only thing I must warn about is that when trying to navigate seemlessly around your beanbag area, gentlemen, the side face-up on the picture will make minor cuts here and there.  </li>
            <li> but there are still minor improvements here and there to be made, such as the battery having to die before charging and drawing testicular inevident blood samples.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to charge it beyond the initial charge yet, but I have only used it a few times so far.</li>
            <li> The charge seems to last a long time and we have had no problems with it at all.</li>
            <li> they last a long time</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am now almost entirely hair free and the stubble left behind doesn&#x27;t feel like there is a jagged edge.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s such a pity that Amazon doesnt have an Australian online store (it&#x27;s only Kindle store).</li>
            <li> However, with this, there exists levels of hair that are too long for the shaver and too short for the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about 10 minutes of touch and goes, I finally grew the balls to go at it (excuse my pun).</li>
            <li> You can trim long hairs on your chest, legs, arms, back, and groin.</li>
            <li> I advise against that unless it&#x27;s in a flat spot with tougher/taught skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have yet to have a problem on my upper legs and my inner elbows which is where I usually break out if I use a normal electric shaver or a razor and shaving</li>
            <li> Saves me from throwing out a dozen razors (body/facial hair is pretty thick)</li>
            <li> I took it slow at first, convinced it would end in disaster.</li>
            <li> I could probably blame some of the inconsistency on the fact that I am one hairy dude; I&#x27;d say my hair is pretty thick too</li>
            <li> I could probably blame some of the inconsistency on the fact that I am one hairy dude; I&#x27;d say my hair is pretty thick too</li>
            <li> Not bad but not great either</li>
            <li> I only knicked myself once down in the tender part because I didn&#x27;t stretch the skin well enough before going over it, but it barely hurt</li>
            <li> I have owned several other Philips shavers in the past and I will say that they certainly have improved quite a bit!</li>
            <li> However, I decided to give this a try since Summer is here and the less hair I have, the less hot I get</li>
            <li> I take the guard completely off for my chest, stomach, and around down stairs.</li>
            <li> Rather, the battery should be allowed to run down almost completely before recharging.  </li>
            <li> only complaints are that it is a little hard to take apart to clean, and the folding charging stand sometimes collapses on itself.</li>
            <li> I was unable to shave a couple hairs right under my nose, because the edger thing sticks out just far enough that I couldn&#x27;t get up to it.  </li>
            <li> On the old model, I had three little blue pieces I had to clip on depending on my preference on hair length.  </li>
            <li> Saw this little beauty when I searched for \\&quot;ball shavers\\&quot; on Amazon (I was surprised that \\&quot;ball shavers\\&quot; actually returned results).</li>
            <li> I have been terrified to put an actual razor blade anywhere near my manly parts, so I had a little trepidation about this item, too, but I&#x27;ve gotta tell ya</li>
            <li> This grooming kit allows me to tame the wild, either grooming or completely removing the offending follicles with absolutely no irritation, yanking or nipping.  </li>
            <li> I was probably due for a new one soon anyway, but just a warning to watch it and be careful in slippery conditions.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricier than some of the other models out there, and in reality they all have the same features, so for the price you could do worse, but for a lot less you can do just as good.</li>
            <li> It is a high powered machine and can be scary to use at first.</li>
            <li> the actual close shave area is not wide enough or round enough.</li>
            <li> It would hold a charge just long enough for about a single use and then need to be placed back on the charger.</li>
            <li> So&#x27;s the misses if you know what I mean;).  </li>
            <li> I have a Norelco BG2020/31 which is essentially the same shaver head only it has clip on combs for trimming instead of the trimmer on the other end.  </li>
            <li> That one broke after a few months, so I bought a brand new unit.</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I only felt a couple nicks, but they were VERY minor and no blood was spilled.</li>
            <li> It has a very strange charging system where you actually charge up the stand that it sits in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After getting a new replacement unit from BB&amp;B, the replacement has lasted less than 12 months and 4 light trims, and the battery is now unable to hold a charge.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I was expecting to have to charge this unit every day and go through a painful period of completely draining the battery.  </li>
            <li> Some have claimed that the foil can catch on dry skin, causing the head to tilt and the side trimmers (which I will get to shortly) to cut the skin.  </li>
            <li> The head floats in every direction, and I haven&#x27;t had nearly the problems I&#x27;ve had with previous razors.  </li>
            <li> my old Wahl took about a hour and half to trim everything (dying every 5 min or so and recharge).  </li>
            <li> Foil head works just as well as the previous model and doesn&#x27;t cause cuts on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I tried lathering up with soap, I tried using shaving cream, and finally this morning I used it dry.  </li>
            <li> It takes too much time to do the job, for a close shave you have to go through the same area at least 4 times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it dry and believe that&#x27;s probably the easier way.</li>
            <li> could be held in different, less awkward angles and get the same effective trimmage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Works in dry and net conditions</li>
            <li> and I ended up doing my whole upper body and needles to say I was late getting to my appointment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used it to dry shave.</li>
            <li> However there are a few things to consider early which for me I believe are essential:  1)</li>
            <li> I have to go back and forth a few times and it does miss hair frequently.  </li>
            <li> I understand it&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s intended to be used wet, so such design will prevent accidental electrocution, but I prefer having the option to plug in, so it doesn&#x27;t die on me in the middle of things.  </li>
            <li> but I only use my Body Groom Pro outside the shower, so I can&#x27;t speak to the results it provides under wet conditions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, as expected, this can still cause some razor burn or draw some blood if you&#x27;re not too careful in the sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> It may nick your skin on lose areas, like your privates, but is a thousand times safer than using a regular razor or a normal hair trimmer, and the nicks are small and unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this a few times now, but so far, I&#x27;m impressed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had the older model before this one for a few years now and for some reasons after a full charge, very randomly the older model sometimes works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t....</li>
            <li> Takes a few passes or a freshly washed and dried area to get</li>
            <li> grows back very fast since what you´re really doing is just cutting it off.</li>
            <li> However, once I slowed down and allowed both cutting heads to do their jobs I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It would have been cheaper for me to bathe in Nair, but it is still cheaper than a single back waxing.</li>
            <li> The manual does say a single 8 hour charge will last 50 minutes of operation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The manual does say a single 8 hour charge will last 50 minutes of operation.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Works for 10 minutes with single charge, enough for grooming needs</li>
            <li> A single charge on the battery seems to last indefinitely.</li>
            <li> What i learned was that for every negative review you read for this product you can find a positive one as well and visa-versa.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews both positive and negative.</li>
            <li> The only con I can think of is the long charging time but once its charged it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Just be careful how many times you go over the same area because it could be a little irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give a full review, obviously, because I&#x27;m not the one using it, but he&#x27;s used it several times and seems satisfied...and he&#x27;s difficult to please with these types of products.</li>
            <li> Strong cutting power, barely any nicking at all.  </li>
            <li> variation of trimming lengths and very smooth cutting blades.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> The other side is ok but sort of useless.</li>
            <li> After trying 3 different electric shavers and 2 other body grooming gadgets, I finally bought the BodyGroom Pro.  </li>
            <li> too small to be a decent body trimmer.</li>
            <li> Battery life is decent, I usually go a couple days between charges.</li>
            <li> So I needed a new razor for shaving and since I was tired of buying new blades at $17 a box</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t possibly recommend it enough, what would have normally taken me hours to do, this thing mowed everything down in half the time!  </li>
            <li> If you want to totally remote pubic hair - you will find you are left with a stiff stubble that ultimately needs to be shaved with cream in the old fashioned razor.</li>
            <li> I put buying this thing off for a long time, thinking I wasn&#x27;t missing much and could stick to using other gear/trimmers.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was a little loud when I switched in on just to see but it didn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest.</li>
            <li> Works great for body grooming, but only lasts about 2 years before it fails at the switch, so be prepared to deal with the warranty every couple of years (which isn&#x27;t bad to deal with overall) or to just toss them out and buy a new one.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself has some stainless steel coverings with some black plastic and black rubber grips.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, the only flaw I could point to with this product are with the cleaning instructions being a bit vague about how to remove foil shaver in order to clean the unit.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this groomer to all men who usually wax or shave.</li>
            <li> But in order to do that you really have to rub it hard against your skin</li>
            <li> handle really helps get those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ve used other groomers in the past, and most were barely a step above scissors (which would be a bad idea to have very close to your privates) in terms of effectiveness and safety.</li>
            <li> Over all this is a very good product, my only compliant is that the shaving head is difficult to remove without stabbing your fingers on the hair guards.</li>
            <li> This is a little disappointing as my hope was to use this product as my sole groomer, but it has definitely made regular maintenance quicker, easier and something that I stay on top of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it pinches on the very sensitive areas down under no matter how I try to use it, wet, dry, skin stretched or not.</li>
            <li> In the past I have purchased cheap plastic trimmers that easily broke when I attempted to use them and were very awkward to reach the correct places for trimming.  </li>
            <li> The length of it is just long enough to use as a wand of sorts, and the slight curve allows you to angle the trimmer edge on the shaver head to get your back and shoulders or other hard to reach places at a right angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get nun of those ill effects with the BG2040/34 smooth sailing all the way.</li>
            <li> Not good for backs unless you have someone who is willing to do it for you.</li>
            <li> This is not a forgiving shaver and the flexibility of the head and cutting blade is over-hyped and mostly ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was charged up it worked just ok, often pulling hairs and cutting skin, leading to bleeding.</li>
            <li> It grabs hair and pulls on it more so than cutting it.  </li>
            <li> I have been through countless trimmers in the past 6 years and this one by far gets the closest cut to the skin.</li>
            <li> I am reporting on long term use.</li>
            <li> so u long ur battery for long life  </li>
            <li> I would suggest not to let your chest hairs grow to long cause</li>
            <li> Yes, you still have to be careful when starting out as I got carried away and just wanted to shave everything...</li>
            <li> And the shaver will leave minor stubs in the end.     </li>
            <li> As for shaving the underneath where the scrotum is at, the shaver grabs the skin and cut too close resulting in minor cuts.     </li>
            <li> For a long time, I have wanted a shaver like this but couldn&#x27;t decide if I wanted to spend the money</li>
            <li> They gave me partial refund only.  </li>
            <li> It can hold battery charge for quite a long time as well (2-3 months for once/twice use per month).</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer not too long ago, been about 2 months now</li>
            <li> Not just because how long it can hold a charge but because you cannot use it while its charging, since it is required to be on the charging stand.    </li>
            <li> Minor detail, not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> There are pre-trimmer nodes mounted on both sides of the shaver head, which allows long hair to be cut to lengths that make it easier to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I suppose that also depends on how long you use it.</li>
            <li> Something minor, but might want to keep in mind...</li>
            <li> but maybe they fixed it because I use mine everyday and charge it maybe once a week</li>
            <li> it is a bit long and can be a bit unwieldy at times.  </li>
            <li> Nearly no hair is out of reach, this has changed my manscaping forever.</li>
            <li> it is often recommended for rechargeable batteries, I used the device until it was fully dead, before charging it completely.</li>
            <li> This leads to irritation and really long shaves, so I&#x27;ve stopped using the shaver functionality as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the strange feeling to shave my legs and everything below the neck for some time.</li>
            <li> Not wild about how long it takes to charge</li>
            <li> I personally like to use it wet with soap.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasted a long time before I had to charge it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely use some shaving gel or lathered soap if using it wet.</li>
            <li> It can be wetted, become wet, or washed entirely with water, however is NOT to be submerged in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You are gonna wonder, why it took so long for this invention to come about!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charger also works well and the charge itself lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Holds a long charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted something like this for a long time &amp; decided to do a search on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts about as long as it says it does, which is 1 hour.</li>
            <li> This is also how long it takes to fully charge.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of cleanup and it takes a long time,</li>
            <li> The charge holds a long time and shaves as close as you want it to shave.</li>
            <li> It shaves close and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Holds a long charge and even works in the shower.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts long time before it needs to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charger and sitting stand are sort of strange looking, but they work.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts long, and it just keeps working year after year.</li>
            <li> I carry it in all my long term trips</li>
            <li> He never nicks himself (as long as he has a mirror) and uses this in the shower as well.</li>
            <li> This has solved a problem I have had for a long time.  </li>
            <li> so I guess it&#x27;s a minor tradeoff that you have to be careful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> one star as it will pull your hair if its too long</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say if it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not very hairy, just a bit of nipple and armpit hair and some moderate growth in the crotch/anus area.</li>
            <li> The product fulfills the promised, the battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The easiest way that I&#x27;ve found is to put my fingernail under the grey plastic piece on one of the corners and pry/pop the foil off.  </li>
            <li> I had long hair on my arms and armpits.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts plenty long.</li>
            <li> Sometime rough especially around the edges.</li>
            <li> battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take long to recharge it, but it lasts days and days before having to recharge it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit holds a long charge; I have achieved 50-60 minutes of run time between charges (which will give you 3 or 4 trimming sessions before the need to recharge).</li>
            <li> Hopefully it keeps this up and the battery lasts as long as it does since I read some reviews about the battery draining after a couple of months of use.</li>
            <li> the battery lasts a long time and can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not as caught off-guard if your manscaping goes long.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what it costs as long as it works</li>
            <li> I have tried both afresh growth and long term growth 2+ months.</li>
            <li> There is DEFINITELY a learning curve in using the shaver, and so you do need to be careful how you use it.</li>
            <li> Should have purchased this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a really long time.</li>
            <li> and i must admit that the first thing that i am annoyed about is the not so long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> It will cut long hairs but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Work in layers if you&#x27;re working with long hair.</li>
            <li> Thinking of mowing the grass, if it were too long you wouldn&#x27;t put the mower on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> Shave well, long battery life, goes in the water, cannot hurt yourself...</li>
            <li> As even level 1 leaves long hair</li>
            <li> The charge lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the long of hair to begin with</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for long but takes like 15mins to charge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a long time and that is all it has ever lasted.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for an incredibly long time.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t use it everyday it will hold a charge for nearly two weeks.</li>
            <li> I wish I would of got this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I had been thinking about it for a long time and I am now asking myself what took so long</li>
            <li> It stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> I hung on to this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-charge lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> charge also holds a long time.</li>
            <li> Holds a long charge and you can even use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spare the details but had to shave before going in for some minor surgery.  </li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I wondered if there&#x27;s any way for that design to go flaky with such minimal contact</li>
            <li> I had tried it once before and it pinched me and caused a minor bleeding incident.  </li>
            <li> I love the trimmer function, and I use it for keeping beard close - however, the razor has a difficult time with my beard, and I do not have a thick beard, so I use the trimmer to get close, then use my old norelco three blade to finish the job when I need a close shave.</li>
            <li> Personally I wish the foil shaver wasn&#x27;t so wide, but then again I&#x27;m clearly not the target market for this product.  </li>
            <li> Let it run dead first few times as instructions stated.</li>
            <li> Things were very unruly, but the trimmer slowly mowed through my body hair with virtually no resistance.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this trimmer performs on my thick and often groomed beard.</li>
            <li> slightly annoying, but I can ignore it for the good results.</li>
            <li> let that dry then put a LITTLE talc-free power, i used goldbond for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that you need to regularly use it.</li>
            <li> I mean how long do you really need to shave your balls...</li>
            <li> Plus side - if you let it get a little unruly, use the other trimmer side first to knock the bush down a bit, then go in with the foil blade side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I still think a razor does a better job when it comes to shave duty and its less expensive and</li>
            <li> The design of this is such that I feel much less likely to drop it.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Philips BG 2020 which lasted only two years and was used a total of</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dry and wet shaving (in the shower) with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would expect something of this size (it is not small, measuring 7.5\\&quot; long) to last at least 20 minutes like my sideburn/beard trimmer, which is 1/3 the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very worried about this thing biting (if you know what I mean)</li>
            <li> But, it makes it awkward when you&#x27;re trying to trim/shave certain areas at certain angles.</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for my 4 year old plain norelco body groom.</li>
            <li> but I got tired of the battle scars (I shave right when I wake up.)</li>
            <li> I picked it up because i realized it uses the same charger as my other Philips Norelco beard trimmer, but this has this strange &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; the charger plugs into to make it charge.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the bottom half is all you need to adjust the trimmer length, but I have to say that this is surprisingly poor quality when the rest of the trimmer feels solid.</li>
            <li> Norelco recommends replacing the shaver foil every 6 months which is a really bad joke as the foil in the one I had only lasted a few weeks before the blades wore completely through it, and the replacement foils aren&#x27;t any better...</li>
            <li> I have seen that some other reviewers have had the same problem.</li>
            <li> The only issue that it has is that it hurts a little when the charge is low.</li>
            <li> I have I use daily or every other day</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t claim to have tried numerous other electric razors (although I have tried some); what I have is</li>
            <li> I did read some reviews of other groomers that people suffered such casualties.</li>
            <li> Compared to other trimmers, the length settings seem a bit different.</li>
            <li> For the other parts of the body: a definite yes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up switching back to my normal razor last night to finish up my arms and legs because I was getting neck crams, and was getting tired of sitting in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the trimmer on the other side of the unit is also under-powered, as it constantly seemed to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; hairs as I was trimming, unlike the trimmer on my Braun.  </li>
            <li> that according to other reviews may work for only 3-12 months before dying is an insult.  </li>
            <li> Being a male, I have hairy arms and legs amongst other body parts..</li>
            <li> Whether you are shaving for athletic or, um, other reasons, the groomer is heads and tails above foams, liquids or razors.  </li>
            <li> Also, the battery charge has lasted for a relly long time!</li>
            <li> I only have to charge it like once every other week.</li>
            <li> I suspect the other users were putting it back on charger every night contrary to the instructions.</li>
            <li> I also love the rotating head, it helps get to the difficult places a little easier.</li>
            <li> As a male who shaves his legs fairly regularly, have this little companion is quite handy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructions tell that it&#x27;s only to be used below the neck, but I&#x27;ve used it for shaving neck hair along with trimming up other areas.  </li>
            <li> Also the battery lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, doesn&#x27;t leave you irritated like other razors and does not cause ingrown hairs like using a regular razor.</li>
            <li> How else could one explain the fact that this trimmer produces the same nicks and cuts that every other model I&#x27;ve tried has produced.</li>
            <li> I have had several other batter operated trimmers that you could use while plugged in</li>
            <li> But still a battery life of two years is pretty weak.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I&#x27;ve only used one other body groomer before this one.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed in the manual in the shower, and practically one-handed (due to incapacitation of my left arm from a motorcycle accident).</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product over other similar products that have been used.</li>
            <li> I originally gave this a 4* rating, however, as time went on, I find this product fails on the battery.</li>
            <li> I think it would also work extremely well on the head as well, but I have not personally tried it there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this works on tough hair, though mine isn&#x27;t all that thick, so gorilla-types may need more.</li>
            <li> I have used my (very good) electric face shaver for other areas before and been very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Far less irritation than manual or other electric razors.  </li>
            <li> The end for cutting longer hair really works well, however the other end does not cut short hairs very well.</li>
            <li> Once charged, it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge for very long.  </li>
            <li> but it was not holding its charge for a very long time and</li>
            <li> I have bought two of these, and neither worked for very long.  </li>
            <li> The battery does not hold a charge very long, but it&#x27;s acceptable.  </li>
            <li> The sheer volume and tone of the noise this bad boy put out should have clued me into the fact that using it would be more like trying to shave with a hedge trimmer than a razor.  </li>
            <li> So, ok product, not too bad for the price, and I won&#x27;t send it back, but not a five star.</li>
            <li> Battery life is bad, not enough power and my norelco or phillips shaver does a better job for shave.</li>
            <li> Even when using the dry shaving I had no problems.  </li>
            <li> If you rinse, just let everything air dry when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> If you rinse, just let everything air dry when you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> I tried the shaver dry and put Powder.  </li>
            <li> With this trimmer, I used both ends, dry, with no shave gel.</li>
            <li> (dry)</li>
            <li> Just pop off whichever end needs cleaning rinse it out and let it dry</li>
            <li> Both sides of this trimmer are useless at making a clean edge at the bottom of your sideburns.</li>
            <li> On dry skin, the foil sticks to your skin, tilting the head and causing the side cutters dig in, nicking the skin.</li>
            <li> You can also use it to dry or liquid foam to shave</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t cut myself with it dry, too.)    </li>
            <li> It worked well while dry.</li>
            <li> This comes with a cleaning brush (for when your dry shaving or have let the razor dry)</li>
            <li> Storage and allowing it to dry this way are perfect!&lt;br</li>
            <li> use it dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the device in both a dry environment and in the shower.  </li>
            <li> While it works in both environments, I prefer using it dry - as it&#x27;s easier to see how you&#x27;re progressing without all your hair being drenched and clinging to your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I went with the dry-shave method as described in the manual which was to wash areas off with soap and water then dry off before using the groomer.</li>
            <li> his only negative comment was that it is a bit loud.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;ve tried dry, wet, and wet with shaving cream (at which point it makes no sense to not just use a regular blade anyway).  </li>
            <li> few months back the BG 2020 finally died, and it was time for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I tried it multiply times a few weeks apart with the same results.</li>
            <li> I can only say it works well for moderate use as it there isn&#x27;t a heavy need in my household.</li>
            <li> I take it off the charger and put it back on, but then an hour later it turned itself on again for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> in the end its only hair and if you cut too short or its uneven just try again.</li>
            <li> I was not sure how efficient it would be before I ordered it, but looking back, I have no regrets whatsoever .</li>
            <li> side is completely useless for me,  simply does not shave worth a damn.</li>
            <li> It is harsh on your face and would not likely satisfy you for a daily shave.</li>
            <li> Having said all this, I have only had the unit a few days, so I can&#x27;t comment further on the battery life.  </li>
            <li> Having said all this, I have only had the unit a few days, so I can&#x27;t comment further on the battery life.  </li>
            <li> For some reason when ever I use this specific shaver and only this one to to shave my crotch, afterwards I get a few pimples.</li>
            <li> I can not live without it now.</li>
            <li> The only down side is it&#x27;s long charge time</li>
            <li> the battery will hold a charge for a long time only down side to this</li>
            <li> and you can change it up and down depending on how long or short you want to keep or cut hair.</li>
            <li> have given it 4-stars, but I think the screen on the shaver side is rather delicate as it was damaged with no apparent mishandling in the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> Buy this bodygroom and I highly recommend setting up with the Subscription of replacement blades at least every 6 months</li>
            <li> its left me small cuts and bumps I have to shave again with regular blad because its does not shave close enough if I press harder</li>
            <li> Did not receive a single cut anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Limited Settings (levels)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a single flaw.</li>
            <li> Replacement head keeps popping off every single time I turn it on.</li>
            <li> So, i think i read just about ever single review for this product before buying it (the BG2040 model)</li>
            <li> As the title says, I used these about four times a month for 24 months and now the battery won&#x27;t make it through a single beard trimming, even after being on the charger for days.</li>
            <li> I got no cuts or knicks at all when using this on every single square inch of the privates area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m limited to one area of the body per charge.</li>
            <li> The shaver head is a single head shaver with &amp;#34;edging&amp;#34; trimmers on both sides.</li>
            <li> This should be a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for every single guy.</li>
            <li> seriously, you can shave your head, trim and shave your facial hair, and trim those other vital areas, all with equal precision and ease.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and this shaver doesnt seem to be able to get it off close to the skin, it leaves a very small amount close to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried both dry and wet, and both times the trimmer failed to get any significant amount of hair.</li>
            <li> the blades &amp; heads are not very wide, but cut well if you don&#x27;t mind taking your time a little bit.</li>
            <li> but I am not pleased with the results so far</li>
            <li> The other head that has the trimmer is totally useless because after using it for 3-4 minutes the charge light starts blinking.</li>
            <li> My hair was only a few days long from being shaved so it wasn&#x27;t too long on my chest...</li>
            <li> Body groomer in my mind meant no more disposal razor shaving for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> What normally happens is I forget to plug it in until it&#x27;s too late.  </li>
            <li> Be careful because the clippers are sharp and I accidentally nicked my husband&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> I have yet to  use the bottom end to shave real long hairs as I have not had the need to do that</li>
            <li> bodygroom 2020, body bare, quite a few Multi-bladed razors and even using electric clippers.  </li>
            <li> The instructions for removing the foil were poor and I cut my finger the first time.  </li>
            <li> I am a pretty hairy guy, and tired of being so.</li>
            <li> Apparently it is a problem with this model after a few months of use</li>
            <li> but the cost of the replacement parts has me a bit sour overall.</li>
            <li> I like the wet/dry and as long as you&#x27;re careful with the clipper guard</li>
            <li> its not perfect, nut its not bad    problem is that i lost the plastic comb  and if u order it from Philips site   </li>
            <li> At first I had false expectations, like it was going to shave as close as a razor.</li>
            <li> I remember the report it made when he struck the edge of sink with his Remington to knock the loose hair out.</li>
            <li> deal what do i have to loose</li>
            <li> None of the parts wobble or are loose.</li>
            <li> The battery life lasts a little over 20 minutes of use - if that, and the performance is considerably weak after the first 5 minutes of use in a full charge, thus rendering it quite useless after that and until the next recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo24A348V67QG9F]]Even new this thing had issues with power fluctuations(Shown in blurry Video Review on a fully charged hardly used shaver).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the awkwardness of having to hold it at odd angles to get it to go where you want it to that makes it easy to bump it the wrong way..</li>
            <li> So recently I decided I wanted to remove all of the hair from my body from the neck down.  </li>
            <li> Next time, I may even trim an upside down moustache</li>
            <li> I will only trust a Gillette Pro Guide fusion razor down there for now.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of purchasing some cheaper clippers before finally breaking down and buying this one...</li>
            <li> and it starts to flash yellow when the charge winds down, so</li>
            <li> the rating boils down to however, is the fact that arguably the key feature of this item doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t it click back down?</li>
            <li> so I always used clippers to get as close a shave down there as possible.  </li>
            <li> ... please don&#x27;t go on vacation without this thing or you might come back to a burn down house?</li>
            <li> The price may be a little steep compared to other products designed for the same purpose, but you are definitely getting what you pay for here.</li>
            <li> When I first looked at all the negative reviews that this product has I was a little set off for a moment or two.</li>
            <li> I see is that a lot of pubic hair can lay flat against the skin or at an angle, and the foil shave is useless on those hairs, while a   razor will lift and cut them right off.  </li>
            <li> I certainly would not use in delicate areas!</li>
            <li> The clipper end is very sharp and I use it without any attachment to cut what hair I have left off of my balding head.  </li>
            <li> My complaint is that it stopped charging after 1.5 years of use, and the cost of a new charging stand is $35.  </li>
            <li> I do, however, recommend using the neck razor with shaving cream, as dry shaving with this baby does hurt!  </li>
            <li> Works well and easy to adjust the cutting height to the desired lenght.</li>
            <li> This is a okay product, fancy packaging etc, but overall I was slightly disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> They did change the shape and head design slightly on this model, so it&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s hitting the skin differently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wet or dry...</li>
            <li> (previously feared to trim) trimmed for comfort and proper hygiene.    </li>
            <li> I did have to send the first one back as their was something wrong with its charging system.  </li>
            <li> (even shaving with just daily stubble, as opposed to bi-weekly or less) is that the skin gets irritated (and even cut and sometimes bleeding) before all the hairs are cut.  </li>
            <li> The foil head pivots in all directions, so it makes mistakes less likely.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like at first was that the guard didn&#x27;t come off the buzzer (which I thought I read in a review), but I was wrong about that.  </li>
            <li> The swivel head works against you instead of for you regardless of wet or dry use.</li>
            <li> Can use wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it cannot shave the smallest stubble so you will be left with really small hairs.  </li>
            <li> Cut hair dry or wet.</li>
            <li> Used less than one hundred times in total and battery won&#x27;t recharge at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor runs wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This body groom does the same job as less expansive clippers.</li>
            <li> Can be used dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I charged it for 24 hours and less than 5 minutes go by before the inevitable hum of the razor slows.</li>
            <li> Gash was courtesy of the wet shave, and I pinched and nicked myself a couple times when using it dry.</li>
            <li> The reason why i gave it 3 stars is because you can only use half the product,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Asian</li>
            <li> Works perfectly wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I only had to do a small touch up the following day.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t shave off all of my facial hair.</li>
            <li> The reason it&#x27;s getting 3 stars is because I typically have to go over an area multiple times to get all of the hairs.</li>
            <li> They broke after several months and their batteries needed about 12 hours to charge to work for one hour or less.</li>
            <li> You can use it both wet and dry -</li>
            <li> Works wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I tried dry and wet.</li>
            <li> The last one lasted less than 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used in shower, wet and dry and nothing seems to stop it.</li>
            <li> The thing I did wrong once (and only once) is that I first tried to use the extension trimmer side on my genital area to get my hair shorter before using the close-shave double-blades.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, but needed to recharge after each use, lasting 5 minutes or less.</li>
            <li> I had one previously and used it extensively.  </li>
            <li> Wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> tried wet shaving with water, with shaving cream, shaving gel and dry shaving.</li>
            <li> As I previously stated, this has a standard electric razor head with shears on either side.  </li>
            <li> the plus side, it does work well, wet or dry, and my skin was never cut by the blades.</li>
            <li> The battery life is quite long and should last a few days before needing to be recharged.  </li>
            <li> wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It was not very easy to use - back to WAXING!</li>
            <li> Do not let the sleek black and chrome appearance fool you, it is totally made for you ladies.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to trim facial fuzz, as the epilator I previously purchase caused ingrown hair issues.</li>
            <li> Can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Works wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of trimmers of various types in the past and used and/or misused them in probably every way possible.  </li>
            <li> And its double ended to make the groomer an all in one which takes up less space.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using the shaving foil end for a super close shave is too uncomfortable and irritable for my liking.</li>
            <li> with the more than average length it still is a little difficult to reach all areas.</li>
            <li> and although I have extremely thick hair there, i was very surprised with the outcome.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only shaver that works down there with minimal nicks.</li>
            <li> You know, how a man can have absolutely no hair down there (below the belt, above the knees).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to be shaving down there, you have to be careful... simple as that.</li>
            <li> The thought of shaving bumps, itching, and scratching down there after a wet shave turned me off totally</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this groomer to anyone who would like to take care of themselves in a typically inhospitable region to ordinary hygienic devices.e</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this groomer to anyone who would like to take care of themselves in a typically inhospitable region to ordinary hygienic devices.</li>
            <li> because when tiny little hair dust gets in the trimmer, it slows down a bit and seems like it needs a charge, when it actually just needs a cleaning.    </li>
            <li> I only wish it had the vacuum feature of one of its Philips product cousins, but that is a small gripe.</li>
            <li> The curve of the body with trimming blades on both sides actually makes it REALLY easy to get the tight corners without cutting the daylights out of your junk.</li>
            <li> a very close shave - this is the killer&lt;br /&gt;Motor on the trimmer seemed weak</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time, and the cradle is extremely convenient.</li>
            <li> I bought a different groomer this time, not worth it for something that only lasted a few months at 100%.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have money for the longest to buy anything that helped, so I was scared the trimmer was gunna pull or hurt and be a total mess</li>
            <li> This is the only shaver I&#x27;ve had that doesn&#x27;t mess up the groin area.</li>
            <li> The closest setting (other than bare skin shaving) could be a little closer in case</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only a minor discomfort and avoidable if you go slow enough.</li>
            <li> Just a warning.. be careful; if you take the guard off the clippers it can cut/pinch skin that is baggy or loose</li>
            <li> (1) It does a poor job shaving, and (2) the battery loses it&#x27;s charge very quickly, and doesn&#x27;t hold it in storage for longer than a week</li>
            <li> Areas before that were a slight problem or tricky with a mnaul razor like rough knees and under arms, this went over easily, following contours effortslessly.</li>
            <li> (And in case you&#x27;re curious, I tried the shaver both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> I have used wet, wet w/shaving gel, and dry.  </li>
            <li> I thought possibly since I ran it down to the point the buzzing stopped, I killed the initial minimum battery level.</li>
            <li> Just as reference I am the type of guy that trims everything short and tight about every 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Trim down with sides then use the flat shaver head.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a body hair trimmer since I was fed up with using an old beard trimmer and wanted to thin out the thicket of body hair my Jewish and Italian ancestors had passed down.</li>
            <li> I use it to shave my face, trim my mustache, shave the back of my neck, the back of my shoulders, and my back, trim my chest hair(which is thick), and even the hair down below.</li>
            <li> Works wet or dry, all over, head to toe, and everywhere in between!</li>
            <li> First of all: this shaver is long enough, and because the shaver end cuts at its edges as well, that one can shave those areas on the back impossible to reach (without help) with a razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the creams to help and other methods to reduce irritation, but I will never shave with an actual razor down there again.</li>
            <li> the other end is the shaver which has two low-powered trimmers on either end, so you can cut your hair down to a short length before it gets shaved.</li>
            <li> My only worry is that like almost every other shaver/razor that it breaks down after about 1 year (&amp; I have to buy another one), but even if it does, I still would have had a year of peace &amp; no aggrevation w/ shaving.</li>
            <li> No more issues with razor rash, no messy shave creams, and it can be used dry or wet so I can just vacuum up the mess instead of letting it go down the drain.</li>
            <li> personally i think the item is a little over priced</li>
            <li> As it is currently manufactured, you risk the family jewels, their carrying case and their little buddy.</li>
            <li> but I still had a little bit of it, but only when set at a 0.</li>
            <li> I was still a little apprehensive, but after only 5 minutes of using it I was convinced of its awesomeness.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER shaved without skin irritation following and this little beauty does the job.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a little picture of a hand clipping the battery wire with scissors in order to dispose of it properly.</li>
            <li> You have to go over the same spot 5 times to get a little cut</li>
            <li> I have tried several other body-grooming devices in the past that either a) broke b) did not work as promised c) did not actually trim hair all that well or d) had a lot of additional pieces that, if lost, rendered the device</li>
            <li> Constantly you will little nicks that, if you&#x27;re like me, will drive you nuts.  </li>
            <li> If you are shaving your back or chest, this hurts a little.  </li>
            <li> Really gets the tough spots</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco products have usually lasted me a few years and this shaver is quite an upgrade from their older version.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other downside was it couldn&#x27;t handle very long hair at all.</li>
            <li> This little bad guy is amazing, shaved my nuts in the shower in under five minutes.</li>
            <li> The 2 heads, cutting both the full main and secondary to lower</li>
            <li> However, on this model they added a swivel to the shaving side head, which in my opinion makes it more difficult to shave the hard to reach areas because somethings always swiveling away from where you want</li>
            <li> Can finally shave ALL over with absolutely no nicks , even over testacies !!!</li>
            <li> Due to the rough shave of a single cutter head, this one isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t nick as bad as my unguarded Norelco beard trimmer, but I just assume when you shell out 50$ or more for a beard and body trimmer that you don&#x27;t have to be so overly cautious.  </li>
            <li> Also, you&#x27;ll be able to feel if something &#x27;bad&#x27; is going to happen (like a nick or pull), so you can stop and adjust accordingly when that feeling happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot give this more than two stars beacuse of my bad experience.</li>
            <li> I cannot give this more than two stars beacuse of my bad experience.</li>
            <li> With this bodygroomer, I can get the close shave I love without the painful itchiness.</li>
            <li> those slicing blades can catch the skin and make the most amazingly painful pinches ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery would die w/no warning, it was light to hold and detachable clippers made it somewhat awkward.  </li>
            <li> the double sided trimmer on top was a stupid design.</li>
            <li> We both like to sit on the toilet and trim so that the hairs are less of a cleanup issue.  </li>
            <li> If you handle it the wrong way, it works just as well, but makes four times as much noise when you put it back together.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave without irritating delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> With this trimmer you can literally remove hairs everywhere, you just need common sense in sensitive areas to nor hurt yourself with the teeth.</li>
            <li> You might want to be careful around sensitive areas, but that&#x27;s common sense.</li>
            <li> I have use this now for 2 weeks everyday sometimes twice a day only charged it once .</li>
            <li> After 1 year or so of minimal use the battery quit taking a charge.</li>
            <li> i do get pinched buy the littler trimmer blades before the microfoil shaver, i not really notice it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-You are shaving uneven area, example, private area/crotch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because of this, i am now scared to go remotely as close as i want to.  </li>
            <li> This morning, I made a 2 mm wide edge between my lip and my mustache.</li>
            <li> Be careful still...</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I had minimal irritation.  </li>
            <li> i read the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li> After I joined the military I started using a trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It came a lot quicker than I had expected I did not order expedited shipping</li>
            <li> I could use this with my eyes closed</li>
            <li> I am in the military and when I shave I want a close shave, and when I am allowed to have a beard I need to keep it trimmed.</li>
            <li> It is an area of very loose skin</li>
            <li> However, the regular buzz cutter clippers on the bottom do not work that well after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The downside as while you can use it in the shower, the shaver head just doesn&#x27;t work well when you&#x27;re wet.  </li>
            <li> It also works well as an electric razor to do clean-up work after a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After just a few uses, the head blade just broke and would not go back in.</li>
            <li> filling in the empty space.</li>
            <li> No really I tried.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful, can nick you otherwise.</li>
            <li> The battery life is very short in my opinion (you need to recharge it after using it a few times)  </li>
            <li> For the face: not really (hence why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars).  </li>
            <li> I only use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> They say it can be used wet-or-dry, but I haven&#x27;t tried it wet and probably won&#x27;t.    </li>
            <li> I know, it doesn&#x27;t come in pink or pastel colors, but,</li>
            <li> i try with day and with wet.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;fenced razor&amp;#34; end of the product does last longer, and is somewhat efficient, however the fence does fall apart within a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have only gotten a few nicks from it and have found if I follow the directions and keep it perpendicular to my skin</li>
            <li> things to know:&lt;br /&gt;-Be careful which side you are using, as there is no indicator as to which side is on besides the buzzing</li>
            <li> In my experience, shaving wet increases the friction and doesn&#x27;t allow the blades to cut as close to the skin.  </li>
            <li> If you want a shave that&#x27;s as close as a manual razor would be, minus the irritation, use baby powder (made of cornstarch, not talc).  </li>
            <li> And putting it back in also needs a firm push.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wet, which I feel does not get as close.</li>
            <li> BG2040 BodyGroom Pro works as expected.  </li>
            <li> This is an utter waste of money.  </li>
            <li> But I had an earlier version of this and after a few months the head kept falling off when I used it.</li>
            <li> guide will let you chose from a few different</li>
            <li> Now, for the harder to reach places...between your butt, it will even work there.</li>
            <li> I received the item a day sooner than expected..</li>
            <li> I set it to my desired length and after a few passes I bumped it against my body as I started the next pass</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cut us no matter how rough we were with it..</li>
            <li> I was reluctant when I bought this--I was looking at a few different options.  </li>
            <li> Although it isn&#x27;t made for it, if you are careful it can be used on your face.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no problems with nicks.  </li>
            <li> when we shave its kinda makes our face rough, and it may cause rash because of that.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that recommended.</li>
            <li> Well despite the answer to a question above the battery on my 2040 is NOT replaceable, and once it&#x27;s dead, there is</li>
            <li> You have to be careful as it will cut you.  </li>
            <li> but maybe the battery isn&#x27;t dead enough...</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it can be difficult to reach some areas such as the mid back, and could do with some sort of extending handle</li>
            <li> I will check back ina few months to give an update.</li>
            <li> : grooming time was short; 4th year: DEAD.</li>
            <li> (That is the only reason for missing one star.)</li>
            <li> I still use it for the necessary tidying of oneself (a few locations on my body).</li>
            <li> Though you do have to still be careful.</li>
            <li> You can use it on all parts of the body and it gives you a shave that&#x27;s close and doesn&#x27;t leave you itchy the next few days.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful and be patient.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer lasted just over a year, used roughly once a month.</li>
            <li> I minus&#x27;d</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes longer than a fancy and chic electric razor (I know, I was hoping to avoidthe wet shave with this groomer, too, you know), but it&#x27;ll get the job done, you&#x27;ll save some money, and you probably won&#x27;t end up with a band-aid on your balls.</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful when navigating around your nether regions as it will nick your nads without the guard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend buying this and a few of the extra heads for it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you have to be careful that you don&#x27;t damage the foil and also accidentally don&#x27;t hit the shaving button while pulling the head off....</li>
            <li> but it is a bit rough after the shave.</li>
            <li> While the grip works in the shower, the trimmer itself had lack luster performance when wet.</li>
            <li> we expected to set an alarm to remind us to remove this thing from the charger?</li>
            <li> Money well spent</li>
            <li> /&gt;Below the belt - Be careful.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> does the job still need to be careful at ground &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he kept saying he wanted an electric body shaver that he could get slightly wet.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut you although you don&#x27;t want to rough house the jewels either.  </li>
            <li> A 15 sec video?</li>
            <li> It required a few extra passes to get everything sufficiently shaved.</li>
            <li> an hour later it turned itself on again for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Turns out i needn&#x27;t be so careful with this item.</li>
            <li> This body-groomer works as expected.  </li>
            <li> It is not really meant for your face, so ignore people who don&#x27;t read directions and then write reviews.  </li>
            <li> The product works but not quite as well as I expected.  </li>
            <li> The only disadvantage I found is the weight of this shaver which raelly feels heavy while doing the work.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times, and I cannot speak for that.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too big and heavy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Being careful will yield results you&#x27;ll like.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> You cannot get a remotely close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They all jammed or broke within a year or two.</li>
            <li> If not used carefully if tends to scratch and sometimes pull a bit.</li>
            <li> No matter how carefully you place the Bodygroom, it never seems to be positioned correctly to charge.  </li>
            <li> If you are a lady, or a man who wouldn&#x27;t mind a pink shaver, I would pass on this one and get the Panasonic ES2207P.</li>
            <li> No complaints or regrets.</li>
            <li> Did everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried using it wet, but it helps make cleanup easier being waterproof.</li>
            <li> Seems reliable, works as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything functions, but nothing functions well;  it gets the job done, but not very efficiently.  </li>
            <li> I went in quite a few directions, only tugged a hair once</li>
            <li> A particulary troublesome area was the bony center in between one&#x27;s pectorals.</li>
            <li> A particulary troublesome area was the bony center in between one&#x27;s pectorals.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the light is useless, it only lights up when the battery has approximately 10 minutes of power in it</li>
            <li> The trimmers did not really trim the hair and the blades on each side of the shaver tended to pull the hairs instead of trim them.</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve tried was such a waste I never used them twice.  </li>
            <li> It is not really designed to be portable.</li>
            <li> but, as an all round trimmer, used on facial hair and to trim between cuts, it does work well and battery life seems quite adequate.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really talking legs here, I&#x27;m talking about the place where we take our pride</li>
            <li> Absolutely no irritation.</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful when you get to the testicles</li>
            <li> The battery life usually only lasts a few minutes.</li>
            <li> So, be careful when travelling with it since there is no head cover for the shaver.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  </li>
            <li> and I ultimately threw it away after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> It is a waste of money and does not do the job properly.  </li>
            <li> Not quite the hype I expected.</li>
            <li> However the battery lasts for roughly five min for me.  </li>
            <li> is wide</li>
            <li> cautious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried using it wet even though I no you can.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not as gentle as it was reviewed a couple years ago when I bought</li>
            <li> Just be careful.  </li>
            <li> I hear you have to shave wet, will give that a try.</li>
            <li> grooming has been done wet, in the shower.</li>
            <li> No really problems.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when using in the shower.  </li>
            <li> like I had expected</li>
            <li> but it expecting it to have absolutely no chance of nicking you.</li>
            <li> I was curious to also try it in the nether regions.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with the close shave head b/c it tends to nick skin.  </li>
            <li> Be careful guys.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no pain, cuts, or pulling.</li>
            <li> minimal effort</li>
            <li> rolling capability of the foil shaving head makes the cutters drag on your skin as you run the foil shaver across your body.</li>
            <li> This was two tries and now I am tossing it.  </li>
            <li> although you have to have the base to charge it (it does pack pretty well) -- and it has held a charge pretty well.  </li>
            <li> although you have to have the base to charge it (it does pack pretty well) -- and it has held a charge pretty well.  </li>
            <li> short, the razor&#x27;s design is good, but the battery is terrible.  </li>
            <li> But, you do need to be careful and go slow, it can still cut and leave razor burn in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend going slow with the razor and cleaning it frequently.  </li>
            <li> shaver old school norelco crap DOES NOT LEAVE SMOOTH FINISH</li>
            <li> Looks nice, but worthless product.  </li>
            <li> but no matter how tight the skin is pulled or not pulled it still grabs the skin and leaves red spots,I don&#x27;t how other people do</li>
            <li> It mowed down my long hairs on my legs, belly button area, arms, and armpits.</li>
            <li> As a former bodybuilder and a lifelong advocate of the hairless look, I have been in various stages and phases of shaving parts or all of my body for the past 30 years!</li>
            <li> Well, without saying too much, if the pivoting head happens to rotate down or at an odd angle for just a second then your sensitive parts meet unguarded cutting metal.  </li>
            <li> , I like bargains, trust refurbs for the most part and only had minor issues with other electronic refurbs I&#x27;ve bought in the past, but this being electromechanical was probably a bad refurb decision</li>
            <li> I hate to admit it, as I&#x27;ve always thought of myself as a rather &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; man, but I really like having no extra hair (or cleanly trimmed, at least).  </li>
            <li> Plain and simply put without beating around the bush.</li>
            <li> I would suggest using the trimmer end dry as water will lay hair down and make it harder to get an even cut.</li>
            <li> other complaint is that the battery has to be completely discharged before charging otherwise you will kill the battery life.</li>
            <li> Previously I used a razor to shave my pubic area, but I was fed up with how long it took and the nicks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wan to shave my legs and hands, so I need the shaver for my back, and the trimmer for other parts.</li>
            <li> My instincts told me that it was a bad idea to have something sharp, electric, and buzzing near my nads, and I should&#x27;ve listened, because my instincts were right.</li>
            <li> because this thing is safe and difficult to cut yourself with does not mean to go crazy when using it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed the trimmer itself is too big for a fine beard trimming.</li>
            <li> By sliding the groomer, side trimmers will cut the long hairs, and long hairs become short enough to be shaved by a hidden trimmer, which is covered by a thin foil.</li>
            <li> Calling Philips, this was going to come to approximately $40 plus shipping, which to me is ridiculous since it&#x27;s the cheap, non-mechanical part of the device.</li>
            <li> If you had bad experience with other Philips Norelco Bodygroom&#x27;s, the BG2040 is 100% better then other.</li>
            <li> For a long time I had simply trimmed and occasionally used a razor but any cuts or irritation is so much worse when its downstairs.</li>
            <li> I accidentally left it in the charger too long once and it killed the battery DEAD.</li>
            <li> Gone are the days spent nurturing wounds in &amp;#34;delicate areas&amp;#34; due to razors, scissors, etc.</li>
            <li> Even though he is dead inside, he seems to only buy something that he is passionate about and has researched heavily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s virtually impossible to nick or cut yourself with it (although it did happen once with me), so it&#x27;s ideal for guys who might be a little careless when it comes to trimming.</li>
            <li> this is my first disappointment, and it&#x27;s a big one.</li>
            <li> I do however wish it didn&#x27;t make such a big mess (needs a collector while it trims so you don&#x27;t have to work hard cleaning pieces of hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll occasionally tug the hairs, and I&#x27;ve been nick&#x27;d a few times when I was being less than careful.</li>
            <li> The pivoting end is a bit weird and can still nick sensitive areas if not careful</li>
            <li> I tried it dry and wet and still hurt/pulled my hair a little.  </li>
            <li> I use the pivoting end for the delicate bits (almost everything down there), and the fixed end I use at the longest setting to keep my leg hair in check.</li>
            <li> On our maiden voyage together I got a little too conformable with this groomer and suffer from a minor cut.</li>
            <li> skin on the pubic mound and between the leg and the sack are thick and tight enough to use the shaving foil for an extra close shave.</li>
            <li> Shaving down &amp;#34;there&amp;#34; was pretty simple although I was still careful not to go crazy.  </li>
            <li> Need to buy a new one at least every few years.</li>
            <li> first, I tried going a little to fast and was mildly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Quieter, less painful, and more convenient with the attached clippers.</li>
            <li> It got high rating possibly because disappointed customers like me are busy returning it to Amazon or the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The main shaver however suffers from a major design flaw that made me almost put this device though a window.  </li>
            <li> Not only was it a bad shave, but it was also much slower than a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Really not as good as the old fashion razor</li>
            <li> I now use it to trim or shave other areas of my body was well, and since buying it in 2010 I replaced the foil 2-3 times.</li>
            <li> Need a deign that truly can replace the features of all my other shavers, esp for close shaves.</li>
            <li> other</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about all you can ask for unless you use Nair or some other chemical hair</li>
            <li> Go to a barber for that other stuff.</li>
            <li> Go to a barber for that other stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used already three other brands over the course of 10 years.</li>
            <li> The 2-in1 shavers design means one end or the other will do for anything that might ever need &amp;#34;grooming&amp;#34; (a.k.a. &amp;</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> These are just examples of extreme nit-picking from me when it comes to this product and should not deter you from buying it.</li>
            <li> I have owned multiple groomers in the past</li>
            <li> Other than that there have been no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Folks, I have tried Braun, Shick, other Norelco&#x27;s, 4 blade razors, 5 blade razors, straights razors, on and on and on to no avail.</li>
            <li> The battery life on it is unlike any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It has a shaver on one end and a trimmer on the other, which means you can do both without having to change heads/attachments.</li>
            <li> leaves bumps on legs, hurts on other parts of body.  </li>
            <li> I like all the other features on it.</li>
            <li> One note - this is a NiMH battery, therefore you must follow the charging instructions to avoid losing capacity due to a memory effect.  </li>
            <li> So, all in all, this groomer is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; not totally useless but not perfect either.  </li>
            <li> Beats any other body trimmer.</li>
            <li> Other than, that, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lady shavers, but they die or have other issues by the 3 month mark, so I decided to do some research on men&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Changed my rating due to the battery life.</li>
            <li> Well what can I say about the razor other</li>
            <li> The other end tackles longer hair.</li>
            <li> The blades are just now due for replacement after about 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> I used to have problems with ingrown hairs from my other cutters.  </li>
            <li> The clipper on the other end does have some use.</li>
            <li> No more having to store extra settings in the sink cabinet!  </li>
            <li> No nicks, cuts, scrapes or other undesireable collateral issues.  </li>
            <li> It shaves closer than any other clippers I have used.</li>
            <li> Have not used length settings or other end of groomer at all and assume you must need to be like a yeti in order to need this end.  </li>
            <li> On the other end you get a shaving head that pivots.  </li>
            <li> now on i &#x27;ll never use any other substitute</li>
            <li> The foil head tore off in a place, and that caused a sharp edge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three in the past several years - I would consider myself as somebody who can now review this product with expertise.</li>
            <li> the battery, the problem I have is that I&#x27;ll charge it up fully, place it aside for my next use, but usually that usage is a week away, and by the time I go to use it again, the battery has lost its charge.</li>
            <li> the other night with it</li>
            <li> Cuts the hair doesn&#x27;t pull like other clippers.</li>
            <li> As other&#x27;s have noted the beard trimming guard is not the hardest/toughest plastic around.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought it, but not its not better than the BG2030.</li>
            <li> The other being the groomer itself has a battery power indicator,</li>
            <li> While you&#x27;re reading, see if other people comment on the battery life.</li>
            <li> The other Philips shaver I had broke at the neck after about 1 years us use.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected, just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Still have to be careful but go for it!</li>
            <li> Other months, I&#x27;m looking for a mate.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not sure I like about</li>
            <li> At some spots the shave is comparable to manual razor, while at other spots it&#x27;s like two day&#x27;s stubble.  </li>
            <li> The other end is adjustable clippers.</li>
            <li> charger, on the other hand, is an abomination.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of my other electric razors, trimmers, etc since this one arrived.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just grabbing and yanking the hairs, creating a sharp pinching sensation.  </li>
            <li> I like the end with the trimming attachment, so I use that end, but the other end just seems to pull on your hairs making it an unlikeable experience.</li>
            <li> I doubt that I will be needing a replacement any time soon, since the shaver is as sharp today as it was the day I received it.</li>
            <li> Only reason i got this one was cuz of the past one...</li>
            <li> Both products I ended up with were Norelco due to reviews.</li>
            <li> it stays sharp and reduces the chance of you carving some initials in the tree trunk or nicking a berry.</li>
            <li> I do not think that I could be any more disappointed with</li>
            <li> It also fully charges in 1 hour unlike a lot of other body hair trimmers out there.</li>
            <li> Usually use this to shave off the bulk of the body hair and then go over the stubble with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Norelco, on the other hand, has.</li>
            <li> also has a adjustable beard trimmer on the other side.</li>
            <li> Now one button is malfunctioning and the other one isn&#x27;t working at all.</li>
            <li> &quot; it was a bit frightening at first</li>
            <li> which definitely takes your trimming time longer than usual.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first reading some of these reviews.</li>
            <li> This may be a problem for other devices as a well.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve tried other methods and have given up every time (with fear of doing something</li>
            <li> withe guide on the other end.</li>
            <li> The ends of the tiny cutters are rounded so they don&#x27;t let any small skin folds get in the blades and</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get this out of the way: this product is made for the hair that grows in places other than your head.  </li>
            <li> (generally only if I begin to rush or apply excessive pressure).</li>
            <li> Shopping for a different brand now, as this is my second unit that&#x27;s failed me in the same time period...expensive junk.</li>
            <li> only problem about this is the guard included has is not applicable for small hairs</li>
            <li> It is not razor sharp close.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t complain about it pulling like some of the other electronic shavers we have tried.</li>
            <li> the other side, haven&#x27;t messed overly with body hair trimming, but for a &amp;#34;beard trimmer&amp;#34;, I like to get to almost a five o&#x27;clock shadow look when I trim up my beard and mustache.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then the other side is a trimmer for things like armpits</li>
            <li> Well, It&#x27;s not that sharp.</li>
            <li> I will usually charge it after usage, and then when I go to use it again (a week later), it has no problem grooming my areas all in one charge.</li>
            <li> That aside, it works as well as any other product of its type.</li>
            <li> No more razor burn or razor red bumps.</li>
            <li> The other side is a hair machine</li>
            <li> When I used the other end</li>
            <li> They were not deep cuts but a lot of small cuts and skin</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not interested in shaving any other body parts.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend this shaver to anyone, due to</li>
            <li> /&gt;2- Blades on either side are shaped to reduce irritation - do not feel sharp tips compared to cheaper products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I guess this is due to the edges of the blades being exposed as other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m out about $50 due to distractions from utilizing the warrantee.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The shaver is pretty difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades are still sharp.</li>
            <li> In a body razor, what else can you ask other than, &amp;#34;Does</li>
            <li> I like the double sided trimmer no more changing heads.  </li>
            <li> Because I had the other one</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has two sides, so one is for longer hair (with an adjustable head) and the other side is for a closer finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the other seems to have seized up.  </li>
            <li> There is a difference between this and other grooming tools.  </li>
            <li> It has grown in size now, due to the two separate ends for shaving/trimming versus clipping.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to use it in the shower as other users say in their reviews.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other guys problems were using the thing.</li>
            <li> I shave my balls with one side and my face with the other.</li>
            <li> I bought it after reading other reviews from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t terribly difficult to do, I posted a guide on iFixit for those interested.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> click and style on the other hand</li>
            <li> I would buy it again and recommend it to other people.  </li>
            <li> contacted Philips USA and they were extremely unhelpful this time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with it over the past several months and wouldn&#x27;t change a thing about it.</li>
            <li> works like a charm, i was skeptical at first cause</li>
            <li> It feels way safer than other trimmers i have used with guards that leave one side exposed.</li>
            <li> I have never been more disappointed with a Phillips product in my life.</li>
            <li> I did not see any other reviewers covering this</li>
            <li> The unit has two ends - one for triming and the other for shaving.  </li>
            <li> (I dropped it from 2.5m onto tile, still works but not exactly waterproof)</li>
            <li> I just am not sure about the shaving experience especially considering the price.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about getting this for man-scaping but after my first use I am amazed by this product.</li>
            <li> While the head is much narrower the trimming blades don&#x27;t retract which makes it a little tough to get into all areas.</li>
            <li> As other reviews mention, be VERY careful in this area.</li>
            <li> I was stupid and threw out the box and papers of the product when i bought it (because i only used the shaver and thought everything is fine).   </li>
            <li> but the shaver (wide) part of the Bodygroom does not work well down there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be careful and cautious at all times and this product will do wonders for you down there.</li>
            <li> If you push down while shaving, it will move the guard, so be careful.</li>
            <li> - there were absolutely NO issues with hair removal down there with the BodyGroom Pro.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to keep your thumb on the slide as you&#x27;ll drop down to lowest guard by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be careful and take your time down there gents.</li>
            <li> Is there really a reason why the base has to be so large?</li>
            <li> Reading reviews of other similar universal products, this seems to be a very common issue.  </li>
            <li> The edges of the head also have a tendency to pinch skin if I am not extremely careful, which hasn&#x27;t drawn a ton of blood but is painful and has led to a quick banshee-wail on a few occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And secondly, the trimming edge is just a little narrow.</li>
            <li> This product is great for the wide areas of your body like chest and legs, but it is very difficult in the narrow areas, like underarms and between legs, it is harmful in these difficult</li>
            <li> Just be very careful around the boys</li>
            <li> However if you very very careless, you can still cut ourself, but that is very rare.  </li>
            <li> out of a dozen or so attempts, while being VERY careful and taking my time, I ending up bleeding 9 of 12 times.</li>
            <li> I used it once and was very careful yet</li>
            <li> I had to be VERY careful with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, be very careful using either side of this shaver below the belt.  </li>
            <li> I was very, very careful with how I used the groomer.</li>
            <li> My skin was very rough after shaving.</li>
            <li> Maybe those who tout that it is impossible to cut yourself will provide some detailed direction</li>
            <li> Less than two years after purchase, the rechargeable battery is dead and it no longer works properly  - also the microscreen end is virtually impossible to clean.</li>
            <li> I can go back over and over those areas, irritating my skin in the process, and still have hairs left here</li>
            <li> but I have used it a few times dry as well.</li>
            <li> My dissapointment with this groomer is that it does not get close enough to the skin, even after multiple passes with pressure to not leave visible stubs behind.     </li>
            <li> It cuts nicely without irritating or cutting one&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> I have used many razors below the waist and this one is by far THE WORST!</li>
            <li> I spent a loooong time reading reviews and finally decided on this one, still with some worries about negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a characteristic of all electric shavers, but fortunately, it is not.</li>
            <li> The next morning I grabbed the groomer, put on my game face, and took the plunge starting to use</li>
            <li> only downside to this in my opinion is that it is a little awkward at first.</li>
            <li> My other two complaints are based on the normal, expected usage of the device, but it is disappointing that they could not take it a bit further and design something that could handle any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I used razors I got what looking like a very unfortunate case of chicken pox and when I used creams that removed hair my skin rebelled by turning bright red.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, you can nick yourself if your careless with the shaver, but if you are shaving below the belt with a razor and you&#x27;re not being careful anyway than you should probably seek out a group and share those feelings with others because you are a strange, strange human.  </li>
            <li> On one end is an adjustable clipper for trimming hair;  on the other end is the shaver head for removing all hair down to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect that you can just go shaving down below with your eyes closed and half hazzardly expecting to come out without any....accidents, just because this is advertised as a product that is meant for shaving \\&quot;all</li>
            <li> the other side for trimming longer hair cuts very un-even and somewhat useless.</li>
            <li> My complaint with other personal groomers from Braun and Remington that I&#x27;ve used is that they sometimes pull rather than cut hair.</li>
            <li> In other words, tilt this thing back and forth over your body, lop off all the hair, and then shave, slowly, holding it perpendicular.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so large that it can be difficult to work with and get into some areas.      </li>
            <li> , i&#x27;ve tried conventional ( and noth so conventional) methods of man-scaping, and this leaves you with minimum irritation.</li>
            <li> I usually use it when my scruff has gotten too long and it shortens whiskers making it less irritating when I go over it again with a normal nonelectric razor.  </li>
            <li> You still need to be a little careful</li>
            <li> Be a little careful while using to avoid zits.</li>
            <li> It took off the thick hair as fast as my regular clippers but without the random nicks/cuts that I&#x27;ve come to expect from the sharp edges of the Wahl clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it costs 20$ which is a third of the entire product    insane, not very customer friendly too.   </li>
            <li> You are sick and tired of using your own electric razor, or just a plain blade, this is totally</li>
            <li> It is much less painful (although to be fair...using this product dry is not painful to begin with).</li>
            <li> well (as previously observed by other reviewers).</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first with the price of the BG2040.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly trim my entire chest without the charge depleting.</li>
            <li> My only problem is sometimes I go a little overboard with the body grooming...</li>
            <li> it had (but was mistaken) -- an extension handle to allow you to use it on hard to reach areas on the back.  </li>
            <li> and I bled enough to learn a hard lesson.</li>
            <li> when it finally decides to dull out it&#x27;s got a replacable head.</li>
            <li> the only issue I have at all is a that it is a little difficult to completely rinse out the head even after detaching it.</li>
            <li> This bad boy is smooth.</li>
            <li> only bad thing, is you must wait 10 hours to charge before you use it the first time</li>
            <li> I got nicked up pretty badly, and was still left with stubble for all my efforts.  </li>
            <li> This shaver gave me pretty bad razor burn and also cut me badly in several places.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like it on your average beard-trimmer.</li>
            <li> the pain this thing inflicts is not worth the time I save.</li>
            <li> Not worth your time</li>
            <li> My only complaint with it is the charging system or battery.  </li>
            <li> research shows that this is not a battery that is intended to be changed by the average</li>
            <li> Veryyyyy average.</li>
            <li> But I have dark hair so for those of you who have lighter pubes</li>
            <li> The only complaint is a bit of razor burn/rash that lasted a day or so</li>
            <li> It needlessly folds, but really doesn&#x27;t save any space by doing so, and you cannot connect the trimmer to the charger alone, you must use the stand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The stainless steel head of the shaver is a bit difficult to remove for cleaning if you have not tried it a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> Loses charge after several months, and the stand will not charge any longer</li>
            <li> As it stands, this product is not worth using.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the $$$</li>
            <li> The shaver end is quite powerful, beware when cutting longer hairs.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this isn&#x27;t really the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only complaint is no travel case.</li>
            <li> This shaver is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> This one is just not worth the money.</li>
            <li> But trust me its not worth trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned quite a few different trimmers in the past five years.</li>
            <li> do like the multi-capability of this device one end for delicate grooming and the opposite end for longer hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult - at least when you have a belly to look around - to get a  close, safe shave with this product.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish the &amp;#34;floating&amp;#34; head on the shaver</li>
            <li> The only negative on this product is the charge life.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the day or 2 smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the close shave end seems to tug at the hairs quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> For the money, this thing is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is not useful to me.</li>
            <li> Since it was late at night, I opted to simply let it charge overnight.  </li>
            <li> no fun.</li>
            <li> and it was just an average shaver.  </li>
            <li> but I am still out $70 on something that should at least last a  year or so...</li>
            <li> /&gt;That is my only complaint which may or</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the size of the foil head.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the battery dies fast (even when I&#x27;m not using the product for a while, it seems to be already drained) and recharging takes longer than it should.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with some sort of storage case is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is there is no wrist strap attachment</li>
            <li> only downside is that the way the battery works is that it should not be on the charger if it is fully charged lest it slowly kill the battery&#x27;s ability to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my fiancée for Christmas because she wanted something to shave her naughty bits.  </li>
            <li> It would start going slow and stop trimming facial or body hair.</li>
            <li> Even on thick hair, even above the neck (</li>
            <li> I thought it wasn&#x27;t working at all, but then I saw there were a few hairs on it, so obviously it was cutting something, but it didn&#x27;t have much effect.</li>
            <li> Same concept, use some shaving cream and get to work, just go slow or you might do something you will regret.    </li>
            <li> Not cheap so expected</li>
            <li> worthless if you ask me cuz u cant use it for more than 10 mins</li>
            <li> Your skin in this region, however, is extremely soft and extremely thin.</li>
            <li> The shaver part doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I would like and requires multiple passes even when I move slowly.  </li>
            <li> You definitely have to shave every day with this tool, or things get too thick for it to shave.</li>
            <li> only complaint and reason for 4/5 stars is that it is difficult to keep a straight line going since the foil is surrounded by the trimmers and the plastic area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a damn bear, thick coarse lumberjack hair.</li>
            <li> This overly heavy and cumbersome body groomer doesn&#x27;t shave wet hair, even though it&#x27;s shower compatible.</li>
            <li> yeah right, there is no way an electric anything could shave me down there without serious harm, rash, or worse.</li>
            <li> no cuts or pulls and its a little odd then wet it and its all good.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and what i really like if the battery end its will not slow down and annoying u with  </li>
            <li> After the first few seconds this feeling resided and to my delight hair was just falling off like mad into the toilet below me.  </li>
            <li> I never used the trimmer, but this strikes me as odd as if you push too hard when actually trimming</li>
            <li> Not really powerful, but works well without the guard to trim down an already thinning dome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So nice when it goes right, absolutely terrible when it goes wrong.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit scared to use this, especially with previous bad experiences shaving below the neck.</li>
            <li> I usually shave once a week and would like this to reduce my beard down to something my razor can handle...which the trimmer leaves hair slightly too long still.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s get down to the details.</li>
            <li> after u are doing shaving down there use a moisture gel.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and throw down 50 bucks on this.</li>
            <li> This shaver is designed for the neck down.  </li>
            <li> this is a down side of all razors I believe.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower to trim hair \\&quot;down there\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> You can trim it all the way down, or just trim things down to a manageable level.</li>
            <li> I shave from the neck down to the toes just because I can.</li>
            <li> like somehow it snipped the lil hair down below the skin...  </li>
            <li> and you will have to go over it a bunch to get down to even that.    </li>
            <li> if you have a lot of hair then put the trimmer to the number one position and start from there then gradually move down to number four    d)</li>
            <li> so if you plan on using this sporadically you may want to water down the head to remove any dust</li>
            <li> You will notice that you will not sweat as much down there and it will feel cleaner and fresher as you move around during the day.</li>
            <li> but you just need to adjust it down one click.</li>
            <li> I use it to shave from the neck down and haven&#x27;t cut myself not once.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product again down the road when/if it ever wears out.  </li>
            <li> The clipper side trims longer hair to precision lengths (5 settings) down to 3mm and the foil shaver side will give a close shave to any part of the body.</li>
            <li> But......cuts and pulls hair down south.</li>
            <li> I then moved down to the goods and trimmed them down before shaving them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with the shortest setting on the blade guard, working my way down.</li>
            <li> I use this to buzz my head, groom my chest, and all the way down below.  </li>
            <li> , if your like me, you have hair you don&#x27;t want down there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed I haven&#x27;t sweated as much down there, and there is no longer a yucky smell after a day of activity.</li>
            <li> well, it&#x27;s like a turtle shell down town</li>
            <li> This might of course just be down to my technique and I&#x27;ll be adjusting that to see if it makes any difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll break it down:    </li>
            <li> Basically, on the up stroke (against the grain), it rocks so the trimmer clears away any longer hairs and/or fuzz; then on the down stroke, the foil finishes the job.</li>
            <li> The battery life has gone down a bit, but I can still get a the job done on one charge.</li>
            <li> No bogging down and no irritation from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THUMBS DOWN</li>
            <li> , just gets it down to about 1/8 inch?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have not had the \\&quot;nicking\\&quot; issues others have had, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust ANY shaver to get that close \\&quot;down there\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have been using beard trimmers for years to trim down there getting cut all the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes time to trim down thicker and longer hair as the cutter can get clogged.&lt;br</li>
            <li> down the razor or scissors and buy this - your balls will thank you.</li>
            <li> That keeps the counter clutter down.</li>
            <li> I thought the pivoting head might help since us women are a bit curvy down there</li>
            <li> THAT I&#x27;M NOT ALONE WITH NOT LIKING HAIR DOWN THERE.</li>
            <li> Additionally, they said it is for your chest down,</li>
            <li> I can shave everything comfortablly from the neck down.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me and have/had never shaved before down there</li>
            <li> The trimmer side can cut hair down to like 1/8 inch but can also leave hair longer.  </li>
            <li> the bottom trimmer always causes me to bleed if I shave down there when taking the guard off.</li>
            <li> Guys are wimping around saying \\&quot;down there\\&quot; and how scared they were to try it.</li>
            <li> Will defenetly recommend it for does who need some trimming down under.</li>
            <li> You know like down there guys.  </li>
            <li> down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed a trimmer for trimming chest and the areas down under.  </li>
            <li> Well, I´d say it makes your job easier if you wanna shave anything neck and down.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve shaved from the waist down 3 times about 15 mins each session.</li>
            <li> the guard can be removed for clipping down to the skin.  </li>
            <li> extremely well!      </li>
            <li> The other end has a trimmer with an adjustable guard for areas that you might want to leave with a little bit of length, up to about 1/2\\&quot; in length.  </li>
            <li> The level of trust reviewing products and rating them is extremely deceitful, someone needs to be held accountable period!</li>
            <li> When it actually worked:  The trimmer settings don&#x27;t really mean anything because for it to cut</li>
            <li> The razor side is a mean machine, I reckon it could remove bunions at 20 paces if misused.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is a slightly different story, it does the job, but I find I&#x27;m not getting as close a trim as I would like with</li>
            <li> Next time I will probably just go for the BG2020 again, its cheaper, small and does the job!</li>
            <li> This one is a little too sharp for the &amp;#34;boys downstairs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a body groomer don&#x27;t look at any other products, go with this one!</li>
            <li> unless your into cutting your veg basket then go right ahead.</li>
            <li> Takes a little while to charge, i&#x27;d say at the absolute minimum 30 minutes, and that won&#x27;t get you much cutting time, assuming your fruit basket grows thick lush hair.</li>
            <li> The sheer amount of force required to get this shaving head to tilt up and down, much less left and right, is going to guarantee you a very, very painful result.  </li>
            <li> But i think what actually happened was the blades on the shaver part (not the trimmer), just needed to dull up a little.  </li>
            <li> As in previous reviews, we were looking for something specifically for the \\&quot;region down below\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Like any shaver, there is the potential for small knicks, just take it slow and be careful.</li>
            <li> I read a few of the other reviews before deciding to purchase the shaver and when I got it</li>
            <li> Like others I read a few reviews on this and a couple other models.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it comes with a little cleaning brush but nowhere to put it.</li>
            <li> It does shave closely, but as a few other reviews have mentioned, it can cut you regardless of what the manufacturer says.  </li>
            <li> This thing flat out sucks.</li>
            <li> Based on a few other postive ratings, I grabbed this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Put bluntly the caveman look went out with the caveman &amp; I was always afraid of trying the old fashioned razor \\&quot;down there\\&quot; for fairly obvious reasons.  </li>
            <li> The previous version needed a lot of changing the setup, which was a pain.</li>
            <li> It started burning slightly, so I immediately washed off the stuff.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this thing basically shaves as close as regular razor to the skin.</li>
            <li> Battery life is horrid, I&#x27;ve had this for less than a year</li>
            <li> The previous model did this, too, but not quite as often.  </li>
            <li> I took it out of the box, charged it in less time than the directions stated, and started using it immediately.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been happier if Norelco would have omitted the foil shaver end and sold the trimmer for half the price.</li>
            <li> Lit bit of an odd shape  </li>
            <li> it can slightly pinch on occasion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a slight bend in it</li>
            <li> I have used it 3 times since buying it and have not had so much as a slight nick yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The design is enticing because it seems to have a wide range of functionality and is waterproof, but it fails at nearly every task it is designed for.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product has been used less than 5 times and will no longer charge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This also replaces two devices, a razor and a beard trimmer, so it saves space on the counter and one less charger plugged</li>
            <li> I had a previous version of the Bodygroom device.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-After less than 3 minutes from when I shave, NO irritation, NO rashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Cleaning takes less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Just go with one of the previous models, trust me.</li>
            <li> Because you dont have to BUY a product to review it, therefore half the reviews are from the seller or manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In less then 5 m I learned all the features of the groom.    </li>
            <li> After less than 20 uses</li>
            <li> Worked less than 3 months.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, you will need to charge the device for about half a day.</li>
            <li> With the shaving cream you will notice much less tug and pull.    </li>
            <li> It probably takes me 25% less time to shave now, including cleanup - and yes, there is still quite a bit of cleanup.  </li>
            <li> Also on the side with the adjustable trimmer, the motor seems to run at half speed.</li>
            <li> but our previous trimmer couldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore and was drawing blood.    </li>
            <li> The replacement heads don&#x27;t cost a fortune (less than $15).  </li>
            <li> less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery in the unit I had died, and wouldn&#x27;t take a charge after less than a years use.</li>
            <li> Slightly glorified.  </li>
            <li> Makes a slight humming noise though.  </li>
            <li> but no she likes it that I have less hair.</li>
            <li> I give it four and a half stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 of the previous models, both of which i used until the battery could no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Plus, a nick or two I can understand, but seriously, my wound is definitely full-on gash status, people.</li>
            <li> Either my old trimmer was horrible or this one is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The secret was to go really slowly and gently.</li>
            <li> it be prepared for less than 5 minutes of shave time.</li>
            <li> There is a serious internal design flaw with this product.</li>
            <li> B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Philips Norelco Bodygroom Pro Grooming System, Black / Silver]]</li>
            <li> Lasted less than 5 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I bought this product as an upgrade to the previous model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find that the shaver doesn&#x27;t cut quite as close (or quite as good/efficiently) as the previous model.</li>
            <li> My previous BodyGroom had issues with the razor head popping off.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just maintaining those areas, you should be fine, but if you&#x27;ve let them grow out and expect to hit them all in one charge, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I can leave it on the charger for a day and it&#x27;ll work for about a minute and a half.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now hidden.</li>
            <li> Also, the head tilts unpredictably and there is no locking</li>
            <li> I felt like snapping it in half after 20 minutes of basically brushing my hair out tonight.</li>
            <li> I had previously owned the Philips Norelco BG2020 BodyGroom.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a black pushbutton on the guide that breaks off after a while.</li>
            <li> I also got a slight burning sensation in the area where I was working.  </li>
            <li> It effortlessly trimmed my man areas in less than 10 minutes with no cuts or pain.</li>
            <li> odd thing is the noise it makes, thus 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> like there&#x27;s a slight ring in your ears.  </li>
            <li> It a typical razor.</li>
            <li> none the less.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of hairy bottom and every time I used the previous model, I had the smoothest shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn on my review, because I love the way the shaver works, but the charger is such miserable engineering, I have to go with two stars -</li>
            <li> Occasionally it will miss some hairs, and it can be really difficult to cut them for some reason,  but the disparity between the hair length isn&#x27;t that big.</li>
            <li> Less chance of razor burn.</li>
            <li> The head is a typical electric razor head with shears on either side.  </li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t incur any serious injury, I was cut several times while attempting to use this device.  </li>
            <li> It charges very quickly (in less than an hour even though charging time says an hour).</li>
            <li> Quite a few of the negative reviews referred to very short battery life.  </li>
            <li> It lasts half of what it says</li>
            <li> , previously i had philips norelco bodygroom(still have it),</li>
            <li> only bummer is the fact that the charger is quite big and that will be difficult to carry around when traveling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It charges in hour or less</li>
            <li> However, the one main problem still remains with BG series shaver, use the blade at slightly weird angle and the attachment comes off.</li>
            <li> Decent trimmer, but battery failed within 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Cons:  Master of none  kinda big which makes it somewhat difficult to maneuver in tight spaces such as between the legs</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using it on an area where the skin is loose (think you know where I mean), &amp;#34;stretch&amp;#34; the skin moderately tight with one hand while using the shaver with the other.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing I can say is that the pivoting head angle was kind of awkward and in some areas it did not give me a close shave.</li>
            <li> $75 dollars and a full year of intermittent (and painful)</li>
            <li> Common sense goes a long way when using a product like this</li>
            <li> The adjustable head is convenient in that you do not have to mess with attachments.  </li>
            <li> Every product before this would cut me and leave me with a mess to deal with.  </li>
            <li> minor complaint</li>
            <li> The battery life was not good to begin with, only getting one-use before it had to be charged again.</li>
            <li> If I had one complaint it would be that the level 1 on the guard cuts too long.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was very skeptical about how well it would work on \\&quot;the fun zone\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> other end, the \\&quot;clipper\\&quot; end, is also performs poor, especially with the guard on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to the design of the trimmer, it does not have a pointy end and it makes it some times difficult to trim near ears.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll get you down past stubble, but in places like your neck and other areas, it&#x27;s not going to do what you&#x27;re hoping it</li>
            <li> And I have an electric face razor with a adjustable trimmer to shave all or a little less than all the hair.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find a battery solution that doesn&#x27;t require one to run down the battery till it&#x27;s completely dead before you can charge it again?  </li>
            <li> (I nicked myself down there once a few months ago), you can ensure that you get an even cut anywhere.  </li>
            <li> They recommend that once or twice a year you run the unit all the way down to a dead battery and then recharge it.  </li>
            <li> but it will do a lot of the heavy lifting down there.</li>
            <li> Because of how the trimmer sections stick out on the shaver end, I do not see how you can shave in any area that is tight without nicking yourself with the trimmer sections.</li>
            <li> but where those two trimmers are seems to make the shaver part unusable in tight areas, which means seeing blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of how the trimmer sections stick out on the shaver end, I do not see how you can shave in any area that is tight without nicking yourself with the trimmer sections.  </li>
            <li> but where those two trimmers are seems to make the shaver part unusable in tight areas, which means seeing blood.    </li>
            <li> Had to yank the hair out tight for it to buzz it.</li>
            <li> Even with holding the skin of my scrotum tight, this shaver ended up snagging my skin and ripping my skin causing bleeding.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lot less messy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the instructions leaflet quite bewildering and confusing, not helped by such small print and diagrams, and that was with my reading glasses perched across my snozzle.  </li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews on this website and I&#x27;m not really surprised by the negative reviews though, so let me list a few of my thoughts on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started shaving down there maybe a year ago and finally got tired of the upkeep, so I quit grooming and boy</li>
            <li> I was tired of the same waxing procedures down there not to mention how time consuming and excruciating the pain could be at times.</li>
            <li> It cuts course, thick pubic hair in a single stroke.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair with a bald-fade, so I have little use for it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one after having other Philips groomers in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for a little over a week now and</li>
            <li> The idea of razors in my man zones made me a little uneasy.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about using it on my balls and still haven&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It has a little weight to it</li>
            <li> I tried a little manscaping and guess what?</li>
            <li> Women prefer a little \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; even if they don&#x27;t tell you.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because of the price.</li>
            <li> Contacted Philips product support who offered little insight, conceding almost immediately that the shaver must be defective.      </li>
            <li> Have you gotten a little ding from the barber?  </li>
            <li> this little tool, I have yet to have a problem.</li>
            <li> I was in the hospital for a little over a month</li>
            <li> The trimmer-guard thingy cuts hair a little longer than the Whal</li>
            <li> it lasted me a little over a year, but it started plucking hairs a little over 7 months.&lt;br /&gt;the battery started crapping out on me after about 4 months, and it lasted a little over 10 minutes before it needed a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;find something else</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with a little background.</li>
            <li> Wish the guard was a little stiffer, but</li>
            <li> , my guess is that you&#x27;ll like this little diddy.</li>
            <li> hope this review gives you some insight and help with your choice, and a little knowledge from an unbiased owner.</li>
            <li> hope this review gives you some insight and help with your choice, and a little knowledge from an unbiased owner.</li>
            <li> This little gadget does everything it says it can.  </li>
            <li> so I can trim as much or as little as I please.</li>
            <li> I wish the trimmer part was a little wider.  </li>
            <li> After reading a couple of the customer reviews I was a little concerned regarding performance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m neither disappointed nor overly excited about the product..</li>
            <li> it sounded a little aggressive</li>
            <li> #1: I&#x27;ve been using this about once a week (or every other week) for the past year.</li>
            <li> It fell apart after 4 years of little use.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it, Takes off hair quickly,but we finish of with triple head for a little closer cut.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> and it has the shaver at one end and the trimmer at the other (no more head changing)</li>
            <li> I mad a funny.</li>
            <li> The shaving size is a little sub-par however.</li>
            <li> Yes you have to take your time but when your shaving your balls don&#x27;t you always take a little time?</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a little heavy-handed).</li>
            <li> The trimmer guard is attached to the unit with a little \\&quot;push lever\\&quot; that slides up and clicks in place to get the setting you want.</li>
            <li> Not just a little bit hairy, like hunted for my pelt hairy.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, being someone who likes to grow out the beard a little before shaving again, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it considering the hassle of cleaning up after each shave from the Duel-End Design.</li>
            <li> If you like to grow it out a little like myself, you may want to think again.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s sting is little use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a little hesitant.</li>
            <li> Let it glide with just a little bit of force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purchased to trim body hair and to do a little manscaping.  </li>
            <li> BUT for the groin area that takes a little practice if you are doing it yourself.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried, picked this over a mangroomer.  </li>
            <li> the charging stand is a little flimsy, but works</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was a little concerned about buying this groomer, given some of the reviewers</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I wanted to something to serve as a beard trimmer for the little bit of the year when I need that and as a shaver for the majority of the time.  </li>
            <li> would be a little smoother.</li>
            <li> The little trimmers on the shaver side help prevents snags of longer hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed by the size of the razor, I have an older Phillips one that is quite a bit smaller, and I&#x27;m sad that the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> The second one after just a few months got really weak which means pulled hairs.  </li>
            <li> I found myself going back to my old ugly looking Wahl clippers that i purchased from Walmart for half the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no added value here over the $30 Mangroomer and this shaver is rather large and awkward in hand.</li>
            <li> The charging stand however is a little annoying as the shaver has to be placed a certain direction/way in it, not a big deal but a con,</li>
            <li> I have owned the groomer for a little over 3 months now, and have used it every few days to keep up with hair growth.  </li>
            <li> once again they didn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
            <li> Will snag loose skin if ya know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> I went very slowly, followed the instructions, and did all the necessary prep.</li>
            <li> No thanks!!!</li>
            <li> If you press too hard they will pinch you, but they don&#x27;t draw blood or break the skin, if you are being careful and paying attention.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll take a full-charge, plus another partial charge (I&#x27;ve found this out the hard way).</li>
            <li> but I mean even for the body trim part unless your chest hair is a forest it hard to pin down hair that is laying flat with this trimmer end.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend has very thick coarse hair and would have to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> If rubbing something sharp across your family jewels makes you cross your legs in terror, buy one of the less expensive models like the BG2038 or BG2028.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been having problems finding a good shaver for bikini line since i hate using a regular razor, this def gives you bad razor burn</li>
            <li> Clearly they are buying inferior batteries or it&#x27;s a lousy charging circuit.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s charged, the cutting mechanisms work very well, with no snags or problems on my ginger neckbeard.</li>
            <li> It is delicate enough to shave delicate areas as well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical like many people and scared of it cutting me</li>
            <li> You would think that when you pop the unit into the base it would slide or fall out, but it grips it firmly and the indicator light lets you know</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Now it runs out of power after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> This product is literally designed to die in a few years forcing another purchase.</li>
            <li> It has become my everyday shaver.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money,,,,,</li>
            <li> If I am gonna put the stand on my counter, then why would I want to plug my shaver in if its not gonna charge unless its dead?</li>
            <li> If I am gonna put the stand on my counter, then why would I want to plug my shaver in if its not gonna charge unless its dead?</li>
            <li> I nicked myself a few times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come close a few times.</li>
            <li> The close skin trimmer, takes a quite few passes to get close, but not that close.</li>
            <li> then it blinks green again to indicate it&#x27;s charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These days I have to swap the AAA batteries out when they go dead since I can&#x27;t get the unit to charge anymore.  </li>
            <li> Be careful and slow in some areas</li>
            <li> months later and tired of using bics i thought id try it again...</li>
            <li> what a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;using</li>
            <li> but sometimes I have to put it in its cradle a few time or even turn it on and off and then put it in the charging cradle to get it to charge.  </li>
            <li> After a few months, however, the battery life began to drop off.</li>
            <li> After seeing a few ads and reviews of this Norelco I decided to use the Amazon credit I had and give it a shot.     </li>
            <li> After reading the instructions, since I had never used an electric razor, I decided to wait a few days to shave.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve used an electric trimmer on my manhood for a few years and have never had a trimmer cut me like this one.</li>
            <li> Also since I&#x27;ve seen the question asked a few times the manual does state that this should not be used on your face.     </li>
            <li> You have to remember never to charge it untill the battery is totally dead.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on the $15 or even $30 trimmers.</li>
            <li> I use the foil end for my balls and the clipper with attachment end for just below my waste line.</li>
            <li> Shaves even longer chest and back hair without pulling or irritating the skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried using a regular razor last week, which left me with horrible razor bumps on my chest and skin below the belly, but above the family jewels.  </li>
            <li> So now the razor is worse than a simple razor blade.  </li>
            <li> : I had read a number of reviews here saying the buzzer would stop holding a charge after a few weeks, but there seemed to be a lot of disagreement.  </li>
            <li> I followed instruction off owners manual, but noted that the green LED indicator would not go on while charging.  </li>
            <li> This is not an electric trimmer attached to a razor blade, what a sham.</li>
            <li> So I immediately put it on the charger and wait impatiently for 8 hours to test it out.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not perfectly smooth</li>
            <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
            <li> You have to pull with a firm grip.  </li>
            <li> Waste  of money</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> Had it for about a year now and the battery is basically dead.  </li>
            <li> My Phillips body-groomer died a few weeks ago after over 4 years of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble and just get this one, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Bought this a few months ago and it works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> Given it a few whirls now.</li>
            <li> The shaver pulled a few whiskers out but didn&#x27;t cut anything.</li>
            <li> but I am not naturally smooth either...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months</li>
            <li> Battery lasted a few months, and did not hold any charge after 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> Its not a smooth or as painfree as I would like.</li>
            <li> Worse, with epilating, when the hairs start growing back, they tend to curl up under the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery no longer holds a charge longer than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I cut myself a few times using this razor.  </li>
            <li> Well either way, a few months of use and this thing started to hold about a 2 minute charge MAX.</li>
            <li> product was not stored in harsh environments, always inside the bathroom drawer, away from harmful elements.</li>
            <li> Not even stubble left behind.</li>
            <li> SENT BACK POOR QUALITY</li>
            <li> Since I have this machine, I forgot about the trouble of shaving body parts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not brave enough to try to use this on my butt crack.</li>
            <li> We broke up a few months ago</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bit a few times, but no blood.  </li>
            <li> I do not use this everyday, so I know that factors in there somewhere.</li>
            <li> Been using the Bodygroom for a few months now</li>
            <li> I use this for body grooming as well as shaving my face with it every day as it isn&#x27;t as harsh as a strait razor.</li>
            <li> I have given the Norelco Bodygroom 2040 a Five star rating based upon the results I have achieved through a few occasions of use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s dead in the water as of 4 months ago.  </li>
            <li> and this thing is totally dead.</li>
            <li> The battery issues just kept getting worse and in turn caused me to constantly lower my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this thing is totally dead.</li>
            <li> The battery issues just kept getting worse and in turn caused me to constantly lower my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had two of these trimmers, and while they both work well for trimming and maintaining unruly body hair, they WILL lose their ability to hold a charge within a few months.  </li>
            <li> I bought two, but for some reason the second one&#x27;s battery life was much worse.</li>
            <li> However the shaver blade would fall apart after a few months</li>
            <li> This thing worked a few times for me for head shaving and body trimming.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t travel with the box and after a few weeks my wife had already thrown it out, so I can&#x27;t return this item now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times a week for almost 2 years.</li>
            <li> After reading a few articles and looking at the competition today (I was thinking of upgrading)</li>
            <li> It has become my everyday shaver</li>
            <li> As far as the trimmer goes, it&#x27;s borderline useless.  </li>
            <li> Lastly and the most annoying thing for me is that you have to charge via the charging dock, you can&#x27;t plug the power supply directly to the trimmer, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> I bought this Philips BG2040 groomer by Norelco on August 17th, 2010 the\\&quot;green</li>
            <li> It is dead.</li>
            <li> I dont know if it&#x27;s going to destroy my privates, did not buy it for that..</li>
            <li> I saw that the performance decreased last year I did change the foil</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I got few peaces of these machine, one for me and rest as a presents.</li>
            <li> If you go slowly, and are careful to pull the skin taut ahead of where you are shaving, then there are no nicks, period.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Be careful when using on your delicate areas - the way it removes hair on the foil side is literally by ripping it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend buying a heavy duty hair clipper and then using attachments to get the desired look you want.</li>
            <li> i say its a waste of money</li>
            <li> Which wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if you kept it plugged in all the time, but I don&#x27;t have the counter space or the need to waste electric.  </li>
            <li> ; batteries myself as a few others have to see if I can salvage some life out of this thing but</li>
            <li> Takes a few passes but it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, it would routinely turn on by itself, in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> So its yet another thing cluttering up either your drawer or countertop, would prefer if the charger plugged directly in, the stand is cheesy.</li>
            <li> This is not comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I have had it a few years now</li>
            <li> Although it says it&#x27;s not to be used for face shaving, I&#x27;ve used a few times with 3 in 1 liquid soap from Nivea for Men.</li>
            <li> A few buyers stated that it pulled hairs out, but anyone who has used an electric razor knows that there is some pulling.</li>
            <li> Have used this product three time and it is dead, like a car out of gas.</li>
            <li> (And yes, I&#x27;m a guy, so that could have been messy and traumatic).&lt;br</li>
            <li> pro is not smooth at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal though.   </li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but the engineers should have thought out the ergonomics of the on-off switches.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> I usually use a Beard trimmer to shave down to stubble.</li>
            <li> The room I now have in my pants is quite unbelievable without having Dr. J living down there.</li>
            <li> I usually trim down chest, arm and &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; and have no problems.</li>
            <li> Also it was a little confusing in that one end is used one way and the other end is used another way as you will see in the directions.</li>
            <li> There are some odd angles down there that make it hard to bring the trimmer across the skin.</li>
            <li> I normally used the Schick Hydro for my face, chest, arm pits and abdomen though I found it quite inconvenient to always having to put on my shaving lotion, I use Jack Black, but with this I just turn it on and do my shaving.</li>
            <li> Even in the stories that result in a non-mutilated and less hairy ending, complaints of excessive itchiness for days to weeks are present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, this is enough to be scratchy and also tug on undergarments, making it extremely itchy and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> especially when putting something sharp in that area is scary...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had one other, which was basically useless.</li>
            <li> but I believe that was due to misuse (pressing too hard).</li>
            <li> my other razors don&#x27;t have to work so hard.</li>
            <li> it is hard to trim a beard without hitting other hairs and messing up.</li>
            <li> The shaver worked rather well (at cutting hair), and this is the key, in flat areas.</li>
            <li> I basically went from long to short since I was a little nervous cutting it with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Between shaving with a razor and using a facial hair trimmer, I had essentially scared myself away from the thought of any body hair maintenance, despite my loathing of the weird scraggly creepy long chest and armpit hair I have inherited.</li>
            <li> Note I was careful not to push down very hard trimming my member and the boys.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product I failed to read the instruction to completely charge it, and I had a bad experience.</li>
            <li> The other negative is that you can&#x27;t use this while its charging or plugged in.</li>
            <li> The worst part is the way it was designed the battery compartment on the inside within the razor is specifically designed to be too small to fit your standard AAA batteries.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to mention the make of the other one for negative publicity</li>
            <li> Get some shaving cream and with your other hand help flatten out the skin of your jewels and slowly move over it.</li>
            <li> If I move the trimmer slowly or use the other end to pre-trim I don&#x27;t tug any hair.</li>
            <li> I like to leave a little strip on hair in certain places and getting a symmetrical cut is nearly impossible using just the foil end.  </li>
            <li> Let me the first to say that I don&#x27;t understand the few bad reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really worried about cutting myself, and there&#x27;s a lot less razor burn than regular razors.</li>
            <li> There is also no easy access to the battery</li>
            <li> As a result, the weight of the groomer is enough for cutting the long hairs by side trimmers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very hairy guy, but that jungle can seriously get out of control.</li>
            <li> If you look on either side of the main cutting foil you will see unguarded trimmers.  </li>
            <li> it seemed quit tame and  </li>
            <li> it pulled my hair, very uncomfortable and also left a mark on the lower private area,</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to get all the private area shaved as it doesn&#x27;t cut all the hair down there.</li>
            <li> And the people saying this is a poor product because they cut themselves in their crotch region, are just inexperienced in trimming the hair down there.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> It makes maneuvering awkward when trying to use it on your sensitive areas down below.</li>
            <li> This is NOT true!  </li>
            <li> I also had it &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; me down under which is not very pleasant</li>
            <li> The big problem, however, is that it does an awful job, completely missing hairs and entire patches and not providing nearly as close a shave as I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nigh impossible to reach my entire back.  </li>
            <li> Then came the hard part: getting the hair down there to a close-shave finish.  </li>
            <li> That makes it hard to work on trimming down stubble without grazing into your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I found out if you press down too hard</li>
            <li> I returned the first because it was so bad</li>
            <li> but the battery life is pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> the trimmer was next to useless as it did an uneven choppy job.</li>
            <li> Also I felt the battery life was poor &amp; charging took a long time.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the same is not true for the trimmer when it comes to the testicles - you will get nicks and they will hurt.  </li>
            <li> That was a BAD move - because the plastic guard has it&#x27;s guard wings too far apart, it allows loose skin to get in between and the blade is not built for \\&quot;bare\\&quot; shaving...</li>
            <li> I started off slowly, keeping any and all skin taught so as to not let the saggy skin down there get wedged between any blades.  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have course or thick hair down there</li>
            <li> Despite all the negative comments who the people must have had a really tough personal problem when it comes to hair.</li>
            <li> And the mere idea of hot wax near my boys is terrifying enough, so that&#x27;s out.</li>
            <li> the next it has less power and bogging down, resulting in pulling your hair instead of cutting it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been sick of using blades for shaving for some time and wanted something that I could use quickly and easily in less time and with less mess, and sadly, I&#x27;m still searching.  </li>
            <li> Thinking about getting a new blade set for it here on Amazon after all the cutting</li>
            <li> Yet this new one came out biting and cutting from day one.</li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed in that I could not acheive the &#x27;shaved&#x27; or wax look right after using this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I should have read the bad reviews more.</li>
            <li> One time I had gotten a competitors brand razor and had a bad experience with it,so went back to Norelco Brand and haven&#x27;t left.</li>
            <li> I had bad experience with shavers and body groomers earlier, but wanted to give them another shot and researched quite a lot, reading all the reviews about different groomers.</li>
            <li> the charging station is a pretty slick design that doesn&#x27;t look bad on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, without the side trimmers, you can not trim long hairs, and before anything else,you have to cut the long hairs with a scissor which is dangerous, and it takes time.</li>
            <li> Too bad I wasted so much money on this one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it falls short in a few areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a real good close shave, but I&#x27;m not a businessman</li>
            <li> I have only seen some reviews about it being painful, my experience is just the opposite.</li>
            <li> If you just glide at a pace just slightly faster than a slow pace, the problem is solved.  </li>
            <li> , they need to include another one that is about half as thick, even on</li>
            <li> Yes it was covered in black thick pubic hair after I unboxed it.</li>
            <li> I can use it in the shower so no more mess!</li>
            <li> One word of caution - don&#x27;t press too hard to try and get too tight.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this unit recently and was extremely disappointed that it broke after using it only a few times.      </li>
            <li> I was looking at myself in a mirror one evening, and it finally truly occurred to me that having neglected shaving my nether regions for 24 years, it was really rather nasty and unruly down there.  </li>
            <li> Since they&#x27;re a bit sloppy and tend to miss things, you want your hairs dry and</li>
            <li> Big, awkward, sharp points on trimmer head, does not trim close.</li>
            <li> IF SHAVING YOUR PRIVATES, PULL SKIN A LITTLE TO TIGHTEN, GO SLOW.</li>
            <li> Despite very little use and fewer than a dozen charge cycles, this thing won&#x27;t recharge.</li>
            <li> Although it is a bit tough to use when skin is wet</li>
            <li> While I was shaving my chest with the shaver part, it was a little difficult because my chest hair was about 1 inch long.</li>
            <li> After buying at least a dozen groomers that I was never very satisfied with, I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Too bad, I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong, above or below the neck.</li>
            <li> Ah, the past.    </li>
            <li> neglected to shave the past week because I was waiting on delivery of this item.</li>
            <li> -Not able to use the shaver while plugged in  -Not able to leave the shaver in charger overnight (24 hours)    </li>
            <li> no, but it is small, she said.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s an OK trimmer, but it&#x27;s the worst one</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s an OK trimmer, but it&#x27;s the worst one I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> My old one stopped holding a charge and the cutting heads became exposed and started to cut my skin (after about 4 years), so it was time to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The unit gets no more than 3-4 minutes of use now before going dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure if it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge or if it isn&#x27;t charging all the way up.  </li>
            <li> I had researched the Norelco body groomers over the past year or so.  </li>
            <li> you want to leave a small length of hair.</li>
            <li> I usually use the blade guard on 1 to do this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magic.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too difficult to work the shaver to get your back without anyone&#x27;s help.</li>
            <li> I had purchased cheaper groomers in the past but they had not worked well.</li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> Pulls hair, not sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with my purchase for two reasons.</li>
            <li> This body groomer works as, if not better than, advertised.</li>
            <li> as usual.</li>
            <li> never has \\&quot;knicks\\&quot; like past shavers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> , you cannot even replace the battery, and past the two year warranty, you are s</li>
            <li> which seemed excessive considering what I paid for the unit.  </li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m too lazy to research the competition.</li>
            <li> not sure why it says to never use on the face, but I listened &amp; never have.</li>
            <li> &gt;:/  </li>
            <li> The foil head can get into small areas.</li>
            <li> I purchased the first one in a Walmart if I recall, and after one year of use the battery failed, like it didn&#x27;t charge at times and it turned on by itself suddenly (creepy), so I threw it away.</li>
            <li> would however caution that it does sometimes cut if not using the product properly or hitting a difficult spot/angle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> I was already past the refund date so might as well.</li>
            <li> and then I get in trouble and that sucks.</li>
            <li> If I transport it, it usually needs to be charged.</li>
            <li> I purchased this not sure what to expect</li>
            <li> I was concerned with how expensive the replacement blade was, but it suggest changing it only once a</li>
            <li> If your not satisfied, just return it.</li>
            <li> This past weekend, I burned myself removing it from the charger and tonight I contacted Norelco for warranty service.</li>
            <li> The past 6 months</li>
            <li> Im not sure....</li>
            <li> The shaver on this product has a small beard trimmer blade on either side of the foil shaver.</li>
            <li> You cant leave them on the charger or they will fail to hold a charge in the future and become paper weights.</li>
            <li> that means no more changing heads and risking parts breaking on you.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m not sure how well this would work for a woman shaving her legs.</li>
            <li> but id have to bring that and my electric razor which is pointless.</li>
            <li> Sadly, those reviews are likely written by interns at Norelco.</li>
            <li> but I wound run over a small 2in area over and over and over</li>
            <li> not sure about the one hour charge claim.</li>
            <li> While attempting to remove the foil cutter, the plastic that mounts to the cutter on the left side cracked, rendering the shaving/close proximity trimming side of the groomer useless.  </li>
            <li> However,  not sure if you&#x27;d want to use something on your face that you&#x27;ll use on your junk too.</li>
            <li> tried to use this item more than a few times and now merely wish I could pass it on to someone I hate</li>
            <li> Totally unacceptable for a product this expensive.</li>
            <li> The shaving area is small, so you have to pay attention to how it is used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through two of these units over the past three years.</li>
            <li> so I was not sure about getting this brand</li>
            <li> No more cuts.</li>
            <li> and I now know I was missing out!</li>
            <li> This seems to work as well as that device if not better.</li>
            <li> Well, I read the reviews first and can&#x27;t say I was disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I was past the warantee period...  </li>
            <li> , I think that&#x27;s because I wasn&#x27;t pulling the skin taught like I usually do.</li>
            <li> But after dreading too long the process of using a regular trimmer to get a sub-par and often painful result, I splurged for the BodyGroom Pro.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for the past week now</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One point to notice: this is a small appliance with small motors</li>
            <li> I shave my legs, arms, small area on my chest, and pubic region about every three weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the battery life though, but</li>
            <li> I find this a bit difficult while trying to move the shaver around at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one did not work for me as there was not enough power nor speed to shave body hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had the same problem with the replacement unit after a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I usually avoid using this</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because a past reviewer stated that it pulled hair instead it was shaving.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure about the razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to reach back.</li>
            <li> is a small fraction of what it used to take.</li>
            <li> the shaving head is useless for facial shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> entire thing is almost useless for pubic shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you buy this to do your groin area, underarms, or small areas</li>
            <li> No more unsightly rash or hair.  </li>
            <li> Not sure this will be a lifestyle change for me</li>
            <li> It has been charging for past 5 hours and when I start using it it runs out in like 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> You should avoid this shaver unless you like to live dangerously and enjoy a little bloody pain every now and then !!</li>
            <li> Needless to say when i began to use this unit I was very very very very very careful like i am with other items.</li>
            <li> right at the base of my penis that won&#x27;t stop bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the technology used because it can not easily cut you even if you are clumsy when using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very, very careful with how I used the groomer and very slowly.</li>
            <li> the trimmer on the revers side works well, but the head on it is very narrow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very few hair-snagging issues with it, which my body is thankful for.</li>
            <li> NO nicks or cuts, and a close shave with very few passes needed.</li>
            <li> They make the shave very messy (they cut the hairs before the shaver causing hair to go</li>
            <li> The only caution is that the little teeth that feed hair into the cutting head are metal and they will seize any skin wrinkles and they will cut and/or tear tender skin.</li>
            <li> The having to charge it up was a little annoying however the charge lasted for me the whole time I used it (about 20 minutes at a time).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very difficult to use in sensitive areas!</li>
            <li> However, the annoying thing is that you have to shave over the same areas multiple times.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my beard is took thick and too coarse for this razor.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, is why they had to make the charger cradle so complicated.</li>
            <li> Also the cutters don&#x27;t cut very well since the plastic mechanism which the cutters/foil shaver sit it to allow it to roll ends up getting in the way of cutting hair since it rolls unnecessarily into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes a mess unless I use it outside (awkward), and that sucks.</li>
            <li> However, the electric shaver is not very good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not very good at getting edges</li>
            <li> The battery life was never very good though.  </li>
            <li> Also using a normal electric razor can be painful with the possibility of cuts.  </li>
            <li> I also like the long design of the instrument, it allows you to reach difficult places.&lt;br</li>
            <li> * not suitable for chest hair - razor preferred.</li>
            <li> but nothing serious, ill no what not to do next time I shave.</li>
            <li> Not great for my goatee as it doesn&#x27;t precision shave to trim down some areas.</li>
            <li> pathetic battery is the main design flaw and they need a battery that will actually last.</li>
            <li> Four stars just because the trimmer is a little too weak compared to the shaver, still works though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to actually shave down there because the few times I did it, oh my goodness, worse decision ever!!!</li>
            <li> The beard/body hair trimmer is disappointing and kills the battery, the stop that locks the trimmer height easily slips to a lower setting, providing disastrous results.</li>
            <li> It will be hard to cut oneself with this norelco product.</li>
            <li> Hit myself with a couple test spots without hardly any pressure.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just hard to use around the corner.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be hard pressed to hurt yourself with this.</li>
            <li> (though, it can still cut you if you hard press it without a guard).  </li>
            <li> Moreover, the trimming head is hard to handle and my wrists start hurting after a while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Being hit hard with the bush from puberty</li>
            <li> Other reviewers were correct, it grabbed my skin and gave me a pretty nasty gash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lessons learned from use:  don&#x27;t press the shaver hard against the skin.  </li>
            <li> Now after 5 months, the blade is so dull it wont cut hair.  </li>
            <li> Hardly acceptable.</li>
            <li> Using a AA instead is hard because the originals don&#x27;t have the raised terminal (nub) and you need to somehow connect two of them together.</li>
            <li> It helps you groom your privates to perfection and those hard to reach areas of your body.</li>
            <li> Hard to put in the charger correctly.</li>
            <li> This is a little irritating in some of the tighter spaces I find myself grooming in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Norelco product for at least 2 years now.  </li>
            <li> and it loses a charge almost immediately</li>
            <li> At least its not all plastic.</li>
            <li> At least, I haven&#x27;t managed to.</li>
            <li> The Shaving Head sucks, but maybe all electric shaving heads suck</li>
            <li> Tried the delicate parts too with the shaving foil end.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Ouch!\\&quot; if you remove the trimming length adjusting unit while doing delicate areas.  </li>
            <li> Lasts for at least one hr.  </li>
            <li> I order from amazon at least a couple times a month.</li>
            <li> This was a total disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> At least then, I could still use the damn thing.</li>
            <li> I would return it but based on what people use it for its just rude.</li>
            <li> I still use it to shave my facial hair, but it is a bit awkward.</li>
            <li> and it sucks, however with this shaver I have not gotten any irritation</li>
            <li> Which meant that I accidentally turned off the groomer at least 4-5 times while shaving.  </li>
            <li> but if not at least I can give warning so you will at least be prepared.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Verdict: disappointing, especially at the price!</li>
            <li> I guess it could be longer, or maybe I just need to do yoga (that sucks).</li>
            <li> A razor can&#x27;t reach the back; is inefficient on longer hair like arms and is dangerous in--ah--certain places.  </li>
            <li> Minus 1 star because the trimmer almost useless.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that this thing is over hyped.....</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t see any negative point in machine .</li>
            <li> no razor burns in delicate areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof -- at least shower-proof which is what I need.</li>
            <li> At least thats what my friend told me</li>
            <li> negative is the charging set up.  </li>
            <li> At least on one end.</li>
            <li> At least now i have a trimmer i can use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2 trimmer sucks because it pulls hair</li>
            <li> sucks.</li>
            <li> but at least it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another negative: you&#x27;d have to place the trimmer on the holder in order to charge it -</li>
            <li> so please take my negative review with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li> -tip: For delicate areas, take your time.</li>
            <li> But the actual grooming was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Seems a regular razor is easier and faster and just as dangerous with a cheaper price tag.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say anything negative about it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Started clipping hair and kept at it with the only nicks coming when the razor was turned to an awkward angle so that the clippers were not running squarely against the skin.  </li>
            <li> And now it just doesnt charge at all and its too late to return it</li>
            <li> i took things slow and guess what happened, the thing chewed into my skin again.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s thick hair either.</li>
            <li> Remember, the tradeoff is to be forced to make a couple passes -</li>
            <li> Slow to use.</li>
            <li> I shave maybe once every 1 or 2 weeks, not because my hair grows slow, but because it just takes a while</li>
            <li> or maybe it&#x27;s because of my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Start slow...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll like this razor to get rid of the thick stuff...</li>
            <li> but i have to be slow with it.</li>
            <li> I decided I would just go for it (slowly of course).</li>
            <li> Slow and controlled movements are the way to go.</li>
            <li> shall we say &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; areas without having to go so slow that it takes</li>
            <li> I would suggest reading the instructions before using this Groomer start off slow until you get a feel for it.</li>
            <li> Just go slow</li>
            <li> Keep slowly.</li>
            <li> Just take it slow and after a couple of shaves your body gets used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say be slow and patient and you will get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I actually really like the shaver itself, but the charging issue is really annoying.   </li>
            <li> My chest hair is not that thick either.</li>
            <li> Just go slow and take your time.  </li>
            <li> So go slow.</li>
            <li> Eventually the power just starts to give and it slowly dies before I am done using it in one session.</li>
            <li> slow -trim</li>
            <li> The detent on the lengths on the clipper side is a little sloppy, it seems to just rely on the tension of some flimsy plastic, and has dropped from a 2 to a 1 mid-shave a couple times (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that the battery is not user-replaceable and I have to buy a new trimmer.    </li>
            <li> It works like charm, especially down there.</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean .</li>
            <li> this mean there is time also to work like 10 min</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers here, get this razor ASAP, you won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> And I mean ALL OVER.</li>
            <li> and when I say accustomed I mean your skin.  </li>
            <li> and by everywhere I mean everywhere.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money do not purchase this item,does not perform as advertised!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a product that is a must have if you cannot stand having excessive and unwanted body hair!</li>
            <li> mean)...</li>
            <li> With this product you can shave anywhere, and I mean ANYWHERE and not worry about cuts.</li>
            <li> and i mean all over.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it still leaves a small amount of stubble behind (at least stubble that you can feel).</li>
            <li> The battery life is questionable because during a 10 min shave is seems like the speed is getting worse as if battery was getting weaker, so there may be some problems with the battery in the long term and there is no option to use it with a cable.</li>
            <li> Very scary to use the trimmer edge around the ladybits, but if you go slowly and angle properly you shan&#x27;t get nicked.</li>
            <li> While I have not suffered as cruelly as documented by other reviewers (in particular Matt, who wrote a review and Whitney, who commented on that review...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;d be a big, bloody mess.</li>
            <li> leaving the choice of a 5 day long beard, or an awkward stubble if i took the attachment off</li>
            <li> The diagram is very vague but the directions do mention to hold the shaving head from the plastic housing only.  </li>
            <li> If you have just the slightest wrong angle, it will nick ya down there and make you say things you shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> be too worried about the scary factor of going down there with an electric trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve upgraded the stars from 3 to four base on the new one and the year of use with no problems.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll cut the hair down to around a mm high, but this looks absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving the balls is a serious business and this is not up to the challenge.</li>
            <li> No more blade razors and no more expensive powered blade razors.</li>
            <li> Seriously, Norelco...???  </li>
            <li> Both the Norelco BG2040 body trimmer and the Norelco QT4070 beard trimmer have a serious design flaw: the comb setting doesn&#x27;t lock.  </li>
            <li> But seriously, be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ridiculous thing can&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to have both operating at the same time.</li>
            <li> im serious.</li>
            <li> It is so impossible to open that it broke a box cutter as I tried to cut along Norelco&#x27;s &amp;#34;cut here&amp;#34; line.</li>
            <li> It seriously does not give you any cuts.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like any other electric razor, the blades do get dull cutting courser</li>
            <li> BUT, for my unit at least, the battery life is an extreme disappointment.</li>
            <li> Cradle and inability to shave while plugged to an adapter makes me a little worried, my experience with batteries in rechargeable shaving machines is that they tend to fail after a while.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit wary of the trimmers on the sides of the shaver section because in the picture they kinda stick out.</li>
            <li> little bit on the expensive side</li>
            <li> It works fantastically, even on my tough thick hair.</li>
            <li> I was an adament shaver of my intimate area, but hated the razor burn shaving would leave me with.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t found anything else that shaves without causing nicking and bleeding in that area; I did get a few pinches with this but no bleeding.</li>
            <li> If you desire a close trim this is not a good product.</li>
            <li> Just a few shaves in and I have yet to find anything wrong or anything I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Not a good product .</li>
            <li> If you want to shave close and be bare in all your unholiest places, then I think you&#x27;ll be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> have made the product useless within a few months both times.</li>
            <li> I hated is so much.. NOT RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> , it was low on power and made shaving my head painful and laborious.</li>
            <li> I think the issue is that the parts have a lot of friction and it causes it to have to work harder to move the cutting head.</li>
            <li> Not a good choice for me.  </li>
            <li> Other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried in the past have had a tendency or nicking the skin, which can be a bit painful.</li>
            <li> In the past I used a beard trimmer and it was always a tense and scary process.</li>
            <li> Look, as guys we&#x27;re never going to feel \\&quot;great\\&quot; about having sharp metal objects cutting \\&quot;that area\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I was wary a bit earlier of the flexible shaving head of the 2040 but in practice it appeared to improve contact and cutting over that of the 2020&#x27;s over all body</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it will get you if you are carelessly speed shaving but if you are careful you will have no problem.</li>
            <li> the Charge Stand it the most stupid and annoying...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Functionality - I realize that this device is not intended for beards, but I am frustrated by how poorly it performs anywhere above the collarbone.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s almost impossible for any skin (even loose skin) to get caught in between the blades.</li>
            <li> ; at least Amazon will reduce the hassle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is wrong</li>
            <li> It just didnt get close enough and now my arms have a 12&#x27;o clock shadow.. :-(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the battery life overall</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d contact Norelco but not sure if I&#x27;ll bother because it&#x27;s a mediocre product and don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll offer me a refund.</li>
            <li> stand is also a dumb design.</li>
            <li> The stand is also a dumb design.</li>
            <li> Pretty pathetic.</li>
            <li> Pretty pathetic.</li>
            <li> It is unbelievable indeed, it wraps off all undesired hairs without hurting or irritating your skin!</li>
            <li> It has 2 weak  magnets to hold the razor, but its imposible to make them work.</li>
            <li> It sucks!  </li>
            <li> I use it over the scrotal area and you do not even have to go slow!</li>
            <li> but the shaving blades facing up and down feel like I am cutting nerve endings instead of</li>
            <li> but I was not pressing very hard as it is.</li>
            <li> The worst part is, because a few people said it takes practice, like a complete idiot I kept trying using different technique, varying pressure, etc.</li>
            <li> Dry wasn&#x27;t bad and there were still no cuts, the gel just helps things to glide along.  </li>
            <li> I bought this machine for the scrotum which is very difficult to shave with other machines /</li>
            <li> the warnings and do NOT use this to trim extremely tough beard hairs.</li>
            <li> Ive clipped my sack a few sacks, the first time was bad and very painful.</li>
            <li> ; if you go very slowly, it has a tendency of giving you a bit of a nick.</li>
            <li> Be VERY slow with this thing.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick hair</li>
            <li> However my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li> (gentlemen you know what mean)!  </li>
            <li> , if you know what I mean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a little nerve-racking when there are mechanized devices with cutting heads in that region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This problem is not unique to the BodyGroom, but it&#x27;s especially annoying because it&#x27;s a $70 item that I only use once or twice per week.    </li>
            <li> I find it is hard to manipulate to get to difficult areas.</li>
            <li> I did use it carefully and nothing bad happened.</li>
            <li> I was stupid for some time not looking into something like this, because I always used regular trimmers for everything.  </li>
            <li> Works even worse in water  5.</li>
            <li> did I hate it after it grew back out.  </li>
            <li> It inexplicably has one on both sides of the foil screen, so I can imagine this could be trouble for someone trying to shave one area while leaving a beard.</li>
            <li> I hate body hair and have been using trimmers designed for above the neck line for years.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a broken BG2030.</li>
            <li> It seems to be under-powered, as it had a lot of trouble cutting hair using the adjustable clipper side of it.  </li>
            <li> im tired if paying for shipping for something that dosent work.</li>
            <li> I think I was shaking worse</li>
            <li> not great.  </li>
            <li> if you have had any bodygroomer with out one you must know how annoying it is to not have enough juice to get your job done.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.  </li>
            <li> It is just thin plastic, so it cannot sit there and hold the shaver.</li>
            <li> If you tried to shave in the shower, you&#x27;d ruin your razor or worse.  </li>
            <li> You can use it in your face but the results are not great.</li>
            <li> This seems like a really poor design to me.</li>
            <li> a inconvenience and poor marketing representation  and strategy of a Philips/ Norelco company for not including the oil trimmer lubricator.</li>
            <li> Batteries are poor......</li>
            <li> If your tired of razor prices this is the way to go for now.</li>
            <li> Also a bit frustrating to take 8 hours to charge, but if it is stored in the charger this is a non issue.    </li>
            <li> I step my game up to something like this so that I don&#x27;t have to keep replacing those litle cheapies on an annual basis.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ignored the negative reviews, and now I wish I hadn&#x27;t.    </li>
            <li> This seems like a really poor design to me.</li>
            <li> The device is a loser and the company seems worse.</li>
            <li> That skin is awfuly thin and gets caught.</li>
            <li> To date I have never experienced a nick.</li>
            <li> Trimmer really not so great.</li>
            <li> or worse, you&#x27;ll yank some of the hairs while trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is really a game changer.</li>
            <li> do some allergy at difficulty areas like behind the knee</li>
            <li> i get blood and bleed a lot not happy</li>
            <li> And this pinches my hairs, not screaming pain but pain enough where its get annoying after a while.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing worse than getting pricked by a toothpick or something equivalent though.  </li>
            <li> I went to use it and it did indeed pull my hair, so I was a bit annoyed that this reviewer was correct.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that it initially confused me</li>
            <li> I do wish they had put a Lithium battery in it; nickel cadmium is outdated...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Turned out to be a bloody one, cutting myself pretty badly after just a few applies.</li>
            <li> Other groomers have cut my badly in areas I would have rather not have been cut, but the BG2040 is not one of those products.</li>
            <li> Other reviews mentioned a bad battery life</li>
            <li> but I hear bad things about it reading other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus now I never have to deal with ingrown hairs or other bad side effects of the razor, on areas that don&#x27;t like to be shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are still 4 places on the shaving side that can leave some quite brutal gashes if you&#x27;re not careful (which you should be considering the target area).</li>
            <li> is either a sharp razor to your skin, painful waxing, or using some chemical hair removers on your skin.</li>
            <li> but that was a bit dangerous on raw skin.</li>
            <li> Seriously, try this out!</li>
            <li> It seriously cuts through hair!</li>
            <li> Not only was I worried about cutting myself, a day later I would get horrible bumps and be itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> the edger thing kept hitting the bottom of my nose which is a little painful after a couple times.    </li>
            <li> it is a little painful and will start bleeding.</li>
            <li> the unit&#x27;s foil goes bad within few months and you can&#x27;t find it in stores</li>
            <li> I had a few painful moments</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has been the worst trimmer experience for me thus far.  </li>
            <li> Still the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever brought near my crotch since I went to Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> It was irritating that I had to shave off the missed hairs in all these random places, but I&#x27;m some what of a perfectionist.</li>
            <li> It makes you sweat and smell, and it&#x27;s just plain ugly.</li>
            <li> I would like for the trimmer guide to allow cutting a little shorter and for the cutting blade to come all the way out to the edge.  </li>
            <li> You can catch the skin and make a sorta painful scratch if you don&#x27;t hold the pro at a very tight angle</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the shaver,though, since I&#x27;ve had a bad eperience in the past</li>
            <li> was disappointed in this product because it was one of the few bodygrommers that got 4.5 out of 5 stars rating on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Who ARE these other reviewers who say that it&#x27;s impossible to cut yourself with this product?!</li>
            <li> The shaver side is very weak and requires 5+ passes to shave any area fully.  </li>
            <li> but it can be a bloody mess (pun</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> However, I had to use about one 7-dollar bottle of Nair per time I got rid of my body hair, which got expensive, so I stopped manscaping altogether for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product until I tried it.</li>
            <li> They stand behind the product!</li>
            <li> The Philips guard does not help lift or guide the hair into the trimming blade rendering it totally useless, unless you have all the time in the world to groom.  </li>
            <li> , i was wrong, i had plenty of time.  </li>
            <li> All of them were unable to hold a charge for under a year</li>
            <li> so sorry about your experiences, guys)</li>
            <li> It was expensive</li>
            <li> if im doing this wrong</li>
            <li> if im doing something wrong.     </li>
            <li> The trimmer is almost useless.</li>
            <li> It was unable to trim to anything closer than a quarter centimeter of stubble which made it look like I hadn&#x27;t bothered shaving or trimming below the neck in a week.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a duo product - do not buy this, as the trimming side is useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it fell to the ground and shattered after 2 years of use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is expensive though.</li>
            <li> The cutter on the bottom, with the adjustable guard, seems to be rather useless.</li>
            <li> However, after years of use,the on/off switch failed on the unit, so I replaced it with the 2040.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> thing is useless, i purchased it to trim my beard and shave my neck:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pivoting head on the shaver is uncomfortable and inconsistent.</li>
            <li> Having to replace this rather expensive shaver every couple of years makes it an expensive proposition, too.  </li>
            <li> but after repeat use.. the trimmer does not hold the charge and is completely useless..</li>
            <li> unfortunately it didn&#x27;t give a close shave.</li>
            <li> I got careless and sped things up resulting in a war</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical about this product you shouldn&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> The angles are totally wrong for the trimmer</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty expensive throwaway electronic shaver.</li>
            <li> Battery failed after six months.</li>
            <li> but it is useless now.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m so sad)</li>
            <li> lame.</li>
            <li> Once again, this trimmer was out of juice and unable to be used.</li>
            <li> The knick, not the unfortunate choice of bandaid.</li>
            <li> It was scary.</li>
            <li> As opposed to the completely useless shaver, the trimmer did have some value.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 of these and they continue to fail.</li>
            <li> Sorry I dont have time or desire to do that.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I took away two star as you can hurt yourself if you are careless while shaving some non-smooth skin (wink-wink).</li>
            <li> purchased 4 of these groomers because each one I purchased failed within 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> i guess.. just not impressed</li>
            <li> this time i got this BG2040 and its fail me.</li>
            <li> It did cut me once (because I was careless).  </li>
            <li> go wrong...</li>
            <li> A weird charging station.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I bought this unit because I wanted a rechargeable trimmer I could use in the shower, and it does that part</li>
            <li> Get one, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> and/or wakes us up, especially when it falls off the shelf in the shower onto the floor (3 am - worst case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured I must have charged it wrong.</li>
            <li> Unlikely.</li>
            <li> As a result, the shaver is useless.</li>
            <li> but I have found it both cumbersome and uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It sometimes gets caught on some skin and the head tilts in a weird way.</li>
            <li> (play the scary music here....</li>
            <li> shaver is totally useless...</li>
            <li> which is especially annoying when you travel extensively as I do, and wish to reduce the amount of items and clutter you carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: SAVE YOUR MONEY and don&#x27;t even think to buy this lousy product.</li>
            <li> This is why I say it&#x27;s not perfect, with that said,</li>
            <li> I must be doing something wrong  </li>
            <li> Too expensive to have these issues.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to get the clippers aligned to the charging prongs.</li>
            <li> unfortunately instead of making it lithium ion they put two AAA NiMH batteries in it.</li>
            <li> I give it a four star review bc its my fault that i bought the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> but I may be holding it wrong against my skin, idk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is designed to fail.</li>
            <li> the shaver was useless.</li>
            <li> After a year, the battery is useless.</li>
            <li> Every now and then, he&#x27;s complain of skin getting caught in the wrong place.</li>
            <li> It can only be used on the stand, which is terrible for convenience, space saving, and - of course - travel.  </li>
            <li> It gives a close shave (obviously not as perfect as with a razor blade).</li>
            <li> Unlikely as it is, I wonder if those people perhaps didn&#x27;t read the instructions?  </li>
            <li> The bottom trimmer was awful, having to pass the same areas over and over to get an even trim.</li>
            <li> The item is a bit expensive...</li>
            <li> but this one sadly misses the mark.</li>
            <li> I will use it to get the areas that are difficult to get with a razor, and use the razor for the rest.  </li>
            <li> Sad to say, they foil shaver broke after a months use.</li>
            <li> I decided to use the 5 since I didn&#x27;t want to get rid of all my leg hair since that would a bit weird to me.</li>
            <li> This product left me with a horrible rash and nicks on my skin for weeks.  </li>
            <li> This has removed a lot of hair from a lot of silly places.</li>
            <li> absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> This thing is very frustrating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very disappointed and was about to toss the thing, but I decided to try it wet.  </li>
            <li> the charging dock is built like crap, but i hardly ever need to charge it.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: bad design and poor performance for a rechargeable appliance.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t cut myself a lot, but it just felt like I had to be incredibly careful, and afterwards (a day or two) I&#x27;d get horrible razor burns and the itchiness was unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Frustrated and confused</li>
            <li> The other end - the body trimmer- is also pathetic.  </li>
            <li> I had gray hair all ovef my chest that I hated, as well as a hairy back which women hate.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that I wasted money on this</li>
            <li> Or you might end up scathing something you wouldn&#x27;t want to lose.</li>
            <li> I can see cutting myself without a guard on the business end, but I&#x27;ve even done it with the shorter hair end</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shakes like crazy while in use.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li> The charger apparatus is awkward.</li>
            <li> The length can be a bit awkward</li>
            <li> The attachment itself is not adjustable but the cutting blade adjusts to five settings.</li>
            <li> BUT the two rows of \\&quot;trimming\\&quot; TEETH on BOTH sides of the foil make it DANGEROUS.</li>
            <li> It decreases the chance cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This model of the body groomer was a bit disappointing.  </li>
            <li> The guides at each end prevent you from getting the cutting head on to the hair, and you end up scratching yourself and suffering pain trying to use it.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be afraid to buy it.</li>
            <li> Anyway, after using it about 6 times between the both of us, I started noticing just how awkward the shape of the thing was...</li>
            <li> This model 2040 is a bit awkward to use because of it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly the battery service time was a disappointment as well.</li>
            <li> The Scrotum is a dangerous place to approach with trimmers..</li>
            <li> Almost incapable of cutting you</li>
            <li> My wife thought I was crazy to order it</li>
            <li> Now just go ahead and buy it and stop reading all these crazy reviews.</li>
            <li> Crazy, I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does well for the groin area and doesnt cut me, i dont know how people are cutting themselves, im not even that cautious.</li>
            <li> the chances of cutting yourself (compared to a razor)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it comes to cutting, there is a reason I said &#x27;minimizes&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Nothing crazy at all... about 1/4 spacing between hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought this to shave my denver nuggets without cutting them.</li>
            <li> You will not have to worry about cutting your junk if you buy this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money in this terrible product.</li>
            <li> You have to hold it PERPENDICULAR to the area you&#x27;re cutting at all times and let the \\&quot;edge trimmers\\&quot; pivot on to your skin.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointing.</li>
            <li> The cutting edges are don&#x27;t sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Removes any disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I think this probably could be improved by having a wider cutting head.</li>
            <li> I cant use it anymore, its cutting my face</li>
            <li> and i have had no&lt;br /&gt;Mishaps with cutting or pain in the jewel area.</li>
            <li> However,  the charging stand is awkward and tippy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid boys.  </li>
            <li> No worries on cutting you or irritation with this product.</li>
            <li> you can shave what ever you like with out being afraid of being sting by it</li>
            <li> I like the duel cutting heads and adjustable comb.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be mad</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> In the past I have used razors to shave my body but after 2 or 3 days the itching was the worst..</li>
            <li> Too bad the battery stinks on this thing.</li>
            <li> However, upon closer inspection I realized that I, stupidly, pressed the wrong button.&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li> Very flawed design for a $50 groomer.</li>
            <li> Im not gonna be all negative and say this product is terrible and whatnot</li>
            <li> and I was very skeptical about the claims of a irritation-free shave.</li>
            <li> However, this is a VERY difficult task to do when the damn comb doesn&#x27;t lock.  </li>
            <li> But the way the stand works is very weird.  </li>
            <li> IT CAN BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE DURING WORKOUTS AND SEX.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very difficult.</li>
            <li> Additionally, they are almost impossible to replace yourself.</li>
            <li> It was on that day that I said goodbye to the level of grooming with which I had become accustomed because it is simply impossible to replicate the results with the Body Groom Pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been working with the website, but their support is impossible.  </li>
            <li> does this thing suck so bad?</li>
            <li> but this machine it&#x27;s have bad shaving</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad one or something</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say anything bad about it.</li>
            <li> a already have a lot of bad thinks to talk about..&lt;br /&gt;iam</li>
            <li> Too bad I it accidentally fell in the trash can</li>
            <li> bad thing I can say about it is that it does tend to pull your hair from time to time.</li>
            <li> charging unit is badly designed.  </li>
            <li> Going on a year and nothing bad to report.</li>
            <li> I dont know why ppl says its a bad idea to combine the trimmer and the shaver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this groomer gets a bad rep for just trimming the body</li>
            <li> i guess maybe I just got a bad one, but this thing can&#x27;t hold a charge at all.  </li>
            <li> Bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How could it be so bad.</li>
            <li> guess that isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Probably just bad luck.</li>
            <li> does it knick, but knicks badly</li>
            <li> You will have a bad day.</li>
            <li> So bad</li>
            <li> Probably bad unit</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> This one cut me .. badly.  </li>
            <li> It has always been a painful endeavor...until now.</li>
            <li> I was shocked how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I think the pivoting head is what makes it feel like you are one twitch away from a painful night in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strike two was that it is painful to use.  </li>
            <li> Every time the foil even touched it it would nick it, then I got really frustrated and jus tryed to fight thru it</li>
            <li> The machine was on and the hair was painfully coming off my body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really sick of this shaving thing.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the soldered in batteries.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- No lanyard!!! :(  </li>
            <li> But sadly disappointed after three month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I contacted norelco that they will do nothing after the two year warranty is expired.  </li>
            <li> Oh, let me tell you the ways that this product has disappointed me:    </li>
            <li> Follow the direction in the user manual and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed pulls the hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m disappointed</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I can not express how disappointed I was by this product.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> really disappointed me to some extent...</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to put it away and purchase another braun. :(</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s scary and terrible.  </li>
            <li> But it was very disappointing in reality.  </li>
            <li> That is very inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> ( worse idea ever!!!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whoever designed this stupid &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; functionality</li>
            <li> I wish I could say that I didn&#x27;t hate it, but I do.</li>
            <li> I find this really annoying when it comes to beard length (I&#x27;m in the Guard now,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for 2months now and assuming it doesn&#x27;t crap out on me</li>
            <li> hate this purchase.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind cutting pieces of your member off and having a terrifying experience then go ahead and get it.</li>
            <li> and it was so annoying and Revolting.</li>
            <li> here I am, with a Hello Kitty bandaid at the base of my penis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing you just keep it plugged in and are charging it every time it&#x27;s on the base.</li>
            <li> (no, even I don&#x27;t have anyone I hate that</li>
            <li> but the grooming end is worthless.</li>
            <li> What a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Just set the shaver in the base, and it charges up, then shuts off automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Maybe you burned the living crap out of your taint with some hair remover cream.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s annoying that i have to time my shaves.</li>
            <li> As noted by others, the rechargeable battery is crap.  </li>
            <li> Plus the charging base is sleek and neat.  </li>
            <li> and it gets annoying and bothersome when I&#x27;m at the pool or sweating.</li>
            <li> like the folding base used to recharge the groomer.  </li>
            <li> The shaving side is also worthless.  </li>
            <li> Another thing that can be annoying is the charging dock.</li>
            <li> Battery is very bad.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed from PhilpNoreleco.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> simply absurd !!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s work is the worst i ever tried.</li>
            <li> If i didnt think it was insanely unsanitary to resell this thing, i would probably try to trade it for a bag of chips or a pack of gum.</li>
            <li> The stand is horrible.   </li>
            <li> Worst purchase in along time.</li>
            <li> it has terrible battery life.</li>
            <li> Like Dr. Evil says, there is nothing like a shorn scrotum.</li>
            <li> Pathetic.</li>
            <li> Regardless of the fact that my husband has cut himself with this product, the customer service at Philips Norelco is awful.  </li>
            <li> I was terribly unsatisfied with this product.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the bad:&lt;br /&gt;The charge is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Horrible, horrible, horrible battery life.  </li>
            <li> Terrible service.</li>
            <li> the battery is terrible!!</li>
            <li> All I can say is holy crap !  </li>
            <li> Terrible service.     </li>
            <li> The worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> and they were terrible.</li>
            <li> product&#x27;s packaging is one of the worst I have seen in ages.</li>
            <li> In that quest, Norelco hasn&#x27;t always faired so well, but they have never been truly awful.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the worst either.  </li>
            <li> if not, you can get some nasty nicks.  </li>
            <li> Its horrible.</li>
            <li> The battery life in this trimmer is terrible.</li>
            <li> used to use cream and a razor, but that was just awful.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is terrible, 20minutes tops</li>
            <li> the batteries that came with it were just terrible.</li>
            <li> I have just never encountered a razor with 2 ends before, hence my terrible rookie mistake.</li>
            <li> Battery life is horrible.</li>
            <li> The battery in this product is HORRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does a much better job that expected</li>
            <li> Easily the best electric razor on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Norelco product for at least 2 years now.  It does what it is designed to do really well---when the battery is charged.  Unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t hold a charge.  I read reviews warning about battery charge issues but elected to buy it anyway.  But, I can confirm that battery life is a major issue.  I have owned a top-of-the-line Norelco shaver years and it still holds a charge for 2 to 3 weeks and I use it every day.  I don&#x27;t know what the problem with this Bodygroom product is but I definately would not buy it again.  (Maybe Norelco has improved the battery life since mine is 2+ years old now?)</li>
            <li> This version has a very s***ty battery that takes forever to charge and discharges within a couple minutes of use.</li>
            <li> It’s comfortable and trims very wellskin-friendly shave. Won’t pull hair and leave your sking smooth. I have not had any problems with nicks or cut while trimming sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> It worked for about 6 months, and now it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge longer than 20 minutes. And I would not recommend body grooming with this..</li>
            <li> It is a good trimmer, but it will pinch your skin if not careful. If i had to buy again i would not. For the price you should not have to worry about the hazard.</li>
            <li> i love it and my wife loves me for using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it keeps me baby smooth down there for her.</li>
            <li> When the screen popped a hole,I was able to find the replacement screen,so I got 2 new screens and one new razor so my son now has his own.Thier really good quality machines.</li>
            <li> Solid device that does the job.</li>
            <li> gets the job done that&#x27;s all that needs to be said</li>
            <li> I bought this to trim leg hair when running was my only form of exercise. I now use it to trim or shave other areas of my body was well, and since buying it in 2010 I replaced the foil 2-3 times. I have used it both wet and dry, but for me dry use is more comfortable. After nearly three years of use the batteries finally gave out and I decided to try replacing them. To my surprise it was easy to take apart except the batteries are soldered in. I bought replacements and put them in, but I don&#x27;t recommend this for people without experience soldering. I am still very satisfied with the product and more so after seeing the how it was put together, but there are some caveats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not give it five stars because the batteries require specialized knowledge to replace. Given the cost and being otherwise so easy to take apart I was disappointed by the soldered in batteries. Too many electronics now a days are designed to be disposable. All that being said I do still recommend this for anyone looking for a body trimmer/shaver.</li>
            <li> Love the 2-in-1 for different lengths. I bought this because lady shavers aren&#x27;t that great. The screen side doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I&#x27;d like but still better than any lady shaver I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a few years ago. I am reporting on long term use. After 2 years, my unit went from 30+ minutes of battery life on a charge to 1 minute. Now it runs out of power after a few seconds. I opened it up and saw that Philips uses cheap NiMH batteries (not decent at all). Additionally, they are almost impossible to replace yourself. They soldered the contacts on REGULAR AAA NiMH batteries. So basically you have to solder contacts on NEW batteries This was a conscious choice on their behalf as it was a standard battery holder, just with custom contacts. This product is literally designed to die in a few years forcing another purchase.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has ever shaved or trimmed below the waist knows that using a blade and shaving cream can cause nicks and bleeding. Contrary to some reviews, I used this groomer and suffered no nicks or gashes. The shaver cuts close enough to cause minor razor burn on tender skin, but otherwise is very comfortable. Follow the instructions and diagrams for close comfortable trimming and shaving.  The diagrams show very specific techniques for using the shaver and trimmer. I Used this groomer correctly and avoided the blood letting reported by some reviewers. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like how the trimmer is attached to the unit. The previous version needed a lot of changing the setup, which was a pain. I&#x27;ve had this for almost a year now and it is my fourth Norelco grooming product. I will definitely be back for more!</li>
            <li> Best $70 I have ever spent. At first I was a bit scared to use this, especially with previous bad experiences shaving below the neck. But this is an absolutely amazing product. Very smooth and comfortable shave. However, don&#x27;t get too &amp;#34;cocky&amp;#34; with it like I did ;) Or you might end up scathing something you wouldn&#x27;t want to lose.</li>
            <li> Works great! Fabulous investment!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice. It has become my everyday shaver. You can use it anywhere on your body. Really good product.</li>
            <li> Concept is good, but, when you try to get the best of both , it leaves both lacking something. I had to switch back to using my 3 separate shavers as this did not work for me. Low rating for design not quality of the brand per say. Need a deign that truly can replace the features of all my other shavers, esp for close shaves.</li>
            <li> The product itself does a great job. The battery doesn&#x27;t last more than 5 minute at a time anymore. It needs constant charging to be used.</li>
            <li> Very versatile! I bought it for trimming body hair - it works wonderfully for that. However, today, the battery in my fancy Panasonic face shaver died, so I tried the Philips on my face. It did the job well and gave me a very close shave. Will from now on take it traveling with me.</li>
            <li> The idea is great but it&#x27;s work is the worst i ever tried. not only wasting money but also tring using it is wasting time.</li>
            <li> The trimmer side of this is awesome.  The adjustable length setting is great, and doesn&#x27;t slip like some others.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver side is ok.</li>
            <li> I researched this item for months, bought it, loved it, after the battery died after nearly a year, I called Norelco to see how to get a replacement and because I registered this product they sent me a new item - no questions! Always register your new items!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several razors. this one by far is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used . No  Knicks or razor burn.  even in the most sensitive places if you know what I mean . I highly recommend this product and the seller</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a high performance, durable material and easy to use this product will work for you, the price its a little bit higher but the shaver really worth it .</li>
            <li> It was great while it worked ,  it stop working  and  i requested return  10 days  after  allowed  time.......  Don&#x27;t waste your money,,,,,</li>
            <li> I have use this now for 2 weeks everyday sometimes twice a day only charged it once . It took a couple days before it stared to to do a good job. Now it is doing a great job very pleased with this shaver</li>
            <li> Wow! This groomer works for ladies too! It gives me a smooth finish. It&#x27;s very convenient to use. This got me telling my friends and family to buy this product!</li>
            <li> Will snag loose skin if ya know what I mean.  other then that works great</li>
            <li> Top reasons its bad&lt;br /&gt;1.re-grown hairs around groin area are very troublesome to re cut&lt;br /&gt;2. Problem- You have to constantly shave one area because it doesn&#x27;t shave it off. leaves red bumps&lt;br /&gt;3. 70$ I thought I would have a rich mans shaver but its best to pay for something cheaper like the cruzer 6 by gillete or not since replacement blades are pricy for the cruzer.&lt;br /&gt;This had many reviews but who knows maybe the top five commentaries are always paid by some organization to write a good review for product.</li>
            <li> I can see where some people would like it but it did not work well for me.  It&#x27;s a trimmer / shaver that does both but doesn&#x27;t do either as well as I would like.  Also I felt the battery life was poor &amp; charging took a long time.  After 1 year or so of minimal use the battery quit taking a charge.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have dabbled somewhat in manscaping before, which mainly involved using Nair for Men all over my body, which worked very well even for my netherparts.  However, I had to use about one 7-dollar bottle of Nair per time I got rid of my body hair, which got expensive, so I stopped manscaping altogether for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after getting back into a fitness/hygiene craze, I have decided to start manscaping once again, I deliberated that it would be proper to get something more permanent and reusable than a bottle of Nair.  So I found this guy.  I bought it to originally be used mostly for my chest, but I thought I could use it all over my body if need be.  I also bought some more Nair, but just for my netherparts since I didn&#x27;t trust putting a razor to that area . . . not yet, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had originally tried using both my hair clippers and my electric razor for my face on my chest, which worked to some degree, but it either didn&#x27;t get the hair down as far as I&#x27;d like, or I would have razor burn.  The BodyGroom Pro left a slight amount of razor burn in the form of raised bumps that show up a little bit when I shower, but it&#x27;s much more manageable than before.  I don&#x27;t mind it too much.  The first thing I noticed that impressed me was that, unlike my hair clippers, this could go right over my nipples without nicking them.  That was nice to not have to worry about that.  Now I&#x27;m not going to go to town on them, but I feel comfortable not avoiding them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I shave my chest, and I skip my arms and legs because I don&#x27;t mind having hair on them.  I also have virtually no back hair, so that was skipped as well.  Now I grab the bottle of Nair, and I apply it to my netherparts, which is the last thing I needed to do for my manscaping.  It started burning slightly, so I immediately washed off the stuff.  I knew that wasn&#x27;t a good idea.  The Nair for Men I had originally used never gave me any issues when putting it on my junk even when leaving it for 15+ minutes on there.  No pain was ever felt in any circumstances.  This Nair was different.  It was more spray-on than like a foamy, whipped type that I had used before.  Note to self: get the speed cream next time, which looks similar and probably is the Nair I had originally had success with.  But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after failing with the Nair, I decided to grow the *ahem* balls to shave them.  I took it slowly, cutting down the forest first with the close shaving end, only to find out it was better to shave down most of it with the guarded side first, which brought down the hair much more quickly.  Then came the hard part: getting the hair down there to a close-shave finish.  I started off slowly, keeping any and all skin taught so as to not let the saggy skin down there get wedged between any blades.  It took probably 15 minutes the first time, but, long story short, I ended up with a completely shaved netherworld, and it was done without drawing blood or nicking myself.  That entire area was almost as close-shaved as my face.  Not quite, but close.  That&#x27;s about all you can ask for unless you use Nair or some other chemical hair remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I now trust this blade to be able to fully bring any hair on my body down to smooth skin while having a low risk of cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the way the battery works is that it should not be on the charger if it is fully charged lest it slowly kill the battery&#x27;s ability to hold a charge.  I think this is called \\&quot;battery memory\\&quot; or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, bye bye, Nair, hello BodyGroom Pro!</li>
            <li> first philips product for me, sounds nice and as described , a bit soft on skin , sometimes u need to press hard to get it all out, but solid product, i guess best at the market now adays</li>
            <li> So i had to use this 2 or 3 times before i like it.  Yes, getting pinched in the bag at first hurt.  But i think what actually happened was the blades on the shaver part (not the trimmer), just needed to dull up a little.  Now, that i am better at maneuvering it and in the rare event i do get pinched buy the littler trimmer blades before the microfoil shaver, i not really notice it.  My wife just commented this am, how good i look down there.  Thats what its about right?</li>
            <li> This works great for what most men are going to buy for it.  However, the only issue I&#x27;ve had with it is the guard on the razor itself doesn&#x27;t guard very well.  I&#x27;ve cut myself multiple times with it no matter how gentle or careful I am.  Just be sure that you&#x27;re very cautious if you use this because it does have the capability of cutting your skin even with the guard down.</li>
            <li> Does this cut hair, yes.  This would not be sold if it didnt.  Does it take a few passes sometimes, yeah, but nothing is perfect in the world.  I dont consider myself a high maintenance guy, and i give PLENTY of chances for this shaver, but this thing is the ABSOLUTE WORSE if you need are in this situation:&lt;br /&gt;-want as close of a cut as possible (no shaving adapter or guard)&lt;br /&gt;-You are shaving uneven area, example, private area/crotch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why does this thing suck so bad? Like someone mentioned before, the buzzer is &amp;#34;unguarded&amp;#34; metal.  I have CUT myself over 30+ times.  Yes i continued to use this thing b/c i thought there has to be a method where it doesnt cut me.  EVERY...EVERY...time i use it, i get cut, sometimes 2 to 3 of them.  Once in a while is fine but EVERY DAM TIME.  because of this, i am now scared to go remotely as close as i want to.  If i didnt think it was insanely unsanitary to resell this thing, i would probably try to trade it for a bag of chips or a pack of gum.</li>
            <li> It got here on time and it works great for what i need it for this is a very nice product.</li>
            <li> for all who try the old model they know its really nice i was used the old model for more than 1yr or 2yr ,,    so i cheek this one its look nice and really easy to put it in bag for travail ( its dont have bag ) and its really look clean after many used and heavy work  ..    i have so much  heir in my body so i use the shave  its really nice and easy to shave ur body and yeah u can clean ur privet place like the ball so easy and no scare u will really love it its keep u clean ..    the battery is good also if its near to end its will light orange this mean there is time also to work like 10 min and what i really like if the battery end its will not slow down and annoying u with  pull ur hair :) its will shut down so u know there is no battery but if u still need to cut few more u can click to start again its will give u few sec work with same full speed and shut down      and after its fully end ( first shut down ) u must charge it 8 Hour  and dont charge it again till its fully end so u long ur battery for long life  and btw dont keep it charge yeah its auto stop charging after full but close ur power as soon as u can after full charge     i really recommend it</li>
            <li> Really works well , worth the price</li>
            <li> Right out of the package this shaver has a solid feel to it.  It fits very nicely into its charging unit and looks sleek.    But, looks aren&#x27;t what make this a great shaver.  You have two ends, each with their own on/off controls.  It&#x27;s meant for below the neck, but you can easily trim above the neck as well.  It does a superb job.  Not much pulling and easily maneuverable.    And I very much like the way I can adjust the trimmer with what I think are a lot of settings... more than I had expected.  That makes sure I don&#x27;t take off too much.  (Reminds me of going into a barber shop and asking for a &#x27;light trim&#x27; and walking out as if I had just joined the Marines.)    This is a sturdy, great product that does the job.  You can&#x27;t go wrong, above or below the neck.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say that I didn&#x27;t hate it, but I do. I really do. Why, you ask?  1. Razor doesn&#x27;t cut anything more than 2mm in length  2. Trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut anything. Especially not hair.   3. Battery lasts about 10 minutes of usage  4. Works even worse in water  5. The stand is horrible.   6. It&#x27;s oddly loud, too.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s agree: shaving is more than an act of maintenance. Let&#x27;s also agree: the ways that men groom is changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s get down to the details. I really like the small edger on the top and bottom of the trimming area. It is good for small touch-ups, like for those small outcroppings of hair on my ear lobes. Yes, on my ear lobes! Arghhh. The holder is not so great. It looks great, but it doesn&#x27;t fit in there very easily. Overall, it is not as \\&quot;close as a blade.\\&quot; What it is, though, is very flexible. I have a beard, and I&#x27;m able to take care of more things with this tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have used it for a while, I want to add one more thing. This is a tool that will change how you shave. It is possible to make small, exact cuts with this shaver. I&#x27;m able to take care of the extras, and that&#x27;s a difference maker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they let me re-design this: For one, I&#x27;d make it a lot smaller. This is a very nimble device. Problem is, it is built at a large scale. Is there really a reason why the base has to be so large? All that does is undermine my ability to artfully nip and tuck at those stray hairs. There is something sporty about a short-throw gear shift. That ought to be the same with this, I think. Second thing is that I would get rid of one of the two micro trimmers. The micro trimmer is great, don&#x27;t get me wrong. There is nothing like it on your average beard-trimmer. This morning, I made a 2 mm wide edge between my lip and my mustache. Imagine trying that with a standard beard trimmer. Unfortunately, it is on both sides, right next to the main screen. That makes it hard to work on trimming down stubble without grazing into your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad used a Remington MicroScreen, which claimed to shave as close as a blade, or your money back. I remember the report it made when he struck the edge of sink with his Remington to knock the loose hair out. It was part of a morning ritual, along with John Gambling on WOR and the percolator&#x27;s steady steam. The Remington MicroScreen was solid, not fancy. The Remington reduced your beard to a bare stubble. Want to shave something besides that beard? You were out of luck. Go to a barber for that other stuff. In short, it was a razor for another era. It was for the type of man that wore a white t-shirt under his dress shirt, who polished his shoes, and who thought no one was noticing when he worked on his comb-over. The Remington neatly fit into an assortment of other men&#x27;s care products: Mennen Speedstick, Prell Shampoo, and Lifebuoy soap. Ah, the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that has all changed, and now men need more out of their shaving system. The Philips Norelco is for that new man. This shaver does all kinds of things: It can shave your chest.It could shave your back hair. It can take hair out of those funny places that didn&#x27;t use to grow hair, but now they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this razor a chance. You know what you will get if you purchase another one of those Wal-Mart style ni-cad systems. You will get a $19 system that breaks in about 14 months. This is much better.en was solid, not fancy.

            <li> It is the best trimmer I ever bought! I have used already three other brands over the course of 10 years. This is the best one out there. I am happy that I did my research and read all the reviews.... With my old ones I used to get small cuts and they were not so precise. It will be hard to cut oneself with this norelco product. It is very good for those sensitive areas...</li>
            <li> After a lot of comparison research, this was the body shaver I decided to purchase. This item is as good as advertised, I&#x27;m not disappointed at all. It&#x27;s a little more expensive than most groomers, but is still cheaper than many. It would have been cheaper for me to bathe in Nair, but it is still cheaper than a single back waxing. They charge quickly and are easy to keep clean and put away so you won&#x27;t gross your wife out with the pubic hair balls all over the bathroom. The 2-in1 shavers design means one end or the other will do for anything that might ever need &amp;#34;grooming&amp;#34; (a.k.a. &amp;#34;I wish I could rip it out but the pain would cause me to explode.)</li>
            <li> This product works.  Just a warning.. be careful; if you take the guard off the clippers it can cut/pinch skin that is baggy or loose (gentlemen you know what mean)!  Also, the other tends to aggressively pull hairs which can be discomforting at first.  This product will have your skin super smooth though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an 18 year old female who was looking for something to get me smooth and hairless without the irritation. My skin is sensitive, so with a standard razor,  I&#x27;d get all kinds of irritation, razor burn, bumps, and ingrown hairs down there. It wasn&#x27;t pretty. With this device, I&#x27;m now like a hairless baby. Seriously, this thing basically shaves as close as regular razor to the skin. Well, you can feel slight stubble if you rub the shaved area with your hand in the opposite direction of which the hair grows, but it&#x27;s nothing you can see or really notice. Running my hand across the shaved area in the SAME direction of which the hair grows feels and looks smooth. CLOSE ENOUGHHHH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used the trimmer side to trim the hair short and then applied baby powder so that the foil can glide more easily, and then the shaving side shaved it clean off. My only gripe is that it may take multiple passes if you can&#x27;t quite get the hairs to stand up properly so that they can get cut, but you&#x27;ll get them eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: The trimmer DID cut my labia minora, WITH THE GUARD ON. Yeah, SOMEHOW it managed to slip IN BETWEEN the teeth of the trimming guard and I cut myself. I wasn&#x27;t paying attention as closely as I should&#x27;ve, so it probably was my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, be sure to keep your thin, sensitive flower petal parts out of the way, pay attention, and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, its great to be able to achieve the bald eagle look without the skin troubles, or even to just keep the hair short with the trimmer. Easy to clean, solid device. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my swiss army knife groomer. Works like a charm for any area and feels solid.</li>
            <li> My husband is shipped in iraq and wanted this. He got it and says he loves how easy it is and how it makes grooming quick.</li>
            <li> Awesome!! It gets the job done perfectly.</li>
            <li> It takes multiple passes to get all the hair, but it never nicks. Ultimately it is a safe and effective razor. No irritation or redness after use or the next day.</li>
            <li> After using the Panasonic ER224s for years, I wanted a new one that could be used in or out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;After looking for a trimmer to shave my chest and lower region in the shower, I came across the Philips BG-2040 and Remington BHT-650.&lt;br /&gt;Before I buy any product, I like to see it up front and feel it in my hands so I know what Im getting. I went to my local stores (Best Buy, Target, Walmart, BedBathAndBeyond) and they all had the Philips BG-2040. Not one store had the Remington BHT-650. I didnt want to buy it online and then have to go through the hassle of returning it if I did not like it so I scratched that off my list.&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews and searching for a trimmer that would work in the shower, they all pointed me to the BG-2040.&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and purchased it from Amazon for $49 with S&amp;H included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it about 2 days ago and I was able to use it today in the shower. If you use this in the shower, you will need shaving cream with warm to hot water.&lt;br /&gt;I neglected to shave the past week because I was waiting on delivery of this item. While I was shaving my chest with the shaver part, it was a little difficult because my chest hair was about 1 inch long. I flipped the shaver to the trimmer side and I was able to trim with ease. Once I was done with the trimmer side, I flipped back to the shaver side and it shaved with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;I started shaving the top part of the shaft with the trimmer and it went really well up until (GULP) my DAM hot water went to cold water real fast and I had nippleitis (HAHA). Anyway, this shaver/trimmer is an excellent product and does what it says. I would suggest not to let your chest hairs grow to long cause then you will have to shave with both the trimmer and shaver. If you groom yourself weekly, you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 things Id like to point out about the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;1-I have not been able to read anywhere online about this, but the 5 setting trimmer end, the head actually comes off completely which I  did not know and thought it was there permanantly. This is perfect because I like to use the lowest possible setting when using the trimmer. (See pics)&lt;br /&gt;2-The charging portions is OK. Initially you have to charger the product for 10 hours. After that, the manual states that the shaver/trimmer should be used twice a year where you let it die completely where the motor stops working.&lt;br /&gt;3-The shaver/trimmer comes with a nice charging stand. I l;ike the idea and I want to leave it plugged in when not in use, BUT the manual states that the shaver/trimmer should never be put on the charger after your using it and never leave it on for more than 24 hours. If I am gonna put the stand on my counter, then why would I want to plug my shaver in if its not gonna charge unless its dead?

This is perfect because I like to use the lowest possible setting when using the trimmer. (See pics)  2-The charging portions is OK. Initially you have to charger the product for 10 hours. After that, the manual states that the shaver/trimmer should be used twice a year where you let it die completely where the motor stops working.  3-The shaver/trimmer comes with a nice charging stand. I l;ike the idea and I want to leave it plugged in when not in use, BUT the manual states that the shaver/trimmer should never be put on the charger after your using it and never leave it on for more than 24 hours. If I am gonna put the stand on my counter, then why would I want to plug my shaver in if its not gonna charge unless its dead? Seeing that the shaver only last about 50 minutes, then you would have to constantly plug the charger in.    Pros:  -Strong feel to the shaver/trimmer  -Can be used in the bath/shower  -Removable trimmer head  -Built in trimmer head so you never have to search for the correct one  -Trimmer and Shaver on 1 machine    Cons:  -Not able to use the shaver while plugged in  -Not able to leave the shaver in charger overnight (24 hours)    Conclusion:  -Even thought the shaver cant be left on the charger, this is an excellent product for what it does.

            <li> Was in the market for a much easier and superior trimmer for my you know what and I definitely found it.  What used to take me a half an hour now takes 10 minutes with a smooth, clean finish. Yes, you still have to be careful when starting out as I got carried away and just wanted to shave everything...Thighs, Above my Junk, etc....Now, I just keep it for my junk.  Outstanding.  I told my wife I do this as much for me as it is for you.  Incredible.  Be careful still...you can nick yourself ...Practice will make you a pro with this Unit.</li>
            <li> This is must have for every man care about his clean and keep the smell fresh. every 3 of 4 women prefer shaved!!</li>
            <li> With any shaver, electric or otherwise, it&#x27;s an exploration...  You just don&#x27;t know how YOUR skin &amp; hair will react.  You can always shoot for the odds, like I did and just hope for the best.  I read plenty articles on this shaver and the models proceeding...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the reviews got better as the better model presented itself,  the price increase didn&#x27;t shoot up that bad.  Besides I would think you wouldn&#x27;t want to risk irritation, redness, snags, pulls, or scratches, in order to be cheap, sooooo......Here we are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first go, I was a nervous wreck...lol!!  Hit myself with a couple test spots without hardly any pressure.  I was cool.  Then I started venturing around more and more, gaining more confidence in this bad boy with each swipe.  Afterwards, I had minimal irritation.  I&#x27;m sure that it&#x27;s just a first-time marriage that needed to break-in and was going to work itself out (..at least, I hoped....lol).  Anyways, no problem, y&#x27;all.  It&#x27;s a great shaver.  I don&#x27;t need to pressure it against my skin and more importantly, no bites!!!  It&#x27;s leaves a great, clean, &amp; smooth cut for me,....EVERYWHERE!!  Works fine on women too! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand isn&#x27;t the most sturdy and the cutter at the bottom with the adjustable thingy is great for those of you who need your scalp cut.  I keep my hair with a bald-fade, so I have little use for it.  Other than that, I wished that it came with something to cover the shaver head with &amp;/or maybe a travel case or bag.  But then again, beggars can&#x27;t be choosers.  Happy Grooming!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS GROOMER! i researched very carefully all the groomers and this one was supposed to be one of the better ones. it arrived. i read the instructions carefully. practiced removing the shaving head but as soon as I removed it, a couple of springs popped out. couldn&#x27;t figure out how to put them back together. searched the web but no luck. Called Philips and they said it sounded like I broke it. i guess so. how do i get it fixed or replaced? they required me to read the serial number to them. i could not find it anywhere on the item or the packaging. they refused to let me send it back without telling them the serial number! do you have a picture on your web site as to where the serial number is? no, but it is small, she said. they suggested sending it back to Amazon. great idea; at least Amazon will reduce the hassle!</li>
            <li> This groomer is great in that it gives you a sense of safety. Other groomers have cut my badly in areas I would have rather not have been cut, but the BG2040 is not one of those products. Is it perfect? I would say no, it has a few minor flaws that kept me from giving it a full 5 stars. The shaving foil will not get as close as you want it to, but this is in keeping with all electric shavers. It must still be given the credit that it deserves, however, as it is still the best electric shaver I have used to date even though it does not get every single hair. I have found that a good solution for this problem is to gently pinch the areas where the hair is not being removed and go over them with the shaver head. It may take a bit longer this way but you are insured a good result.     Ergonomically it is not so great either, it is large and can be quite cumbersome in certain areas. It casts a large shadow so it should be used in a well lit bathroom, preferably where the light is coming in from different sides of the room or directly above.     What redeems this product for me is the lack of irritation produced. I have extremely sensitive skin and honestly I thought I would wake up with razor bumps all over my nether-regions from this shaver. This was not so, in fact the skin down there is as smooth as can be and I am completely comfortable into the next day.      These are just examples of extreme nit-picking from me when it comes to this product and should not deter you from buying it. I enjoy being thorough in product reviews so that others can reap the benefits and know what they are in for when it comes right down to it. I have owned multiple groomers in the past and I can tell you that this is by far the best one I have ever owned. Sure it misses a few hairs now and then but other groomers miss entire patches no matter how often you go over them.</li>
            <li> Works really well, shaves very close. I use it full body, and I don&#x27;t pinched or nicked. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was never a fan of body groomers. They always broke or would not work efficiently. This product on the other hand is very very effective. It really works on all areas. Yes its safe for your most private parts. I have and will recommend this to any one.</li>
            <li> I tried the Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Bodygroom Shaver and it shaved OK. When shaving the pubic area but not the scrotum, the shaver shaved close, but not too close as it can give you nicks. And the shaver will leave minor stubs in the end.     As for shaving the underneath where the scrotum is at, the shaver grabs the skin and cut too close resulting in minor cuts.     I had to return the item and use the regular razor blades, which gives me better control with a close, smooth shave without the nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> This bodygroomer is awesome. It feels great to hold in your hand and does an amazing job. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it! I do wish they had put a Lithium battery in it; nickel cadmium is outdated...</li>
            <li> this was my 3rd bodygroom product from philips.  Great while it works, but none of three product I had lasted a year.   6 month maximum.</li>
            <li> I Love it.  Bigger, better, smoother than the smaller one with the blue handle.  The trimmer part with adjustable comb length is great also.  JUST GET IT!</li>
            <li> After my old trimmer finally died after many years of use, my search began for a replacement.  After searching reviews and different products online and eyeing every trimmer I came across in stores on and off for a couple of months, this one came towards the top and was priced not too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I state why it&#x27;s one star in my book, I want to state my prior use.  If this is your first body trimmer, you don&#x27;t know if it can be better or worse for certain.  I&#x27;ve used a variety of trimmers -- for both hair found around the head and elsewhere on the body -- for about 10 years.  They range from cordless to cords, beards to top hair to pubic hair.  After I joined the military I started using a trimmer.  First, for touching up the sides to stay within regulations, then for the nether regions soon after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been the worst trimmer experience for me thus far.  It&#x27;s been my current all-around trimmer for almost a year.  I&#x27;ve cut myself more times using this trimmer than times I&#x27;ve been cut using anything else, for my entire life even.  I can see cutting myself without a guard on the business end, but I&#x27;ve even done it with the shorter hair end (the shaver end, but not the shaver itself--the pre-shave finer trimmers).  I&#x27;ve also had it pull more on that end than other shavers.  There&#x27;s also a large gap in the length range going from no guard to the closest guard setting.  I find this really annoying when it comes to beard length (I&#x27;m in the Guard now, so I only have to be clean shaven on average twice a month).  Also, I go the extra mile sometimes and try to taper the hair length from the outer groin to my leg hair for the girlfriend.  I do not, nor will I ever, shave my legs.  A girlfriend did it once (as in she physically did it) and that&#x27;s not happening again.  Oh the things women can convince men to do.  Because of the guard lengths, it hasn&#x27;t made a very good versatile trimmer for keeping the sides clean and tapered for me.  One reason I went with this one was because it has two different built-in trimmers.  I&#x27;m on the road periodically, so being able to pack less is always welcomed.  This one doesn&#x27;t hack it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will say, the water proof feature is nice and it&#x27;s been the easiest to clean--mostly because I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting something wet I shouldn&#x27;t.  Charging is pretty easy -- although you have to have the base to charge it (it does pack pretty well) -- and it has held a charge pretty well.  The battery has held strong thus far.  I don&#x27;t use it every day though.  Maybe once or twice a week at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s been a complete letdown.  I have a cordless beard trimmer that I got when my first one started to not hold a charge well that I use for keeping the sides clean and I still use it to bridge the gaps of this one for the more \\&quot;personal grooming\\&quot;.  That intermediate one will bite sometimes without a guard, so I just use its better guard lengths.  With this \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; trimmer, I now have to use two separate trimmers to get what my first one has done for many years with great success.  The best was a battery powered Conair beard trimmer.  Unless the current model (GMT189RGB) of the one I had has changed any, it made a great personal and beard trimmer.  I couldn&#x27;t cut myself if I tried with that thing--and that&#x27;s without a guard.  I&#x27;ve even cut my neck with this nonsense--a first for any trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  In all, I think I&#x27;ve own about five or six.  I guess it&#x27;s an OK trimmer, but it&#x27;s the worst one I&#x27;ve owned.one was because it has two different built-in trimmers.  I&#x27;m on the road periodically, so being able to pack less is always welcomed.  This one doesn&#x27;t hack it for me.

            <li> Does a great job removing hair from places you don&#x27;t want. Doesn&#x27;t ever cut or snag you also. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this one after having other Philips groomers in the past.  The last one was the BG2020 and this one blows all of them away!!!  I have very sensitive skin, so this works very well for me, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all with it....  It shaves very close &amp; the battery lasts alot longer before you have to charge it up again...  Very well made &amp; I love the stainless steel, that it&#x27;s made out of too.  I plan on buying more from Philips in the future...  I highly recommend this product because it has all the features in one!!!  Go out and get you one now....and, you&#x27;ll never be the same all over...  :)</li>
            <li> works as I expected, easy to use, easy to charge, can be used to shave most of the body hair, highly recommanded</li>
            <li> I had this shaver for about four months and it decided to stop charging. I did not use this thing more than four times!No Joke! However, it seemed to work well when it did work. For 60 bucks you would think it would last longer. buy at your own risk!    P.S. I have seen that some other reviewers have had the same problem.</li>
            <li> The groomer itself actually works really well.   But there is an issue of hair getting stuck beneath the razors and such.  It comes with a charging stand and that&#x27;s where my problem starts.  The stand looks nice and supposedly the razor will fit inside the curve while being charged.  But the stand&#x27;s opening is actually bigger than the razor itself so the razor will slide down past the appropriate position to be charged.  I&#x27;ve had this for a few months and every time I used it the \\&quot;please charge me\\&quot; light blinks on.  I could still use the razor for a duration long enough to get the job done at that time.  But few weeks ago the razor just completely refused to charge itself, even when placed correctly with the electrodes touching each other.  There is also no easy access to the battery so I assume it does not operate on the general AA or AAA    Very flawed design for a $50 groomer.</li>
            <li> I can assure you that anybody harming himself with this device has himself to blame. As long as you do things their due justice, this shaver should do the job just fine. I&#x27;ve been using the trimmer end exclusively on my beard, as I prefer it short. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it thus far.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver. I have had it for a little over a week now and it does every thing I wanted it to do. It does not pinch the skin or leave any razor rash. It does give me a nice smooth feeling when I am done using it. The feel is just right with the razor. I have yet to  use the bottom end to shave real long hairs as I have not had the need to do that so I cannot comment on that part. My girlfriend and I are going to a halloween party next weekend and she and I are trading sexes for our costumes so I need to shave my legs and it has done that wonderfully again leavingno razor rash. We had tried using a womens razor a while back to experiment but did not like that a rash did develop later on so after using this I would highly recommend this for someone who is thinking aboutpurchasing this electric razor. It came a lot quicker than I had expected I did not order expedited shipping but it did come about 3-4 days after I placed the order over a weekend.</li>
            <li> Not one for writing reviews but had to say that I was somewhat apprehensive at first in buying this. After I got it, it actually sat in the package for nearly a week before I tried it on various areas. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it cut and trimmed with almost no irritation even on the first use. After \\&quot;grooming\\&quot; areas that most men are probably down right afraid to try let alone allow anything sharp to come within a foot of, there were no nicks, not cuts, no razor burn.  This is a great product for anyone, man or woman who wants to trim, cut or groom below the neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll dispense with the pro forma encomiums of praise for this gadget&#x27;s grooming properties: they&#x27;re good. Whether it&#x27;s a clean shave (as close as a razor, but with much less attendant ingrown hair irritation) or a meticulous, even-haired trim, this product&#x27;s one of the best on the market. But given its obvious purpose as a groomer for MEN, particularly the hirsute subgroup, it seems remarkable that the design team omitted to consider that men are no more able to shave their backs alone than fly without wings. No grooming tool for men worth its salt can be sold on the premise that shaving must be a two-person operation if the entire body is to be tended to. Accordingly, this otherwise excellent tool gets a grudging 3 stars from me, as I had to purchase an entirely different product merely to cater to my back hair.</li>
            <li> So this is a very good razor/shaver except the other day I was shaving my head and I found out if you press down too hard it shaves more because it bends closer to the blade. I wouldn&#x27;t be mad but I was not pressing very hard as it is. My two sense.</li>
            <li> I find anything with batteries wares out far too soon.</li>
            <li> Battery life is horrid, I&#x27;ve had this for less than a year and it loses a charge almost immediately</li>
            <li> After much research, i decided to purchase the bodygroomer for my boyfriend for xmas. All the reviews will tell u norelco is the best and its no lie. Spend the extra bucks!</li>
            <li> Really great product, not sure why they say not to use it on your beard or goatee, but I have and it works really great.  It also works really great every where else, I feel comfortable when using it down below and haven&#x27;t had any nicks, scraps or cuts.  Does a really nice job no matter where you use it, very easy to use.  The only down side is it&#x27;s long charge time and it&#x27;s short usage time.  50 mins sounds like a lot, but I seem to be charging it more than I want.</li>
            <li> Great product works perfectly</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was hesitant to buy this product. The idea of razors in my man zones made me a little uneasy. However, it faded after I used it the first time.  The coolest things about the Norelco are that it is 2 sided. You can have a smooth shave or a trim. I&#x27;ve put both to the test. The trimmer side is much more effective when dry (great for trimming underarms) and the shaver side is great both dry and wet. I prefer to use it in the shower. The most important lesson I learned is to really take it slow on the sensitive parts. The first go I nicked myself a few times. Other than that there have been no complaints.  Oh, and it is really easy to clean. Both sides of the Norelco pop off or up (in the case of the trimmer) to allow for easy cleaning.  The only downside is that if you are pretty hairy and slow going you may run out of juice before you are done. I&#x27;ve come close a few times.</li>
            <li> Great price, delivery and product. I bought this for my wife to us I her legs so she can toss out the disposable razor. After using it for three weeks she decided she will. Keep using it. Like any electric razor, it does not cut as close as a blade but it&#x27;s quicker, easier and does not nick the skin.</li>
            <li> Good product. Wish there was a shorter setting than #1 on the trimmer.</li>
            <li> received as listed.&lt;br /&gt;very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;versatile.&lt;br /&gt;240v-120v no additional adapter required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons, it would be even better if it collected the shavings.</li>
            <li> So alot of people have been saying how this is amazing, I bought into the hype and got it.  Im not gonna be all negative and say this product is terrible and whatnot, I will say it doesn&#x27;t work for ME.  I have very thick hair and this shaver doesnt seem to be able to get it off close to the skin, it leaves a very small amount close to the skin.  However, this is enough to be scratchy and also tug on undergarments, making it extremely itchy and uncomfortable.  For someone with thinner hair (think blondies generally), this should be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;VERY SAFE! Used a few times over the past week and a half to try and get used to it, and I must say the engineers at Philips really made a safe piece here.  No knicks, no panics, nothing.  I could use this with my eyes closed&lt;br /&gt;Nifty charging mechanism&lt;br /&gt;5 trim lengths&lt;br /&gt;Water proof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not a very close shave - this is the killer&lt;br /&gt;Motor on the trimmer seemed weak&lt;br /&gt;Even though it did not catch or cut my skin, it did cause some minor irritation, but this can be fixed with moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a okay product, fancy packaging etc, but overall I was slightly disappointed with it. I am in the military and when I shave I want a close shave, and when I am allowed to have a beard I need to keep it trimmed. The beard/body hair trimmer is disappointing and kills the battery, the stop that locks the trimmer height easily slips to a lower setting, providing disastrous results. The close skin trimmer, takes a quite few passes to get close, but not that close. The item also doesn&#x27;t have a port to plug and use, so if it isn&#x27;t charged don&#x27;t plan on using it. Such a pain I don&#x27;t even use it anymore, sits under the sink.</li>
            <li> IM A WOMAN! from a woman&#x27;s perspective, I have never been able to find an intimate shaver that actually made me smooth but this shaver does the job and doesn&#x27;t leave cuts. You can go in all directions with it and has a comb and then a close shaver to make sure you are as smooth as possible. I think it works better dry but works in the shower as well. GREAT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lady. Yeah, I know this product is marketed for you guys; but I&#x27;ve been searching for an alternative to razor-shaving my bikini area. It can be a hassle not to mention risky, and I wasn&#x27;t keen on trying waxing. I&#x27;ve tried women&#x27;s bikini area trimmer/shavers and they don&#x27;t work worth crap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After discovering this shaver and reading the review posted by \\&quot;1.4.the.team\\&quot;, I was convinced. To 1.4.the.team, I have to say, \\&quot;thank you\\&quot;. Any guy willing and brave enough to test drive a body groomer on their boys is a hero in my book. Your review was informative, enlightening and, yeah, at times comical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my body groomer 7 months ago and I love it. I&#x27;m completely satisfied. It provides the silky-smooth shave I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had the problem with the battery charge not lasting long. Of course, I realize I don&#x27;t have all the hair you guys have to get rid of. So my idea of a long-lasting charge may be irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s your turn. Read the reviews if you want, then click \\&quot;add to cart\\&quot;. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for shaving everything below the neck, if youre gonna shave in the groin area use a sensitive shaving gel. first take a hot shower, it opens up the skin pores. next put in a sensitive shave gel. let it sit for about 2 minutes. then shave. after u are doing shaving down there use a moisture gel. let that dry then put a LITTLE talc-free power, i used goldbond for sensitive skin. Men! NEVER EVER use a razor.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t hold charge.&lt;br /&gt;Noisy.&lt;br /&gt;Shakes like crazy while in use.&lt;br /&gt;Can not use it in personal areas - cuts like a cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owned this for one year now. Worst purchase in along time.</li>
            <li> I owned the previous version of this groomer, and of course now own this one as well.  My old one stopped holding a charge and the cutting heads became exposed and started to cut my skin (after about 4 years), so it was time to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and purchased this model and have been using it for about 9-10 months.  It works, although I would say it pulls hair out just as often as it cuts it.  The previous model did this, too, but not quite as often.  They did change the shape and head design slightly on this model, so it&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s hitting the skin differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about this model is the separation between the \\&quot;razor\\&quot; part and the hair trimmer part.  If you have more hairy areas, you can knock it down quickly and efficiently with the bottom part of this device, and then follow up with the top part to get it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, is this a baby-smooth shaving experience?  Heck no.  It&#x27;s good enough for me, but please don&#x27;t expect perfectly smooth skin if you have typical \\&quot;man hair\\&quot; in various \\&quot;man places\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is pretty good on this model.  It was pretty good on the original as well, but this new one seems to be lasting longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one seems sturdier.  With the old model, the cutting head would constantly pop out of the top while I was using it.  With this upgraded model, they&#x27;ve apparently fixed that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature of this improved model is the hair cutting portion at the bottom.  It has a built-in adjustable hair length selector.  On the old model, I had three little blue pieces I had to clip on depending on my preference on hair length.  Those pieces always got misplaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone that needs to do basic body grooming activities.  It&#x27;s solid.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to take care of grooming my unmentionables and the occasional buildup of neck hair in-between my every-two-week haircuts.  This trimmer is absolutely perfect for these two functions. Very high quality device and I&#x27;m very pleased that I bought it.  Do yourself a favor and throw down 50 bucks on this.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying \\&quot;I NEVER LEAVE REVIEWS\\&quot;. This thing was just too awesome not to share.    Folks, I have tried Braun, Shick, other Norelco&#x27;s, 4 blade razors, 5 blade razors, straights razors, on and on and on to no avail. I was so tried of the cuts and pain. Saw this little beauty when I searched for \\&quot;ball shavers\\&quot; on Amazon (I was surprised that \\&quot;ball shavers\\&quot; actually returned results). Reviews were really good so I thought I&#x27;d give my perfect ball shave quest one more try and I&#x27;m glad I did. This thing performed beyond my wildest dreams. No cuts, no nicks, no blood, no pain (just make sure you pull the skin tight and perform on dry/clean skin). I was able to do the frank and beans, leather cheerio, upper legs, chest, arm pits, and feet within 10 minutes.    I first started shaving \\&quot;below the neck\\&quot; while deployed to Iraq because it was the only way to prevent \\&quot;desert rot\\&quot;. Hairy, confined areas breed bacteria which equals funk. It has always been a painful endeavor...until now. I wish they had this thing ten years ago! I registered my shaver with Norelco online and they gave me a 5 year warranty! Care instructions are clear and easy to follow. Replacement blades are only needed once a year and are cheap here on Amazon (under $12). Norelco even has a 45 day money back guarantee on this thing.    BUY IT! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t as close as I expected, but I LOVE IT. I can use it in the shower so no more mess! I first trim the hair down if too long, then use the shaver to do the rest. It works great and is waterproof so don&#x27;t be afraid to get a little wet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the men out there.. I use this on the scrotal area with NO PROBLEMS. It is an area of very loose skin so one would think that any product that shaves that area would cause cuts or get caught in the blade. You will NOT have that problem with this shaver. I use it over the scrotal area and you do not even have to go slow!</li>
            <li> The top end in the picture works great.  The long handle makes it easy to reach tough areas.  However, the regular buzz cutter clippers on the bottom do not work that well after a few uses.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver that has worked on my beard. I love both features. The battery life on it is unlike any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. It lasts me a really long time and it charges back up very quick too!</li>
            <li> All I know id my husband liked this gift. It has a shaver on one end and a trimmer on the other, which means you can do both without having to change heads/attachments. It is also water proof and can be used in the shower. The battery lasts a good 50 minutes. his only negative comment was that it is a bit loud. I enjoyed getting him something practical that he actually got excited about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: 2.5 yrs later, this thing is still going strong. sometimes i use it too and it works great!</li>
            <li> you knew that was coming right?    First, it looks cool.  It has a very cool charger, very modern and sleek looking, if a bit larger than some of our other trimmers.  It charges relatively fast, and that is always a good thing.    One thing I did have an issue with is the spacing between the teeth.  If you ahve longer hair anywhere on your body, this could cause some snags and pulling.    My husband used this on a small area of his chest, and it worked great, though because of the space between the teeth, I don&#x27;t think the shave was as close as a handheld razor would provide, but it did the job.    This worked very well on my bikini line as well, and the waterproof casing allowed me to take it into the shower.    All in all, it&#x27;s a body groomer/trimmer. It is a little pricier than some of the other models out there, and in reality they all have the same features, so for the price you could do worse, but for a lot less you can do just as good.</li>
            <li> Nice 2 in 1. Fairly large but does hold enough charge for a 3-4 day trip easily.</li>
            <li> There are several things I REALLY like about this product, but there&#x27;s also room for improvement.  First, the battery last a really long time between charges.  Second, you can truly use the shaver head on sensitive area&#x27;s without worrying about getting nicked.  Third, it goes through the hair quickly and smoothly even if it&#x27;s a little long.      The only area where I think there is room for improvement is the size of the shaver head.  It&#x27;s so large that it can be difficult to work with and get into some areas.      I had a \\&quot;body bare\\&quot; shaver before this that was nice and compact, however it occasionally nicked things (ouch) and it didn&#x27;t hold a charge very well at all.  It did give a nice close shave and was very compact. The other downside was it couldn&#x27;t handle very long hair at all.</li>
            <li> So nice work better than expected and expectations were high</li>
            <li> It hurts your skin sometime</li>
            <li> Use it all the time to trim and groom. Well don Phillips</li>
            <li> Perfect so far no complaints!!</li>
            <li> does not shave any part of your body good. all it is good for is shaving your arms &amp; legs a bit closer. not a good clean shave on any part of the body. leaves bumps on legs, hurts on other parts of body.  do not buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of this item in a row and both times the battery died within six months. It&#x27;s such a well known issue that the website &#x27;ifixit&#x27; has a guide on how to replace the batteries of this specific model. It&#x27;s a shame since the overall quality of the shaver is quite good otherwise. Planned obsolescence? who knows. Do yourself a favor and google &#x27;Philips Norelco BG2040 ifixit&#x27; to see the type of maintenance you will have to perform or be willing to buy a new one every six months or so when the battery dies.</li>
            <li> The shaver is great, I hate the charging stand though.  It works...sort of.  Pretty unstable, it could be better.</li>
            <li> Nice product, easy to use. The only issue that it has is that it hurts a little when the charge is low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this about 2 years now and it&#x27;s been good.  About once a week I use the trimmer to my face for a minute or two.  No big deal.  About 4 months ago I noticed that the unit began to have a shorter battery life.  I would leave the unit charging but it would never get a full charge according to the light on it.  The light blinks green when charging and is a steady green when fully charged.  Well, the unit never gets a steady green anymore and it fact the charging light goes off completely even when in the charger.  If quickly remove it from the charger and put it back then it blinks green again to indicate it&#x27;s charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I attempt to use it you can hear that there isn&#x27;t a lot of juice left.  An orange light also blinks when the unit is about to die and that light comes on fairly quickly even after it&#x27;s been charging for hours.  The unit gets no more than 3-4 minutes of use now before going dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even attempted to swap out the stock batteries with a much better brand.  This fix worked but it doesn&#x27;t want to charge.  These days I have to swap the AAA batteries out when they go dead since I can&#x27;t get the unit to charge anymore.  Here&#x27;s a guide if you&#x27;re interested.  https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Philips+Norelco+BG2040-34+BodyGroom+7100+Battery+Replacement/27145</li>
            <li> Makes quick work of hair, but doesn&#x27;t cut quite as smooth or close as I&#x27;d hoped.  The clipper end would be better if you could cut closer as well, while still leaving the guard on for a clip shorter than 1/4&amp;#34;, but longer than bare skin.</li>
            <li> this is a great trimmer to do &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; below the belt. Works great and no danger of a mishap.</li>
            <li> This shaver is designed for the neck down.  For a long time, I have wanted a shaver like this but couldn&#x27;t decide if I wanted to spend the money but now that I did, I am glad.  I used it for the first time last night down to the belly -- will have to try \\&quot;further\\&quot; when I have more time.  Where I did shave, I was pleased with the closeness of the shave.  Over all, I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect Product&lt;br /&gt;User Friendly</li>
            <li> Works perfect,  does exactly as described.  It&#x27;s just hard to use around the corner.</li>
            <li> Great present for Christmas</li>
            <li> Great product, I gave this to my boyfriend and I&#x27;m pleased to say that he loves and it and uses it all the time. Of course I get to benefit too, I&#x27;m not into cavemen hehe..     This shaves and trims, and feels great in the hand, the design feels very natural and comfortable, nothing worse than trying to balance a piece of buzzing equipment near your features, this works great on all sorts of body hair and is much better than a plain razor, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Really fantastic razor and trimmer; it does a very nice job on everything below the face.  Be careful and slow in some areas (if I need to spell it out, you shouldn&#x27;t be buying this for yourself) and stay on top of keeping it trimmed, because the foil trimmer part is a lot easier to use on &amp;#34;those areas&amp;#34; than the sharper razor and blades therein.  Keeps a nice charge going as well.  Much easier to use on areas that are flatter (chest and abs) than rounder, just like a normal razor -- but still works very nicely on uneven areas.  Rounded foil head is a godsend keeping those leg/torso junction areas neat and clean.</li>
            <li> best groomer on the market, wish you change your own batteries but overall very satisfied.</li>
            <li> SO far, its the best grooming tool i have ever had. Its very convenient to use. Quick reCharge. Good battery life as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after using it like a year... Battery is NEAR to Dead.</li>
            <li> I think the other reviewers have said most of what I&#x27;d planned to say, so I&#x27;ll try to add comments that fill in some of the gaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I am one of those people an earlier reviewer referred to as a \\&quot;Yeti.\\&quot;  If I didn&#x27;t groom throughout the year, I wouldn&#x27;t need to wear a coat in the winter. Since I don&#x27;t live in Siberia, this is a significant problem because the ladies (below the arctic circle) don&#x27;t like this sort of thing. I have to groom several times a week, and this unit does it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can adjust the depth of the one end to trim my goat, adjust the depth again to trim my eyebrows, then flip it over to clean up the perimeter of the goat, my sideburns, and remove anything on my neck and ears.  I typically use a razor to shave, but I&#x27;ve found I can actually razor shave every other day by banging out a quick shave with the foil end, if I don&#x27;t have an important meeting at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed right out of the box because it was easy to open, and the form fitting tray holding the unit was actually high tech molded paper, so most of the packaging was recyclable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can reach it, I can trim it cleanly and painlessly with this unit.  Now if the Norelco engineers can just figure out how I can trim the center of my back without help, they will really be onto something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually a situation where the few extra dollars are totally worth it.  Very good, high quality engineering on this device.</li>
            <li> Just got one. Works quite well, does not cut your balls and gives a decent shave. Does not seem like another product could beat it.</li>
            <li> After reading many good reviews I decided to buy this particular trimmer.  It looks nice and charged quickly. As soon as I started using it I noticed it was pulling hairs out rather than cut them.  I made sure the battery was fully charged.  Again I started using it and it was pulling out hairs.  Ok, I&#x27;m portuguese but my hair isn&#x27;t that thick.  Then after I decided to man up and keep trimming I cut myself.  Keep in mind the area I am talking about trimming is my sack and dong.  So after the trimmer drew blood, I said enough was enough.  I packaged the unit back up and returned it.  Hopefully they don&#x27;t just resell it because I think I left some blood and pewbs in it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good body trimmer.</li>
            <li> i paid a lot of money for this and used it on my nether regions, like youre supposed to be able too. first time it chewed into some skin...i almost threw it accross the room. months later and tired of using bics i thought id try it again...assuming i wasnt careful enough the first time (even though in my heart i knew i was) i took things slow and guess what happened, the thing chewed into my skin again. this time i did throw it so i knew i wouldnt use it again. i actually picked it up and theew it in the trash..what a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;using regular razors is so much simpler and if you get a nick, thats all it is!! the bodygroom actually &#x27;chews&#x27; into your skin. dont buy!!</li>
            <li> I have used this electric shaver two times so far.  The instructions state to fully charge before first use, so I charged it for about 6 to 8 hours the first day, then unplugged it before bed and plugged it up the next morning before college.  It was still saying that it wasn&#x27;t fully charged when I came home which was maybe 4 hours.  Regardless, it finally fully charged, and I used the trimmer a little later that day on the shortest setting and it done a good job, so I was very happy about that part.  Later that night or the next day, I used the shaver in the shower.  It didn&#x27;t do a perfect job (which is why I gave it 4 stars), but I was definitely happy with it as it gave me a very good shave in less time vs a Gillette Razor.  It&#x27;s just something that you will get better with as you use it more.  I was a little nervous about using it on my balls and still haven&#x27;t.  I just used the razor as I feel more comfortable with that. The second time I used it, I felt much more comfortable with it and felt I did a better job.    I started shaving down there maybe a year ago and finally got tired of the upkeep, so I quit grooming and boy did I hate it after it grew back out.  I seen this shaver and heard several good reviews, so I gave it a shot, and i&#x27;m glad I did.  I REALLY like the fact that you can use it in the shower.  It gives a pretty close shave, but it does miss hairs, but so does a razor.  If you&#x27;re contemplating spending the money, in my opinion, do it.  On my last shave, I used the electric shaver, then used the Gillette razor over that to finish it off and I was happy with it.  I like this electric shaver a lot, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is just because the shave isn&#x27;t excellent, and the battery life didn&#x27;t seem to be the specified 50 minutes on a full charge, but as long as it last long enough to do the job once, then I don&#x27;t mind putting it on the charger to refill for the next time.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for the price. The body shaver head works great and is easy to use and clean. The lower pubic region head does an ok job wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the power it had, and I trim often so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s thick hair either. Overall it&#x27;s a good purchase</li>
            <li> This Shaver / Trimmer Shaves and Trims your ...body as advertised! The downside as while you can use it in the shower, the shaver head just doesn&#x27;t work well when you&#x27;re wet.  It&#x27;s much easier to do when dry. There&#x27;s no irritation or anything. The build quality is extremely high. I own this, and a Sonicare toothbrush from Philips and am impressed by the high quality.  The charge lasts a long time, and the cradle is extremely convenient. I would highly suggest using this body trimmer!</li>
            <li> Purchased the BG2040 to groom areas around surgery incisions to make life easier on everybody involved.  Very helpful for keeping areas clean for taping, massage, etc. for post-surgery Physical Therapy.    I was amazed how well the BG2040 performs.  It&#x27;s easy to get carried away and this unit does it all... wet or dry... extremely well!      Great for athletes trying to keep areas (previously feared to trim) trimmed for comfort and proper hygiene.    Worth the investment in every way - I cannot recommend this unit enough!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be the first shaver and trimmer that would work on the groin area but no matter how tight the skin is pulled or not pulled it still grabs the skin and leaves red spots,I don&#x27;t how other people do so well but I am not pleased with the results so far</li>
            <li> This thing cuts through my body hair like butter. It is incredibly helpful  to have in the shower to trim my body hair to a reasonable length. It also works well as an electric razor to do clean-up work after a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any cuts, nor any issues with the battery personally.</li>
            <li> I use to have an older version of this product, but after 2 or 3 years, is out of order and needed to replace, I tried so far two times and I am quite happy with it.       Feels very comfortable on my hand and does its work easily.</li>
            <li> Great shaver / trimmer, though user might want to be careful not to swing/move it too fast as the shaver unit is not very secure, comes off rather easily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit recently and was extremely disappointed that it broke after using it only a few times.      Amazon would not replace the unit. They gave me partial refund only.  Now when I go back on Amazon, the price has increased from $58 to $65.    I bought this to replace the original BodyGroom because the blade kept falling out and the battery was dying.  As soon as I used this one, it had the same problem.  The head blade falls out repeatedly while you are using it.  After just a few uses, the head blade just broke and would not go back in.</li>
            <li> I have used all three BG series shavers from Philips-Norelco. This one is surely the most convenient. I did like the ease of all the shaving solutions in one neat package, no need to change attachments. However, the one main problem still remains with BG series shaver, use the blade at slightly weird angle and the attachment comes off. slightly annoying, but I can ignore it for the good results.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what every guy who likes to keep the downstairs grass trimmed or shaved needs... Its Awesome - especially when putting something sharp in that area is scary... No Nicks no Cuts No hassles... Works like magic...</li>
            <li> Ok, same as the previous models - which I liked.</li>
            <li> .....but I felt obligated this time, given the quality of this product.  What everyone here is saying is true, this electric razor is da bomb.  I took it out of the box, charged it in less time than the directions stated, and started using it immediately.  I did my left arm up to my elbow, took about two minutes.  The thing you&#x27;re gonna want to hear is:  my Gillette Fusion 5-blade razor can&#x27;t shave me better than this product.  The skin is as smooth as baby butt, without the nicks and cuts.  Like the other reviewers here, get this razor ASAP, you won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Love it. So far, well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Not the closest shave, but a great product.</li>
            <li> It works OK, but is unnecessary IMO. I&#x27;ve been trimming and shaving frank and the boys for about a year now using an old beard   trimmer and Gillette Fusion razor.  The trimmer end of the tool works pretty well, but I&#x27;m not sure why Norelco even bothered with the foil shaver. A regular   old razor is much more effective, quicker, and you get a better shave.  Problem I see is that a lot of pubic hair can lay flat against the skin or at an angle, and the foil shave is useless on those hairs, while a   razor will lift and cut them right off.  I&#x27;d been happier if Norelco would have omitted the foil shaver end and sold the trimmer for half the price.</li>
            <li> After hesitating for a long time to purchase this groomer and reading all the reviews here, I finally made the purchase. It is everything others have commented on. I like it a lot and would recommend this product if this is the kind of appliance you are looking for.    The price was right and a rebate added the final touch. The product shipped and was received quickly with out any troubles.    Norelco has a great product and Amazon did a great job filling the order.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to take hair off of whole body. Have to go over the same area a lot of times. I was looking for a groomer that would take the hair off in a couple of passes. This does not do it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for all the male parts. Had for a couple of years now and is still going strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, I used it for everywhere except under arms as I prefer not to shave those areas with razor. I am not giving it 5 stars because it does not work perfect once you are wet which I was expecting before buying it. this is a down side of all razors I believe.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend against this product strongly enough.  The trimmer part is fine; it gets the job done, which is why I&#x27;m giving the product a two-star rating, but it&#x27;s nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real problem here is the shaver side.  Like many others who have written reviews, I chose to ignore the negative reviews that detailed horror stories of cuts, gashes, and &amp;#34;craters&amp;#34; left in the wake of this product.  $75 dollars and a full year of intermittent (and painful) attempts later, I&#x27;m writing my review to add my warning, for what it&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been fortunate not to experience any gashes or &amp;#34;craters&amp;#34; while using this shaver.  Every single time I have used it to try to shave my most sensitive area, however, I have been left bleeding and in pain.  Some have claimed that the foil can catch on dry skin, causing the head to tilt and the side trimmers (which I will get to shortly) to cut the skin.  While this might happen in some instances, the foil itself is actually responsible for the large majority of injuries I have sustained.  Somehow, no matter whether I prep the area to be shaved by leaving it as, pulling it tight, or anywhere in between, the foil manages to create the sensation that the skin is being pinched in that area hundreds of times per second, and ultimately the friction and pinching result in cuts to my skin, blood, pain, buyer&#x27;s remorse, resistance of the urge to break the product in half and burn it in occult celebration, and longing for the original Body Groom that I threw away when I bought this one (although not necessarily in that order).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The side trimmers cause their own issues.  The row of teeth that moves back and forth in order to cut the hairs is actually on the skin side, not the backside as you would expect.  On my old Body Groom, for whatever reason, this was never an issue and never caused any pain.  On this one, the friction that results from contact with sensitive skin hurts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About that old Body Groom I owned.  What a great product!  It had no trimmer side like the Pro does, and of course it had its own design issues, but compared to this one...well, there really is no comparison, except to say that the old one actually did what it was supposed to do.  Oh, and the original Body Groom emitted only a moderate noise, just strong enough to give me confidence that it was going to get in, get the job done, and get out.  When I turned the new one on, I was actually startled.  The sheer volume and tone of the noise this bad boy put out should have clued me into the fact that using it would be more like trying to shave with a hedge trimmer than a razor.  But back to the original...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could shave and trim anywhere in the target area with no cuts or abrasions, and the results were always to my liking.  When I was given a Target gift card and was wondering what to get, I came across this item and thought &amp;#34;Man, if mine works so well, the Pro version must be even better!&amp;#34;  In fact, my positive experience with the old Body Groom was why I chose to ignore the negative reviews.  How I rue the day I bought this and threw the old one in the trash.  It was on that day that I said goodbye to the level of grooming with which I had become accustomed because it is simply impossible to replicate the results with the Body Groom Pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a quick word on the &amp;#34;3D Pivoting Head&amp;#34; that they advertise.  The sheer amount of force required to get this shaving head to tilt up and down, much less left and right, is going to guarantee you a very, very painful result.  That is all.</li>
            <li> I bought this in February 2011.  Worked well for the first couple years.  I didn&#x27;t use it that much, maybe once or twice a month.  Recently its completely stopped holding a charge.  The charge lasts about 10 minutes when fresh.  When I put it away for just a day, it won&#x27;t hold the charge at all.  Most electric face shavers I have I use daily or every other day and they last over 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, guys if you think this makes it easy to trim your back yourself, think again.  You have to have the flexibility of a yogi or get someone to do it for you.</li>
            <li> Using actively twice a week, great shaver and trimmer. Norelco quality!</li>
            <li> Good and easy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;والله انها تهبل&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V 220 run&lt;br /&gt;تشتغل على 220</li>
            <li> These are great!!! The charge last for a long time. And the versatility is bar none. It&#x27;s gets as close a shave a razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it would become my only hair shaving/trimming tool.   1) The trimmer aspect of the Bodygroom is great. The adjustable guard is good quality (stays locked in at desired length, isn&#x27;t too flimsy)  2) The foil shaver aspect is decent. I have coarse hair and sensitive skin, but it gave me a smooth shave without irritation.  The fact that it can be used in the shower is pretty nice also.    3) The downside of the shaver aspect is the edger. Well, actually edgers. It inexplicably has one on both sides of the foil screen, so I can imagine this could be trouble for someone trying to shave one area while leaving a beard. It would be all too easy to bump into and end up trimming where you didn&#x27;t want to.    Also, it causes problems when shaving the mustache area. I was unable to shave a couple hairs right under my nose, because the edger thing sticks out just far enough that I couldn&#x27;t get up to it.  That, and the edger thing kept hitting the bottom of my nose which is a little painful after a couple times.    4) The charger apparatus is awkward.</li>
            <li> My BG2020&#x27;s battery was biting the dust so decided to make the upgrade to the BG2040.  It&#x27;s considerably larger but it didn&#x27;t cause me issues.  Having the trimmer on the opposite side with an integrated guard prevented a lot of having to pick up the snapped off blue guards of the 2020.  It doesn&#x27;t glide along my skin as well as the 2020&#x27;s curved guards did, but it gets the job done.  I was wary a bit earlier of the flexible shaving head of the 2040 but in practice it appeared to improve contact and cutting over that of the 2020&#x27;s over all body bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to guage battery life, but I am overall pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product until I tried it. It worked great for the couple times. I charged it 100% before the first use, and got about 4 uses out of it before the battery died. I went to charge it back up, and sure enough, it doesn&#x27;t charge...at all. I&#x27;ve tried several different power outlets to no avail. Hopefully they will send me a replacement...</li>
            <li> The only all in one you need. Cool design, excellent quality and works great.  I have tried alot of different razors and trimmers, this is finally the one i will keep.</li>
            <li> Npt that good - might be good for the balls but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> this works very well for trimming body hair in your arm bits and nether regions. The top is the close shaver side and bottom is for buzzing off larger quantities of hair at once. this will let you get an almost bare skin look if you spend the time on it but you still need to be carful because any electric razor including this one can and will cut you if your not careful(work to men shaving their pubic area).</li>
            <li> but this machine it&#x27;s have bad shaving but otherwise it&#x27;s agood  water proof and touching button thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nasser alshahrani here</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this thinking it was a standard shaver. It does not work well for that lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I decided to use it and give my thoughts. I&#x27;ve never used a body shaver before so I have no point of reference. But this shaver was easy to use and worked very well. It is ergonomically designed and comfortable to use. I had a couple of pulls but nothing remarkable or unexpected. It is easy to clean and looks nice on the its charger. It could use a little better documentation but I was able to figure out how to disassemble the shaving head easily enough without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am impressed by the design and quality of this product and can easily recommend it.</li>
            <li> As advertised this is a great razor for the neck down. It&#x27;s waterproof so its great for shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> This device is the best trimmer/clipper for body hair that I have ever owned.     First, it&#x27;s worth discussing the bottom of the device - the \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; trimmer or clipper part. It is unexceptional, and works fine. You can shorten hair with it. It has a nice captive adjustable plastic guard you can set the length with. Most trimmers only offer this functionality.     However, with most trimmers/clippers, if you want a very close trim or near-shave, you will need to remove the plastic guards, and that&#x27;s when you start being able to cut yourself. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve nicked part of my body with a host of other products.     I&#x27;ve never cut myself with the Philips Bodygroom system. And that&#x27;s because of the other side - the top.    The top of the device is a rotating head, with two short trimmers and an electric shaver foil in-between them. The trimmers on top are small, don&#x27;t stick out far, and are not really designed to do an amazing job cutting all your hair off. What they do is trim very effectively, without almost any possibility of cutting yourself.     This means you can just wave this thing all over your body, in many lazy passes, without having to worry about nicking or hurting yourself. If it takes many passes sometimes - who cares! It&#x27;s fast, easy, and safe. Once you&#x27;ve trimmer hair, you use the foil in the middle to get a close shave, optionally. The foil requires a slower hand, and requires you to hold the body groom perpendicular to your hair, and move it more deliberately.     In other words, tilt this thing back and forth over your body, lop off all the hair, and then shave, slowly, holding it perpendicular. That&#x27;s the best way to use it.     Also, the trimmers are less effective when your hair is wet. Since they&#x27;re a bit sloppy and tend to miss things, you want your hairs dry and \\&quot;perky\\&quot; so the trimmers will lop them right off. Remember, the tradeoff is to be forced to make a couple passes - what you gain is a complete assurance thatyou won&#x27;t cut yourself. The foil shaver, however, works best while wet - like anything you need to make a close shave with.    What I like to do is trim all my body, quickly, a couple times while standing in the shower, then turn on the water, take a shower, and slowly use the foil to shave. It&#x27;s incredibly easy, incredibly fast, and works perfectly. And the bodygroom is waterproof, so you can just leave it in the bathroom or shower and charge it every a week or two.    I strongly recommend the bodygroom.</li>
            <li> I bought the BG2040 to replace my dying BG2020. I like the new dual-head design and improved ergonomics of the handle.</li>
            <li> I have had this for awhile and I noticed even when I got it that the battery in it doesn&#x27;t last. You end up charging it more than you use it. I would recommend trying a different product as there has to be one that keeps a charge.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally like to write these things, but I thought I would give it a shot. This shaver has a great design to it. I love how light weight and easy to use. I am glad I bought this shaver. I have been looking for the right one and I have found it. I was skeptic at first because I have purchased Norelco products in the past and they have cut my face. This Norelco is an excellent shaver, and it is good for shaving all areas. Easy to clean and has a nice place to store it. Looks good on my shelve next to  my sink.</li>
            <li> Got this for my fiancée for Christmas because she wanted something to shave her naughty bits.  She loves it and I can certainty say it shaves smooth.</li>
            <li> does it&#x27;s job.  good product.  no complaints. now I don&#x27;t know what else to say.  filling in the empty space.</li>
            <li> This item feels like it is built very well. It has a little weight to it but i think that can be a good thing. At least its not all plastic. personally i think the item is a little over priced but i still love the item itself. works great.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how great this groomer is!  It is excellent for anything below the neck;  you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> THIS THING HURTS. I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad one or something but the shaving blades facing up and down feel like I am cutting nerve endings instead of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this would be a better alternative to using a trimmer -&amp;#62; razor shave but the pain this thing inflicts is not worth the time I save.</li>
            <li> I simply love this product. It is a quality product of Phillips, which is serving my purpose satisfactorily for more than a year now. It has two ends - one for trimming body hair and another for shaving (including sensitive areas) without any cuts or scratches on the skin. It is easy to clean/wash-off since it is water resistant. You can literally rinse it with tap water. It can hold battery charge for quite a long time as well (2-3 months for once/twice use per month).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas... being a woman, I really don&#x27;t know about body groomers so I went out on a limb based on these reviews and he LOVES IT! He used to break out when he used his old body groomer and it&#x27;d be a big, bloody mess. He shaves all the time now, and I must say he is mighty smooth :) Happy husband, happy wife.</li>
            <li> I bought this to trim my beard in the shower and it works perfectly. I use the close shave side to get rid of my neckbeard, and the trimmer side to keep it at a nice length. I love being able to take care of it in the shower and not get the counter all messy. It works exactly as I would expect and would recommend it to anyone who likes to trim their beard in the shower.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 2 weeks, then blades seemed to dull and the battery last very very shortly, especially when you use the beard groomer. Not worth your time</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, the build quality is excellent and it looks elegant. The Philips BG2040 works as advertised and I would recommend it to anyone that is considering shaving below their neck line wanting to avoid skin irritation.  Great Product 5/5</li>
            <li> This is probably the best body groomer I have every used. The trimmer feature is so good! It gets everything the first time and is so quick compared to other ones I&#x27;ve used. The shaver head is very good too. Doesn&#x27;t catch or scratch. Definitely worth $60 for a quick trim and shave whenever needed. It only takes about an hour to charge and gives you 50 minutes of battery charge. Best trimmer!</li>
            <li> Effective and easy to use.  Makes shaving a pleasure.</li>
            <li> I replaced the one I had for about ~7 years after it finally died.  I used it almost daily and leave it in the shower and abuse it, so 7 years seems like a decent amount of time for it to last.  Well made product.</li>
            <li> Owned the BG2020 but the head kept popping off while shaving and felt cheap, which is the last thing you want to feel when putting a razor to sensitive parts.  The 2040 feels solid and comfortable. It shaves well after 8 months of use and looks great. If you can&#x27;t decide between the models, spend the extra $, it&#x27;s well worth it to get the 2040.  The only thing I really hope they eventually do is add the ability to dispense lotion, which my face razor does.</li>
            <li> It worked great up until week 3, where the foil that guards the shaving end developed a small hole which grew larger quickly, leading in cuts. I still use the trimming side. No complaints there.</li>
            <li> This model of the Norelco Body Groom is drastically better than the BG2020 model. I had the lower model, but the battery wore out really quickly and it got jammed with hair quickly. This mode is much easier to clean and does a much better job at trimming armpit hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer not too long ago, been about 2 months now and I must have used it 5 to 6 times by now. When I first got it, I charged it for about 10 hours and then used it but the charge only lasted for 12 minutes or so. I thought well maybe it is because I didn&#x27;t charge it long enough etc. So then I charged it for 8 hours the next time and used it and it last for about 10 minutes! I thought it was because of the time lapse between the charge and me using it, since I charged it after I used it and cleaned it after each use. So, then I charged it for 8 hours-ish, then used it right away. Guess what????! It still last about the same time, 10 minutes! Point being...It cannot hold the charge as it claims for 50 minutes after 8 hours of charging, \\&quot;Get 50 minutes of cordless use with an 8-hour charge in the sleek store..\\&quot;    I would not but this and do not recommend you to buy it. Not just because how long it can hold a charge but because you cannot use it while its charging, since it is required to be on the charging stand.    If you do not care about how long it can hold a charge, I would recommend you buy it because it is a good trimmer. I like all the other features on it. The two sided this is really handy and works well! The trimmer end, which is the adjustable, is the best part of it(without having to change the clips)!</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of good review i decided to order this.  It doesn&#x27;t go really close to your skin. I can still see hair after i shave. and i got some cuts too.</li>
            <li> Overall it does what it says it does without any razor burn.  That is a very good thing.  My only complaint with it is the charging system or battery.  I&#x27;m not sure what is wrong but sometimes I have to put it in its cradle a few time or even turn it on and off and then put it in the charging cradle to get it to charge.  Once charged, it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge for very long.  I use it maybe twice a week but within two weeks it is in need of another charge.  Not the eight hours as advertised.  Not sure if it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge or if it isn&#x27;t charging all the way up.  In my opinion, they should lower the price to make it a better deal.  Don&#x27;t think I would pay that much again.  Okay, I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and if I leave it in the charger cradle all the time it works great.  I did have to send the first one back as their was something wrong with its charging system.  I&#x27;ve upgraded the stars from 3 to four base on the new one and the year of use with no problems.  The manufacture was a dream to work with on the replacement too.  Sent me the new one and a return label to send the old one back.  They stand behind the product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not huge, the battery life is good enough to trim your body and facial hair, can be used in the shower, and doesn&#x27;t take any space. It hasn&#x27;t pulled or tugged or ripped out any hair and is pretty boss. It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is everything that the positive reviews claim it to be.  Strong cutting power, barely any nicking at all.  If you want a body trimmer, this is the one for you.  One note - this is a NiMH battery, therefore you must follow the charging instructions to avoid losing capacity due to a memory effect.  Minor detail, not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> thanks for good and nice product</li>
            <li> This does a great job at trimming those \\&quot;special\\&quot; areas lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery seems to last long enough for me and I love the physical design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts well and fits in my hand comfortably.</li>
            <li> After reading some mixed reviews, I can say that this item works great.  I used to shave with a razor and would have lots of irritation.  Not with with product.  I was able to shave chest, groin, and even further below with no nicks or cuts.  Even when using the dry shaving I had no problems.  I recommend using it in the shower though.  A must buy for those guys who like to keep a close trim EVERYWHERE including on the shaft.</li>
            <li> Real close shave and grooms your body realllllly well. I love it! No wonder Philips confidently gives a 45 day money back guarantee, no wonder why! I also thank the reviewers below who greatly helped me decide to go for this purchase!</li>
            <li> It works fantastically, even on my tough thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 3 months now and I&#x27;m still loving it.  Nothing has fallen apart on it or gone defective.  I&#x27;m happy to report it&#x27;s still working really well.    I love the fact that I can \\&quot;manscape\\&quot; without pain.  This has not cut me a single time and since there are some pretty sensitive areas, that&#x27;s an awesome thing.    I&#x27;m not going to get into any details but I&#x27;m enjoying this purchase.  I have absolutely no regrets.</li>
            <li> I would very much recommend this trimmer. I hate body hair and have been using trimmers designed for above the neck line for years.  This is truly an amazing trimmer if your looking for one to help out below the neck..it did a fantastic job on my chest/stomach and below.</li>
            <li> This is the only shaver I&#x27;ve ever had that won&#x27;t nick your ballsack. You can actually just go rambo on your balls and there&#x27;s no chance you&#x27;ll shred your sack like paper -- I don&#x27;t know how it works, but there&#x27;s science in there somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this and the nosehair trimmer by Philips, I&#x27;ve never been so well-groomed.</li>
            <li> i have so much body hair i can be a ape lol     i was worried that this will not be for me but i thought with the 45 money back deal what do i have to loose lol.....    let me just say this is by far the best body shaver i have ever owned ......   im a hairy guy so most trimers take me awhile to use but out of all of them i like this one the best ...    heres why     it dose cut a very close shave i do have to say that the 1st time i used this trimer i was going to fast but i found out if you take your time this will give you a really close shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that the trimmer works great; I have another trimmer and used it in various \\&quot;areas\\&quot; with some success, but also with some problems that I haven&#x27;t had with this one.  However, I&#x27;ve been sick of using blades for shaving for some time and wanted something that I could use quickly and easily in less time and with less mess, and sadly, I&#x27;m still searching.  I can&#x27;t claim to have tried numerous other electric razors (although I have tried some); what I have is (even shaving with just daily stubble, as opposed to bi-weekly or less) is that the skin gets irritated (and even cut and sometimes bleeding) before all the hairs are cut.  I can go over an area once, and 98% of the hair is shaved to a satisfactory level... but that just makes the rest stand out like a sore thumb.  I can go back over and over those areas, irritating my skin in the process, and still have hairs left here and there that really stand out next to closely shaven skin.  On the upside I will admit this (and it&#x27;s the reason I still give it three stars): out of the electric razors I&#x27;ve tried, this is the best one so far.  The head floats in every direction, and I haven&#x27;t had nearly the problems I&#x27;ve had with previous razors.  The fact of the matter is that we&#x27;re all unique, and the skin and the grain of the hair growth (in odd directions) on my face and neck simply doesn&#x27;t seem to be suitable for an electric razor.  Yes, I&#x27;ve tried dry, wet, and wet with shaving cream (at which point it makes no sense to not just use a regular blade anyway).  This unit is also replacing a trimmer, and for that it does a really great job.</li>
            <li> Great product it works really well and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It is simple to use, and convenient.  I shopped for a long time looking for a body groomer, and I am extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little strange looking and the charging stand is pretty cheap.  The length can be a bit awkward but overall it&#x27;s been a very good unit doing everything I&#x27;ve needed it to.  It pulled a hair or two the first time I used it.  But, hasn&#x27;t since.  The shaves aren&#x27;t perfectly smooth or even, but it&#x27;s good enough.  Just takes an extra pass or two to get it there.  I don&#x27;t often go for the clean shave, just a short length.      Pros  Water proof design and nice charging contacts  Replaces my normal face shaver and body trimmer  Fair price to equipment value (far cheaper than many facial shavers)  NO PARTS!  love the fact that there is only one removable attachment, that doesn&#x27;t even need to be removed    Cons  Lit bit of an odd shape  Flimsy and too light charger/holder  Takes a few passes or a freshly washed and dried area to get a nice uniform shave  No plug-in option.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that when the battery dies, the unit dies.      Suprises:  Battery life.  After reading many reviews I was expecting to have to charge this unit every day and go through a painful period of completely draining the battery.  But, it just hasn&#x27;t been so.  I can usually go 3-5 complete trims before the red light will start flashing.  Thinking the flashing means imminent turn off... I left the unit on to complete discharge.  It took over 30 minutes for the unit to turn off after the warning.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s been a hassle to groom in general. After reading the reviews I decided to try this out myself, it works just as they claim, very easy to use and clean and you can use it anywhere. Cradle and inability to shave while plugged to an adapter makes me a little worried, my experience with batteries in rechargeable shaving machines is that they tend to fail after a while. I&#x27;ll update this review if needed.</li>
            <li> This worked beautifully for a month or two, and I had no problems. After a few months, however, the battery life began to drop off. This thing requires ten hours of charging, and is flashing yellow before I&#x27;ve had it in use for five minutes. This requires me to strategize and divide my trimming sessions across the week, as it&#x27;s barely possible to trim my beard on one charge - let alone my full body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it worked well, I loved it. But the battery life dropped so rapidly to near unusable that I cannot recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading a lot of reviews. I used Panasonic, and prefered Panasonic over Philips. After reading all of the reviews I decided to go with this one. I use it to get a haircut, shave my face and everything else. Its a really good system. It does not get 5 stars coz it has terrible battery life. 3-4 shavings and thats it. Not even a week.</li>
            <li> nice and smooth...  My man parts look bigger!</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on all the positive reviews and works amazing. It grooms extremely well the lower area allows you too nicely groom the area above and cleans up well the hair around the boys. You will feel clean and your significant other will love the polished look. Just be very careful around the boys it can slightly pinch on occasion.</li>
            <li> I purchased this personal groomer after my Wahl trimmer started losing battery life.  After reading a lot of reviews I felt confident this item would handle my grooming needs.  Just as reference I am the type of guy that trims everything short and tight about every 3 weeks.  Well this go around I put off my trimming for a couple of weeks in search of a new groomer, due to my old Wahl took about a hour and half to trim everything (dying every 5 min or so and recharge).  I got in my new Philips about 5 weeks after my last trimming session.  It took less than an hour to charge fully right out of the box, which is nice.  Now that it was ready to use I proceeded to use the &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; side first on the #1 guide setting to cut the hair short before switching to the &amp;#34;shaver&amp;#34;.  I honestly tried about 5 different angles and approaches and I could not cut any hair, and would probably still be standing there trying to trim if I did not get out my old Wahl and limped it along to knock the tall hair down.  The Philips guard does not help lift or guide the hair into the trimming blade rendering it totally useless, unless you have all the time in the world to groom.  Once I was ready to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; the Philips actually did a really nice job (chest, stomach, the boys, butt, and back).  Just beware of the angle you are holding the shaver as it will nick you, and most likely in the most sensitive area too (as it did me).  Once you figure out that perfect angle it works great, nice and smooth.  Its design and length allowed me to reach the middle of my back with no problems and not asking for help. So, all in all, this groomer is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; not totally useless but not perfect either.  It has been about 4 days since I shaved and it seems like I will need to redo everything a little sooner than normal too looking at hair growth.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. he uses it for body and facial grooming. its easy to use and clean. I recommend this to anyone out there looking for a groomer for ALL parts of the body!</li>
            <li> Smooth close shave built great, this is all you need for a close shave trim stash side burns what ever. For under sixty bucks its a great deal compared to the rest with there weak construction too many attachments biting nicking pulling crap. You get nun of those ill effects with the BG2040/34 smooth sailing all the way.</li>
            <li> good packing ! but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like to it it&#x27;s not as described it cuts the skin !! , no totally removal for the hair by using the two sided of the groomer !</li>
            <li> Ive had mine over two years and still works great! I just buy replacement blades every four months or so depending on usage. A+++ Beats any other body trimmer. A great Buy!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m with Dr. J. I have no idea why everyone loves this thing. Those cutters on the side of the foil head... I think they&#x27;re literally designed to rip your skin to shreds. I mean, if you take off the top few layers of skin, the hair will certainly go with it, right? And there&#x27;s no avoiding them as far as I can tell... Just when you&#x27;re cruising along, the head will catch on something, pivot, and the side blades go right into your nether bits. The worst part is, because a few people said it takes practice, like a complete idiot I kept trying using different technique, varying pressure, etc. Did I get better with practice? Let&#x27;s just say I had to type this review standing up. I&#x27;d return it, but I&#x27;m going to save it for carving the Turkey next year at Thanksgiving. I bet it&#x27;ll do a great job. Although I hope no one finds out where it&#x27;s been...</li>
            <li> I recommend this product. It is very stylish and compact. Good for trips. You don need lots of adapters in you case. Great!</li>
            <li> I had researched the Norelco body groomers over the past year or so.  I read the reviews for this product &amp; decided that this was the one I wanted to try.  I have had it for just over a month &amp; used it 3 times.  I will have to admit that even with the good reviews I was still a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work as advertised.  I quickly learned that there was nothing to worry about.  I first used the trimmer end to trim the longer hair then switch to the shaver end.  This was the part I was most worried about.  As you can imagine the idea of possible snags while shaving was a big concern.  I was VERY happy with the results.  There were no snags, the shaved area felt smooth &amp; there was no irritation later.  As I stated earlier, I have used it 2 more times &amp; am still happy with it.  I would recommend this body groomer to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really like this electric razor. I&#x27;ve only had one other, which was basically useless. This does a great job. For shaving your face, you will have to go over the fine details with a disposable just to touch up. As for other man-areas, very good!  My biggest problem with this razor is that you can&#x27;t plug the cord directly into the razor. You have to plug it into the charging stand and rest the razor in the stand. This is just one more useless thing to lug around when traveling. Also my bathroom has no, and I mean no, counter top space so I need to charge the razor in my bedroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for 7 months now and the battery barely lasts more than 20 minutes now. I followed all the instruction as far as battery care went and leaving it unplugged and all that, but it still just doesn&#x27;t hold a charge properly anymore. 2 year warranty so I&#x27;ll request an RMA, but that&#x27;s still a pain to have to do.. it should last longer.  That said, when it does work, it works well. Easy to clean. Has some good heft to it and you can tell its of good build quality.  I wish the clipper attachment was a more sturdy kind of plastic, it does bend fairly easy so be careful (you can bend it back if you do accidentally bend it, as long as you&#x27;re gentle).</li>
            <li> You really feel that this is a good quality piece of machine from the minute you hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the battery life. For me it stays for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves very well with no scars or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m a believer :)</li>
            <li> How long has this been available!  was the first question I asked myself after using it  down there.  Using it is easy and very much secure.  With all new confidence I could only  suggest every man to Buy it.  You will never regret.  With no extra  attachments its also convenient to carry along or put it on the counter.</li>
            <li> I purchased the philips noreic bg2040 about a month ago, and i am very happy with the purchase.    What i like most about it is that you don&#x27;t get cut and scratched while you are removing hair 99% percent of the time(even in the groin area!). However if you very very careless, you can still cut ourself, but that is very rare.  Overall i am very comfortable using this, and i don&#x27;t have to constantly be carefull not to cut myself as i did with other triming devices.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Price but battery is already dying fast after only about a dozen uses. FAST Shipping!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best body groomer I&#x27;ve owned. You&#x27;d be hard pressed to hurt yourself with this. No really I tried. After owning many trimmers where you had to be very very careful not to nick the boys, I approached these with the same caution. After a while it seemed too easy, so I really got after it, and still nothing. No pinching no nicks nothing just baby smooth skin. You can more or less blindly shove these anywhere and come out ok. After my SO refused to express an opinion on body hair, I decided to go for the full clean shaven look, it went over so well she has decreed that they shall remain in this fashion. Glad I bought these. Would do it again, and probably at least a few more times.</li>
            <li> Just alright. The hight adjustment adapter is a bit flimsy... Doesn&#x27;t provide a clean shave. Good for trimming only. Have to be careful, can nick you otherwise.</li>
            <li> Love it, easy to use, easy to clean</li>
            <li> This is a well made product. I believe the instructions say do not use above the neck. It would be great if you could shave your face. However, for body hair, the shaver works great. The attachment itself is not adjustable but the cutting blade adjusts to five settings. The closest setting (other than bare skin shaving) could be a little closer in case you want to leave a small length of hair. Other than, that, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This thing is magic. Between shaving with a razor and using a facial hair trimmer, I had essentially scared myself away from the thought of any body hair maintenance, despite my loathing of the weird scraggly creepy long chest and armpit hair I have inherited. But I splurged on this product because of all of the positive reviews. Anyway, I have been able to groom those areas (TMI: and more!) without the worry of a nick or pulled hair. I really like that you can use this wet or dry, too.</li>
            <li> I cant complain about this product, it works really good and you can use it as a shaver machine and a body hair trimer as well. The only thing i can tell is that the battery does not last so much, so you have to recharge very often, however, this product is excelent! Recommended</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a broken BG2030. Love the new design and not having the removable heads which was where the last item failed. Foil head works just as well as the previous model and doesn&#x27;t cause cuts on sensitive areas. Definitely worth the cost for something that does its job this well.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than my previous trimmer. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I started shaving all of the hair on my body a couple of decades ago when I worked as a performer.  I tried everything from epiladies, to waxes, to Nair... and I experienced all of the pain and torture involved with the use of each one.  I no longer work as a performer, but my hair continues to grow back faster and thicker, so I finally resorted to hair clippers once every couple of months and decided that getting a close shave on my body was more trouble than it was worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading an article in a men&#x27;s magazine, I decided to research a bit and it looked like plenty of guys recommended the Philips Bodygroom.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is, Wow!!!  I wish I would have had this thing two decades ago.  It took off the thick hair as fast as my regular clippers but without the random nicks/cuts that I&#x27;ve come to expect from the sharp edges of the Wahl clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smoother side of the Bodygroom allowed me to take care of my underarms and private areas quickly and painlessly... and without any blood associated with straight razors.  Whew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer my Norelco SensoTouch 3d for shaving my face... but the Bodygoom 7100 has won me over when it comes to transforming my winter Chewbacca coat to a smooth physique that allows me to stay MUCH cooler during the hot Texas summers.</li>
            <li> I have purchased and used all kinds of personal grooming devices and this is by far the best.  It does a great job all over.  And I mean ALL OVER.</li>
            <li> I love this body groomer! LADIES DO NOT ASSUME IT ONLY WORKS FOR MEN! I was an adament shaver of my intimate area, but hated the razor burn shaving would leave me with. I&#x27;ve tried lady shavers, but they die or have other issues by the 3 month mark, so I decided to do some research on men&#x27;s products. I will never turn back. With this bodygroomer, I can get the close shave I love without the painful itchiness. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Although it takes practice to get used to its multi-functional design, the Bodygroom Pro Grooming System is quite an efficient body hair shaver for the hirsute among us who want to stay nicely clipped before laying claim to Darwin&#x27;s theories of evolution. At the top is the groomer, which consists of a pivoting shaving head that floats according to the contours and curves of your body no matter how contoured it may be. What makes the design unique is how it allows a comfortable shave without the risk of skin irritation. There are pre-trimmer nodes mounted on both sides of the shaver head, which allows long hair to be cut to lengths that make it easier to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bottom is a more intense trimmer designed to cut longer hair for refined grooming. It can be set to five different lengths depending on the shortness of your hair. There are combs and rounded blades to avoid the risk of nicks. What I appreciate most is how both the shaver foil and the trimmer are made of hypoallergenic material so as to prevent the possibility of skin irritation, allergy, or rash. Helpfully, it&#x27;s waterproof which gives you the flexibility to use it in the shower, and the curved shaft between the groomer and the trimmer has a rubber grip that allows a secure hold even when the Bodygroom is wet. There is a folding stand for storage and recharging, as well as an eight-hour charge that gives you fifty minutes of continuous use. Not only does it keep you well groomed, the Bodygroom itself is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as advertised. By far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Works great for getting a &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; cut on your tender areas but if you want it &amp;#34;razor smooth&amp;#34; you will still have to use a razor.</li>
            <li> The things men go through to look beautiful :-p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to do a little manscaping, this is the perfect electric trimmer to use. It is designed for the body and it works great for keeping myself trim in areas all the areas that I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is simple to use. I use it in the shower to trim hair \\&quot;down there\\&quot;. You can trim it all the way down, or just trim things down to a manageable level. When I first used it, I was a little hesitant, but once I started, things went very smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have experience with other razors like this, but this one is easy to use and is very effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for about 4.5 months now, and it is my go-to for all of my shaving needs. Now, I&#x27;m not one of those guys that likes to have baby-smooth skin on my whole body, and this shaver won&#x27;t do that for you. You can get a very, very close shave with the pivot head, but it won&#x27;t be the same as using a razor, waxing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this shaver is a body groomer and not advertised as a facial hair trimmer, I do use it to trim my beard, and it works very well. I usually use the blade guard on 1 to do this. I also take the guard off to clean up my neck before using a razor. I have very sensitive skin so getting the hairs as short as possible before using a razor helps ease the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is advertised as a body groomer, and body grooming is what it does best. The trimmer blade works very well on the torso, providing a close shave in just a few minutes. Now, for the more sensitive parts of the body, the 3D pivoting head is a charm. For the first time, I can really clean up the most sensitive of body parts without any discomfort, pain, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance and battery life are really good. I usually give it a full charge every few weeks, letting the battery run pretty low before charging. I&#x27;ve never had any hairs get caught within the blades or the foil. It gives a very clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the great performance of the shaver, I commend Philips on the design. It is aesthetically pleasing and has a modern look to it, so I&#x27;m not afraid to leave it on the bathroom counter at times. The ease with which the blade guard can be installed, adjusted, removed is fantastic. And since the guard is adjustable, I don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping up with several guards; there&#x27;s just one, and it&#x27;s alway connected to the shaver. The guard is plastic, but it seems to be of good quality, and I don&#x27;t see it ever breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is a great product, and for the price point, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything better out there. Give it a try, and see for yourself!</li>
            <li> You need to really work through your skin with this one.  And most times, you&#x27;d have to go through the same area a couples of times to get a clean cut.  But if you&#x27;re only looking for a trim, it works great!    The battery life is very short in my opinion (you need to recharge it after using it a few times)  But I suppose that also depends on how long you use it. I probably use it 20-30min at a time.    Something minor, but might want to keep in mind... This thing is LOUD!  If you plan on using this silently, privately, whatnot; keep searching...    But overall, it&#x27;s a nice product :]</li>
            <li> Does a great job of shaving those &amp;#34;private areas.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I shave my whole body with this shaver. I am new to using a shaver in the shower but once I lathered up the first time and put it to work the hair just came right off of me. I shave from the neck down to the toes just because I can. It works best when you have plenty of shave gel on but I have used it a few times dry as well.</li>
            <li> I am a hairy guy, not Sasquatch hairy mind you, but hairy enough that taking my shirt off at the lake is somewhat of a concern.  My wife says that she loves every hair on my body, but you and I know the truth: even a light rug on your back ain&#x27;t cool.  This takes care of the issue quickly and leaves you smooth and silky without causing razor burn.  Hell, it was so easy I tried a little manscaping and guess what? It works there too.  No nicks, cuts or burns.  This is my new favorite grooming tool, at least during lake season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/31/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought a new foil for the shaver end and works as new.  I love this manscaping tool, however the battery is beginning to die and only holds a charge for a few minutes.  I need more to power through my ahem...well u know. research shows that this is not a battery that is intended to be changed by the average do it yourself person as soldering is required.  I am going to clean it well to remove my pubes and take it by the local battery joe to see what they can do.  The repair man should in all good conscious wear gloves.</li>
            <li> This tool is a work of genius.  Makes manscaping much easier, and whole lot less risky.  I started out using it in the shower but I&#x27;ve discovered that it works better dry.  The product is definitely designed with maximum safety in mind.  For the most part, you can be pretty reckless with this thing and not hurt yourself.  At least, I haven&#x27;t managed to.</li>
            <li> Just tried it out. Used it on legs, under arms, chest, and public area. The trimmer on zero can cut you if your not careful but it gives you a very close and smooth shave. The pivoting head is great for sensitive areas, Ive never gotten such a close and SAFE shave on the hanging twins. I blame myself not the machine for the cut, i was just going to fast thinking I wouldn&#x27;t have enough time to cover everything in 50 minutes, i was wrong, i had plenty of time.  Update: Changed my rating due to the battery life. Wears our very fast. Big flaw. How does it take 8 hours to charge but shave for 10 minutes?</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this item. I had an older version that finally petered out. Sleek handle, great grip. Dual-sided design for trimming and shaving. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I should have read ALL of the reviews (especially the 1 and 2 star ratings)before I bought this. This COULD have been a really good personal shaver. I like the feel and shape. I like the wet/dry functionality. BUT the two rows of \\&quot;trimming\\&quot; TEETH on BOTH sides of the foil make it DANGEROUS. I gave this shaver the benefit of the doubt and blamed it on my inexperience . . . NOT . . . out of a dozen or so attempts, while being VERY careful and taking my time, I ending up bleeding 9 of 12 times. The teeth on this monster rip into the sack, shaft, and anything that comes in contact with them. Shredders !!! If Philips Norelco lost the the trimmer blades or made them fully retractable this product would be GREAT. As it is currently manufactured, you risk the family jewels, their carrying case and their little buddy. You should avoid this shaver unless you like to live dangerously and enjoy a little bloody pain every now and then !!</li>
            <li> I bought this about 9 months ago and for the first 6 months it worked, mostly. 3 months in the large trimmer stopped working and after 6 months the battery needed to be charged pretty much after every use. Oh by the way, this is the third body groomer I have purchased from Norelco (2 regulars and then this pro). Battery is a looming issue in their products. All of them were unable to hold a charge for under a year and you know, I got it, replace it every year or so. Well in that case this should cost $30 bucks and not almost $70. Don&#x27;t get taken, there are plenty of other products on amazon that do this job and actually last a decent period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally...might I suggest you look at the Gillette fusion beard/body trimmer...under $20 and does everything this can do...plus it runs on an actual battery.</li>
            <li> So I needed a new razor for shaving and since I was tired of buying new blades at $17 a box I thought \\&quot;Hey why not go the electric route and save some money.\\&quot; After seeing a few ads and reviews of this Norelco I decided to use the Amazon credit I had and give it a shot.     Well what can I say about the razor other then it&#x27;s a razor. After reading the instructions, since I had never used an electric razor, I decided to wait a few days to shave. Now where exactly will I be shaving since not everyone will shave the same spots. Legs, Arms, and below the belt. Now I&#x27;m not a hairy man by no means facial hair yes, every where else not so much. Since I have tattoos on the arms and legs I wanted them to show better and that&#x27;s why I shave those areas.     The razor has two sides a Trimmer and a Shaving Head. The trimmer works great, but is insanely sharp and it has cut/nicked my manhood on several occasions. Now I&#x27;ve used an electric trimmer on my manhood for a few years and have never had a trimmer cut me like this one. So proceed with caution if you go below the belt. On the legs and arms the trimmer works just fine no problems.    The Shaving Head sucks, but maybe all electric shaving heads suck I don&#x27;t know. This thing is always leaving patches of hair as well as it pulls the living daylights out of my legs, not so much the arms. I&#x27;ve actually stopped using the shaving head and gone back to my Gillette Fusion.     Also since I&#x27;ve seen the question asked a few times the manual does state that this should not be used on your face.     So in the end I&#x27;d pass on this razor and find something else.</li>
            <li> Im a girl and bought this for my legs, arms  and bikini line touch up. This is perferct for shaving almost anywhere! One end is good for giving a close shave. The other end tackles longer hair. I love mine and have had it for about 2 years now. It is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery still works. You have to remember never to charge it untill the battery is totally dead. The blades are just now due for replacement after about 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came with a travel bag</li>
            <li> While I have not suffered as cruelly as documented by other reviewers (in particular Matt, who wrote a review and Whitney, who commented on that review...so sorry about your experiences, guys), I have also nicked myself while using the foil shaving head on my sack. If this happens to you it&#x27;s not something you want to to repeat, so I have switched back to shaving most of my netherregion with a Gillette Sensor. I use the trimmer for the upper groin area and it works well, no mishaps. I do use the shaving head for pits, torso, head, and sometimes even face (although it doesn&#x27;t work as well on the latter as I prefer a close facial shave). All-in-all it&#x27;s a very versatile groomer; you just have to be careful: Using the foil shaver on your man parts is *not* recommended. Tonight the shaver quit working (trimmer still works fine) so I&#x27;m either going to try to dig up the receipt, see if it&#x27;s still under its 2-year warranty, and maybe return it for a replacement if it is. If not, I will probably purchase another one as it is - though not without its faults / cautions - the best groomer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well very satisfied with purchase</li>
            <li> Easy to use for both men and women.</li>
            <li> This works as a great trimmer, great close shave. Although this is supposed to work on wet hair, I find that it clogs too much and pulls when wet.  Dry, it works great.  Giving it a 3 because I bout this for him to shave in the shower.  Charges quickly and stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> It works well and charges for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Like Dr. Evil says, there is nothing like a shorn scrotum. This is the best groomer for the job. If you&#x27;re comparing this to the cheaper models, buck up and pay the extra. It&#x27;s your cock and balls! If you&#x27;re gonna spend the money anywhere why not on your most prized appendage? Oh and chicks dig a hairless package as much as we dig their hairless area :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m female and it took FOREVER to find a decent groomer. I am &amp;#34;naturally tan&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s a challenge finding something that will leave a clean canvas minus the nicks. Bravo! I purchased because of the reviews I read here...this product exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li> This is a handy quick grooming device that gives a close shave. It&#x27;s not as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s easier on the skin. The beard trimmer is effective and quick. The charging device takes some getting used to, and if it is moved or bumped accidentally, it breaks contact and ceases the charging. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is great for the wide areas of your body like chest and legs, but it is very difficult in the narrow areas, like underarms and between legs, it is harmful in these difficult areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if they did not add the integrated pre-trimmers located on both sides of the shaving head it will be much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I bought this for trimming body hair but I actually use it every day for shaving my neck as well. My other Norelco shaver irritates my neck but this does a great job; no irritation even when used daily. As for trimming body hair it works really well and gets a very close shave with no irritation and I haven&#x27;t cut myself at all with it. Occasionally the trimmer on the edge can yank a hair out but it&#x27;s only a minor discomfort and avoidable if you go slow enough. Other reviews mentioned a bad battery life but maybe they fixed it because I use mine everyday and charge it maybe once a week and I haven&#x27;t had the battery die on me yet. The adjustable trimmer on the opposite end is a great feature too.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to remove hair. A razor works much better</li>
            <li> Veryyyyy average. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Excellent priduct. I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for some time. It works well in those sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no hiding the fact that I&#x27;m a hairy guy.  Because of this, I was worried that this product wouldn&#x27;t be enough for my sasquatch like appearance.  I&#x27;m happy to say that I now know what it feels like to be hairless.  This thing works like a charm.  What used to take me 30 min. with a pair of simple cutters took only 10 min. with this guy.  Not only that but it SAFELY takes the hair all the way down to the skin.  I used to have problems with ingrown hairs from my other cutters.  I&#x27;ve used the Norelco several times now without worry.  If you&#x27;re looking to trim some of that unsightly hair, look no further.</li>
            <li> I ordered this groomer after reading a lot of positive reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, there was enough of a charge to give it a test drive, although the low battery indicator light was flashing about half way through.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll only be using this on the south of the border region, as I don&#x27;t have chest or back hair. And it had been awhile since I had performed any grooming because I was looking for a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, this thing had its work cut out for it. It performed brilliantly. I used the trimmer end first, to knock down the high stuff. I originally set it on the longest setting, as a bit of a precautionary thing. It&#x27;s always a little nerve-racking when there are mechanized devices with cutting heads in that region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a once over on the highest setting. No problems, so I adjusted the trimmer to the shortest setting. Again no problems!&lt;br /&gt;Well, I prefer a smooth shave down there, as does my wife, so I turned the trimmer end off, and switched to the razor end. It&#x27;s really nice that only one end will operate at a time. It decreases the chance cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the razor shaves really close. Almost as close as a manual does. The best part? NO IRRITATION!!! NONE WHATSOEVER!!! I was amazed. Normally, after trimming and then shaving with a manual, I&#x27;d end up with some razor burn/irritation 1-2 days after. I had none at all with this groomer. It&#x27;s fantastic!! It&#x27;s completely \\&quot;frank and beans\\&quot;safe. No nicks, cuts, or gashes of any kind. I did read some reviews of other groomers that people suffered such casualties. Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this in my opinion is that it is a little awkward at first. It&#x27;s got a slight bend in it, I assume to make it more comfortable in your hand. But, it makes it awkward when you&#x27;re trying to trim/shave certain areas at certain angles. This is easily overcome though by repeated uses, and becoming more comfortable with handling the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is a breeze. The trimmer guard and head come off, as does the shaving head. You can choose to either simply brush everything clean with the included brush, or you can do a combination of brushing and rinsing under the faucet. If you rinse, just let everything air dry when you&#x27;re finished. Very simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say how many uses you will get out of a single charge. I guess it depends on how regularly you use it. The manual does say a single 8 hour charge will last 50 minutes of operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing is that there is a registration card included in the packaging. You can register online, which you&#x27;ll earn either an additional 6 months of warranty on the groomer, or a 15% discount on your next purchase of $100 or more at the Philips Norelco online store. I chose the extended 6 month warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing. My wife saw how well of a job this does, and has been begging me to let her use it as well. I&#x27;m sure it would work equally as well for women.he shaving head. You can choose to either simply brush everything clean with the included brush, or you can do a combination of brushing and rinsing under the faucet.

I chose the extended 6 month warranty.  One last thing. My wife saw how well of a job this does, and has been begging me to let her use it as well. I&#x27;m sure it would work equally as well for women.</li>
            <li> I bought this for manscaping. For a long time I had simply trimmed and occasionally used a razor but any cuts or irritation is so much worse when its downstairs. And the mere idea of hot wax near my boys is terrifying enough, so that&#x27;s out. So what to do? The ladies definitely prefer a cleaner look and from a personal hygiene standpoint so do I. So I got this and went to work. My initial plan was to just clean up my usual trim job but everything was going so well and looking so smooth I just kept going. Now I don&#x27;t know how I got along all these years with one of these. You can use the adjustable trim guard to leave a lot or a little or use the other end and be completely smooth. Great product, pole, pouch, and starfish approved. If you are looking for a body groomer/electric shaver get this. A definite buy.</li>
            <li> This model of the body groomer was a bit disappointing.  The flexible head does not seem to help getting a &#x27;close shave.&#x27;  The clipper on the other end does have some use.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised (I only tried it dry) and does a much better job then I was expecting.... I will highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is still going strong! awesome purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this groomer because I wanted a better alternative to a razor for shaving down there. Excellent buy in my opinion! It is \\&quot;shaft, sack, and starfish\\&quot; safe, if you know what I mean. I was a little bit wary of the trimmers on the sides of the shaver section because in the picture they kinda stick out. But after using them they do not hurt at all. If you press too hard they will pinch you, but they don&#x27;t draw blood or break the skin, if you are being careful and paying attention. Like all things in life you have to pay attention to what your doing if you want it to come out right. Highly recommended product for cleaning hair everywhere below the waist.</li>
            <li> electric razor is good.  you must pass over the same spot a lot to get a clean shave, but doesn&#x27;t everything.  well designed and built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update. Within a year, after a full day&#x27;s charge the battery lasts for less than 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good razor.</li>
            <li> Had gone thorugh ,utiple sites and various review in amazon before deciding up this product.It lived up tot the reviews.  Nice product to have and to use.Me and my wife uses it regulary now and it works fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my hubby.  As in previous reviews, we were looking for something specifically for the \\&quot;region down below\\&quot;.  As a wife that cleans her hubby up - I not only needed it to be easy to use - I needed it to work on him without the nicks, cuts, or other dangers involved when shaving this sensitive area.  Can I just say - WE BOTH LOOOVVED IT!  It was very easy to use and performed the job beautifully!  We both enjoyed the closeness of the shave and that it was able to reach all areas - as another reviewer described - the nuts, bolts and sack they came in.  It also did an amazing job on the back door!  So - go ahead ladies - get this one for your man and enjoy the adventure of shaving him clean!</li>
            <li> Well, I was a happy owner of the ORIGINAL Bodygroom, BG 2020.  I have to say the BG 2020 lasted me a good 6 years, being in the shower constantly, only coming out to be charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months back the BG 2020 finally died, and it was time for a replacement. I was a little skeptical at first with the price of the BG2040.  But because I was so happy with the BG 2020, I took the dive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the shaving blade seems to be better quality, and also seems to operate at higher speeds then the 2020, shaves seemed much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The built in groomer with adjustable settings is GREAT!! No more having to store extra settings in the sink cabinet!  Just select and go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Removal battery, seems like a great idea, especially if it goes bad and I need to replace just the battery....of course that all depends on how much it costs!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  I&#x27;m not crazy about the shape/bulkiness of the groomer.  I like the dual heads, but I would have rather had a smaller, more agile groomer with removable settings than this larger, more awkward setup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No lanyard!!! :(  how am I supposed to hang it up now!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning this groomer is quite the task, of course it doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to figure it out and it doesnt require any tools, it is much more complicated than the BG2020&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of some of the Cons I&#x27;m going to give it 4 out of 5.  I&#x27;d have to say though, it&#x27;s still the best bodygroomer on the market, and being waterproof really puts the selling point on this item.</li>
            <li> This product may seem somewhat expensive at first however the thing does a great job where it needs to!  And THAT is worth alot to anyone. It is highly rated, and I find it to be a good product. It shaves perfectly and well, charges nicely on the handy charger stand, and also has convenient trimmer choices. I&#x27;m very happy with it. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> First it&#x27;s great but...not last more than two years, A disposable equipment is of poor quality , do not buy!</li>
            <li> It was a decent shaver for a couple years, but crapped out soon after. Guess they&#x27;re only built for short term.</li>
            <li> I have used many different shavers.  This is the best one for getting into that area where we want little to no hair.  Get in the shower and shave as you would your face. I use warm water to open pores followed by a good lathering of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Have used this on face and head with no problems despite the instructions saying use only below the neck....there...I&#x27;m your guinea pig...do as you will</li>
            <li> I was really nervous to try and use an electric razor around my manhood and backside, but it worked fantastically.  No cuts, no razor burn.  I feel completely safe using it and it produces really sexy results.  I find it to be sack, shaft, and [...] safe.  I recommend this razor to any man looking to feel sexy and safe.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Works as advertised. Searched and researched before buying this product. I am happy with my decision.</li>
            <li> Husband loves all the features! Great razor!</li>
            <li> Great product with sleek design</li>
            <li> In short, I am very pleased with this product as I was able to shave \\&quot;the below area\\&quot; entirely hairless after my second try with this groomer. I had a little trouble getting a clean shave on my first try, so make sure to give it some time! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this groomer, just make sure to follow the \\&quot;obvious procedures\\&quot;. That is, check the foil in case it has any dents, this could almost inevitably cause harm, and make sure NOT to push down hard while shaving. Also make sure to clean it regularly after each shave.  With patience and a little skill, this product is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the original Norelco Bodygroom BG2030 for just about a year and the head finally became so loose that it was no longer usable. Rather than simply get another BG2030 I decided to spend the extra $10 and upgrade to the BG2040, which as you can see includes both the regular groomer AND a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you notice when you get the groomer out of the packaging is that the charging stand is rather clunky and unstable. You have to fold it a certain way to get the power supply cord in and then fold it a different way in order to get the groomer in the charging cradle. There must be a better way to design a charging stand. The first unit I ordered from Amazon simply would not charge. I returned the item to Amazon and have since received a new groomer that thankfully charges as designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The groomer itself is heavier and bigger than the BG2030 and fits more comfortably into my hand when using it. The groomer portion (as opposed to the trimmer) is very similar to the prior version and if anything actually seems to be slightly less effective. I found myself going over the same area several times to achieve the desired smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer portion is worth the $10 upgrade if you like to quickly trim your chest hair without completely shaving yourself to the point of having that annoying prickly chest for 3 days. The trimmer is surprisingly effective at getting through hairy areas and the plastic guide has 5 settings without needing to use different plastic attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you&#x27;ve been using the BG2030 and could use a trimmer attachment this model is worth the $10 incremental cost.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace an older version.  Absolutely love it.  No nicks, cuts, scrapes or other undesireable collateral issues.  Perfect for hard-to-reach, sensitive and \\&quot;wife mandated\\&quot; areas.  It costs just a bit more than lesser products, but would be a bargain at twice the price with its ergonomics, ease of use, functionality and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year now and it is still just like new. On the box it says not to use it on face but I have used it many time and it has not dulled the blade. i like the design of this better than other electric shaving machines. highly recommend for anyone men or women.</li>
            <li> I never took time to write reviews but Norelco BG2040 inspired me to start.  Read a lot of review before purchase and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot and return.  But I&#x27;m gonna keep this one.  Very elegantly designed and does a great job.  Thanks Philips for the brushed metal finish.  Used the trimmer first to shorten the hair and then the shaver foil side.  Felt very subtle pinch kinda feeling at first with the shaver but got used to it - not painful.  Tried it on my upper arm, shoulders, back, lower neck and got a clean result.  The design is so good that I was able to reach my upper back all by myself without any assistance.  Tried the delicate parts too with the shaving foil end.  I read reviews as \\&quot;Ouch!\\&quot; if you remove the trimming length adjusting unit while doing delicate areas.  So I did not take a chance.  Did not receive a single cut anywhere.  Some reviews said that the length adjusting comb feels fragile.  I disagree, its well designed and easy to use.  Key is to never adjust or remove/attach by holding the comb end.  Use the sliding end that fits into the unit.  It slides back smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;I did not try it on face.  I feel that this device is a very close-to-skin trimmer and may not/won&#x27;t be as good as shaving.  I will stick to my Fusion Plus for facial shaving.  The battery life truly surprised me.  Lasts for at least one hr.  I feared I might have to recharge before I was done but it didn&#x27;t give up on me.  Worth all the $$ and works as good in the shower.  Like another reviewer said, a must have for all hairy men.  So awesome that my armpit is so smooth like I shaved with a razor.  Its that close-to-skin!</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer and groomer with many improvements over previous models from Norelco.  The pivoting head makes it very easy to work.  It&#x27;s also very quiet.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, modern men like to groom themselves more than ever. For many men, part of this grooming includes trimming and/or shaving body hair, on ALL parts of the body. Well, this sleekly designed and easy to use body groomer is just the ticket to safely and professionally get the look (and feel) that we want. I have owned 3 other types of body groomers, and I&#x27;m here to tell you that the \\&quot;Philips Norelco BG2040/34\\&quot; is THE best on the market. Everything you need to get the precise trim/shave you are seeking is right there on one little unit, and it is truly easy to use. With my first use, I didn&#x27;t get one nick, pull or bite in any of the highly sensitive areas. (Fellas, you know the areas I speak of) When I was through, I was amazed at the results, and so was my wife, whom immensely enjoyed the well trimmed look as well as the baby-smooth parts.  If you are a long-time groomer and have used this product, I know that you agree with me. If you have never groomed \\&quot;below the neck\\&quot; but are considering it, then I highly recommend buying this groomer and getting it done right the first time. The price is extremely fair for such a wonderful product, so, you really can&#x27;t go wrong. Trust me.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean . Low noise level . I find it a great value for the price .  Comfortable and looks great .</li>
            <li> did what it was supposed to do quick, close shave. Glad that we bought it, and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have pretty sensitive skin and everything I have used to shave below the neck has just caused irritation .  While this razor can cause some slight drying out of the skin it really is amazing how well it works. The only downside I have found is it really does need to be fully charged to really get the job done.  Over all this is a great razor for the money I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best trimmer I have ever owned, and I only buy top of line electronics.  I&#x27;ve owned one for 2 years now. You can take it in the shower no mess, no cord.  I just recently had an issue with blade.  Philips sent me new one.  No charge.  So it work like new again.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat impressed. However, I still had to risk the use of a manual razor because it just didn&#x27;t get it as smooth as I would like. It leaves quite a bit of stubble. But I have dark hair so for those of you who have lighter pubes your all good. I really like the style and the charger works great!</li>
            <li> After buying at least a dozen groomers that I was never very satisfied with, I decided to give this a try. I liked the fact that it&#x27;s just one unit and you don&#x27;t have a bunch of parts separate from the unit, which makes this the best for no clutter and taking up very little room.  Cons:   This can only be charged while in its stand/cradle. It charges well, but the stand is too lightweight for the groomer. Therefore, I have to set it so the front leans against the wall. Otherwise it just falls over. Not a huge deal though.   Compared to other trimmers, the length settings seem a bit different. The 1 seemed to trim more like a 2 compared to other trimmers. But since the quality of the trim is good, the simple adjustment isn&#x27;t a huge inconvenience.   Other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried in the past have had a tendency or nicking the skin, which can be a bit painful. This is better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve tried but I still had a little bit of it, but only when set at a 0. Here&#x27;s the trick I learned though; if you go very slowly, it has a tendency of giving you a bit of a nick. If you just glide at a pace just slightly faster than a slow pace, the problem is solved.  Pros:   Very high quality blade. I use a 0 setting on my face prior to shaving with a razor because I find I get a closer shave doing so. This really gets a close stubble which made the razor shave great (eliminated a lot of post-shave razor burn too). It&#x27;s also a very smooth, effective shave when trimming hair under your arms. Glides right through with a good trim without clogging up the blade.   Clean-up. Just pop the trim selector off and wipe it clean. Easy as that. Tip: When using metal, wiping it with an alcohol wipe prevents rust and wear. Water is what causes that.   One unit. There are other decent trimmers out there by companies like Wahl. But they have a bunch of different trim length selectors that are separate. Thus, they take up more space and can be irritating to keep organized. This is one unit. Sure, it&#x27;s longer than other units. But it has a good grip and you get used to it really quickly.  Overall, this is the best unit I&#x27;ve tried. Don&#x27;t waste money on the $15 or even $30 trimmers. You&#x27;ll be throwing them away after not much use because the quality really isn&#x27;t great. This gives a great, even, smooth shave and trim in one handy unit. I&#x27;ll never go back to a different trimmer.</li>
            <li> Okay this shaver is amazing. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it! No more issues with razor rash, no messy shave creams, and it can be used dry or wet so I can just vacuum up the mess instead of letting it go down the drain.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews I was convinced that this razor was only for shaving your \\&quot;junk\\&quot;.  This is NOT true!  The product clearly says that it is not for facial use, but it works great.  I have been trimming my beard hair, head hair, and using the razor to trim my neck for a few months now and the product has worked better than expected.  I do, however, recommend using the neck razor with shaving cream, as dry shaving with this baby does hurt!  It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s  water proof and can be easily rinsed off and put back in its charger after each use.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this purchase.  This is a very well designed groomer that does the job without the pain, discomfort or anxiety of wondering if it will \\&quot;bite\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s worth mentioning I am not a hairy person, but I do like to keep a couple of areas completely free of any hair.  This thing really does it.  Take the two \\&quot;marbles\\&quot; for example...I like to keep the package they hang out in completely hairless, this groomer does it! Straight down to the skin and it is so smooth it even feels like somehow it snipped the lil hair down below the skin...  It&#x27;s been a few days and no red rash, no bumps just smooth soft skin.  It&#x27;s going to be so easy to make a routine out of keeping things trimmed.  Actually its more than that, its  more like completely hairless-yay! This was one of the better purchases I have made in a while.  I&#x27;m still amazed with the results and NO pain or discomfort of any kind!  WOOT!!!</li>
            <li> this is an awesome tool for all your grooming needs, it recharges quickly and holds the charge for quite awhile. The comb and guard edge (settings for desired length) are very well amde and should last a long time. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> for this money the product is perfect.i like it,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Got this a couple of weeks ago. Opened it charged it and set it on my bathroom sink counter.  Went to use it today and it would not work for more than 10 seconds due to no battery charge. Plugged it in and have had it charging for 4 hours.  Still no luck. Looks like I got a lemon. Threw out the packaging so I guess I am stuck with this.</li>
            <li> The foil head pivots in all directions, so it makes mistakes less likely. I use it to trim my man regions and it works very well. Like any shaver, there is the potential for small knicks, just take it slow and be careful. I use the foil end for my balls and the clipper with attachment end for just below my waste line. It gets everything looking clean, trimmed, and ready for a night out.</li>
            <li> I had the old model of this before with the changeable heads which broke after too many drops on the tiles. This new one seems much more solid and shaves even better. Fully recommend it.</li>
            <li> i had great hopes for this when I found it on amazon.  So many 4 &amp; 5 reviews looked great.  Sounded awesome.  I should have paid more attention to the 1 star reviews.  I can only assume that this thing does work great for some people and they love it.  I&#x27;m not one of those people.  I didn&#x27;t have a catastrophic experience with it like some people here say they did (thanks for that), but it did not work and definitely showed the potential to cause harm.  Slow to use. Caused irritation, snags, and cuts.  And for all that, where/when i was able to get it to work its best it still did not come close to shaving as close as a safety razor.  I returned it a week after trying it.  Amazon honored the 30day money-back return policy and made returning it fairly easy although I did have to pay about $6 for the return shipping.  It was worth that for the experiment and potential and maybe you want to take a similar gamble but if you do go in cautiously. It&#x27;s not magic.</li>
            <li> This Norelco Bodygroom clippers is an excellent product. It is very well designed, fits in the hand nicely, and trims well. I got this because I dropped the last corded trimmer I had and broke it. The design of this is such that I feel much less likely to drop it. It shaves closer than any other clippers I have used. It is not the same as a razor though. The battery life is good. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not a bad trimmer once the blade wears down a little bit.  Does not leave in-growns.  Be cautious though.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good shaver and it&#x27;s really handy having both ends in one. I use the adjustable side to trim my beard to length quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that the battery runs down quickly, and that the shaver isn&#x27;t very secure in the charger, but those are minor gripes.</li>
            <li> Bought this crappy designed product (the lateral cutters are the dumbest idea ever) and even though I had doubts I wanted to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Turned out to be a bloody one, cutting myself pretty badly after just a few applies. Shaving cream had no help there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is incorrectly advertised that can be used \\&quot;anywhere\\&quot; although they don&#x27;t explicitly exclude the jewels. They just want to let you figure out by your own after buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving the balls is a serious business and this is not up to the challenge. Normal disposable razors and a steady hand work the best for that.</li>
            <li> The comb on the cutter head is cheap and flexes. The clippers on the head with the screen are pretty good but the screen blade will cut you and leave your skin very red. Also it causes ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Highly recomended</li>
            <li> I bought this for the same reason many of you are looking into it: my nether regions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried multiple electric groomers, some work great, others just slice and dice. I have done shaving, but prefer not to for a multitude of reasons (razor bumps, ingrown hairs, razor burn, cuts, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is when I found this, trimmer/shaver combo. It was expensive but I went out on a limb and trusted reviews. I am sure glad I did. I did not manscaping for about a 1.5 - 2 weeks leading up to trying it out to see how it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I tried going a little to fast and was mildly disappointed. However, once I slowed down and allowed both cutting heads to do their jobs I was very satisfied. The head trims from both directions and pivots to cut in the said direction. Sometimes it takes a couple passes.However, ultimately it will leave a VERY smooth finished product that will not lead to ingrown hairs, razor bumps, burn etc. The hair grows back soft and does not cause loads of irritation like a razor would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A major concern of mine was getting cut by this. I have used it 3 times since buying it and have not had so much as a slight nick yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt I would recommend this to any man looking to safely, quickly and effectively manscape.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how protected the blades were yet I was able to get a quick and close shave/trim everywhere (including the \\&quot;Kiwi\\&quot;). No nicks or scratches of any kind. Highly recommend using it in the shower.  Ladies if you want to drop the hint to your guy get them this as a gift!</li>
            <li> I prefer using the attachment with the guard, the side without the guard tends to give me razor burn. Works well when using it to even out sideburns, and touch up hair in general. Not sure if it was worth the ~$90.00 I paid for it.</li>
            <li> This being my first electric (dry) shaver I can only compare it to the disposable razors that I&#x27;ve been using since I turned legal age.  For shaving the face it just isn&#x27;t as close as the regular razors,  it&#x27;s better if you wanna keep trimmed.  The beard accessory is kinda flimsy, as another reviewer wrote it tends to go the the default 1 setting when held normally,  this is good for people like me who like to keep short goatees, but for those that don&#x27;t it could be an issue. I&#x27;ve not tried \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaving with this &amp; don&#x27;t expect to try.      It has a pretty good battery life,  but what I really got it for was for shaving those \\&quot;other\\&quot; areas of my body. Put bluntly the caveman look went out with the caveman &amp; I was always afraid of trying the old fashioned razor \\&quot;down there\\&quot; for fairly obvious reasons.  I can say that I&#x27;m pleased with the results, while not \\&quot;smooth as a babys bottom\\&quot; it came close, &amp; no razor burns or discomfort afterward.  For first timers like me you&#x27;ve got to be patient with this thing, it&#x27;ll get the job done but it&#x27;s no where near gonna be as fast as a razor.      Do I recommend this?  For the face: not really (hence why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars).  For the other parts of the body: a definite yes.</li>
            <li> Have owned the item since the day it just released.  Seems to be well built especially the attractive stainless metal and rubber grip housing.  Does a good job so far in aiding in my metro endeavors.  Easy to clean and cheap to replace the foil blades. Charger/stand is attractive and works well.  Foil end of groomer gets surprisingly close with not really much irritation.  Have not used length settings or other end of groomer at all and assume you must need to be like a yeti in order to need this end.  Overall a nice package.</li>
            <li> This product is well priced, functions well and looks great.  The battery life is great and the waterproof casing is a great feature.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The Bodygroomer is a sleek and stylish product that works as well as it looks.  Shaves even longer chest and back hair without pulling or irritating the skin.  The trimmer end works well on sideburns and back of the neck.  The groomer is lightweight and curved perfectly to fit your hand.  It runs quietly.    The groomer comes with an equally stylish charging stand.  It recharges fairly quickly and holds its charge well. The charger stand also folds flat which makes the entire system easy to store or pack for travel.  I honestly had no complaints at all with this product.  It does what it is supposed to do and looks good - all for a quite decent price.</li>
            <li> This tool works fine, but it takea a long time to charge and then discharges fast.  It is not the battery fault.  I have two and they are both the same.  Still a good unit.</li>
            <li> I read a few of the other reviews before deciding to purchase the shaver and when I got it I was still a little apprehensive, but after only 5 minutes of using it I was convinced of its awesomeness. It&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t cut or pinch even in folds, leaves your skin smooth and soft. Just get it. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> So recently I decided I wanted to remove all of the hair from my body from the neck down.  Until now, I didn&#x27;t really consider myself a hairy guy.  I have no back hair, my chest hair wasn&#x27;t over grown, my arms were normal compared to a lot of my friends, my legs were probably hairier than some.  I&#x27;ve been working out recently and after starting to see some awesome results, the hair all over just wasn&#x27;t complementing me.  I tried using a regular razor last week, which left me with horrible razor bumps on my chest and skin below the belly, but above the family jewels.  After reading the reviews here, I decided to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an hour between the shower and bath, the only thing I found this good for was just the areas I had razor bumps on and the &#x27;starfish&#x27; area.  I don&#x27;t know if the rest of my hair is simply too fine for this to work with, or perhaps I wasn&#x27;t doing something right.  I tried lathering up with soap, I tried using shaving cream, and finally this morning I used it dry.  Even going very slow with the razor required me to make 2-3 passes to get successfully trimmed up; the &#x27;pre-trimmers&#x27; were doing a better job than the razor under the foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up switching back to my normal razor last night to finish up my arms and legs because I was getting neck crams, and was getting tired of sitting in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give this product a couple of weeks to see if/how the results improve from regular use, but after my first night using it, I was not overly impressed, and if I didn&#x27;t believe in second chances, this would be going back to Philips today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any tips/hints/tricks, please drop me a line at matt@mattzuba.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update On 10/20/11:&lt;br /&gt;Once my razor bumps from normal shaving cleared up and smoothed out my skin a bit, this shaver is doing better.  I shave maybe once every 1 or 2 weeks, not because my hair grows slow, but because it just takes a while and I don&#x27;t like spending 45 minutes in the shower often.  The trimmer is quite good for taking the hair down to a good level which can then be smoothed out by the foil side.  I still use a blade on the family jewels and legs and arms (a Quatro, in case anyone cares), this just doesn&#x27;t do the job for me there.  The foil side works well for smoothing out the pubic area, chest and &#x27;starfish&#x27; without worry about nicks, cuts or razor bumps.taking the hair down to a good level which can then be smoothed out by the foil side.

            <li> At first I was a little reluctant to like this shaver but after using it for a few weeks I really have come to like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see in the pictures and read in the product description details on one end it includes an adjustable trimmer with five different settings to trim beards, mustaches, sideburns, etc..  The blade guard is also removable for up close detail work.  On the other end you get a shaving head that pivots.  I have used it for various areas of body hair and have been very happy with the results.  I even used it for a quick facial shave (It was an emergency) and the results weren&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each end has its own on/off button so there isn&#x27;t any confusion.  The shaver is cordless and fits slides into a nice charging stand.  The shaver itself has some stainless steel coverings with some black plastic and black rubber grips.  It is actually has a quite stylish and modern look to it and I don&#x27;t mind having it out on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance and battery life it good too.  I leave it off the charging stand often and it seems like I only have to charge it up about once a week.  Charger automatically shuts off when charging is complete.  As I mentioned before actually hair cutting performance is good.  No clogging or sticking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint may be that is that shape wise it is a bit long and can be a bit unwieldy at times.  Now I realize this is the result of putting two shavers in one, but I am just mentioning it.  Also despite the nice aesthetics and good overall quality, some of the plastic parts, especially the plastic trimmer blade guard look and feel kind of cheap, and I am always a little worried I might brake it, rendering the trimmer pretty useless.  Those are my only real complaints and relative minor ones at that.  Otherwise I find this to be a great product and will be happy to continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li> The body trimmer is a bit pricey, but you paid for quality from Norelco. Nearly no hair is out of reach, this has changed my manscaping forever.</li>
            <li> At first this razor made shaving fun again.  I really enjoyed the product in the brief period it was effective.  I first used this model before I purchased one by borrowing my father&#x27;s.  I enjoyed it so much that I decided to purchase one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor worked well for about a month.  But after a month - and after the time to get the item returned - the battery just quickly faded.  I followed the instructions to ensure the battery would last as long as possible, but whenever I took the razor off of the charger, sure enough the red light would flash to indicate the battery was almost dead.  As a result, the razor lost a lot of its shaving efficiency.  So now the razor is worse than a simple razor blade.  I don&#x27;t know if the razor I got was just a defective one out of many good ones, but for about sixty dollars for a razor I would have rather used my money to get a decent blade instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the razor&#x27;s design is good, but the battery is terrible.  I loved this product at first, but was seriously disappointed by how quickly it died.</li>
            <li> I am an Amazon Prime Member. I order from amazon at least a couple times a month. Never have i received an item that I am so completely blown away by. The Phillips Norelco Body Hair Trimmer is the most superior shaver I have ever owned! Let me answer the most pressing question guys ask when considering a trimmer like this. YES! You can trim comfortably around the groin area without so much as a slight nick - and get a very clean shave!     Bottom Line:    In a world where trimmers are either overpowered or underpowered, the Phillips Norelco BG2040 has struck the perfect balance. This shaver/trimmer has no equal. Spend the extra money to buy this product and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> After two weeks I have decided that for my type of hair this is probably best used as a maintenance shaver/trimmer. I have very fine hair on my torso and the comb on the trimmer wouldn&#x27;t quite work on it. I get better results from a cheap beard trimmer.The hair on my legs is coarser and it did a fine job neatening it up. Below the belt the trimmer did a so-so job. The shaver did a fantastic job on most parts but not very well on the more contoured areas. I still need to use a blade but the time involved is nil.    All in all, I am quite happy with this shaver and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shaver and yes, it is the best option for trimming down there. I know some people cut themselves and yes I&#x27;ve had the same issue before. You just need to be careful with the end of the trimming blades when shaving your sensitive areas. Make sure you are using the center of the foil shaver to trim the hair. You&#x27;ll get used to it. Even with those nicks every once in a while it&#x27;s a hell of a lot better than using a manual razor to try and shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this thing way back in 2011 and just before my warranty was up the thing wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. I got brand new replacement and after another 2 years the same thing happened and it won&#x27;t charge anymore. I only use it a few times a week so I would charge it maybe every 2 weeks. FYI to prolong the battery life, like with all electronics that have rechargeable batteries you&#x27;re not supposed to put it in the charger after each use (if the charger is plugged in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway second time around they didn&#x27;t give me another replacement of course but they did offer me 15% off a new one. For 4 years of use, I feel like I got my moneys worth in the long run and dealt with good customer service....rock on Philips. I found a guide to replace the batteries on ifixit.com that somebody posted in the product questions above. Of course this would void my warranty if I still had one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a hairy dude..... It&#x27;s great for trimming the back of your neck between haircuts. I also have sparse long back hairs and it&#x27;s not too difficult to work the shaver to get your back without anyone&#x27;s help. I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s just okay for beard trimming but I have had irritation with all electric shavers on my face. Only 1 star lost for crappy batteries....</li>
            <li> No complaints here! What you see is what you get. Was able to shave in the no-no places with ease and comfort. Great shave!</li>
            <li> If I had a do over, I would do a different item. The clippers work well but the shaver portion does not cut close at all and the trimmers on each side of the shaver foil sometimes snag skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit, as my primary electric razor from Braun really isn&#x27;t up to the task of shaving the rest of my body, and this seemed much more convenient.  But it was very disappointing in reality.  It seems to be under-powered, as it had a lot of trouble cutting hair using the adjustable clipper side of it.  And the trimmer on the other side of the unit is also under-powered, as it constantly seemed to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; hairs as I was trimming, unlike the trimmer on my Braun.  So it basically made it unusable.  The build quality of the unit is nice, but apparently you&#x27;re not supposed to leave it on the charger 24/7, which makes it inconvenient for occasional use (i.e. I have to remember if I charged it last time, or pre-charge it before I need it, rather than just have it be a part of my permanent counter space where I know it&#x27;s always ready-to-go).  Ultimately, I returned it to Amazon, as it&#x27;s just not powerful enough to be effective.  They need to bump up the RPM&#x27;s on the trimmer so that it can cut through hair without tugging.</li>
            <li> I love the trimmer function, and I use it for keeping beard close - however, the razor has a difficult time with my beard, and I do not have a thick beard, so I use the trimmer to get close, then use my old norelco three blade to finish the job when I need a close shave.</li>
            <li> This thing really gets the job done.  I&#x27;d been using a cheap beard trimmer for 10 years or more to do the job and it left a lot to be desired.  I just kind of figured all body trimmers were created equal.  Not the case.  From trimming back, chest armpits (not nearly as itchy as it was with the clippers) to shaving below the belt (smooth sailing with no hair pulls or snags), this product performs as advertised.  I&#x27;d never go back to doing it the old way.  Bonus, the 2040 model has all the attachments built right in so there&#x27;s no searching for the \\&quot;level 3\\&quot; trim attachment in your bathroom junk drawer.  Great product and the reviews can be believed.  Get one.</li>
            <li> The motor is so underpowered it could be steam powered.  The other end - the body trimmer- is also pathetic.  The guides at each end prevent you from getting the cutting head on to the hair, and you end up scratching yourself and suffering pain trying to use it.  I think this may have been designed by a woman with deep seated psychological hatred of men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks really good and the controls are great - but I wouldn&#x27;t trim a dog with this piece of rubbish.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking a little larger than expected. Works very well ,does take some time to recharge but over all very pleased.</li>
            <li> Women prefer a little \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; even if they don&#x27;t tell you.  This is the first razor or shaver that I have ever used that didn&#x27;t either pinch, draw blood or leave a razor burn.  I can use this shaver without fear of accidental castration.  One end has the razor for closeness with a pretrimmer that will cut any longer hairs before they get to the razor.  It works great.  The other end has a trimmer with an adjustable guard for areas that you might want to leave with a little bit of length, up to about 1/2\\&quot; in length.  They say it can be used wet-or-dry, but I haven&#x27;t tried it wet and probably won&#x27;t.    In my opinion, women would also like this for use on their \\&quot;bikini area\\&quot;.  I know, it doesn&#x27;t come in pink or pastel colors, but, its a great razor that you can use on those intimate areas without fear, whether you&#x27;re a man or a woman.  This razor is so fearless, you could allow your significant other to use it on you, or you could use it on them.  No fear.</li>
            <li> First of all, I purchased a BG2020 (the cheaper model by Phillips) about a year ago. The product lasted for about 6 months, and then one day the button would no longer function to turn the device on and off. I thought about complaining and trying to return the item, but I instead elected to purchase the BG2040, and give the company a second chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is often recommended for rechargeable batteries, I used the device until it was fully dead, before charging it completely. After charging for 4 hours, I went to remove the product from the charger, and it was burning hot. It was so hot it could have burned my hand, but more importantly, the groomer never worked again. This product lasted me for not even one charge, so I really hope I am able to get a replacement, as it seemed to be a good product during the hour that it was functioning.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for overall body grooming. I was a little hesitant because of the price. I had purchased cheaper groomers in the past but they had not worked well. You get what you pay for. This groomer works extremely well, cleans easily, and has a sleek design. The charge lasts for about 4 hours of continual use, which is plenty long enough for my needs. It is long enough to be able to reach over your back and get all areas, which other groomers could not accomplish. It gives a very smooth shave to the tenderest parts with no nicks or pinches. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am actually quite surprised I use and enjoy using this groomer as often as I do. It&#x27;s very simple to use, virtually maintenance free, and does what is advertised.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Its much more comfortable than using a razor and hair grows back soft. Although it is a bit tough to use when skin is wet</li>
            <li> There is no point in repeating the info in the great prior reviews for this product.  Lets just say that, after suffering through a whole host of similar products, over the years, this one works PERFECTLY, with no rashes, nicks, ingrown hairs . . . etc.  One thing that others haven&#x27;t mentioned: It actually LOOKS GOOD on the bathroom counter and takes up very little space.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is what i actually wanted. love to have this product...&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend everyone this product ...thanks philips for this</li>
            <li> The design is enticing because it seems to have a wide range of functionality and is waterproof, but it fails at nearly every task it is designed for.  Battery: I had read a number of reviews here saying the buzzer would stop holding a charge after a few weeks, but there seemed to be a lot of disagreement.  Well those reviews were right, after just a few times using the buzzer it only holds a charge for about 20 mins and becomes noticeably weaker within the first 5 minutes of use.  Waterproof: The waterproof thing is a gimmick, it doesn&#x27;t cut wet hair very well, so using it in the shower is highly ineffective.  The Trimmer: The guard on trimmer side easily falls down to the lowest setting, so I only use it on the lowest setting now, limiting its versatility significantly.  The Shaver: The shaver side is very weak and requires 5+ passes to shave any area fully.  This leads to irritation and really long shaves, so I&#x27;ve stopped using the shaver functionality as well.</li>
            <li> Works better then any other I have bought!</li>
            <li> when i was read the positive responding i was enthusiastic to much of the product.&lt;br /&gt; But sadly disappointed after three month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several times there was blood coming out when trying to shave in the sensitive place. i cut my self  I was very, very careful with how I used the groomer and very slowly. i try with day and with wet. I tried the shaver dry and put Powder.  still there is cut and blood comes out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how some people could even give this product one or two stars... some of the reviews are bogus, while others are using it to try and shave their heads, when it says on the box that it is for below the neckline. Great product, doing its job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Not sure if im doing this wrong but the shaver (wide) part of the Bodygroom does not work well down there.  Pulls hair, not sure if im doing something wrong.     also charge is 10 min max.</li>
            <li> This product was defective right out of the box.  I followed instruction off owners manual, but noted that the green LED indicator would not go on while charging.  Contacted Philips product support who offered little insight, conceding almost immediately that the shaver must be defective.      I previously owned the Philips BG 2020 which lasted only two years and was used a total of maybe 6 times before the anemic ni-cd battery died and wouldn&#x27;t take charges.  A defective brand new BG-2040 underscores my suspicion that the entire line of Philips/Norelco bodygroom shavers are lemons.  $29.99 retail for the older BG2020 was a reasonable price.  But asking $69.99 for the Bodygroom Pro that according to other reviews may work for only 3-12 months before dying is an insult.  It didn&#x27;t work right out of the box.  Pathetic.</li>
            <li> I ordered this trimmer with high hopes.  I had another Philips that lasted 5 years before it gave up.  (I&#x27;m moderately furry, and trim everywhere except my back (which is mostly hairless) every three or four weeks, at different comb lengths just for some variety.  My lady friend prefers my chest hair longer.  So I&#x27;ve used guide numbers 1-5.)  I like the adjustable comb feature - my last Norelco had multiple combs, none of which was ever the precisely correct length.  I recently began growing a beard, just for fun.    This trimmer stopped charging after about three months, which was about three charges.  When it was working, a full charge would last a long time!  I polished the charging contacts, and there IS voltage there.  But none of it gets to the trimmer&#x27;s battery.  I&#x27;ve tried leaving it on overnight and all-day charges three or four times recently.  Now I&#x27;m giving up.  I bought a wired Wahl, and I&#x27;ll see if that one works better.  The only thing I&#x27;m not going to do is go back to scissors.  Though I have considered just letting the whole thing go natural, a la Seventies!</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Norelco BG2020 and got great use of it for about 2 years. When it came time for me to replace it, I went with this since you naturally want to go with the \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; version. However, I miss my old 2020 for one reason - this one bites! The clippers on the shaver side adjust but are more aggressive which can cause burns - something I never experienced with the 2020. This 2040 does have a better trimmer though. I like the easy adjustment of the trimmer settings which work great on my sideburns. I don&#x27;t recommend this groomer for facial shaving though - and it&#x27;s not intended for close face shaving anyway. It charges well and and has a nice appearance, so overall it works well but is a little aggressive for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the highest expectations when making this purchase because I&#x27;ve had several trimmers to date, but this has definitely exceeded my expectations.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars was because the clipper side is adjustable with different sizes, but even the lowest setting of 1 doesn&#x27;t cut very short, so I can&#x27;t use it to trim my facial hair.  But to be fair, it is advertised as a body trimmer and not a beard trimmer, so I suppose it wasn&#x27;t really intended to be used for facial hair.  Overall, its great, well worth the cost, and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this product, except I dropped it in the shower and the flexible top part broke off.  Be careful of drops because once you break the top you only have the side burn end that will work.</li>
            <li> This shaver is just awesome. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like at first was that the guard didn&#x27;t come off the buzzer (which I thought I read in a review), but I was wrong about that.  It comes off and you.  There is a slight learning curve to the shaver side like many say but it&#x27;s not like you have to learn German.  I&#x27;ve been using this thing for a while and never had as much as a pinch.  This thing is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Regardless of the fact that my husband has cut himself with this product, the customer service at Philips Norelco is awful.  The rep answered me in 3 words, nothing is covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has been used less than 5 times and will no longer charge.  Guess who is out the money for a defective product? You are! Don&#x27;t buy this unless you want to keep purchasing. Very disappointed that I wasted money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAME ON YOU PHILIPS!</li>
            <li> Great shave, amazing battery life</li>
            <li> this product exceeded my expectations. i have very course body hair and doubted it get the job done. i would recomend it to anyone who is looling for a good men&#x27;s body groomer</li>
            <li> Amazing product best ive used ever. Definitely something i would recommend getting if you have sensitive skin. Well worth it</li>
            <li> when i got this nothing on it worked, so i sent it back and got a new one. the seccond one i got inly the razor side worked but not the trimmer. im tired if paying for shipping for something that dosent work. but ither than that if u have better luck than me, the side that works works great lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it short -    It does what you would expect it to do and does it well.  Works better dry than it does in the shower.    Common sense goes a long way when using a product like this so think before you use it.</li>
            <li> i tried it for 5 times now and i can tell you for sure that you will feel great while and after using it&lt;br /&gt;from now on i &#x27;ll never use any other substitute</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a body razor before but I must say this is a great product, it performs exactly as described. The only complaint is a bit of razor burn/rash that lasted a day or so but I believe that was due to misuse (pressing too hard). I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Can finally shave ALL over with absolutely no nicks , even over testacies !!!</li>
            <li> Where to start this is so fantastic. Like others I read a few reviews on this and a couple other models. This seemed acceptable and would get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first use a few minutes ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it far exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all there is the double ended design. I&#x27;ve seen these before where both ends run at once, ie, double drain on the battery. Not so here. This has separate on/off for each end. Easy to locate and push button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel was very comfortable in my hand, not too heavy and easy to hold with a lite grip it was well balanced. I quickly became comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first trimmed my beard and mustache. What a pleasure. It glided effortlessly through all parts doing the job quickly. My old beard trimmer while doing a good job, never was this easy to use. I did not feel any snagging and it easily followed all contours even under the chin. Did the job much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I decided to test out the manscraper function. I&#x27;ve had the strange feeling to shave my legs and everything below the neck for some time. I&#x27;ve used a manual razor with some success, but it takes so long and was harsh to my skin in some areas. This was quick and much easier. I did under arms, chest, stomach, sensative areas, legs feet and toes. Areas before that were a slight problem or tricky with a mnaul razor like rough knees and under arms, this went over easily, following contours effortslessly. It was so gentle on all body parts calling it a manscraper sounds harsh but it really does the job so very gently. Going up my legs was so easy, one single pass from foot to knee where it took three or four strokes the manual way, er width of the razor. I feel it did a much better job and in at least 1/10th the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also replaces two devices, a razor and a beard trimmer, so it saves space on the counter and one less charger plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best of either type I have ever owned, being about my fifth one over the years.</li>
            <li> This is my first time reviewing and i am only doing it because i expected a lot from this product.    The head (side) that has the shaver works fine, except that if your hair is more than 2 inches long it would hurt a bit and won&#x27;t work smoothly.    The other head that has the trimmer is totally useless because after using it for 3-4 minutes the charge light starts blinking. It would start going slow and stop trimming facial or body hair. This was a total disappointment for me. Nobody mentioned it in the reviews when i was buying this product.     A full charge takes about 4-5 hours and still the trimmer won&#x27;t work more than 3-4 minutes, however the shaver would work without a glitch.     I was stupid and threw out the box and papers of the product when i bought it (because i only used the shaver and thought everything is fine).   I would not recommend this product to anyone because it doesn&#x27;t work as advertised. I don&#x27;t know about the older model, but people are really satisfied with it.    Best of luck</li>
            <li> still working after years of use</li>
            <li> The razor work good though I don&#x27;t care for the swivel head because it folds over when you use it. Takes some getting used too. The other end has a guard but it set to high for trimming hair. It is also pretty loud. The model below this one was better IMHOP.</li>
            <li> Despite all the negative comments who the people must have had a really tough personal problem when it comes to hair. this product works as great as it does for the price. don&#x27;t be afraid to buy it.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Bodygroom Pro Grooming System is a great electric shaver. It works just like the product description says. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have had a product like this. I was a little skeptical at first but man, it is great! I researched other products and models and this was definitely the best buy. No switching attachments, decent battery (but no indicator) and really easy to use.    Pros: Simple, easy to use. No problems with pinching or anything. Very easy to clean.    Cons. None really for me. Not having a battery indicator isn&#x27;t a big issue for me but it could be for some people. Not for use above the neck maybe? But that isn&#x27;t how it was designed.    I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> shaver part is really good, trimmer part size adjustment little bit ineffective. would like to go shorter.  but it is fine product.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more after reading the reviews. I cut my own hair so I have clippers with the attachments to shave close to the body. And I have an electric face razor with a adjustable trimmer to shave all or a little less than all the hair. The closeness from the face razor and hair clippers is actually closer than this product. Its good if you don&#x27;t have these.  But I already did and was hoping for a lot better trim. Still a good product.</li>
            <li> This is not an electric trimmer attached to a razor blade, what a sham. This is the real deal. It works great! Even on thick hair, even above the neck (though the manual states not to use it there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does work under the shower without rusting, without slowing down or losing any effectiveness. I&#x27;ve thoroughly enjoyed using this unit for the past 6 months. It&#x27;s been easy to clean up and does give a close shave leaving the skin smooth. I haven&#x27;t had any issue with rash or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do find a little bothersome is that the fella runs out of juice pretty quickly. Either that or I got a \\&quot;defective\\&quot; unit... or maybe it&#x27;s because of my thick hair. It&#x27;s quite a trooper though considering all the work it does.</li>
            <li> Previous reviewers said it best, I&#x27;ll echo their confidence in this product.  It&#x27;s a solid device and works well for all intended uses.  Buy and use with confidence!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my new shaver for the past couple of weeks and this thing is the best!  If you want smooth balls without using a rash causing razor or irritating depilatory creams, this is it.  The side with the adjustable fins is great for trimming down regular body hair and, contrary to the instructions, is great for trimming facial hair to that 3 o&#x27;clock shadow look if you take the guard off.  The other end with the screen does the job flawlessly on the twig and berries.  It&#x27;s a leap of faith the first time you apply it to your junk and rake it across, but when you feel how smooth the trim is and how it does not cut or burn your tender bits, you will groom more aggressively.  The tilting head really helps get the taint and ass area baby smooth, in complete comfort.  As an avid manscaper, I highly recommend this product... and so do my girls who get to enjoy the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality is top notch and mine has been running off the original charge for 2 weeks now.  Make sure to follow the charging instructions as this unit uses a NiMh battery, not a Lithium one and they are prone to battery memory.  Do as the instructions say and charge it fully before using, about 10 hours, then unplug it and let it sit in the provided cradle.  Make sure to run the batteries completely out before recharging for another 10 hours and never leave it on the charger for days on end if you care to have it work for years to come.</li>
            <li> Great for manscaping and overall body grooming.  Not wild about how long it takes to charge but it&#x27;s wet/dry so no complaints.  Take your time with this thing.  Let it eat, don&#x27;t feed it.</li>
            <li> I use this to maintain my beard and it is great. Plus it holds a charge for what seems like ever. Great product!</li>
            <li> This shaver doesn&#x27;t cause as much irritation or nicking as I got when I tried a regular old face shaver, but there&#x27;s still some, and it doesn&#x27;t get anywhere near as close as the face shaver. There&#x27;s always about a millimeter of stubble left no matter how many times you go over it- and you will have to go over it a bunch to get down to even that.    Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t found anything else that shaves without causing nicking and bleeding in that area; I did get a few pinches with this but no bleeding. My face shaver caused tiny bleeding cuts, and I&#x27;m terrified of even trying a manual razor there.    The trimmer is almost useless. I thought it wasn&#x27;t working at all, but then I saw there were a few hairs on it, so obviously it was cutting something, but it didn&#x27;t have much effect. The trimmer on my face shaver is far, far better.    All in all, it has some value, but it&#x27;s not what the reviews had led me to expect.</li>
            <li> This thing has been an amazing investment for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was born particularly hirsute, so much so that it would be easy to mistake me for a wild animal were I to strip naked in the wilderness.  This grooming kit allows me to tame the wild, either grooming or completely removing the offending follicles with absolutely no irritation, yanking or nipping.  Yes, even on the tenderest of tender areas.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this thing is just amazing.  There isn&#x27;t a whole lot that I can write that others haven&#x27;t already said.  If you&#x27;re afraid that your soft skin (Im an easy bleeder) will not tolerate an electric snipper, you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised. Im now smoother and barer than the day I was born and I wasn&#x27;t nicked or pulled on at all! No blood! yay!</li>
            <li> Maybe mine was defective (considering all the rave reviews here), but this product hurt so bad I wasn&#x27;t able to use it for more than a few seconds at a time, while shaving my head.  I quickly gave up and just decided to return it.  Too bad, I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> After messing around for years with the spinning types this nose hair trimer finally does the job.   The eye brow trimmer attachment is a great bonus feature.</li>
            <li> I was terribly unsatisfied with this product.    It was unable to trim to anything closer than a quarter centimeter of stubble which made it look like I hadn&#x27;t bothered shaving or trimming below the neck in a week.  Wet/dry &amp; with/without shaving cream didn&#x27;t make much of a difference.  Obviously this is not the case for everyone who uses it but it certainly was a disappointment for me because the convenience of the product is great (that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s 2 stars instead of 1).    I think part of the problem is that the body hair I&#x27;m trimming tends to grow out at an angle close to the skin (rather than perpendicularly).  The shaver just wasn&#x27;t able to get close enough to trim these hairs as short as I neeed. This is something to be aware of if you&#x27;re thinking of purchasing.    For now I&#x27;ll just go back to my trusty Mach 3.  Thanks for the easy return Amazon.</li>
            <li> After using 2x of the original BodyGrooms 2020 models *which in my opinion are junk overall* but they are easier to use with out getting any nicks or irritation.  I am giving the 2040 a 5 out of 5 stars because once you get used to it *took me a couple of shaves* and the first I did nick myself on the first shave but afterwards no irritation or nicks at all.  I have used the following products for shaving:  bodygroom 2020, body bare, quite a few Multi-bladed razors and even using electric clippers.  The body bare was alright for stubble but would not touch the longer hair and the included clippers with the package I had purchased with it, irritated skin and don&#x27;t even think trying to use any of them in sensitive areas unless you want to have a sex change lol.  The 2040 does a great job and yes I did nick myself by not paying attention but the next couple of shaves &#x3D; nick free, pain free and pretty smooth.  The 3D head of this bodygroom, helps get everything smooth *not bbs like a razor* but pretty close.  Add a Mangroomer pro back shaver and you keep all body hair at bay.  Shaving underarms are a lot better with this versus the 2020 by a long shot and the added length from having the electric trimmer &#x3D; better reach for hard to reach areas.  I have only charged this item 2x in the last 5 days which was amazing compared to the 2020 which after a shaving session, I would have to charge daily.  Buy this bodygroom and I highly recommend setting up with the Subscription of replacement blades at least every 6 months but more like every 4 months if you are using frequently because the blades do wear out fast.  No cons so far, this seems to be better built then the 2020 *my second one split, the rubber button split from body*..  I never used the combs with that but it used to be water resistant but with the new one, I do not see this happening as it seems more solid.  Considering I have been shaving my body for well over 4 years now, it used to be a pain to do but with thisand the mangroomer &#x3D; I really don&#x27;t need anyone to do any shaving for me now.  Well worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting a losing battle with body hair for years now. I have very sensitive skin, so most attempts to get rid of body hair has left me with rashes and razor burn. The first time I tried this product I failed to read the instruction to completely charge it, and I had a bad experience. I was dejected, but I decided to try again the next night after letting it charge. I got in the shower, held my breath and gave it a go. I was shocked how well it worked. I used it on several highly sensitive areas and received smooth skin with no irritation. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, great price; purchased one previously and paid more for the same brand and model.  At first was leery about sensitive areas but after using it there is no concern.</li>
            <li> Phillips Norelco BodyGroom Pro is perfect.  Close and smooth shave, and extremely easy to use for perfect lines and edging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now and have had some very interesting experiences with it. I&#x27;ve read all of the reviews some of which sing praises and others which seem to condemn the product.  This is a VERY good product...I mean you can&#x27;t really get any better than this.  In terms of cuts, dings, gashes, etc, it is definitely possible but more so from not paying attention, taking your time and planning what you&#x27;re going to do (think about it - do you think your barber just hacks away?? Consider his approach...meticulous, deliberate, extended).  Have you gotten a little ding from the barber?  You should have the same expectations here.  However there are a few things to consider early which for me I believe are essential:  1) If you are not accustomed to shaving/trimming and venturing in this area for the first time, then:    a) Talk to a woman (someone you trust); they&#x27;ve been doing this for years (think about it) ask for advice for your particular situation    b) Make sure you clean up first.  That is, take a shower and really clean your self    c) Start slow...if you have a lot of hair then put the trimmer to the number one position and start from there then gradually move down to number four    d) Once trimmed, leave it there and get accustomed to it and when I say accustomed I mean your skin.  Having all that hair gone changes the &#x27;climate&#x27; (think about it)    e) Once you are accustomed and want to go further (shave)...repeat steps a and b.  Use the shaver and follow the  directions that came with the manual and advice from your woman friend.  2) If you are accustomed to shaving/trimming then you should appreciate this product for helping to make the process quick(er) and hopefully painless  What I like most about this product is the battery life.  I charged it 2½ months ago and its still going.  I also liked the weight, seemed sturdy (go figure).  I also liked the design which in my opinion helped me to &#x27;reach&#x27; (at this point let me re-iterate, makesure you clean yourself properly).  For the new ones getting into trimming and more so shaving please PLEASE PLEASE:  - clean yourself well  - go in one direction (for now)  - take your time (go in stages)  With that said you should have a great experience.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> In contrast to other positive reviews, I do not find this electric shaver works very well on either armpit hair or the pubic region.  The trimmer does not work well whatsoever, and I am amazed that others seem to be satisfied with the performance of the product.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, however after a month or two the foil head broke on the machine. The foil head tore off in a place, and that caused a sharp edge. Will need to buy new foil head.</li>
            <li> After reading many review I took the risk and bought the item. Surprise every good thing said was truth. Was so easy that I got a little bite carried on a got the legs all the way to the knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despues de leer varios comentarios tome el riesgo y compre el articulos. Sorpresa todo lo bueno era verdad. Fue tan sencillo que se me paso la mano y estoy razurado hasta la rodillas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three in the past several years - I would consider myself as somebody who can now review this product with expertise. The trimmer does not work, ever, on any of these models. It will last 5-15 minutes at full charge, and die - pending a new full charge. If you&#x27;re looking for a duo product - do not buy this, as the trimming side is useless. The &amp;#34;fenced razor&amp;#34; end of the product does last longer, and is somewhat efficient, however the fence does fall apart within a few uses. Anyways; its better if you mail Norelco $10 and save yourself pulling hairs and a headache than ordering this for much more, and adding the headache.</li>
            <li> The product arrived when it said it would. I placed the trimmer on the charger and once it was fully charged, I began to tackle the treacherous terrain of my own body. I used to regularly maintain my body hair with Gillette Fusion razor and shave gel before i was driven to Gove it all up altogether for my own wellbeing. As much as I enjoyed having everything neat and clean, it rarely stayed that way for 2 days before the awful razor burn, ingrown hairs, and just plain discomfort set in. With this trimmer, I used both ends, dry, with no shave gel. Things were very unruly, but the trimmer slowly mowed through my body hair with virtually no resistance. It took a third of the time my routine used to take and I could not be happier with the end results. I would buy this product again if I had to do it all over again.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver/trimmer. Does everything advertised and quality is great. Battery lasts long time, and its easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like the others say. It will groom everything. The only thing I wish it had was a way to plug into an electrical plug. Just incase the batteries were getting low. I still give it five stars though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with my purchase for two reasons. (1) It does a poor job shaving, and (2) the battery loses it&#x27;s charge very quickly, and doesn&#x27;t hold it in storage for longer than a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the shaving, it takes multiple passes with the long-hair trimmer to get the hair actually cut shorter, and after that it takes even more passes with the close shaver all for an end result of stubble. There is no close or smooth shave to be had here. I&#x27;ve tried dry and wet shaving (in the shower) with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the battery, the problem I have is that I&#x27;ll charge it up fully, place it aside for my next use, but usually that usage is a week away, and by the time I go to use it again, the battery has lost its charge. The instructions state not to leave it in the charger once fully charged, so I haven&#x27;t been doing that. The result is that it&#x27;s just not often usable when I need it.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I have used it a ton and it works great dry or wet.  I personally like to use it wet with soap.  I shaved my head (dry) the other night with it and it was perfect.  The battery lasted a long time before I had to charge it.  I would charge it before doing anything large like your head.  I have only gotten a few nicks from it and have found if I follow the directions and keep it perpendicular to my skin I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer specifically to trip a certain part of my body. After looking up reviews online this particular model received the highest praise for that area so I splurged. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the ease and pain-free way that I&#x27;m able to virtually eliminate all of my hair down there. It&#x27;s a nice close shave with the foil end, and basically no chance of Knicks or cuts. The other end, however, is noticeably sharper, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it below the belt, but it&#x27;s great for other areas such as the chest or neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, who complain about the design of the groomer and the side trimmers of this groomer, in my opinion, it has a perfect design. only if users understand the mechanism of the groomer, they will shave their body without any problem. Keep the groomer horizontal, and slide it forward. There is no need to press. By sliding the groomer, side trimmers will cut the long hairs, and long hairs become short enough to be shaved by a hidden trimmer, which is covered by a thin foil. Otherwise, without the side trimmers, you can not trim long hairs, and before anything else,you have to cut the long hairs with a scissor which is dangerous, and it takes time. As I said before, only keep the groomer in a way that the side trimmers become parallel with the surface of the skin, and slide the groomer forward (or backward). As a result, the weight of the groomer is enough for cutting the long hairs by side trimmers. After that, short hairs will be guided through the foil holes, and the covered main trimmer will shave your body without any problem. I shaved my pubic hair without difficulty.</li>
            <li> Like the description says this really is an \\&quot;all in one grooming solution.\\&quot; I&#x27;m by no means a hairy guy but I wanted to buy a shaver for below the waist. I have tried using a hair trimmer, electric shaver, and manual shaving and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with any of it. Manual shaving works good but I got tired of the battle scars (I shave right when I wake up.) I read some reviews and decided I would give it a shot and I&#x27;m glad I did. Like others have said one of the downsides is when it arrives its not charged and the charging time is a full 8 hours! So I immediately put it on the charger and wait impatiently for 8 hours to test it out. On the eighth hour on the dot I jump in the shower with it and was amazed at how well it worked. It obviously won&#x27;t work as well as a manual shaver which I was hoping by some miracle it would, but it gets the job done fast with no more scars. Its very safe but still use some caution you can hurt yourself! I have also used the trimmer for my beard and armpits and have had no problems at all with it. Cleaning is just as easy as shaving. Just pop off whichever end needs cleaning rinse it out and let it dry and you&#x27;re all done! I really love this thing especially since its water proof it makes my life a lot easier. The only con I can think of is the long charging time but once its charged it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> from all i could find out before i purchased this i expected better. the actual close shave area is not wide enough or round enough. it actually has a tendency to nick &amp; pull on hairs. the bottom end for longer hair is great! no issues at all.</li>
            <li> I had a previous version of the Bodygroom device. It worked great! Unfortunately it fell to the ground and shattered after 2 years of use.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to &#x27;upgrade&#x27; and purchased, what I thought, was a better model. While it works, and gets the job done, I don&#x27;t feel as &#x27;safe&#x27; using it around the nether regions.  I think the pivoting head is what makes it feel like you are one twitch away from a painful night in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bodygroom Plus and Bodygroom seem to be a closer match to what I used before.</li>
            <li> 1st time man-scaper! I am one hairy sumumabitch! I&#x27;ve been working out, and have improved pecks &amp; six-pack-abs...so wanted to shave my chest/stomach so I can show it off at the pool. After charging it, I began. It took quite a while to get it smooth....and it&#x27;s not perfectly smooth (I ended up using my facial electric braun shaver to get it a bit closer). The Philips is nice. I like both ends. It&#x27;s not too noisy. The battery life was fine. But, I&#x27;m just not that impressed with the closeness of the shave. Perhaps I&#x27;m overreacting since this is my first time shaving my body, but I expected babysmooth skin. You&#x27;ll like this razor to get rid of the thick stuff...but if you want it super-smooth...keep shopping around.</li>
            <li> Works great, hold a charge for a very long time. Cuts the hair doesn&#x27;t pull like other clippers. I would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> Excellent for below neck shaving. It&#x27;s not just for men. Women use it too.</li>
            <li> Oh baby, I am all so shaven now. lol</li>
            <li> This is an excellent electric razor. Does everything I need it to do.</li>
            <li> I have struggled for years with skin irritation after shaving. I read reviews about this shaver and I was very skeptical about the claims of a irritation-free shave. Let me tell you...I have used this several times and it holds true to the claim. I have NEVER shaved without skin irritation following and this little beauty does the job. I am very impressed and I will never doubt the wonders of Norelco again! If you have sensitive skin, this is the shaver for you!</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product!Great job Philips!!&lt;br /&gt;I only had problem with the US/Europe pluging system; I couldn&#x27;t find a plug adapter easily here...</li>
            <li> MUCH BETTER than I expected. Shaves close and without any cuts or snags. So much better than using a blade razor. Beard trimmer half is great for toning down those hairy legs without full shaving. And great for full shaving your man parts. No nicks. No cuts. No stubble. No rash or tenderness. Just smooth skin after the fact. No more blade razors and no more expensive powered blade razors. If you are a shaving guy in those man areas, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Me gusta mucho, afeita muy bien, no irrita despues de afeitarse, lo unico que hay que tener en cuenta es para que no moleste cuando se afeite es que este bien cargada, porque cuando le falta carga, fastidia y aveces lastima, pero cumple con lo que ofrece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like, shaved fine, non-irritating after shaving, the only thing to remember is to not disturb while shaving is that it fully charged, because when you need load it hurts and sometimes it hurts, but it does what it offers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a year now.  For the most part it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable clipper works without nicking, and has a good selection of trim lengths.  But the plastic adjuster/blade guard is a bit flimsy and will break if mishandled.  Also, it could get lost easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body shaver side does cut very close to the skin, also without nicking, and has a dual sided fine trimmer as well to knock down the hairs.  Also, I find the handle design is good and long, allowing me to reach all sections of my back, with a little stretch.  I don&#x27;t need a second device to reach my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you probably figured out by now that this is NOT a face trimmer, so disregard any reviews that knock off points for not shaving your beard well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, insofar as a shaver/trimmer/clipper for body hair, this thing works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad:&lt;br /&gt;The charge is terrible.  I wish I could use it with a cord, but, it only works cordless.  I can hardly trim my entire chest without the charge depleting. I&#x27;m not THAT hairy of a guy either.  It lasts 10 minutes at the most (from the very first day I used it).  I would expect something of this size (it is not small, measuring 7.5\\&quot; long) to last at least 20 minutes like my sideburn/beard trimmer, which is 1/3 the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the charging cradle, though it looks nice, is not well balanced, only holds the trimmer when on a flat surface and cannot be mounted on a wall.  It needlessly folds, but really doesn&#x27;t save any space by doing so, and you cannot connect the trimmer to the charger alone, you must use the stand.  So, if you travel, that&#x27;s three things to take (trimmer/charger/stand) because you can&#x27;t charge it and take it with you, you will not get through but one trimming session at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $50 here on Amazon with free shipping, it was cheaper than my local store.  But if you want something with a longer charge, or that can be used with the cord when the charge is depleted, look elsewhere.the charge is depleted, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is the best. I have gone through many in the past and this works the best. It has 5 different measurements for your beard and can easily shave the neck (or any other place) to a smooth surface with the other side. Easy to clean and maintain and easy to charge.</li>
            <li> This constantly nips my skin and doesn&#x27;t shave very close. My cheap 20 buck buzzer from Walmart worked 1000x better. Wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
            <li> The Philips BF2040 is my first personal groomer. I tried it both wet and dry, and I got great results for both. Definitely use some shaving gel or lathered soap if using it wet. The comb attachment at the end is really nifty -- it slides for length adjustment, or you can just take it off for closer mowing. Right now, I&#x27;m smooth where I want to be and perfectly groomed elsewhere! You can definitely use this groomer wherever you want -- underarms, groin, backdoor, all painlessly. Making short, smooth movements helped. Whenever I left the teeth on one area for too long, it did pinch me a bit which wasn&#x27;t pleasant. No awful bleeding or anything though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Encouraged by the review &#x27;Im a Believer&#x27;, and other positive reviews I decided to place my hopes on this body grommer for men. Prior to my purchase, I waxed and shaved with great results, albeit more effort required.     My dissapointment with this groomer is that it does not get close enough to the skin, even after multiple passes with pressure to not leave visible stubs behind.     Being a male, I have hairy arms and legs amongst other body parts.. I was sorely disappointed in that I could not acheive the &#x27;shaved&#x27; or wax look right after using this trimmer.  Of course your mileage may vary based on your hair type but this trimmer did not provide me with the results I was hoping for.. It just didnt get close enough and now my arms have a 12&#x27;o clock shadow.. :-(</li>
            <li> Awesome Product, As easy as 1-2-3!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 Stars for Precision and Perfection&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this product is that when it shaves your body hair, it does not cause rashes. Meaning, it does not feel like you put a porcupine between your legs after you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to know:&lt;br /&gt;-Be careful which side you are using, as there is no indicator as to which side is on besides the buzzing sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Trim before using the foil shaver. Don&#x27;t worry if it&#x27;s long, the Foil shaver on the opposite end will cut it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-After less than 3 minutes from when I shave, NO irritation, NO rashes. Wonderful shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cleaning takes less than 2 minutes. Comes with a dual sided brush (long+Soft/Short+hard)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-This is NOT a submarine. It can be wetted, become wet, or washed entirely with water, however is NOT to be submerged in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend this to another.</li>
            <li> This item is really convenient as it can cut long or short hair and it has a lot of power as well. The only problem is that once it is fully charged it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I thought it would and there&#x27;s no way to use it while it is charging.</li>
            <li> Watch out for the two moving blades of the shaver end!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades will work fine if you shave a flat-surface area like your legs for example, but any other areas that are curvy and sensitive like your groin, they will cut your skin.  I think this is just poor design because when you want a silky smooth look, the trimmer end does a decent job of trimming down long hairs to about 1/10 of an inch (though, it can still cut you if you hard press it without a guard).  Now all you need is the foil shaver to finish the stubbles.  However, this can&#x27;t be done because the two moving blades will cut you when you press the shaver close to your skin.  If you don&#x27;t press the shaver close to your skin, the stubbles will still be there and later create excruciating itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery didn&#x27;t last long in my case after I followed instructions and had it first charged for 10 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed in this product because it was one of the few bodygrommers that got 4.5 out of 5 stars rating on Amazon.  It got high rating possibly because disappointed customers like me are busy returning it to Amazon or the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> i bought this bc i&#x27;ve been having problems finding a good shaver for bikini line since i hate using a regular razor, this def gives you bad razor burn also it doesnt shave close at all! my husband can use the clipper end for his bread which is the only good part of the shaver!</li>
            <li> Gives a nice clean shave ANYWHERE on your body, easy to use, easy to handle and very easy to clean after each use. Great product overall.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of all the great reviews on this site. I have to shave the same area over and over to see any results and even then its not close enough.It is probably effective for someone with light body hair.</li>
            <li> First off, this is the BEST body grooming device out there today.  If you want to be smooth wherever or just some touching up, this is the gadget for the job.  Far less irritation than manual or other electric razors.  I&#x27;ve had my Bodygroom since it first launched years ago and have been upgrading as Norelco improves the product.  The pivot head is great because it better follows the contours of your body and is especially handy in the groin (be careful down there!).      In my experience, shaving wet increases the friction and doesn&#x27;t allow the blades to cut as close to the skin.  If you want a shave that&#x27;s as close as a manual razor would be, minus the irritation, use baby powder (made of cornstarch, not talc).  Sprinkle the powder over the area you&#x27;re going to shave first, then gently rub it in so the powder covers the whole area evenly.  This will create a smooth, dry shaving surface so the blades can cut close but will lessen the risk of nicking the skin.  It will also help clean out the hair from the razor head by absorbing any skin oil/moisture and thus the hair can just be blown/brushed out easily for cleanup.      Make sure to replace blades roughly every six months or whenever they become dull (you&#x27;ll notice you have to push harder and sweep over areas more frequently with dull blades, and will tend to get more nicks).    Use small, gentle, 1-2\\&quot; strokes for areas of dense hair, and broader strokes for just a light dusting of hair.  Do this before you shower so you can hop in under the spray after shaving and rinse off any remaining powder.  However, if you&#x27;re on the go fast you can simply brush a towel gently across the area and that&#x27;ll get rid of the excess powder, too.  Using powder will also reduce friction between your clothes and shaving areas, so this is particularly good for athletic folks or anyone who wears tight clothes.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Haven&#x27;t experienced any nicks yet and handle easily.</li>
            <li> It really works. I totally recommend. Painless, fast, no redness, can wet and you can use in your entire body (except head). After star using you literally cannot stop!  Cons: The plastic parts looks cheap and non durable. There is no case. Kind of big in size. The charger specifications are different from my brand-new Philips razor, so I cannot use the same charger cable in both products.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was very skeptical about how well it would work on \\&quot;the fun zone\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m very happy to report I used it for the first time last night and did NOT have that \\&quot;OH $&amp;%@!!!!!\\&quot; moment of something being pulled, nicked, cut, torn into.  I was very cautious around \\&quot;the boys\\&quot; at first but it just really worked well in taming my jungle.  A smooth and more importantly PAIN FREE trimming experience.  It also did a really nice job on my beard.  As other&#x27;s have noted the beard trimming guard is not the hardest/toughest plastic around.  The guard could be described as flimsy, but I&#x27;m trimming my beard not opening a can of tuna so I&#x27;m not overly concerned about it.  The unit itself (the trimmer not mine) feels good and sturdy in your hand and is a good size (ok, mine could be described that way too, lol).  Look, as guys we&#x27;re never going to feel \\&quot;great\\&quot; about having sharp metal objects cutting \\&quot;that area\\&quot;.  But this excellent trimmer made the process easy, painless, and my life didn&#x27;t flash before my eyes in terror while using it.  It works, buy it.</li>
            <li> Best unit on the market</li>
            <li> Advertised as an all-in-one grooming solution the actual instructions indicate the trimmer should not be used on the face.  Since this was purchased primarily as an electric shaver for the face we are returning. I never got beyond reading the instructions before deciding to return, so I can not review the use of the product.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised. I would buy again and recommend to anyone. No nicks or accidental  cuts. Does not create produce baby smooth skin, but very close.</li>
            <li> Seriously, Norelco...???  Couldn&#x27;t find a battery solution that doesn&#x27;t require one to run down the battery till it&#x27;s completely dead before you can charge it again?  What is this 1985?  If you don&#x27;t follow this rule, then the battery begins to wither away....until it only holds a charge for about 1 minute.  I would rather it took two regular AA&#x27;s.  At least then, I could still use the damn thing.</li>
            <li> This shaver is easy to use and it does a great grooming job. The battery charged up quickly the first time and I have yet to recharge.  The instruction says to use up all the juice in the battery before charging, but I have used it 4 times now and the indicator light has not come on yet. Each time I use it is about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stainless steel head of the shaver is a bit difficult to remove for cleaning if you have not tried it a couple of times.  You have to pull with a firm grip.  And putting it back in also needs a firm push.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer with the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; is kind of fragile.  It is plastic and it should be removed carefully and more gently.</li>
            <li> The best of the best, after try like 4 different shavers this one is definitely the best I ever try, and the best part is It can be used on the shower.</li>
            <li> This is the best body groomer that I have ever purchased.  Works very well.  Battery life may be an issue for some.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, the product is great, a 10/10</li>
            <li> I recently bought it, but not its not better than the BG2030. The shaver looks kinda cheap and the comb trimmer does not cut small hair, instead it leaves the hairs uneven.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am a man that, for lack of a better description, Manscapes.  For those men that like to keep the bonsai (as Philips Norelco calls it) looking nice there is no other choice than this.  For years I tried using traditional razors and no matter what shave lotions, gels, creams, etc I always suffered from razor burn and in-grown hairs.  With the Bodygroomer I have just smooth skin and no irritation in the nether regions.  I have found it works best as a wet shave in the shower using Bump Patrol cool shave gel that I get through StockNGo and I follow with Target&#x27;s brand of Neutrogena Calming Lotion.  I do use a Gillette Fusion on the scrotum area as a personal preference (since I never had any irritation there).  Guys, if you like to keep that area looking good (we shouldn&#x27;t ask women to do anything we would not do ourselves!) this is the PERFECT razor to use.  I use the Amazon prescription service and change my blades every six-months and I am not sure if it is necessary but as cheap as it is I feel like it is worth it.  Buy it and you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> This body groomer works as, if not better than, advertised. I am very happy with this product. It cuts nicely without irritating or cutting one&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> Works well. Nice charging station.</li>
            <li> First of all, I Will tell everyone who reads this.  NO PRODUCT is perfect.  The Bodygroom Pro, is as close to perfect as any MAN can purchase. For the Man that worries about shaving the Chest and Forest below and knows how sensitive those areas are. This razor is the fr!@&amp;ing BOMB! I read all the reviews on this site and many others before I decided to finally pull the trigger and make the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW!  THE BEST personal grooming tool EVER! I have owned it for just over two weeks.  I used to use regular razors and I had a HUGE problem with irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this little tool, I have yet to have a problem. Wet, which I feel does not get as close. As well as Dry, much closer shave.  First of all, You can&#x27;t just run rampid and reckless and not get a bit nicked up. Once you learn how to use this gift to Mans Below the belt regions and the chest?  You are gonna wonder, why it took so long for this invention to come about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It REALLY, REALLY works well.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I cut myself a few times before I figured out the best way to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If You are sick and tired of using your own electric razor, or just a plain blade, this is totally the gift from heaven Guys have Waited for!!  Fantastic product, and a trimmer with a guard on the bottom!!!  You can&#x27;t go wrong. Just don&#x27;t let the Forest overrun the Tree to much or it really gets difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If You are in doubt?  Don&#x27;t BE!  It is the best Manly Grooming tool EVER!  BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> the only reason i am not giving this 5 stars is because there is no bag or travel case for the shaver, plus there is no shaver head cap so if you plan on using this sporadically you may want to water down the head to remove any dust</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant on using this product on certain area of my body, I know it says it can be used pretty much everywhere but still I was very iffy on trying it. I think I was shaking worse then Michel J Fox and Ali put together when I was about to use this thing on my chest around my nips and lower area&#x27;s, yet to my surprise the product works amazing in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no pain or irritation what so ever, no redness, bumps nicks nor cuts. I highly highly recommend this product to all men that want to groom themselves down there, on chest no problems on with nicking the nips or just your face it works great there too. It also leaves the skin smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom I love this product it takes care of all my grooming needs in one simple to use device, and  works wet or dry my prayers have been answered with this thing lol.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS, best I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> I mostly use this on my face to keep my beard trimmed very short.  The settings on this are not to my liking at all.  The level 1 cut is just too long, and if I take the guard off it cuts my beard too short.  I understand that is a personal critique, seeing as people obviously grow their beard at different lengths, but my 15$ Norelco beard trimmer would do the job if I wanted to switch back to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver on the flip side also does the job, but not for what it costs, imho.  It&#x27;s not nick-free and it frequently pinches in places that you don&#x27;t want it pinching.  It doesn&#x27;t nick as bad as my unguarded Norelco beard trimmer, but I just assume when you shell out 50$ or more for a beard and body trimmer that you don&#x27;t have to be so overly cautious.  Perhaps I&#x27;m wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does work great in the shower, however.  With that I am well pleased.  The charger also works well and the charge itself lasts for a long time.  So, there are ups and downs on this.  If I had a do-over, I&#x27;d probably pick a different body groomer, but this will still work.</li>
            <li> This sounded cool, but it hurt a little when I did my chest.  Doesn&#x27;t cut very close either.  I followed the direction exactly.  I tried it dry and wet and still hurt/pulled my hair a little.  Razor does a better job and doesn&#x27;t hurt!  I&#x27;m returning this Monday.  I&#x27;m going to stick with regular clippers and the new gillette mach razor.  My hair was only a few days long from being shaved so it wasn&#x27;t too long on my chest...just stuble..</li>
            <li> This thing does a great job of shaving fairly close....but not close.  I find it works pretty good in the shower if a body wash has been applied first to lubricate the skin.  I have to go back and forth a few times and it does miss hair frequently.  Good.....not great.  Don&#x27;t expect your skin to be baby smooth for a guy.  It works great for armpits in the shower and for my back.  Legs...not so great.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is amazing. I owned the first one that came out BG2020 and compared to this model it is use-less. This model is great, metalic cover with rubber grips for great holding. It is heavier then the earlier models, has buzzers on both ends which can have only one on at a time (great incase ur absent minded like me at times). The pivot head is one of the Key additions that makes the model superior, reduces any possibilty of cuttes or close calls. The other being the groomer itself has a battery power indicator, if you have had any bodygroomer with out one you must know how annoying it is to not have enough juice to get your job done. The light indicates charging, low battery power and full battery, great to know since most of these devices can malfunction if left charging to long. A must by if interested into personal grooming men and women alike. I&#x27;ve gotten all my friends into norelco because of this model series.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works very well but needs a closer setting. If you desire a close trim this is not a good product.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was exactly what I expected.  Holds a long charge.</li>
            <li> the trimming end left me with a freaking gash on my obliques and red marks all over stomach, it&#x27;s alright though, pretty cool body groomer, shaved my balls with the shaving side successfully</li>
            <li> Great product....great price....as usual. It came in 3 days during the Christmas rush season and I am thoroughly happy with it. My dad loves his present!!</li>
            <li> I like that the attatchments are built in so i can&#x27;t lose them. It&#x27;s very sleek looking, more so than the previous models. However, I feel that the cheaper older models work better; giving me a smoother closer shave. To be honest I don&#x27;t trust this one down by the privates. It nicked the sack once already, my older bodygroomer never once did so. This product is most definitely not worth the extra $25. Just go with one of the previous models, trust me. Hope this helps some one.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for any male to have! I bought my first back in 2010 while living in Italy! Bought m second one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted something like this for a long time &amp; decided to do a search on Amazon. Sure enough, I found what I wanted, ordered it, and am very pleased with my Philips Norelco Bodygroom. It works fine!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to spend money on wax anymore but does not know or want to take Veet products, this is the stuff that you need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job flawlessly and does not irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive though.</li>
            <li> Foil shaver pinches facial area, including chin, electric razer doesn&#x27;t. ER also used to cut hair on head and pubic area, works very well for both. Both foil and electric parts easy to clean. The battery lasts about as long as it says it does, which is 1 hour. This is also how long it takes to fully charge.</li>
            <li> This was highly recommended on another website I frequent so I gave it a shot. This is not an every day face razor, so don&#x27;t buy it for that. It is a great razor for grooming the rest of your body. I use it all over to minimize my ape-like hairiness. The dual heads are a great idea in one unit because you really need different approaches to different body parts. I love this groomer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m female.  Even tho this is targeted at men I thought I&#x27;d try it.  Love this product! Use it all over even on sensitive skin areas.  I use it head to toe...never has \\&quot;knicks\\&quot; like past shavers I&#x27;ve had. Very glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> much easier to use and very smooth trimmer. absolutely painless and no pulling of hair. very happy to own it.</li>
            <li> I already have a basic bodygroom, but this one was great, more power and more battery life.&lt;br /&gt;It have extra funtions that my basic one don&#x27;t have, like the hair/bear cutter.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro works as expected.  It&#x27;s a major improvement over my use of the pop-up groomer on my face shaver as a body groomer.  Very comfortable for shaving all parts of the body and no nicks anywhere!</li>
            <li> The BodyGroom Pro is so much better than the original BodyGroom that Philips should have chosen a new name for this product. The battery lasts long enough - at least 25 minutes of shaving - and charges very quickly. But the best improvement is in the blades, which cut well and quickly. Repeated passes are no longer necessary. AND the points are now rounded so that they do not irritate the skin, which is the most important improvement over the original. The cutter on the bottom, with the adjustable guard, seems to be rather useless.</li>
            <li> there are many kinds of products like this out there, but I have toy say, that this, is totally worth it, i&#x27;ve tried conventional ( and noth so conventional) methods of man-scaping, and this leaves you with minimum irritation. Totally worth the coin.</li>
            <li> Great product! It does the job!</li>
            <li> this razor is the best i&#x27;ve seen, i&#x27;ve had it for years now and have only changed the razor head once, stills works as the first day.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully. I used it to trim up my downstairs - it worked great and trimmed the length of the hair down so I could have a Brazilian wax. Before purchasing the body trimmer, most reviews suggested it was meant for men....I&#x27;m a woman and it works great for me!! It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, whether trimming or shaving,  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Waste  of money&lt;br /&gt;returned it.&lt;br /&gt;not a good product&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed from PhilpNoreleco.</li>
            <li> I bought this machine for the scrotum which is very difficult to shave with other machines / Knives.&lt;br /&gt;It did the job, but for the rest of the body it&#x27;s drudgery !&lt;br /&gt;If you plan to shave and trim your groin - this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the rest of the body do what I did - Use your haircut machine - It would do the job more efficient &amp; quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It shaves the MOST tender areas without any nicking or grabbing.</li>
            <li> Great product! The stand is really cool-looking and the dual action allows me to get the shave I need. My only complaint is that it comes with a little cleaning brush but nowhere to put it. I&#x27;m definitely going to be losing it at some point this year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing the most expensive Bodygroom because you really need to understand something before you plunk down this much cash:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t plug this in to recharge. You plug the charger in, and set the Bodygroom on the cradle. But the BG charger/cradles are cheap. Mine broke before the Bodygroom did. So... read other reviews to confirm this is an uncommon issue. While you&#x27;re reading, see if other people comment on the battery life. Yes, the batteries are NiMH. And it appears this is a 1-hour charge, vs. cheaper Norelco products that require 8-12 hour charge times. That&#x27;s usually a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Bodygroom itself... yes, it works. Amazingly well. I&#x27;m on my second (cheaper) one. Since the latest cradle fell apart, I&#x27;m having to do some wacky workarounds to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heed the warnings and do NOT use this to trim extremely tough beard hairs. That&#x27;s what Norelco triple-head razors are for.</li>
            <li> THIS SHAVER NEARLY BLED ME TO DEATH!  Those that sit on there ASS rating this as a five star work for the company!  Don&#x27;t believe a thing they say about this \\&quot;piece of s***&#x27;...  The level of trust reviewing products and rating them is extremely deceitful, someone needs to be held accountable period!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best razor for man-scaping that&#x27;s been invented. I use it a few times a week and it&#x27;s just wonderful. I used to always look for the latest and greatest in this area...I&#x27;m done looking! I just can&#x27;t say anything bad about it.</li>
            <li> It really does a good job.</li>
            <li> Loses charge after several months, and the stand will not charge any longer</li>
            <li> Very good shaver/trimmer.  Works very well in all areas, except face, which it&#x27;s not meant to be used for anyway.  Razor/foil probably should to be replaced more often than once a year, which is the recommended.  Trimmer works fine dry, but for shaver you probably want shaving cream or at least wet conditions.  Can be used in the shower, which is convenient.</li>
            <li> This is perfect. Very easy to use and wont irritate your skin. Very good on those scraggly hairs around your back and shoulders. It turned me from a hairy chimp-like creature, to a more human-like creature.</li>
            <li> Men be very careful putting this thing anywhere near your boys as it can tear them up! Safe as some say for stomachs and chest but i would stick to the razor for more gentle areas. Wasn&#x27;t as good as i was hoping from other reviews.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Great performing. Easy handling. Battery lasts for 10 shaving.</li>
            <li> Had it for about a year now and the battery is basically dead.  My older $20 Remington still work after 5 years and the battery stays charged.  Kind of a rip off for a $70 trimmer basically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I owned the cheaper version of this, the BG2020.  It was about half the price, and I liked it much better.  However, after years of use,the on/off switch failed on the unit, so I replaced it with the 2040.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I primarily use the trimmer for sensitive areas and to shorten up some of the hair on my gorilla arms ;)  The 2020 did this perfectly with the exchangeable heads and wider path.  However, the BG2040&#x27;s adjustable trimmer just doesn&#x27;t seem to get the job done.  For starters, the adjustable trimmer needs to be WIDER.  Secondly, the comb part doesn&#x27;t seem to lift the hairs that need to be trimmed very well, which means that it takes a very long time to get a nice consistent cut.  For me, the 2020 does everything I need, and does it better than it&#x27;s more expensive cousin.</li>
            <li> This item works really well--until it doesn&#x27;t. Like most products of its kind made today, it has no replaceable parts (except the shaver head), you cannot even replace the battery, and past the two year warranty, you are s*** out of luck, your disposable item goes right in to the landfill, and it&#x27;s back to Amazon to drop more $ on another product.    This problem is not unique to the BodyGroom, but it&#x27;s especially annoying because it&#x27;s a $70 item that I only use once or twice per week.    Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I had this thing for 3 months or so. Used it maybe 5 times. Now it doesn&#x27;t turn on and won&#x27;t charge.  I read the manual when I first got it and it said to get the maximum life out of your battery not to keep it plugged in after it&#x27;s been fully charged. I followed all of their recommendations.    When it actually worked:  The trimmer settings don&#x27;t really mean anything because for it to cut you have to have it on the lowest setting.  The close-shave part worked just &#x27;okay&#x27;, although I have nothing else to compare it to. It seemed to do the job around 75% of the time, but many spots wouldn&#x27;t shave smooth.</li>
            <li> This is an utter waste of money.  WHY are the reviews on Amazon so often full of lies?  Because you dont have to BUY a product to review it, therefore half the reviews are from the seller or manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is useless, i purchased it to trim my beard and shave my neck:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimming beard:&lt;br /&gt;*  Limited Settings (levels)&lt;br /&gt;*  Inconsistent trim (the centre of the shaver trims at a different level than the sides)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving neck:&lt;br /&gt;*  feels like it is about to slice my skin open&lt;br /&gt;*  doesn&#x27;t actually shave!  Unless I was bigfoot, using this to shave the neck is useless&lt;br /&gt;*  Only a maniac would use this thing close to his genitals!</li>
            <li> My son had no trouble at all using the Phillips Norelco BodyGroom Pro and is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This works well -- for now. But I had an earlier version of this and after a few months the head kept falling off when I used it. I finally gave up and ordered another, choosing the more expensive version in hopes it would last better, but it turned out just to offer an extra type of clipper which is of no use to me. I fault Amazon for not making this clear in its description of this shaver. Got my fingers crossed that this one will not start falling apart soon!</li>
            <li> Very good product for the money.  The other Philips shaver I had broke at the neck after about 1 years us use.</li>
            <li> BG 2040&#x27;s trimmer works great! It gets the job done in 5m.  The best part about the trimmer, it never has to be replaced.     The Bodygroom is 2 sided. The head is the shaver, and the button is the trimmer. You don&#x27;t have to attach anything for the trimmer.     It is extremely easy to use. In less then 5 m I learned all the features of the groom.    I am also a owner of the BG2020, and I did not like it. If you had bad experience with other Philips Norelco Bodygroom&#x27;s, the BG2040 is 100% better then other. I would highly recommend.  Specially for those who want legit trimmer.      Battery life.  I used this groom rite out of the box (because i forgot to charge it), it it was still working perfect. When I found out that I did not charge it, I was amazed on how good it worked.</li>
            <li> Great product..works well and does it exactly what its supposed to do battery life lasts long as well.overall good  product</li>
            <li> I had the older version with interchangeable blades and this is a HUGE step up. I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best bodygroomer out there..This does an excellent job in those \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas and does&#x27;nt even pinch or hurt one bit. Definitely a must buy for the man who wants to stay perfectly groomed.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a body hair trimmer since I was fed up with using an old beard trimmer and wanted to thin out the thicket of body hair my Jewish and Italian ancestors had passed down. I was intrigued by this product because of the dual heads, being able to switch from trimming to the foil shaver with a press of a button is amazingly convenient. At first I thought the handle to be cumbersome but after using the product it actually is an advantage having the large handle because it helps to reach those odd and hard to reach areas of your body. (think back of you legs, butt and back) It is also waterproof making clean up easy, especially for me since using it in the shower means not having to lay out towels on the floor and sink top to catch all the falling hair. Both heads detach to clean out any hair that might have gotten stuck. The battery life is more then sufficient for an entire body use (~35mins fully charged). All in all this is exactly what I needed in the most convenient and effective design. I&#x27;ve had mine for 2months now and assuming it doesn&#x27;t crap out on me I can&#x27;t find a single flaw.</li>
            <li> Loved it for the 5 months of battery life it offered. Wish I had read more reviews before purchasing this groomer.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love the fact that it combines the different trim heads into one that glides along skin. I really wanted to give this 4.5 stars. the only issue I have at all is a that it is a little difficult to completely rinse out the head even after detaching it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent. I wouldn&#x27;t spend my money on it again. It&#x27;s convenient, but the problem I have with it is the closeness of the shave. I get better results with a 2 blade razor than I do this.</li>
            <li> The pivoting head on the shaver is uncomfortable and inconsistent. The pivoting head nicked me on several occasions. So If that was corrected this would be an awesome product.  I love having the convenience of the groomer on the other end.</li>
            <li> Works well but thought I was buying a FULL body shaver capable of trimming &amp; shaving all areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a groomer for two years and this one is not my favorite. The swivel head works against you instead of for you regardless of wet or dry use. The back end is OK for trimming but still is not full size and the #1,2,3 adjustable part does not lock well and slips halfway through using it giving you an accidental shorter cut, so it is disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually prefer to use the basic body groom from Norelco far more than this one. I only use this for my back because it is a bit longer and I can get to tough to reach areas better. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does it trim hair, yes.  But in order to do that you really have to rub it hard against your skin and I guarantee you there will be red marks everywhere you use it.  It is not gentle by any means and certainly doesn&#x27;t glide over your skin like a normal trimmer.  You often have to go over the same area multiple times as the first pass is not enough.  Additionally, the battery life is abysmal.  They claim 50 minutes.  In one year&#x27;s usage I never got more than ten minutes.  After less than 20 uses I now maybe get 4 minutes max.  And since there is no cord, you are stuck until it is charged again.  I have bought Norelco products for 20 plus years now and this is my first disappointment, and it&#x27;s a big one.</li>
            <li> It works great for Male genital area and is very gentle. I have used others and gotten hurt. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected, just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I just received my razor last night.  I wanted to use it right away but there is a 8 hour charging period.  Today I woke up and shaving was the first thing I did.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this razor.  It&#x27;s very high quality, cuts chest hair, groin hair, thigh hair no problem.  I never had much pubic hair since I also purchased the Personal Shavers Men Package..but I can say this razor does a much better job and gives a much closer shave than the lady fair feminine trimmer.  You can take my word for it or spend the extra money on the Mens package.  The body bare shaver is worth having though.  Combined with this product..my other razors don&#x27;t have to work so hard.</li>
            <li> The groomer works, and works well.  I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times now, and could not be more pleased with the performance.  Fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Typically I am a loyal Norelco user.  I purchased this device to trim body hair in various areas.  The adjustable head is convenient in that you do not have to mess with attachments.  The trimmer itself does an average job at best.  The foil shaver end does work pretty well.  I have attempted to use on chest and stomach---results are not consistent across the areas trimmed, armpits--works very well, man region--works well in non-sensitive area.  I believe there has to be a better product out there.</li>
            <li> Great item. Works fantastic.</li>
            <li> My Phillips body-groomer died a few weeks ago after over 4 years of use.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this one will last as long.</li>
            <li> The razor works well and the trimmer does as well. So well, in fact, that I actually trimmed the hair far shorter than I meant to. I&#x27;m definitely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I lost the charger though somewhere and they sell for about $40-50 used or new (everywhere!!) which seemed excessive considering what I paid for the unit.  Recommend you try reselling the charger online if the thing quits working on you.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Has the ability for trimming and shaving and is great on areas with sensitive skin.  Provides a clean and neat shave without cuts or irritation.  Charge lasts longer then expected and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely out standing. It is easy to use with battery which lasts hours. To recharge it, all what you neef us just one hour.. What i can say but Perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple times now and it seems well built and works good.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use it in the shower so I won&#x27;t be able to comment on that part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female and I purchased this after reading all the reviews of men&#x27;s trimmer versus women&#x27;s trimmers. I was in the hospital for a little over a month so there was no razor that was going me anywhere close to a good shave without pulling and hurting. This. Is. Amazing. Was able to trim my &amp;#34;lady parts&amp;#34; neat and get a very close shave on my legs. Awesome product!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so usefull&lt;br /&gt;And confortable</li>
            <li> This is the second BG2040 I&#x27;ve owned.  It seems to perform its trimming/shaving functions OK (though I&#x27;m amazed the tech hasn&#x27;t advanced much since we shaved with sharpened knives) and is well-shaped; however, the charger is un-necessarily large, fiddly and non-secure, and the battery life is awful by modern standards.  Even though I never re-charged until the red light came on, and did a complete discharge/recharge from time-to-time, after a couple of years, my first unit would require as much as 5-6 hours of charging time to yield maybe 10 minutes of usage.  Having to replace this rather expensive shaver every couple of years makes it an expensive proposition, too.  But, like I said, I just purchased another one, so I guess the benefits still outweigh the down-sides.  Either that, or I&#x27;m too lazy to research the competition.</li>
            <li> It is not working. Worked less than 3 months. Not charging no power. I regret to buy this and no support from anyone .hope Amazon won&#x27;t sell defective products like this</li>
            <li> The trimmer while it holds the charge for the first year is great.. but after repeat use.. the trimmer does not hold the charge and is completely useless.. for the next trimmer I want one that last a long time and can handle all of my monkey fur lol if anyone has any suggestions please let me kn ow</li>
            <li> I have found this BodyGroom Pro to be effective, easy to use and a joy to use. For those of us who like to keep our bodies as well as our faces groomed, I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li> It shaves smoothly and has never once nicked my balls or cock.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my significant other; he loves it!&lt;br /&gt;He was able to trim his beard, shave his chest (for me. Hehe), and cut his hair all in one charge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guide will let you chose from a few different lengths.&lt;br /&gt;It also gives a nice, close shave when wanted.&lt;br /&gt;(You can also take the guide off to quickly shave longer hairs.)&lt;br /&gt;He said it doesn&#x27;t pull on his hair when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is easy to charge, and quick to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent hours researching the perfect all-around shaver that wasn&#x27;t too expensive. I&#x27;m not disappointed with this one!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Norelco to anyone who has some manscaping to do!</li>
            <li> Awesome buy it wouldn&#x27;t think twice. Works even better than the cheaper ones that work well also. Very worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product based on other reviews. unfortunately it didn&#x27;t give a close shave. My legs felt like I shaved them the day before and had hair growth. I would return it but based on what people use it for its just rude.</li>
            <li> No instructions or anything telling how to use the phone!</li>
            <li> this product is a very good body groomer, I use it very often and every time is a pleasure, great results</li>
            <li> All in all, this razor works well.  One complaint would be that it&#x27;s easy to turn it off while using simply because the on/off switch is where you would naturally grip it.  But other than that, it works quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I like to keep myself trim, and for years I&#x27;ve been using my old Remington beard trimmer to also trim my legs so that they don&#x27;t look like a human forest.  That Remington trimmer worked GREAT for years until it reached the end of its life.  So, I did the research, and bought a separate beard trimmer (the Philips Norelco Qt4070), and a separate body groomer which was this one.  I like the fact that it was an all-in-one device...didn&#x27;t have a million attachments.    Big mistake.    Both the Norelco BG2040 body trimmer and the Norelco QT4070 beard trimmer have a serious design flaw: the comb setting doesn&#x27;t lock.  So, if you try using any setting longer than 1 (the shortest), and you apply normal pressure to your skin, the comb will get pushed back to the shortest setting.  Now, I don&#x27;t want to be completely hairless...I just want to keep my fur in check.  So, I use the longer settings (4 or 5) on my lower legs, the medium setting (3) on my armpits and..err..pubic area, and the lower settings (1, 2) on my upper legs.  However, this is a VERY difficult task to do when the damn comb doesn&#x27;t lock.  You have to hold it in place!!      As for the shaver side of it...it&#x27;s okay.  I never fully trust electric shavers anyways.  When I want to mechanically shave something (like the back of my neck), I just remove the comb from the trimmer end, and use that side of it, and then I&#x27;ll go over it again with the shaver side.  The shaver side is only good for areas with very sparse hair.    DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.    I wanna say that this is an overpriced product, but then I&#x27;d be saying that it&#x27;s worth buying at a lower price, which isn&#x27;t true.  This isn&#x27;t worth your money at ANY price.  DO NOT BUY.  I found a refurbished version of my old Remington beard trimmer here on Amazon, and will buy that for both beard and body.  Too bad I wasted so much money on this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after my second Philips Norelco BG2020 broke. I decided to opt for the more expensive option hoping it will do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use the trimming head to shorten my body hair. Although the shaving head is exactly the same as the one on the BG2020 this guys seems to trim a smaller area than its predecessor. Moreover, the trimming head is hard to handle and my wrists start hurting after a while.&lt;br /&gt;I used the shaving head a few times and cut myself with it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this might be a good purchase for someone that mainly uses the shaving head and occasionally the trimming one. If I was you I would consider some of the lower cost options which are much better to handle and do a better job in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be frank. If you&#x27;re a guy, keeping your private areas clean is a must. But, if you are like me, you have no idea on the best way to do it. Let me tell you a way...get this product and read my review. Let&#x27;s get \\&quot;grooming.\\&quot;    Out of the box, you will need to charge the device for about half a day. But after that, you are ready to go. Now, as advertised, you can use this product both in and out of the shower. From my experience, I would advise doing it in the shower for two reasons: 1) You&#x27;re going to want to get in the shower after you use it anyway, and 2) it&#x27;s a lot less messy. So, after jumping in the shower, soap up and clean rinse yourself off. Now, I would HIGHLY recommend using some sort of lather such as a shaving cream for doing the actual grooming. It is much less painful (although to be fair...using this product dry is not painful to begin with). With the shaving cream you will notice much less tug and pull.    Now for the graphic parts, after putting shaving cream where you are going to be working, take the Bodygroomer and just use it like you would a normal razer. My preferred method is to just in a patch of hair and then rise...then repeat. It&#x27;s very effortless. It might take some time to get it the way you want, but the adjustable attachment and pivoting head will have you in and out of the shower in 10 minutes.     Now, for the harder to reach places...between your butt, it will even work there. Same concept, use some shaving cream and get to work, just go slow or you might do something you will regret.    And lastly, for the family jewels. Honestly, it&#x27;s the same idea. Get some shaving cream and with your other hand help flatten out the skin of your jewels and slowly move over it. It will work with no problems. I have been using this for month now and not once have I ever cut myself. Just remember to pay attention while you are using this...concentrate and you will be fine.     Results: after the first day of use, the hair was still smooth andthere was no irritation. You will notice that you will not sweat as much down there and it will feel cleaner and fresher as you move around during the day. I&#x27;m sure you are skeptical that a product actually exists to solve all your \\&quot;private\\&quot; shaving needs, but this product is it. I would highly recommend it. I am several months in and have very, very happy with it.    5/5 stars. Amazing product. Amazing results.</li>
            <li> Works great on the tender parts. Charges quickly, easy to clean. Designed to fit your hand, easy to manage and maneuver.</li>
            <li> Bought this under the impression it actually WAS an all-in-one (including facial razor)...honestly, I still use it on my face and it certainly does a better job than my previous shaver. the blades &amp; heads are not very wide, but cut well if you don&#x27;t mind taking your time a little bit. I am disappointed with the battery life overall, it&#x27;s cute though Norelco followed the induction charging fad with this one. Also suspicious mine was refurbished; did not come with cleaning brush. Other than that, gets the job done, looks cool. I&#x27;d say it really can be used all over and not just on the body.</li>
            <li> Very nice product!  Whether you are shaving for athletic or, um, other reasons, the groomer is heads and tails above foams, liquids or razors.  Easy to clean, sturdy, overall nice.</li>
            <li> Have had it a short time and only a couple of uses but as discussed was great for the nether regions of the body that we&#x27;re all trying to shape up.  Still have to be careful but go for it!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is allergic to regular razors and breaks out when he uses them. These razor and refill heads are perfect and keep him from breaking out. Loves that its a trimmer and shaver.</li>
            <li> not sure why it says to never use on the face, but I listened &amp; never have. Other than that, its awesome. Don&#x27;t want to get into too much detail on this one. Ok, one thing; battery last really long.</li>
            <li> Some months, I really let myself go. Other months, I&#x27;m looking for a mate. By mate, I mean somebody that is consensually willing to be physically intimate with me. I&#x27;m not a very hairy guy, but that jungle can seriously get out of control. With the Philips Norelco BG2040, my manscaping is made easy. Next time, I may even trim an upside down moustache so I can look at my junk and it seems to be like a face. &#x27;Murca.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver. My old Philips Norelco Bodygroomer worked okay but it was not holding its charge for a very long time and one day it just wouldn&#x27;t shut off. I ditched the old one and purchased this model. Primarily I use it for shaving some unwanted chest hair and for trimming down there. It works like charm, especially down there. The shave is much smoother than the old model and it handles very well. It&#x27;s also very east to clean. The only thing I&#x27;m not sure I like about it is the holder. The shaver sits in the holder less securely than the old model. I&#x27;ll have to wait to see, if my cleaning lady knocks it to the floor when she cleans. That&#x27;s my biggest concern.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of the reviews I gave in and got it. Not bad. Wish it would cut better, but I guess you get what you pay for????</li>
            <li> This Shaver is a great buy, shaves all parts of the body except the head great. this is the best shaver Ive found for the body!!!  give it a try, youll love it....</li>
            <li> I purchased this new body groomer to replace the older model before this one.  I received the item a day sooner than expected..given it includes free shipping, which this is why i like to shop on Amazon and no tax ! ;-). I had the older model before this one for a few years now and for some reasons after a full charge, very randomly the older model sometimes works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t....So.. after i got this new body groomer, i tried it and i really like how it feels and shave a lot better then the older model.  The cutting head on this newer model seems to be very sturdy and hold it very tight unlike the older model, it popped out too easily sometimes during shaving.  So far I am very satisfied with product and hope that it will last me for a very long time :-).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for a few years now.  There&#x27;s a lot of cleanup and it takes a long time, so when I saw this, I figured I would try it out to see if it could save me some time.  The truth is, this did save some time.  It probably takes me 25% less time to shave now, including cleanup - and yes, there is still quite a bit of cleanup.  The big problem, however, is that it does an awful job, completely missing hairs and entire patches and not providing nearly as close a shave as I&#x27;m used to.  At some spots the shave is comparable to manual razor, while at other spots it&#x27;s like two day&#x27;s stubble.  If this provided a comparable shave to a razor at the time savings it provides, it would be a great product.  If it provided the shave it provides now, but saved 80% of the shaving time, it would be worth it.  As it stands, this product is not worth using.  Stick to the manual razor.</li>
            <li> I like this product and use it frequently on all but the most very sensitive of areas. I had the Philips Norelco BG2030 Professional Body Grooming System in the past and you could go to town with it using it on and around the whole butcher shop without fear but when it broke I could no longer find that model so I tried this one. Well it can go most places for me but it pinches on the very sensitive areas down under no matter how I try to use it, wet, dry, skin stretched or not. I will only trust a Gillette Pro Guide fusion razor down there for now. Also on the side with the adjustable trimmer, the motor seems to run at half speed.</li>
            <li> Followed all the instructions in regards to not charging the battery until the light indicates it&#x27;s time and waiting until it&#x27;s fully charged.  Then, I get 10 minutes at most of use before it goes dead.  Definately overpriced for the technology.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean. Safely cuts real close to remove unwanted body hair. The other end is adjustable clippers. Works MUCH better on my body than my Braun Synchro, which is made for your face. This is made for everything below the neck. You&#x27;ll LOVE it. Makes body trimming and manscaping a BREEZE. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Quite a few nice features, and well made, with a nice solid feel. However, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t go quite short enough - I would have liked two more settings further down to get that &amp;#34;shaved two/three days ago&amp;#34; look, instead of the &amp;#34;shaved a week ago&amp;#34; that is the best I can get with it. Also the shaver part doesn&#x27;t get quite as smooth a result as a regular electric shaver, and definitely not as good as a wet shave, but I guess the latter is to be expected. So, ok product, not too bad for the price, and I won&#x27;t send it back, but not a five star.</li>
            <li> The one side of this trimmer works well for thinning your sideburns etc. The other side is ok but sort of useless. Both sides of this trimmer are useless at making a clean edge at the bottom of your sideburns. My charger stopped working about 6 months after I bought it. I&#x27;d contact Norelco but not sure if I&#x27;ll bother because it&#x27;s a mediocre product and don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll offer me a refund.</li>
            <li> I just received this product, charged it and used it, and I gotta say.. Wow..! Finally what I was looking for.. It does what is says it does, is a easy to operate product, no additional pieces that you may loose and compromise the usage of the item, does a perfect job, even on \\&quot;that area\\&quot;, and at a great price.. Excellent product, 100% recommended..</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Does everything you want it to do. Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this s*** .</li>
            <li> Very good product, but died after 25 months of use. I&#x27;ll need to get a new one.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect groomer, I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I made the mistake of purchasing some cheaper clippers before finally breaking down and buying this one... wish I would have saved the trouble and frustration and gotten it in the first place! It&#x27;s worth every penny! The adjustable lengths on the clipper end do everything. I take the guard completely off for my chest, stomach, and around down stairs. Using the guard on the 4 or 5 setting is nice for keeping leg and arm hair in check, but doesn&#x27;t shave it enough to be &amp;#34;noticeable&amp;#34; and I use it on 1 for my underarms to avoid nicking myself on the hard angles. Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, you pretty much have to try to get this thing to bite you (if you&#x27;ve had cheaper one you know what clipper biting feels like). I can run it freely with no guard, without worry on my chest and stomach (the ends of the teeth are rounded and don&#x27;t bite easily), but of course when getting down around more sensitive areas it&#x27;s wise to use a little more caution and pull the skin tight a bit just in case. Now, I don&#x27;t shave the boys with the clipper end, the foil end is much safer and does a good job. The foil end also does a great job of cleaning up areas after the clippers where you want a really close shave. Save yourself the trouble and just get this one, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This thing gives me rashes like no other. Ive clipped my sack a few sacks, the first time was bad and very painful. Be VERY slow with this thing. I dont get how people give this thing 5 stars. Its ok, I do like it for the groin area but i have to be slow with it. Any sensitive area like obliques or your ass, be ready for some rashes. not that impressed with this thing</li>
            <li> Product was defective, wouldn&#x27;t charge</li>
            <li> Like the title says, it delivers results as advertised. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Great sleek design and very portable. The waterproof feature is od great help for cleaning which was my problem with my previous model.</li>
            <li> Decent design.  Horrible, horrible, horrible battery life.  I followed the instructions and it begins blinking low battery as soon as you take it off the charger.  I feel like Norelco stole $60 bucks from me.</li>
            <li> really easy to use and does its job. people who have issues with it most likely rush or are a bit too rough on it. any sensitive part should be taken care of gently no matter how smooth the product is cause its not cut proof!</li>
            <li> She uses it for the same reason I did; to trim the lower region and this one will not pinch or cut and shaves smoothly.</li>
            <li> EDIT- Customer Support provided me a brand new shaver and for that I will have to give this product 5 stars. The thing still works!  I was happy about mine until it broke after a year and 7 months. Kind of a short life span, however. I&#x27;ll be very happy if customer support send me another.</li>
            <li> Really works great.  I am a fan.  The trimmer-guard thingy cuts hair a little longer than the Whal I used to have but you just need to adjust it down one click.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second body shaver and it&#x27;s a huge step up from it. I use it to shave from the neck down and haven&#x27;t cut myself not once. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great shaver for manscaping, however, after about a year, the battery quit holding its charge. Now I can&#x27;t get 5 minutes without the battery dying.</li>
            <li> works great and gives a very very close shave. Doesn&#x27;t pinch at all while shaving so that&#x27;s a huge plus</li>
            <li> After one use, I would say, it was good product, but still chest area for men difficult to remove hair. I spent more than 4 times to remove it properly so it might be different situation from man to man!</li>
            <li> I like this for the trimming part.  The adjustable guide slide a bit too easily.  I set it to my desired length and after a few passes I bumped it against my body as I started the next pass and the guide moved easily to the shortest setting creating a uneven cut.  Lesson learned....be very very deliberate and go slow to avoid that mishap.  For areas that I wanted to be smooth, this left a lot of stubble.  I was able to successfully use my regular electric razor to get the smoothness I was expecting.  So ... end result is 50/50 verdict.</li>
            <li> very practical and easy to use.  I recommend to use baby Johnson prior to shaving your private parts.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as advertised. I bought one and returned it. I&#x27;ll stick with my Norelco XL razor. Keep looking for that &amp;#34;Perfect Razor&amp;#34; I am.</li>
            <li> nice razor&lt;br /&gt;love it&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sweetie who is pretty hairy.  Was concerned about ingrown hairs from shaving, especially in more &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas.  The body groom pro makes it easy, no ingrown hairs, no cuts or skin irritation and I love the new man-scaped version and he is reaping the benefits!</li>
            <li> Superb cut, slick design, battery long enough for cutting full head&lt;br /&gt;chrome looked not so good after long period of using</li>
            <li> I love this product, I am not sure I could go back to shaving my body without it. It works great for trimming my beard as well, I really could not ask for more from a product. I have been using it for a couple of months now with zero issues. Every man should own this product, whether you just want to trim you facial hair, or shave it completely, this product will not let you down.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but I decided to spend a little more than I am comfortable and it has paid off. It&#x27;s very well made and intuitively designed. I&#x27;ve never gotten such a close cut before.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough bout this shaver, wish I would of had this all my life, simple and effective at removing body hair</li>
            <li> It has a modern a suitable design.&lt;br /&gt;I have a sensitive skin but with this machine i dont suffer the use,</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and cuts hair quickly but not the one I am looking for as It needs concentration when shaving private areas and may cause cuts and irritations if you do not stretch your skin, I am still looking for a gentle machine for such sensitive parts, starching sometime is impossible in some areas.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works as described. Go ahead and make the purchase.</li>
            <li> I had a another body groomer but this one is much better.  The charge holds a long time and shaves as close as you want it to shave.</li>
            <li> This unit worked moderately well.  It was in perfect condition and the battery, which can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;be replaced gave out.  I threw away a perfectly good unit.  Great hair removal,  lousy&lt;br /&gt;life span of equipment.</li>
            <li> I got this product mainly for manscaping down there. In the past I used a beard trimmer and it was always a tense and scary process. I decided to try this product out and WOW this leaves you silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a word of caution. On our maiden voyage together I got a little too conformable with this groomer and suffer from a minor cut. This wasn&#x27;t the fault of the groomer but a fault of my own. While this gets a very close and easy shave you still need to take your time. I got careless and sped things up resulting in a war wound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful and cautious at all times and this product will do wonders for you down there.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor that is comfortable to use, but it will &#x27;pull&#x27; hairs in sensitive areas. I have actually cut my leg along the bikini line while jsut doing general maintenance.</li>
            <li> I bought this to groom and trim body hair. After reading many reviews on Amazon (mostly positive) I decided to pull the trigger and test this out. The shaver/trimmer end works very well and - with removing the plastic guard I am able to get a nice close-ish shave of any part of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the shaving foil end for a super close shave is too uncomfortable and irritable for my liking. Given time I could probably get used to it, but in all likelihood I will just use the trimmer end without the plastic guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver arrived well packaged and the battery life seems to last a long time. I&#x27;ve used this several times (perhaps a total of 15 minutes) and have not had to charge it. The supplied plastic stand feels somewhat cheap and isn&#x27;t very stable.</li>
            <li> Initially, my husband and I liked this trimmer.  It didn&#x27;t cut us no matter how rough we were with it.. at first.  I could trim and even shave as close as I wanted.  We use it for our more intimate areas.  But the hair growth after completely shaving was not fun.  Never is.    Anyway, after using it about 6 times between the both of us, I started noticing just how awkward the shape of the thing was... it is oddly curved and very large for trimming the intimate areas.  Not what we were used to but our previous trimmer couldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore and was drawing blood.    SIGH. We couldn&#x27;t return it at this point so we just stuck with it.    We both like to sit on the toilet and trim so that the hairs are less of a cleanup issue.  But for the last THREE times I&#x27;ve done this, the shaver/trimming head falls off and PLOOP right into the toilet!  It&#x27;s the awkwardness of having to hold it at odd angles to get it to go where you want it to that makes it easy to bump it the wrong way.. and it doesn&#x27;t take much of a bump to get that piece to pop out either.  &gt;:/  Not happy at all.  It also CUT ME this last time just before it fell into the toilet again.    I wish I could return it for a full refund.    I can see how this would be great for larger areas of hair.. but that&#x27;s not what we need it for.  And if I could tape or glue the stupid head to it but be able to clean it well to keep it from falling off all the time, I WOULD.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant when I bought this--I was looking at a few different options.  This works great--just as advertised.  It is painless and accomplishes the job.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it for men looking for this type of product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical about this product you shouldn&#x27;t be.  I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve never used a better shaver.  My navel, chest, pits, shoulders, back, and \\&quot;down south\\&quot; were all shaved in no time and looking great.  I lost 24 pounds and was excited to try this shaver.  You need to be patient with this product if you&#x27;re not used to shaving those areas.  I will buy this product again down the road when/if it ever wears out.  Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Previously I used a razor to shave my pubic area, but I was fed up with how long it took and the nicks. This razor took care of that problem; you can get a quick shave and I had virtually no irritation afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest and most important flaw is this shaver doesn&#x27;t get a very close shave. I never expected it to get as close as a regular razor, but I had hoped that it would get close enough for me which it didnt. Another thing is that this shaver or most electric shavers in general are a lot more difficult to shave in between crevices or curvy areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you just wanted a quickly done shave without needing a really close shave, I would recommend this. But if you&#x27;re looking for a really close and silky smooth shave, this isnt the product for you.</li>
            <li> Too bad the battery stinks on this thing. I get maybe one or two trims out of it and the darn orange light starts flashing to recharge it. I took the head off of it and stuck it on the old model I still have. The battery on that thing works like a champ. This model 2040 is a bit awkward to use because of it&#x27;s size. it&#x27;s much harder to shave the boys using this as compared to the original model. I still use the trimmer end to trim my goatee to length but the battery...sheesh. it&#x27;s takes like 8 hours to charge and I get maybe 15 mins of use out of it. This started to happen within about a month after receiving it. Clearly they are buying inferior batteries or it&#x27;s a lousy charging circuit. My bet is a bum battery.</li>
            <li> Just like all the reviews, it works great even in the &#x27;groin&#x27; area. I only nicked myself twice in this area and it was because I was going fast and rushing through. Go slow, keep your skin tight, and you&#x27;ll be good.</li>
            <li> Works good and worth a buy.. I just got it for ma friends who needs to have a clean one everywhere!</li>
            <li> Bought this a few months ago and it works well. Maybe not the best ever, but definitely good for the price</li>
            <li> I have been really impressed with this product. It is low hassle and works great. The battery lasts forever without a recharge and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The end for cutting longer hair really works well, however the other end does not cut short hairs very well. You have to go over the same area several times and even then it misses stuff. My old and cheaper Norelco bodygroomer did just a good of a job if not even better.  Quality is good, it feels very solid and comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this body groomer pro to anyone who has had the cuts and awkwardness experience of shaving south of your belt line. right out of the box i gave it a try and it was effortless and most importantly painless to shave down there. also it was easy to clean and comes with other accessories for full grooming from head to toe. this is the last shaver groomer you will ever need. i would give it 10 stars if i could</li>
            <li> This is working perfectly.  The trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut my skin.  And the stand is relatively easy to use.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> This shaver is terrific. You can use the bottom to shave down longer hair and use the top to finish it off. Shaves very clean, almost to the skin. Tested on legs and arms so far. Got really smooth. This is going to save me tons of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger, on the other hand, is an abomination. You cannot plug it directly in; you have to use the charging cradle. First of all, the plug comes out easily, so if you pick up the cradle the plug may fall out. Also, the cradle has no weight. It is just thin plastic, so it cannot sit there and hold the shaver. You have to hold the cradle while you put the shaver in it. And since it has no weight, you cannot just drop the shaver in it, you have to hold it. And then you have to position the shaver just right or the whole thing will fall over. And the plug will fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not sufficiently detract from the usefulness of this device. It is an excellent shaver and trimmer in one. It has clippers on both sides of the foil, so you can pretty much come from any direction and get results. Although it isn&#x27;t made for it, if you are careful it can be used on your face. But seriously, be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a 5-star shaver and trimmer with a -1 star charger. So 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut or bruise my private parts, so it passed the test. I recommend it  for those who like to stay sharp and clean!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple tools to help in this area, and this is the best.  Just go slow on the family jewels, otherwise, welcome to a more hairless world. That&#x27;s just better for everyone.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold charge - had to return. Not worth the $$$</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the result that i had very smooth on my body &amp; remarkably great in my groins area and my other sensitive places , I&#x27;ve never used bodygroom before until i got this product.. Bottom line I highly recommend it..worth every penny</li>
            <li> Awesome best one yet!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works! I have had friends tell me that they shaved their nuts- and that their girlfriends REALLY liked this- but I never thought in a million years that I would attempt this stunt! Seriously, just using the side trimmers by the blade (and not the actual shaver) does a SUPER job! I&#x27;m talking baby smooth! Pretty soon, after you go slowly the first few times, you&#x27;ll get more confident and get an even closer shave! After doing my nuts, I did my chest, armpits, and then inner thighs! I notice I feel much fresher and cleaner and can dry off from a shower quicker too! Please, don&#x27;t hesitate! This is what you&#x27;ve been looking for! I got amazing results using it dry, by the way! I will use this until it dies and then buy another one for sure! Also, the battery charge has lasted for a relly long time! Honestly, this is one of the BEST products I have ever bought in my life. Thanks Norelco!</li>
            <li> This thing is so easy to use. I don&#x27;t have very much body hair, but this thing works great on my chest and leg hair. When I shaved my balls there were a couple hang ups but nothing serious, ill no what not to do next time I shave.</li>
            <li> No nicks!  Can use wet or dry.  Easy to clean.  Only drawback is that it is not meant for shaving facial hair.  I still use it to shave my facial hair, but it is a bit awkward.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. Great for all areas including the groin. The clipper side trims longer hair to precision lengths (5 settings) down to 3mm and the foil shaver side will give a close shave to any part of the body. Absolutely no problems with nicks.  The foil head can get into small areas.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this unit. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. The height adjustable trimmer is a much better solution than the different level blade guards the older model has. This is much more comfortable to use and does a better job.</li>
            <li> I use this for ALL of my personal shaving needs.  It is easy the best razer that I have ever owned. It shaves close and holds a charge for a long time. Love it!</li>
            <li> Recommend Baguetnaúha ..Ore excellent presence and work better Mmatoukat the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Cut Sizes liked very much.Suitable for thinning hair from around the body</li>
            <li> Outstanding!!!  Very impressed with the close shave on my face.  The body hair trimmer is great too.  Use it in the shower or out of the shower flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Every few years we buy a new one bc the battery poops out, but we always get this brand because of the quality performance and that it&#x27;s great in wet and dry environments. It&#x27;s the only kind my fiance will use. Additionally, has a great sleek metalic look now. Arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Seller: 5 Stars Product Quality: 3 Stars  This is the second I bought. I purchased the first one in a Walmart if I recall, and after one year of use the battery failed, like it didn&#x27;t charge at times and it turned on by itself suddenly (creepy), so I threw it away. I purchased another one in Amazon and is great but when using it suddenly stops, and I press the button again and runs for 3 seconds and stops again &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Great product! Smooth shave and comfortable</li>
            <li> One of the best machines shaving body</li>
            <li> Works really well and gets the hair. I like the fact that it works in the shower and won&#x27;t electrocute me.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order the &amp;#34;body groom&amp;#34; because it was not real clear on the result re: &amp;#34;when using on &amp; around private parts&amp;#34; but it swayed toward satisfaction.  As a result, I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of cleaning up the more sensitive areas we bought it for. The pivoting head helps a lot!!</li>
            <li> This product performs very well. This is the second version of this model I have owned. The only problems are: 1) it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long; and 2) the plastic comb piece that attaches to head tends to break easily.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have owned after the first one stopped charging. Contacted manufacturer, they replaced no charge!!!&lt;br /&gt;Nice variation of trimming lengths and very smooth cutting blades.&lt;br /&gt;Long handle really helps get those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> It works great if your patient and practice. I perfected the art of grooming myself on my third groom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only bad thing, is you must wait 10 hours to charge before you use it the first time</li>
            <li> After trying 3 different electric shavers and 2 other body grooming gadgets, I finally bought the BodyGroom Pro.  This product does it all, and does it all well.  From head to toe you can shave, cut, trim and style it all.  It really does charge in 50 minutes, which is one of my favorite things.  The replacement heads don&#x27;t cost a fortune (less than $15).  It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use.  The pivot head is just enough flex to get the curves of my chin and face and the trimmer on the other end is great for a stubble week.  I haven&#x27;t used any of my other electric razors, trimmers, etc since this one arrived.  Also, I did buy the warranty buy haven&#x27;t needed it.  This one has been going strong for almost a year with no issues and no signs of slowing down.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews I decided to buy the product for myself.  I have owned the groomer for a little over 3 months now, and have used it every few days to keep up with hair growth.  As many other reviews have said it does what it says it does.  The product is safe to use on sensitive area such as the groin and testicle region.&lt;br /&gt;I would however caution that it does sometimes cut if not using the product properly or hitting a difficult spot/angle.  After using it a while you will know where the problem spots are and take a little more time in certain area than others.  Otherwise I am very pleased with the product and would recommend it to friends as well as buy again if I had to for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> It works, it&#x27;s one of the better devices for trimming my beard. I also like the styling of it and the battery last for a good while.</li>
            <li> As one who is an avid shaver of unmentionable parts I was in the market for a dedicated trimmer (I&#x27;ve been using a set of $20 clippers that I use to shave my head). I will say that this product does do what many have described. it will give you a smooth shave down there, but it does have it&#x27;s flaws. I found myself using the two side mini-clippers most of the time shaving as close as possible with those, then trying to get a smooth finish with the middle shaver. What I found was it does get a smooth skin finish, but it comes with all the downfalls of using a straight edge razor (ie: ingrown hairs). It seems that nothing for me these days can give me a perfectly smooth finish without irritation. I will say though that the mini-clippers gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had, but it also took me more than 2x as long to shave (when compared with using normal hair clippers). After only 1 use, I went back to using my normal hair clippers as the irritation coupled with the 2x time trimming wasn&#x27;t worth it to get such a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I will also note that I have used this as a facial shaver &amp; it works great, but takes a while to shave compared to conventional gel &amp; razor shaving. But I guess that&#x27;s another story/argument.</li>
            <li> This Product is practical, battery lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s also water resistant, which make it even Better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also recommended it to two of my friends who bought it and like it</li>
            <li> I was tempted by the pivoting head on the BG-2040 and paid the $70.00 price instead of the $45.00 price for the non-pivoting BG-2038.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good razer, holds a charge, works well in the shower and does a great job with my manscaping but I really don&#x27;t need the pivoting head to get the job done so that was an additional $25.00 that I wasted and I wish I would have bought the BG-2038 instead.</li>
            <li> This is the first full body groomer that I have used worry-free!  No worries about cuts, scrapes, or nicks, especially in the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas!</li>
            <li> I specifically asked Amazon to show me Mustache trimmers.  They showed me this, among others.  I chose it because it was supposedly good for the whole body. It says so right up there in the instructions.  And the whole body means the mustache, right? Wrong!  The instructions specifically warn the customer not to use the shaver above the neck.  So back to Amazon the machine goes.  Amazon, this is about the third time you have sold me something that is exactly the opposite of what I asked for in the search parameters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality I have no idea how well this thing works because I didn&#x27;t use it, even once.  So if you are looking for a body shaver, this may be a great deal.  But be warned if you are looking for a mustache trimmer. This is not that.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased as a gift. The reviews were decent. But......cuts and pulls hair down south. Not cheap so expected a better shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Product came on time and as advertised. Great product and the purchase was hassle free!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to adjust the cutting height to the desired lenght. Still need to shave for stubble free comfort.</li>
            <li> Okay so far. If you&#x27;re hairy, buzz cut that junk first and use this as a detailer.....But who wants to?</li>
            <li> Decent trimmer, but battery failed within 6 months.  Unable to hold a charge for more than two trims.  Phillips continues to devalue every company it aquires.</li>
            <li> Good tool for grooming.  Fairly powerful and has great battery life.  Waterproof so it can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> Really exellent product.it is used for both shave and trimming.while shave time skin is not burning, very smooth. Over all it is very good.</li>
            <li> I used an electric razor to shave my face when I was a teenager; back then all electrics were dry-shave only.  If you tried to shave in the shower, you&#x27;d ruin your razor or worse.  So, naturally, the first thing I did with this razor was try to shave dry skin.  BIG mistake.  I got nicked up pretty badly, and was still left with stubble for all my efforts.  On dry skin, the foil sticks to your skin, tilting the head and causing the side cutters dig in, nicking the skin. I think one of the cheaper models without the floating head would work better for this, since you could keep the foil level even on dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed and was about to toss the thing, but I decided to try it wet.  I know shaving my face with a blade works better if the hairs have softened, so I took a long, hot bath and lathered myself up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With proper lubrication, the razor does a pretty decent job, comparable to a Gillette Trac-II blade razor (which costs under $1).  I can get an even smoother shave if I spend a great deal of time (10-15 minutes), but this really isn&#x27;t practical for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While trying to shave my &amp;#34;coin purse&amp;#34;, it feels like I&#x27;m getting nicked up, but there&#x27;s no blood or any visible injury.  I think it&#x27;s just grabbing and yanking the hairs, creating a sharp pinching sensation.  I find myself shaving everything else with the BodyGroom and using the Gillette for that one area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also too large and unwieldy to use between the cheeks, another area where the simple razor blade wins again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation would be to skip this particular model.  If you&#x27;re confident and competent with a blade, go that route, it&#x27;s cheaper and faster.  If rubbing something sharp across your family jewels makes you cross your legs in terror, buy one of the less expensive models like the BG2038 or BG2028.  They all use the same foil unit and the fixed head might actually be easier to use, particularly dry.</li>
            <li> I am giving it a 4 star for a couple of reasons. My previous Phillips manscaper (I have had it for 6 yrs now) was much more maneuverable. I use this up and down stairs, it does a fine job, but takes much more time as you must move at a much slower pace in order to elude pinching. the trimmer on the revers side works well, but the head on it is very narrow so it takes more time than my last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros- it is good in the shower and so far I have not experienced the charging and holding charge issues.&lt;br /&gt;The cons- user must use slower strides and careful on the angle using the fine clippers on either end of the main (top) head of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Most of you are probably thinking of one specific area that you would rather not injure while trimming/shaving. This does it well, BUY IT.</li>
            <li> Good product. But I prefer the previous model for better results! An elegant finishing, a little bit heavy, good price.</li>
            <li> Given it a few whirls now. Does alright for trimming, but for actual shaving, my 5 year old electric shaver does a much better job with less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only exception was it did the arm pits very well, not sure why it had a problem with my chest hair. Keeping it for the adjustable length trimmer, but the shaver was not up to snuff.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Shaves as close as a razor, without causing razor bumps. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for the trimmer, which works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> i like everything like battery,style etc etc&lt;br /&gt;but when we shave its kinda makes our face rough, and it may cause rash because of that.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that recommended.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great to use in the shower as its water proof. Its relatively light as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;There is a bit of tugging when using the groomer end.</li>
            <li> The 7100 is a striking improvement over the older model. This one I can use the shaver without feeling trepidation. The battery is also superior.</li>
            <li> It definitely body grooms</li>
            <li> Smooth trim. No irritation at all. Contours to any part of the body, even the most sensitive areas. Very gentle and light pressure required. looks like a fresh waxing or shave without the razor bumps.. Love this product. I will suggest that if there is ever a pulling or pinch on the skin then do not hesitate to replace the foil head immediately.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for the face and down south. Still using it weekly for two years. Doesn&#x27;t need to recharge that often.</li>
            <li> First it&#x27;ll pick your hair a bit. But after some usage, you will get more comfortable and the hairs will not pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE IT ON FACE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for arm pits, chest, Abs, Legs, or Groin area. I shave almost every thing in my body, Just don&#x27;t apply pressure in more sensitive areas, take your time and it&#x27;ll do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part is its not to loud and is usable in shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery could last longer but I only use it for 15mins in shower depending how much I have to shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be direct here and tell you I use this to groom my male areas. It&#x27;s the only shaver that works down there with minimal nicks. Yup if you aren&#x27;t carful you will nick yourself. That being said it&#x27;s the most groin friendly shaver I have ever used. If you don&#x27;t rush the job it works great, just go slow and steady. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is the best body shaver I have ever bought in my life. It is really amazing , you can shave any part of your body with no pain even the balls. No pain no irritation no itching .</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t in good conscious recommend this product to anybody. The battery in the unit I had died, and wouldn&#x27;t take a charge after less than a years use. Norelco recommends replacing the shaver foil every 6 months which is a really bad joke as the foil in the one I had only lasted a few weeks before the blades wore completely through it, and the replacement foils aren&#x27;t any better... Low end junk. For the money I expected much better quality. I&#x27;ve gotten better use out of a Conair groomer than I did out of this thing, and for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Much higher quality than the cheapo 20-25 dollar units you see in retail stores. I wont get into the details but it works the best of any trimmer ive tried.</li>
            <li> To clear any doubts, this is solely a bodygroomer and as such is a great piece of kit. You can use it in your face but the results are not great. The shaver end is quite powerful, beware when cutting longer hairs.</li>
            <li> When I first looked at all the negative reviews that this product has I was a little set off for a moment or two. After reading on with most of the reviews I realized that most people had a faulty product that just needed to be exchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then continued to all the positive reviews given to this product and I instantly wanted to buy it. YES, this product was purchased mainly for the bush down south.... I have also been using it to shave regularly. I am unsure as to why so many people said it was a bad shaver because this shaver is actually pretty awesome. The fact that you need to replace the blade every so often is fine.... That part really does not bother me at the slightest, any shaver you buy you need to replace the blades on it after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the kind of guy who shaves and always gets that irritation after and it sucks, however with this shaver I have not gotten any irritation and I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY NICE PURCHASE I EXPECT TO BUY THIS BRAND MORE OFTEN</li>
            <li> It is a good product for your whole body but still doesn&#x27;t work as well on the groin area.  Slightly glorified.  It is ok there but I don&#x27;t want anybody to think it has revolutionized cleaning up that area.</li>
            <li> Probably the poorest product I&#x27;ve ever used. The shaver pulled a few whiskers out but didn&#x27;t cut anything. The trimmer didn&#x27;t cut at all. I threw the thing in the trash! My happiest moment was knowing I would never have to see this thing again.</li>
            <li> I got it because of all the great reviews this shaver had. It says that its not made for the face and not to use it above the neck line......well.....I use it to shave my face every morning and....ITS AMAZING!!! Better than a razor. The trimmer and razor both work great. Haven&#x27;t had a problem yet. Keeps good charge...I only have to charge it like once every other week.</li>
            <li> I am a teenager, and I know there are some of you out there who want to shave your goods. Being hit hard with the bush from puberty I decided it was time. After researching on price and ratings and reading all the reviews on this product I decided I would try it. I was very excited when my package arrived. No one was home so I threw it on the charger for the hour that was required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the fun part. I read the instructions (being my first time shaving), and started with my stomach. I soon found it was working wonders. I then moved down to the goods and trimmed them down before shaving them. I found it was working quickly and efficiently. They say you&#x27;re supposed to stretch your skin straight but the pivoting head makes it so you don&#x27;t really have to focus on getting everything straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished trimming and turned on the shaver. I decided I would just go for it (slowly of course). First stroke, no hairs pulled, just shaved. Second stroke, no hairs tugged, just shaved. I realized what I had in my hands and was aggressively getting rid of all the unwanted underbrush. No nicks, no cuts, no irritation. My goods are looking great and I feel great. This thing is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, for 50 dollars you can&#x27;t get anything better. You&#x27;ve found the right product so buy it and get those smooth goods you want!</li>
            <li> It works everywhere and by everywhere I mean everywhere. Worth the $50 just buy it you will not regret it</li>
            <li> I have used many razors below the waist and this one is by far THE WORST! I used it once and was very careful yet it still cut my 2 veg. I tried it multiply times a few weeks apart with the same results. This thing will leave you either screaming or too scared to use it on your privates again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to purchasing this product, I had the original bodygroom and it worked great on the jewels. It lasted about 3 years until the battery died. I will be buying that one again and throwing this one in the garbage!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any man looking for a body trimmer. Holds a long charge and even works in the shower.</li>
            <li> Happy with the no cord gets in the way. Perfect for tiding up in your&lt;br /&gt;private areas.  The charge lasts long time before it needs to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detroit Michigan</li>
            <li> I have to hand it over to the manufacturers.. this thing is a beauty! Yes, reading the reviews I sought a shaver that I could put to the test &#x27;manscaping&#x27; the groin area.. and my test went A-OK! No real issues after the first use, and following the instructions made things pretty straightforward!&lt;br /&gt;The blades on the shaver especially are oh-so safe, and although it does take a pass or two at the right angle, the damn thing does its job really, really well. Safe on the &#x27;nads and everything! I&#x27;d say, bite the bullet and make the purchase!</li>
            <li> greatest body shaver ever. I use this product to shave my chest and upper body. It works great. No complaints at all so far</li>
            <li> This thing is just AWESOME. Getting rid of body hair is easy on the skin and the result is superb. No irritation, no red spots. 10 stars!</li>
            <li> This product looks very good and the razor shown at the bottom of the photograph works ok... but this product isn&#x27;t really something I&#x27;d recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price. Fairly inexpensive in the range.&lt;br /&gt;Design. If this product worked very well, I would really appreciate its design and ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving quality. The top of the unit doesn&#x27;t pick up hair very well and doesn&#x27;t provide anything remotely resembling a close shave. I simply could never imagine using it reliably.&lt;br /&gt;Can leave nicks. I&#x27;d expect a shaver that wasn&#x27;t capable of providing a close shave to be relatively safe for avoiding cutting. Unfortunately this isn&#x27;t really the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d stick to a manual razor or use something a bit higher up on the quality totem pole than this.</li>
            <li> After reading many different reviews about many different groomers I was hopeful that this one would work out. When I opened the box I was immediately pleased with the product. It was simple and felt like good quality. I used it straight out of the box and it worked great. I would defiantly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just works, unexpectedly well in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note; when you remove the foil for cleaning, read the directions on how to handle it.  If you handle it the wrong way, it works just as well, but makes four times as much noise when you put it back together.  Or I just mangled it.  That said, it still works, so works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: made it 3+ years, and then the batteries (not replaceable) started to go.  Swapped the new shaving foil ($12?) every year.  Replacing the old one with a new one; having the shaver + trimmer all in one was pretty nice, and it did a good job.</li>
            <li> It is a very good grooming product, but I did not find that upgrading from the lower priced model was a significant increase in quality.  Stick with the lower price model.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Wokrs everywhere. If you are considering it just go for it. Its a very good everyday tool.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to deal with below the waistline grooming. All the electric shavers I&#x27;ve tried before nicked skin and pulled hairs. I really wanted to find one that worked well. After reading all the positive reviews I decided to go for this one. It was no different. I had to be VERY careful with it or it would bite me, and found I had to keep going over places again and again and again before they were clean. I accidentally left it in the charger too long once and it killed the battery DEAD. Well despite the answer to a question above the battery on my 2040 is NOT replaceable, and once it&#x27;s dead, there is no bringing it back to life. I looked at the instructions about how to replace the battery and there&#x27;s a little picture of a hand clipping the battery wire with scissors in order to dispose of it properly. The instructions say to recycle the battery responsibly and discard the shaver! Back to shaving with a blade and scissors….</li>
            <li> Great dual purpose product.  Really does the job.</li>
            <li> The best and safest one I can find for body grooming.  The clipper end is very sharp and I use it without any attachment to cut what hair I have left off of my balding head.  The only problem is the batteries are not quite as good as they should be but last a good while.  I have not found a better option.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver known to &amp;#34;MANkind&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t think twice if you need to manscape. It does a killer job with no pain or cuts. Git&#x27;er done...</li>
            <li> Let me the first to say that I don&#x27;t understand the few bad reviews for this product.  I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the trimmer for many man-scaping expeditions and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has provided many days of baby  butt smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the issues with the batteries,  I have had none.  I haven&#x27;t charged the unit besides the initial charge and have used it once a week for 2 months without issues.  I suspect the other users were putting it back on charger every night contrary to the instructions.</li>
            <li> not all that good for sensitive skin. but its great ,</li>
            <li> Best below the neck shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Be a man and get a Gillette Venus for Women. This electric razor will do far more damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a no thrills electric razor that isn&#x27;t good enough for your face, nor does it give a close shave anywhere else on your body. It does nip sensitive areas. It might be ok for trimming beards, but a proper trimmer will do better. Bottom line, this does many things, non of them well.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. It does the job and I am really satisfied with it. Both sides are useful and necessary ;)</li>
            <li> MUCH better than the similar product made by Norelco.  This thing works great and I love the dual ends.  It truly is a body groomer.  Between the different clipper settings and the razor side it&#x27;s got a solution for everything.  And it&#x27;s waterproof and cleans easily.  Fantastic purchase.</li>
            <li> The upper part seems to get stuck a little when shaving, the trimmer works excellent though. It doesnt solve both ends of the product correctly.</li>
            <li> The greatest electric razor I have ever used, I bought this specifically for removing hair from the beanbag and it delivered. Every product before this would cut me and leave me with a mess to deal with.  I ran this razor in every direction and manor and not once did I get cut.  It&#x27;s as smooth as a babies bottom now which the little lady very much enjoyed.  I know it&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s simply amazing don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this</li>
            <li> You have to be careful as it will cut you.  I have opted for full body waxes instead.</li>
            <li> awesome for body hair</li>
            <li> This is great... My husband has been looking for something I could hold, with out any effort.  It works great for both of us.  Great product would buy it in a N Y min.</li>
            <li> Best body groomer I have used. That includes shave cream and blades, 2 other brands of electric-Mangroomer and Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Having sensitive skin this product is much smoother causing almost no skin irritation. Not good for backs unless you have someone who is willing to do it for you.</li>
            <li> I like this body trimmer. It works well. It work in water and I like that I don&#x27;t have to remove heads to use its variations features.</li>
            <li> This thing is as good as everyone else says it is, but the dial to adjust the trimmer length feels extremely cheap. After using it just once, the springs under the switch (and the plastic on top) fell off. Luckily, the bottom half is all you need to adjust the trimmer length, but I have to say that this is surprisingly poor quality when the rest of the trimmer feels solid.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised</li>
            <li> it lasted me a little over a year, but it started plucking hairs a little over 7 months.&lt;br /&gt;the battery started crapping out on me after about 4 months, and it lasted a little over 10 minutes before it needed a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;find something else</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with a little background. I&#x27;ve gone through a couple different shavers and trimmers, from: Norelco, Braun, Wahl, Gillette, and Panasonic. I&#x27;ve had favorites and also some that I&#x27;d definitely steer away from. In a nutshell, I highly recommend this BodyGroom Pro. I am able to safely and efficiently trim down the hair, and then subsequently shave it off with the other end. I did get experience a little nick, but that was my own fault. Overall, I&#x27;ve been thoroughly impressed with the quality!&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More detail:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me make a point: I am blessed with the &amp;#34;lots of hair, all-over, grows back way too fast&amp;#34; situation -- something I&#x27;m not bragging about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my schedule, trimming the &amp;#34;bod&amp;#34; requires two nights. I&#x27;ll start with the shortest setting on the blade guard, working my way down. I&#x27;ll start shaving &amp;#34;with the grain&amp;#34; (in the direction of the hair), and then also against the grain (opposite direction). Afterwards, I&#x27;ll remove the blade guard and shave over, against the grain, the areas to get the finest trim possible. Once satisfied, I can switch over to the shave-end and take care of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This method works incredibly well and so far I&#x27;ve been really happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With respect to trimming/shaving the &amp;#34;jewels,&amp;#34; technique is the most important. You definitely need to trim with the blade guard first. It&#x27;s vital to stretch out the area you are shaving, as that will result in the most effective trim. Same technique with the shave-end!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When trimming/shaving, be confident. Slow and controlled movements are the way to go. Also, you&#x27;ll be able to feel if something &#x27;bad&#x27; is going to happen (like a nick or pull), so you can stop and adjust accordingly when that feeling happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy this trimmer/shaver, it&#x27;s a great investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Does not nick or cut when used properly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not work very well on the face&lt;br /&gt;Charging cradle is flimsy, only charges by the cradle there is no plug in the actual unit.</li>
            <li> He likes it, uses it alot.</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job and is convienent. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is the fact that the foil on the actual head broke within the 3-4th use and I had to order a replacement already. I am still trying to see if my hair will get accustomed to using this as opposed to a razor. Hoping it does just like shaving your face with an electric razor takes time to adapt as well.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job with no pulls or nicks.</li>
            <li> Norelco makes a great product.  I use this to buzz my head, groom my chest, and all the way down below.  Easy to use and will take your hair all the way off if you want.  I was nervous at first to use this on my man-hood, but after a couple times the nervousness has subsided.</li>
            <li> Very Very Nice product. I like it. I will buy them again. Very comfortable. Very good shaver to shaver the full body</li>
            <li> I had the personal groomer before, which was simple and good. This one doesn&#x27;t have a clue as to what it is.  The angles are totally wrong for the trimmer and then the adjustable trimmer does not go to usable levels for a beard trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate this purchase.  Getting rid of it and looking for something that will work properly for trimming to a shadow or trimming my beard growth to 3-4 days length.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  Easy to clean and use.  High quality groomer with a lot of options for use.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Best body groomer I&#x27;ve ever bought. Cut is much closer and no pain at all. I was hesitant at first to shave super close to my...more personal areas, but I had no issues at all.</li>
            <li> Nicely updated version. Good product.</li>
            <li> It does not shave the face, the clippers are the only thing good on this product</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, just don&#x27;t use it on your balls. Just shave &#x27;em with an old fashioned razor like everyone else does, it&#x27;s easier. Four stars just because the trimmer is a little too weak compared to the shaver, still works though.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo24A348V67QG9F]]Even new this thing had issues with power fluctuations(Shown in blurry Video Review on a fully charged hardly used shaver).  One second it&#x27;s okay, the next it has less power and bogging down, resulting in pulling your hair instead of cutting it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving end cuts very close which was surprising.  The pivoting end is a bit weird and can still nick sensitive areas if not careful but overall that side is what I use the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimming end I would use except even without the guard on it still doesn&#x27;t cut my sideburns or trims close enough to make it any good.  I usually shave once a week and would like this to reduce my beard down to something my razor can handle...which the trimmer leaves hair slightly too long still.  I don&#x27;t have a big beard or need for the adjusting guard but I hear bad things about it reading other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging stand works okay.  Makes a slight humming noise though.  It&#x27;s nice how you just rest it on and take it off when you want it...  Kinda on the edge with that one.</li>
            <li> Smooth, no irritation.  It does exactly what it supposed to do.  Skin is extremely smooth after use.  Definitely a good choice.</li>
            <li> I like the end with the trimming attachment, so I use that end, but the other end just seems to pull on your hairs making it an unlikeable experience.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything better than this currently on the market now. The only complains I have is the unit&#x27;s foil goes bad within few months and you can&#x27;t find it in stores so you have to purchase the foil on amazon</li>
            <li> Owned this product for 3 years. Bought in from Amazon Austria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had much success with the shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;Took to long to get a clean shave an my balls or chest, and got cut or scratched multiple times in the process.&lt;br /&gt;Switched to a regular safety razor and received much cleaner results, without cutting myself in the process.&lt;br /&gt;The trimming side works well. I mostly used it to trim my thick leg hairs without them looking stubbly or clean-shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly the battery service time was a disappointment as well. I often had to stop and recharge during usage.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Was&amp;#34; because the product refused to charge after 3 years using the included charger, and I never bothered replacing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again. I&#x27;m looking for a simple body hair trimmer, and use a safety razor when I want a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Because of how the trimmer sections stick out on the shaver end, I do not see how you can shave in any area that is tight without nicking yourself with the trimmer sections. This seems like a really poor design to me. Clearly, others love this device but I do not see what they see in it. It seems well made but where those two trimmers are seems to make the shaver part unusable in tight areas, which means seeing blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is also a dumb design. Most shavers and trimmer have just the unit itself and a cord for charging it. This gives you this nice, fold out stand. Problem is you cannot charge the device without the stand because the stand conducts the electricity. Hence, unless you love the idea of displaying your bodygroom pro on your counter, you will have to keep track of three things, not two, and get out three things, not two, when you want to charge the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the unit is well made. It&#x27;s just got design issues that make it something I wish I had not purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with 45 day money back warranty from Norelco. I called to take advantage of this. Person took all my information. They (Norelco) did not follow up further as they said they would. Terrible service.</li>
            <li> This shaver is super fast for body shaving and easy to clean.  It&#x27;s also really nice that is is chargeable so you don&#x27;t have to run through tons of batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a Hairy guy but I am not naturally smooth either... This baby works perfect and without a doubt better than some other trimmers I have used in the past. The quality is high and it feels legit while holding it. I also love the rotating head, it helps get to the difficult places a little easier. The main reason I purchased this was for smoothing out the old twigs and berries, so the misses doesn&#x27;t get bark in her teeth.  Works like a charm! It will bring you right back to the days when smooth was natural... No pain, no bumps, no irritation. Granted that&#x27;s one mans result I think this is the best trimmer out there and I&#x27;m stoked I bought it. So&#x27;s the misses if you know what I mean;).  As far as longevity goes I csnt say. But I don&#x27;t need to use it to often so my guess is it will last a while. And if not, hell I&#x27;ll buy another.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this.  The beard trimmer is a great addition!  The only thing I am not getting is the light to come on....but maybe the battery isn&#x27;t dead enough...I&#x27;m not sure.  But this is a great product and it is even better than before!</li>
            <li> The strangest charging device ever.</li>
            <li> Works Well&lt;br /&gt;No Issues</li>
            <li> For such a high price , one would think that Philips /Norelco Company will at least like many other brands ad a small plastic oil lubricator per their own recommendation to lubricate the trimmer before 1st use.&lt;br /&gt;I guess not. Since I happen to have one from my old trimmer I was lucky, otherwise one will need to go to a department or local store to see if they sell one small oil lubricator and pay more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a inconvenience and poor marketing representation  and strategy of a Philips/ Norelco company for not including the oil trimmer lubricator.</li>
            <li> does not work anymore. Orange led keeps blinking.</li>
            <li> ok all i can say is this works perfectly for that zone above your knees and below your waist</li>
            <li> Great so far.  Easy to use. Easy to clean.  I am only giving four stars as I have not had a chance to use it that much.. Sheesh I don&#x27;t grow hair that fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty hairy, and I&#x27;ve struggled with certain areas for most of my life, and this device makes it a little easier to trim up in those tough areas.</li>
            <li> The Scrotum is a dangerous place to approach with trimmers.. those slicing blades can catch the skin and make the most amazingly painful pinches ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver end of the bodygroom PRO will work over the scrotum amazingly. You can catch the skin and make a sorta painful scratch if you don&#x27;t hold the pro at a very tight angle but once i learned that it was easy to correct for and now i can hit my scrotum without any fear whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU BODYGROOM PRO</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the BEST all over body shaver I have ever used. It is also the most economical and has the best BANG 4 the BUCK rating compared to other shavers of this type. Replacement heads are only $12, and are so easy to replace. I doubt that I will be needing a replacement any time soon, since the shaver is as sharp today as it was the day I received it. On a side note, this is not &amp;#34;just for men&amp;#34;. My wife uses it also, or should I say I use it on/with her. We both enjoy this product and highly recommend it to everyone, males, females, couples and all bipedal species that choose to live a hairless, or &amp;#34;less hairy&amp;#34; lifestyle. Have fun and I hope this review helps you in your buying decision.</li>
            <li> The Bodygroom Pro is effective at trimming as advertised, and comes with a handy charging stand so you never need to worry about whether or not it&#x27;s ready to go. The only downside is that it can be difficult to reach some areas such as the mid back, and could do with some sort of extending handle feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well designed, has a good feel to it, easy to use.</li>
            <li> the older one is better.  Only reason i got this one was cuz of the past one...do not buy, do not buy</li>
            <li> I just used the Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro for the fist time.  I was amazed by how close the groomer was able to trim.  I trimmed the hair on my chest and arms which is not a lot, but enough that I like to keep things clean.  The groomer worked effortlessly and I was very happy with the clean look it left behind.  The build seems adequate but I fear the day i drop the groomer. I do not anticipate the groomer holding it&#x27;s own against the linoleum. the buttons for the groomer are in an the same spot that you place your fingers to guide the groomer. Which meant that I accidentally turned off the groomer at least 4-5 times while shaving.  Not a huge deal, but the engineers should have thought out the ergonomics of the on-off switches.  I will check back ina few months to give an update.</li>
            <li> what can i say.. just save you money and buy a hair cut machine cheap than this joke.. i just used it. Tried to use the &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; part, guess what ? if u looking to spend 1 hr in each part of u body to try to remove  hair,  go ahead (the battery just last 50min)&lt;br /&gt;so.. i just forget this &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; side and used the trimming side, which is also a joke.. its small and do the same job as any hair cut machine (but the haircut machine does a better job, because its bigger, so do it faster and saves ur time)  i bought this thinking would be easy to remove my hair but its not. the only advantage of this is because is cordless.&lt;br /&gt;i read a review saying the he cut his balls.. and.... its true i didn&#x27;t believe it until i got my&lt;br /&gt;i have it for like 3 hrs a already have a lot of bad thinks to talk about..&lt;br /&gt;iam willing to return it and buy a cheap haircut machine that is cordless.  was expecting more from you&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco BG2040</li>
            <li> Works great! love it.</li>
            <li> I had the original BG2020 when it was released and rarely used it.  I like that this one has the trimmer on the handle instead of having to store and swap out adapters.  Quick and easy clean up of your downstairs (good bye swamp butt).</li>
            <li> Over the last couple months  I&#x27;ve scoured the internet as most probably had, looking for a \\&quot;best\\&quot; groomer. Incidentally i simultaneously had been looking for a \\&quot;best\\&quot; beard trimmer as well (separately). Really wanted 2 dedicated devices that specialize in each. Both products I ended up with were Norelco due to reviews. I guess norelco just isn&#x27;t for me or my specific grade/texture hair. I&#x27;ll be returning this in the morning just like I returned the beard trimmer several weeks ago. It didn&#x27;t cut short enough (which is not the devices fault, I should have realized the shortest mm wasn&#x27;t enough in the packaging). As a grooming device  I guess I assumed the settings would have been shorter and didn&#x27;t catch that. But even on the shortest setting I noticed it didn&#x27;t really cut evenly and I had to go back and forth several times for the easiest of trimming on some arm hair which is very fine and light and easy to cut typically with my hair trimmer. My hair trimmer does a good job over all of trimming body hair but is bulky and running a cord and extension cord all around is not ideal. But for now I&#x27;ll have to keep using them, which incidentally I had to use to fix what this trimmer couldn&#x27;t get on my arms adequately/evenly. The foil shaver was pretty good, used to remove a small chest patch I have. I was happier with that result but on that I expected a bit more a well. I guess for the price I expected it to be perfect for me and have a stronger motor, sharper cutting action and assumed (I know I should never assume) more length setting options.</li>
            <li> The trimmer side dies immediately after turning on after owning this for 6 months. Shaver side works fine so I know it has a charge.  You might expect that of a 30 dollar shaver but for 70? It&#x27;s a shame cuz I like the double sided feature.</li>
            <li> This thing is great, and the battery life is amazing. The only down side is that you need to regularly use it. If your hair is too long, you will need something more powerful or you will spend all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied&lt;br /&gt;is just what I wanted&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for its quality and price … …</li>
            <li> This was my first bodygroom product. It works as described. Can be used wet or dry. The trimmer and shaver both are a breeze to use with the contoured surfaces and flexible tips. The product is safe to use if you are slightly careful. Battery life is great too! Recommended!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and it is durable, dependable and gives a nice smooth shave. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this shaver</li>
            <li> Works great! Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This thing is great. Shared by me and my boyfriend and we love it.</li>
            <li> the battery is terrible!! drains faster than an android device!! worthless if you ask me cuz u cant use it for more than 10 mins</li>
            <li> Charge lasts much longer then I expected. It certainly can give a nice smooth shave. But, you do need to be careful and go slow, it can still cut and leave razor burn in sensitive areas. But, it is the best shaver I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Perfect and gets the job dome. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for over a year and I am very pleased with it.  Capable of shaving almost my whole body on a single charge makes this very convenient.  Almost incapable of cutting you (I nicked myself down there once a few months ago), you can ensure that you get an even cut anywhere.  The only downside is that it cannot shave the smallest stubble so you will be left with really small hairs.  The Bodygroom cleans easily and it&#x27;s charging stand makes a good holder when not in use.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer works well compared to the older Wahls that I had. However, the electric shaver is not very good. I have a wet/dry Panasonic electric shaver that is far better. I would not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because when I groom down below with a normal razor, I get ingrown hairs and razor burn very easily.  Also using a normal electric razor can be painful with the possibility of cuts.  This pretty much makes those issue non-existant.  I use this with a talc powder which makes everything go smoothly.  You still have to be a little careful but not nearly as careful with a normal electric razor.  This also works great for sideburns and beard trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend if you are like me.</li>
            <li> So far this is what I was looking for.  I used it for my underarms and pubic hair, and I am very pleased with the results.  If you are not looking for perfection, I would recommend this.  I used it wet and dry to test, and so far dry is better for me.  I was stupid for some time not looking into something like this, because I always used regular trimmers for everything.  I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly! It&#x27;s not as complicated to own as others make it out to be if you actually READ the instructions and DON&#x27;T always leave it on the charger as the instructions tell you not to do because that will kill the battery! Mine still works great and I have no complains! Not a single nick or cut!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews in products, but I finally found a razor that&#x27;s water proof and works perfect in groin region. Guys this is the best shaver for the scrotum area, without the worry of knickin the nuts:)</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve purchased. My first one was over 5 years ago. That one the battery died rather quickly in my opinion. Although it&#x27;s too soon to determine how the battery will hold up with this new generation, it&#x27;s performance is just as good if not slightly better then the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really safe to use down there, feels great in the hand, build is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this and hope it lasts longer then the battery did in the first one. That&#x27;s really the only issue anyone could have with this device.</li>
            <li> I am just a big fan of this thing, helps take care of unwanted hair. It&#x27;s revolutionary in my opinion.</li>
            <li> In theory, this should be a great product.  Unfortunately, it falls short in a few areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, and most importantly is in battery life.  No matter how long or short it charges for, the trimming side always has very little battery power and the yellow light almost immediately comes on.  This started happening perhaps a month into its use.  Weird thing is that if you shut the trimmer off and turn the close shave side on, the battery  magically comes back to life.  Reading reviews of other similar universal products, this seems to be a very common issue.  Again, very unfortunate because on paper, this is an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, be very careful using either side of this shaver below the belt.  I won&#x27;t go into details but it can be a bloody mess (pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, it doesn&#x27;t come close to giving you a smooth shave.  It&#x27;ll get you down past stubble, but in places like your neck and other areas, it&#x27;s not going to do what you&#x27;re hoping it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasty, I did not receive the 3 additional attachments shown in the photos, so I was stuck with the only adjustable beard trimmer.  leaving the choice of a 5 day long beard, or an awkward stubble if i took the attachment off altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, it&#x27;s worth the $30-40 bucks you can save on having it do a lot of razor work.</li>
            <li> It works as stated and is a good quality shaver. A bit pricey but wet/dry and shave/trim is good and is built to last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I have bought ever ,it has tow ways of use one for the small hair and other one for long, you can use it for body shaving or face shaving , very long battery life ,light and thin .&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for over two years still works great, the charge lasts forever, I mainly use to shave the longer hairs on my legs and arms in the summer months, it gets hot in Florida, I don&#x27;t need the hair. My wife thought I was crazy to order it but no she likes it that I have less hair.</li>
            <li> i love it, the ladys love it, its a win win for everyone.  Everyman should try to this, its a great product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.. I bought it to trim my beard and my head. Hairs get stuck in combs.</li>
            <li> The best shaver. Period.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using straight razors and wanted something that would get very close to the skin without causing irritation. I use this with Williams Lectric Shave and it gets the job done. The trimmer is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I have ordered twice of this, best product</li>
            <li> I purchased this about six months ago and I am very happy with my purchase. In addition to getting $10 credit with Phillips Norelco after registering the product warranty, it works very well. I have used this product on a daily basis to trim my facial hair (I like it at about a 4) and clean up any unwanted stubble, this despite the fact that it is not intended for use on the face. While I am not an excessive &amp;#34;manscaper&amp;#34; it has worked very nicely for keeping my privy parts pretty. I would recommend using the product with shaving cream if you are wanting to go for a close shave.</li>
            <li> So I bought this hoping it was the solution I needed to trim my pubes. Well the trimmer does not cut the hair nearly short enough and I warn you. DO NOT use the trimmer without the guide. You will cut yourself guaranteed. So you essentially have to use the foul to get any results from this thing. I hadn&#x27;t planned on being as smooth as a child but hey if it works it works right? Wrong. Using it in the hot shower with gillette body shaving gel I not only cut myself with the foil part, but a day later noticed the bumps. This was even though i used an after shave moisterizing lotion on it right out of the shower and then again before bed and the morning after. Then the ingrown hairs came about two days later. And everybody knows how great those feel. So I waited two weeks when.it was at least mostly away and decided to give it one more try. I was already past the refund date so might as well. Using even more precaution with pre shave oil and the shave gel it cut one part of my shaft raw and the next day had a bunch of bumps..again. Ive decided to give it one more try two weeks from now and if it finally does what it says I will come and change this but if not at least I can give warning so you will at least be prepared. Update.. Still the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever brought near my crotch since I went to Hong Kong. If you don&#x27;t mind cutting pieces of your member off and having a terrifying experience then go ahead and get it.</li>
            <li> This product does not hold a charge.  I am able to get 1.5 -2 shaves with it before it dies on me.</li>
            <li> Works like a champion device. I have never had a device that worked so well. Cut hair dry or wet. Very nice design.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy balanced feel for a personal groomer.  Very impressed with the charging stand, design and feel.It is showcased on my dresser it looks that cool.</li>
            <li> Love this BodyGroomer.  Husband uses to manscape which really prevents skin irritation since he&#x27;s a runner.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> 2 years have gone buy since my purchase. Still works, still gets the job done. Best i&#x27;ve ever purchased. Recommended.</li>
            <li> The shaving head works well, especially the teeth, for trimming eyebrow strays, ear hair and cleaning up my sideburns, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the trimmer head has ZERO power, it dies on me in fact and I can only use it for a few minutes on my decidedly fine body hair. The most I can use it for anymore is to trim my little goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: disappointing, especially at the price!</li>
            <li> Works great for female grooming. No uncomfortable nicks.</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I have made recently. I use this all the time when I&#x27;m manscaping.</li>
            <li> does exactly what the packaging states, very awesome grooming tool, the charging dock it great and the charge lasts long.&lt;br /&gt;the power stays consistent for a cordless device compared to other devices, very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re smart and careful you&#x27;ll never get nicked. This thing is the best version of the 3 BodyGroom razors I&#x27;ve had over the years.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing. No ingrown hairs, no rash.  It works very well on all the special parts.  The blades do not last forever so be sure to order replacements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably give it 4.5 stars if the battery worked long enough for a &amp;#34;grooming.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year, it does not. I&#x27;m 4 years into this one, used it infrequently, and now it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End of story.</li>
            <li> This works as advertised.  It&#x27;s a great Product.  I highly recommend it.  Safe for those tender regions, if you know what I mean!</li>
            <li> If you want to be just a little hairy you will love this</li>
            <li> I still use this, and should probably get a new one, but this one has been great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and I&#x27;m actually quite pleased. I will detail for better understanding:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The 2 heads, cutting both the full main and secondary to lower I have worked very well, perfectly smoothly cut.&lt;br /&gt;* The cleaning is quite simple and can be waterproof put it in the jet smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;* The battery charges very fast, about 2 hours from 0% to about 100%. And it takes a lot (2-3 weeks, depending on frequency of use) without loading again, but I have to accept that I am not the world&#x27;s hairiest.&lt;br /&gt;* You can also use it to dry or liquid foam to shave smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;* I like the technology used because it can not easily cut you even if you are clumsy when using it.&lt;br /&gt;* The&#x27;ve used in all (really all) parts of the body where hair out and offered me the best result, very good. Even in intimate parts you will have good results, but I warn you to be careful and not make it into the wild because it can hurt.&lt;br /&gt;* After a few months is cut perfectly, but I guess at least annually or should do little more head change can be achieved very easily here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I think I&#x27;ve spent good amount of $$ it cost me and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who needs something. He will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Take it slow and it&#x27;s great. If you move too quickly it will pull on your skin and cause irritation.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good, but I&#x27;m not jumping up and down about how good it is.</li>
            <li> Closest thing to a real shave. I was surprised how close of a shave it really was. Every man needs one of these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through two of these over the sears.  I am pretty happy.  I works great for trimming all sorts of body hair.  As long as you keep it clean it stays sharp and reduces the chance of you carving some initials in the tree trunk or nicking a berry.</li>
            <li> Battery lasted a few months, and did not hold any charge after 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro]]&lt;br /&gt;As so many others have already said, this thing is great when it is new. BUT, (and that&#x27;s a big but), it will stop taking a charge between 6-12 months after first use. I sent the first one back and it was replaced under warranty with a new one but with the clear proviso that the warranty would not be extended for the new model. Well, guess what?  After working fine for about six months, the second one has now also lost its ability to hold a charge as well, just like the first one.  And, of course, the warranty on the first one (after their refusal to extend it for the new replacement) has now (just) expired!  Since so many people are complaining about this, Philips Norelco MUST know that they have a problem with the battery.  Why aren&#x27;t they pro-active and contact ALL of us who have purchased this (and registered it with them) and replace it with something that works for longer than six months!  DON&#x27;T PURCHASE THIS IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT LASTS MORE THAN A YEAR!</li>
            <li> ....far better than the previous model which the blade kept falling out of it and it was so annoying and Revolting. this is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Well Built, and feels solid. I love every bit of how it shaves and how it works. Its also classy and looks good whiles being charged.</li>
            <li> Its not a smooth or as painfree as I would like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous shavers, from manual to electric, and this is by far one of the best.  Personally I wish the foil shaver wasn&#x27;t so wide, but then again I&#x27;m clearly not the target market for this product.  It&#x27;s safe to use in shall we say &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34; areas without having to go so slow that it takes forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great having all the tools attached right to it (i mean come on who hasn&#x27;t lost some of the 800 attachments other products provide) and the combination of the trimmer and foil gives you nice smooth results.</li>
            <li> Works great. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the best appliance I have purchased in the last 10 years: Quality construction. Excellent user manual. Works exactly as advertised.  UPDATE 4 years later: Batteries are poor......sigh.....if only they were replaceable LiIon.....sigh....will not hold a charge at all.....sigh..... Summary: first 2 years heaven; 3rd year, starting running short: grooming time was short; 4th year: DEAD.</li>
            <li> VEry nice and easy to use. Made well, and does not feel cheap or will break. One hour to charge.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item about 16 months ago and use it 3 times a week.  I&#x27;m a bearded man and I really only use it for my face.  It works decent enough for your under carriage, but I just prefer to use a safety razor in the shower.  This unit was great, but after about 12 months it&#x27;s performance began to degrade.  Now at 16 months, it won&#x27;t even hold a charge.  It takes 2 separate uses to complete a beard trimming.  I believe I can get through 2 to 3 mins of use before it quits.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve had it 2 years now and I&#x27;ve yet to change the battery. I actually didn&#x27;t even realize it had been so long since it still works well and I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve changed the blade or only bought one. The thing works, what can I say. I can shave - not my face with it and all is well. I like the &#x27;beard&#x27; trimmer too. It&#x27;s very easy to adjust the length and even though it says to not use without the guard, I do it all the time...unless it voids my warranty, because then I don&#x27;t do that. It works wet or dry, but seems to work better dry as a first step if you wait to long between shearings. Wonderful product. I give it four and a half stars. What improvements would it need to get five? you may ask. Well, I don&#x27;t know. It looks like I&#x27;ve been scratched up on my back when i use it and then I get in trouble and that sucks. It makes a mess unless I use it outside (awkward), and that sucks. I guess it could be longer, or maybe I just need to do yoga (that sucks). But, I wouldn&#x27;t trade the trimmer length adjuster at all, unless it got better. I just can&#x27;t stand the clip on goofy type. Either way, I like it and recommend it,</li>
            <li> Got this product two days after ordering it. Shipping was very fast. Used it about 4 hours after it was charged. All I can say is holy crap !  This thing works awesome. I bought it for grooming down below and it works great.  No pulling at all at hairs or any kind of irritation at all. You do need to take your time but the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Love and so does my wife. Trims the chest, arms, legs and with her help cleans the back. Wish the guard was a little stiffer, but oh well. Does a great job below the belt also.</li>
            <li> I had the older BG2020 before upgrading to this new trimmer. I thought the BG2020 was fantastic and I was weary at first to try an &amp;#34;upgraded&amp;#34; model in case it didn&#x27;t work as well. I upgraded because the screen clamps on the BG2020 wore out and I couldn&#x27;t keep the screen on any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BG2040 feels more sturdy than my BG2020. It trims very well, probably better than the 2020. The only problem I have with the 2040 is that it tugs on longer hair if I move to fast, which is something I never had a problem with on the 2020. (That is the only reason for missing one star.) If I move the trimmer slowly or use the other end to pre-trim I don&#x27;t tug any hair. Also I have yet to nick myself with this trimmer, which is very nice when you shave sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the other end is fantastic. I like having as few trimmers as possible and this has pretty much replaced my old beard and hair trimmer. I shave my entire head to a 2, and the settings on this are a little shorter than normal trimmers, so I place the setting to a 3 and am able to get a nice shave on the top of my head and beard.</li>
            <li> After searching for hours upon hours, I finally bit the bullet and bought this personal groomer. So far, I have not had any issues with the adjustable trimmer sliding down to the lowest setting when trimming hair and the trimmer is by far my favorite side of the groomer. Never had any snags or pulls. Always very smooth and a good looking cut. The shaving side takes a little practice and getting used to, but overall works very well and does an outstanding job. The swivel head works very well for any shaving in tight spaces. I had the model before this and I believe that the shaving on that was a little bit better, but it died. Also it charges very quickly and I have never had it die on me mid-trim. Overall, I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase and would recommend to any guy that is trying to get into some body hair management.</li>
            <li> I hate to admit it, as I&#x27;ve always thought of myself as a rather &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; man, but I really like having no extra hair (or cleanly trimmed, at least).  I tried shaving for the first time earlier this year with a standard razor like what ladies use, and I tore myself up.  Then, I tried an epilator (which looks like a shaver, but just pulls the hair out completely), and while this is the best removal method, it&#x27;s painful and very time-consuming.  Worse, with epilating, when the hairs start growing back, they tend to curl up under the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This body groomer is just the perfect balance.  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as epilating, but it&#x27;s comfortable and effective.  I only tried it on my chest and abs, and I like the results, but will try it in the shower another time.  I have high expectations, and I believe I won&#x27;t be let down.  If I experience otherwise, I&#x27;ll update this review.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the reviews had me believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really want to return it but cannot as I am leaving for a trip tomorrow and wont be back for 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an ok product. For the price, it should have been a much better and premium product.</li>
            <li> Edit: 10/03/2013&lt;br /&gt;Will no longer charge at all.  Used less than one hundred times in total and battery won&#x27;t recharge at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really frustrated is the best way to sum it up.  When this thing is fully charged it works great.  However I have only used this maybe a five six dozen times in the many years I&#x27;ve owned it and barring the first few times used, it could never last long.  Maybe mine is a dud, but why can&#x27;t it last more than thirty minutes?  I am not talking about thirty straight minutes without turning it off.  I am talking about five to ten minutes of usage then turning it off then trying to turn it back on again after a week off and getting no response.  Why is it if I leave this unplugged and unused after just being fully charged does this lose its charge in just under a couple days?</li>
            <li> First of all: this shaver is long enough, and because the shaver end cuts at its edges as well, that one can shave those areas on the back impossible to reach (without help) with a razor.  Admittedly, I can only just barely get between my shoulder blades with my reach and flexibility--but barely means it does.  That alone make it a winner, to me.&lt;br /&gt;To elaborate, it trims EVERYthing well (as previously observed by other reviewers). Some men don&#x27;t mind having hair on every square inch of their bodies.  Some men (can&#x27;t see it myself) LIKE that.  Myself, I like a clean, smooth feel (perhaps I was a Roman in a previous lifetime) and have relied on my razor for decades.  A razor can&#x27;t reach the back; is inefficient on longer hair like arms and is dangerous in--ah--certain places.  This shaver does everything and does it supremely well.  &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
            <li> Manscaping can be a delicate &amp; downright controversial subject.  As a male who shaves his legs fairly regularly, have this little companion is quite handy.&lt;br /&gt;If that fits a description of you, my guess is that you&#x27;ll like this little diddy.</li>
            <li> I can shave the private areas and not worry about bumps or cuts.  The pain it would&#x27;ve saved me had I learned about this product earlier.</li>
            <li> This is a great body groomer. It really gets things under control \\&quot;down there.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve used other groomers in the past, and most were barely a step above scissors (which would be a bad idea to have very close to your privates) in terms of effectiveness and safety. This machine -- and it is a MACHINE -- does the job quickly, safely and thoroughly. My privates -- sack and staff -- are silky smooth. The effect made certain others happy. And so, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Great tool for the money.</li>
            <li> It is good for getting into small areas such as groin or in the crevice of your chest (the sternum).  It&#x27;s not as powerful as I would like but it does the job.  I hope Phillips can come out with the same size but a stronger motor.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I just had some cheap trimmer that I bought at Walmart.  It started to die and I went looking for a new body hair removal device.  I stumbled upon this product and saw that there were mixed reviews but most were positive.  I decided to fork out some extra cash and here I am now, with what is probably the most hilariously patchy and razor burned pubic region in all of America.  I do not think that I could be any more disappointed with is product.  I will be returning it ASAP.  BTW I did not use the other end, so that might work fine for all I know.</li>
            <li> I returned it not because it does not do the job.It was my skin is sensitive. This is a very awesome trimmer. Thanks to Amazon for returning with no problems.</li>
            <li> Decent shaver, bought it primarily to use in the shower, no issues so far. Minus 1 star because the trimmer almost useless. However, I normally use a Wahl Hero T Blade, or Andis T-Outliner trimmer if I&#x27;m not shaving clean, so it&#x27;s kind of hard to compare to those.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, was everything I expected</li>
            <li> Worked great for a few weeks and now it doesn&#x27;t charge anymore. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a problem with the charger or the product itself. The red light at the back of the shaver flashes when I try to turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon won&#x27;t let me return it, so I&#x27;ll have to try contacting Philips for warranty.</li>
            <li> This body groomer is twice as nice. One end for bulk removal and the other end for a nice clean finish. I used it on my Italian sweater that I had been wearing my whole adult life. My daughters had great fun shaving papa bear back and then talcing me up. Now daddy is a smooth customer</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my old Norelco BodyGroom. I like the two head feature. Is easy to handle and works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> It is really amazing machine for remove the hair of body in any area&lt;br /&gt;I love it .</li>
            <li> I guess, I was expecting more as I love Norelco product.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: it looks great.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: 1) The top part, for shaving the private area, includes a very short trimming edge on both side. Why include that when the other side of shaver includes exact same thing as you can remove the plastic part and have a very short trimmer. If you are not careful, while shaving private area, you will touch skin with the edge trimmer and encounter massive pain. 2) the other side for trimming longer hair cuts very un-even and somewhat useless. I should have listened to others but bought it because it is small and looks really good. It quickly has found its way to be inside the vanity cabinet instead of on top.</li>
            <li> The battery no longer holds a charge longer than a few minutes. And replacing a $5 dollar battery will require you to open the unit and SOLDER on the new battery. Why didn&#x27;t they create a charging cut off on the unit so it wouldn&#x27;t kill the battery with over charging?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty expensive throwaway electronic shaver. Won&#x27;t repeat buy.</li>
            <li> I like it, I love it... Too bad I it accidentally fell in the trash can and I threw it away... so I ordered another! Very good in the shower!</li>
            <li> This is a very solid shaver specifically designed for removing body hair. Instead of the typical Norelco lay-out of 2 or 3 round heads, it uses a slim cylindrical head more often seen in Braun or Panasonic products. The shaving head can both pivot and telescope; Thus it can follow the body curvature very well.    The product itself is solidly built and ergonomically shaped. Perhaps because Norelco is trying to invade a competitor stronghold, the price is set surprisingly low for a premium brand. Overall, it is both a very good product and a very good bargain.</li>
            <li> This shaver is simply awesome.  The instructions tell that it&#x27;s only to be used below the neck, but I&#x27;ve used it for shaving neck hair along with trimming up other areas.  I&#x27;ve experienced absolutely zero pulling or nicks using both ends of the trimmer.  It is gentle and effective.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well for the private  areas for men and woman</li>
            <li> I owned the older Phillips bodygroom razor.  It was ok to use.  Battery would die w/no warning, it was light to hold and detachable clippers made it somewhat awkward.  It finally stopped working and I needed a replacement.  I did a lot of research and came back to Phillips.  It&#x27;s awesome.  It&#x27;s heavier and more solid to hold, there are no attachments and it has an indicator letting you know when battery is low.  It even shaves better than the older model.  Only complaint is no travel case.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. Easy to use and effective.  It really is a full body trimmer.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> this razor works great!!!   nice close cut without having to worry about nicks or cuts.  feels great in the hand, great sized head for getting all the nooks and crannies.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great neck down trimmer. This is completely the razor you want if you want to shave your man bits. No nicks or cuts like when trying to use your wife&#x27;s razor. This razor runs wet or dry. What a product. I&#x27;m a hairless cat these days. Smooth as silk. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  The pivoting head doesn&#x27;t work well on my body, and if you try to get your back at all it&#x27;s not happeneing.  It&#x27;s good to have as a back up, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product it does all that I want it to do and I am now a Philips Norelco fan. I have two different shavers made by them and very happy with both.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift purchase for our son.  It is quite versatile, he uses it daily and loves it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but not by much</li>
            <li> Battery failed after six months. Let it run dead first few times as instructions stated. Worked great when it was new, but began using less as the battery became less and less potent. The questions section has instructions on how to change internal battery, that speaks volumes. Sticking to Wahl or Braun from now on.</li>
            <li> the best body groommer made it has everything you may need to work on your body you can use it for everything ! ! !</li>
            <li> Feels cheaply made, and does the job only ok.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for sensitive areas mostly.  It does a decent job with no irritation.  I also tried it on my legs. It doesn&#x27;t nearly do the job that a blade does but decent if you want a quick shave out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with the product until it just stopped working on the cutter end.  I was disappointed when I contacted norelco that they will do nothing after the two year warranty is expired.  Also the batteries are not designed to be replaced. and like most batteries they don&#x27;t last long enough for a shave after two years. Bottom line, be prepared to buy one every two years.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. It protects sensitive areas and cuts super close to the skin.</li>
            <li> Replacement head keeps popping off every single time I turn it on. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 months but it is useless now.</li>
            <li> I researched available products on the market extensively and this one seems to be the best. I am very happy with it. The shaver portion does a great job on the &amp;#34;boys&amp;#34; and I love the smooth feeling there and am addicted to it now. You do have to be careful as the fine trimmer edges on the shaver side for longer hairs can and will catch loose sensitive skin which I have done a few times. The builtin adjustable comb is great on the trimmer side. Overall very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Everything works very well. The only issue I have is taking off the top to clean it. The manual that comes with it doesn&#x27;t clearly indicate how to pull off the top.</li>
            <li> This shaver is not worth it.  I cut myself a few times using this razor.  It doesn&#x27;t sit in its stand very well and the whole device has a shoddy build quality to it, compared to my Braun shaver.  I ended up using my old Braun shaver instead.</li>
            <li> This body groom does the same job as less expansive clippers. I would not advise to use it near male private parts unless you want to bleed. Only advantage of this groomer over standard electric clippers is that this groomer is water proof.</li>
            <li> Has worked really well. Two complaints - full metal body is heavier than necessary for airline travel. And the hair trimming part doesn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; measurements, it&#x27;s either pure blade or a noticeable gap. Works great for body hair, but not as well if you want to use it to keep stubble on your face (was hoping to only have 1 razor).</li>
            <li> Ok product.....i will update this rating after i use it a little bit more. I have VERY thick hair so i have to go over spots on my shoulders a number of times......it struggles to cut.    Uppdate:  Overall pretty good. I use it on every part of my body....it does what its advertised to do....nothing spectacular but it definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd BodyGroom. I&#x27;ve had 2 of the previous models, both of which i used until the battery could no longer hold a charge. In my opinion, both were superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They make a big deal about the advances like the 3d pivoting head, but it&#x27;s not really that smooth a shave. Nothing like the smoothness of a razor - I can go over an area three times and still have stubble. This is great for something quick and convenient, or for getting rid of hair where you don&#x27;t want to use a blade, but it&#x27;s just not a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest problem with this model: mine does NOT stay in the charging dock. The previous models slid right into their charging docks and stayed there, no problem. This one just will not stay seated in the dock. I think I&#x27;m going to have to tape it in place to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one. The older models were better. This one is just not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This thing worked great for the first few months. I would charge it until full, take it off and leave it alone until use. Take it in the shower or out, and use it over and over until it started blinking at me. Well either way, a few months of use and this thing started to hold about a 2 minute charge MAX. I would charge it for however long it would take, and then shave as quickly as possible. It was almost as if it were an overheating problem, and it would start to blink shortly after starting up, and then shut down completely. It is now dead completely, and I&#x27;ve been using regular clippers and an old shaver to help trim different areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was not stored in harsh environments, always inside the bathroom drawer, away from harmful elements. Never left on the charger or anything like that either. I was very disappointed it died, as this was absolutely perfect when it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the market for a new one this weekend, and I&#x27;ll probably be going with the mangroomer pro or something, and hope for the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So once again great shaver, just for me... didn&#x27;t last :(.</li>
            <li> One of the best trimmers I have ever owned. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good trimmer .</li>
            <li> I put buying this thing off for a long time, thinking I wasn&#x27;t missing much and could stick to using other gear/trimmers. WRONG. This is fantastic. The curve of the body with trimming blades on both sides actually makes it REALLY easy to get the tight corners without cutting the daylights out of your junk. The trimming edges are also SUPER safe on skin - I didn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;nicked&amp;#34; once, unlike other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried. Waterproof is a nice touch, too.</li>
            <li> Great product, very happy with results. Everything as described. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that this thing is over hyped.....First of all...when you venture below you you can nick yourself and yes when you do it bleeds and bleeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a good concept but I would say it is better as a trimmer than a shaver....the teeth will bite and when they do you are cut.  Maybe those who tout that it is impossible to cut yourself will provide some detailed direction cause I don&#x27;t see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that I am still using it a year later.  You have to be very careful and make sure you have the angle right.  I&#x27;ve had much better luck by powdering prior to the shave.  If you go slow and are careful you will get good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only other complaint is that the battery has to be completely discharged before charging otherwise you will kill the battery life. Come on...this isn&#x27;t the 1980&#x27;s anymore.  So when you have the quick touch up before special times you won&#x27;t be sure it will have enough charge and of course if you rush you will arrive with a few wounds.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product!! It is very good at getting a very close shave, and I feel safe enough to use it for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas, which I can only assume is the main purpose of this product. Some areas are better with the guarded edge, while others are better with the trimmer edge which works well for large areas. It holds a charge for quite a while ( a couple months of regular use for me). I have tried waxing, traditional razors, and epilators, and this is by far the superior choice. No pain, no bumps, and very fast.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of others &amp; decided to pull the trigger.  I purchased this Target as it was on sale &amp; this isn&#x27;t a Prime item. (I&#x27;m so sad) I used this for the first time last night.  I let it charge for 1 hr like the directions stated. Then I went to work, not a nick or scratch.  It&#x27;s very quiet &amp; works well.  I was able to go bald in about 20 mins. You do need to go slow &amp; take your time until you figure out which direction works best for you.  I do recommend this to anyone who wants that smooth feeling anywhere below the neck.</li>
            <li> I really like this model so far. Just a few shaves in and I have yet to find anything wrong or anything I didn&#x27;t like. The trim feature on the bottom is great, perfect length settings and has enough umph that you don&#x27;t expect it to give out for a long while. The charger stand is small and appropriate, doesn&#x27;t take up too much space. Great for the trimming of key areas.</li>
            <li> In the past I have purchased cheap plastic trimmers that easily broke when I attempted to use them and were very awkward to reach the correct places for trimming.  I frequently had to replace them resulting in much higher cost over time.  Not so with this item:  The body is pretty solid metal construction and looks to be able to survive a drop (although I cannot confirm this yet).  Also combines the best of both worlds with a adjustable trimmer and contact mesh trimmer on opposite sides.</li>
            <li> I have owned a few body razor&#x27;s for men and so far I like this one the best.  It&#x27;s convenient in the sense that both heads trim hair and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Excellent so far. Easy to clean and no pulling at all..</li>
            <li> So far i had used dozens of body hair shaving and grooming products, but this one is the best .</li>
            <li> Excellent quality &amp; performance! This is by far the best body grooming product I have ever owned. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a pain-free shave as advertised.</li>
            <li> First let me state I am a female not a male and this is my quick view on this product. I was tired of the same waxing procedures down there not to mention how time consuming and excruciating the pain could be at times. I am very pleased with how close the shave is and highly recommend this product to all men and women who want to trim or shave off their pubic areas. This product performs very well. It also fully charges in 1 hour unlike a lot of other body hair trimmers out there. Plus since its waterproof its very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> There really are few things better than a freshly shaved nether region. This has made the process much easier. If you want a mole rat with matching luggage,  I recommend this handy tool.</li>
            <li> Excellent, priced fairly, wonderful product, exactly as described,  zero misrepresentation....</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. Usually use this to shave off the bulk of the body hair and then go over the stubble with a regular razor. Saves me money on regular razors, used to use 2-3 a week just to shave body hair. Although its not made for use on the face I sometimes use it to trim facial hair short before using a normal razor. Saves me from throwing out a dozen razors (body/facial hair is pretty thick) Only issue I have is that I shave my private area and thighs about once a week and it tugs and pulls and clogs 2-3 times per leg.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband as a Christmas gift. He really likes it and says it has a nice weight to it. But he says that you should be sure to &amp;#34;stretch out&amp;#34; the boys when going near them with the groomer or else it grabs them in a mean way.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  This razor recharges on its stand and is perfect as an electric razor and as a trimmer.  Plus you don&#x27;t have to replace batteries regularly.</li>
            <li> Bought for my teenage son as a gift and he loves it. Can be used dry or wet. Great product!</li>
            <li> I like to write my product reviews after I&#x27;ve owned a product for a while since in the modern era, things don&#x27;t seem to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco, on the other hand, has. And it has very well. I still use it for the necessary tidying of oneself (a few locations on my body). It has yet to wear out, it keeps the same charge it did as it was new, and I&#x27;ve performed *no* maintenance on it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is built very well and I would recommend it. I&#x27;ve dropped it many times, used it both in and out of the shower, and it has held up great!</li>
            <li> the head stays on unlike the earlier models. great for anywhere. also has a adjustable beard trimmer on the other side. easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Double sided, makes it nice for a quick change between trimming and shaving. Strong battery, stays charged for more then one session. Great buy!</li>
            <li> So I consider myself to be a moderately hairy guy.  The Norelco trims as well as removes hair quite well.  I primarily bought this to use on my man parts but trim chest hair and some other spots too.  I&#x27;ve had it for some time now and gotten good use out of it.  A couple of times I&#x27;ve gotten nicked, but overall it works very well for that purpose.  It&#x27;s recharged well and tends to hold a charge for some time.  Well worth the money invested.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. I would suggest reading the instructions before using this Groomer start off slow until you get a feel for it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for about one year.  Used it very rarely, maybe once a month or even less.  Now one button is malfunctioning and the other one isn&#x27;t working at all.</li>
            <li> I am surprisingly pleased with this product.  All of the reviews are spot on.  The only downside is that it isn&#x27;t super fast.  It does take some time to get all the hair but overall this is the best product I have used.  I would recommend trying it out.  I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> It does a good job, all around useful tool, not as close as I would like but what can you expect. Have not cut my self yet even in the more sensitivity man areas. If your tired of razor prices this is the way to go for now.</li>
            <li> It simply does not provide neither good trim, nor a good shave...period. And this is THE highly recommended body shaver....lord knows how the unacceptable the &amp;#34;lesser&amp;#34; brands must be!</li>
            <li> This is what i am looking for ! i really happy with it..&lt;br /&gt;my entire body has been shaved in 15 min :). my body look sexy and attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the design is perfect and easy for use . i don&#x27;t see any negative point in machine . Thanks to Philips.</li>
            <li> The one star is for Norelco&#x27;s website policy of coercing the purchaser to go through a survey to warranty the product.</li>
            <li> Its always nerve racking buying electronics online. Let me say this though this razor has worked well since day one. It is a great close shave and solved several of my grooming needs.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about this product. It&#x27;s stylish, it&#x27;s light-weight, it gets the job done. The Philips Norelco Bodygroom Pro is definitely a great product based on the price alone. I&#x27;ve found that the item holds its initial charge for quite a while and that it&#x27;s one of the few shavers/groomers that&#x27;s really easy to clean and maintain. I did find, however, that it seemed to take a bit pressure/force in order to get the desired close shave that I wanted. I&#x27;m sure that the preference varies among the user how close or how much you want to be groomed, so I didn&#x27;t feel the need to knock off a star or take that into account when reviewing the product.</li>
            <li> Well built and stylish. Cordless shaving is a great convenience and the charge seems to hold up well. I can only say it works well for moderate use as it there isn&#x27;t a heavy need in my household. It does say that it isn&#x27;t for above the neck, so you still need a second shaver for your face.    I&#x27;m not crazy about the stand as it seems a little rocky but it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems. Also a bit frustrating to take 8 hours to charge, but if it is stored in the charger this is a non issue.    It does what it says it will and looks and feels solid.</li>
            <li> So, i think i read just about ever single review for this product before buying it (the BG2040 model) and as well the model below this one the BG2030. What i really liked about the BG2040 is that all the attachments are on the shaver. this means that if i want to use the comb attachments to shave hair to a certain length i don&#x27;t have to hunt for or even change anything on the shaver. Its al there already, and i love that! i really dont like buying shavers with like twelve attachments... lame. This is a very simple product and does a great job at shaving. i&#x27;ve used the shaver in every way it was designed for and for all areas of the body. And it really does a great job all over.   Now as far as shaving \\&quot;below the border\\&quot; it was a bit frightening at first but after actually doing it, it was actually no worry at all. Worked great. Though you do have to still be careful. Don&#x27;t expect that you can just go shaving down below with your eyes closed and half hazzardly expecting to come out without any....accidents, just because this is advertised as a product that is meant for shaving \\&quot;all over\\&quot;. You still gotta be smart and be careful and take your time. But if you do, you&#x27;ll be fine.   Battery life if good, cleaning is easy. Works great in the shower and out of it.     Now just go ahead and buy it and stop reading all these crazy reviews. What i learned was that for every negative review you read for this product you can find a positive one as well and visa-versa. I read every review, then bought it, and i&#x27;m happy with the purchase.     Good Luck!</li>
            <li> It takes too much time to do the job, for a close shave you have to go through the same area at least 4 times. The battery life is questionable because during a 10 min shave is seems like the speed is getting worse as if battery was getting weaker, so there may be some problems with the battery in the long term and there is no option to use it with a cable.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other two bodygroom products and I think that this is the best. The handle is nice and sturdy and shaving head works great. Trimmer is attached on the handle as well (So no switching required) is a nice feature. The charger and sitting stand are sort of strange looking, but they work. I would recommend it for anyone looking for this type of product.</li>
            <li> He had a shaver which everytimt he uses it. The tip keeps falling out. So i bought him the body grommer and haven&#x27;t heard any complaints. Which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have ever bought where I felt compelled to leave a review.   It&#x27;s the ultimate for grooming your most private area.  Not one nick,  cut, pull, or irritation.  Plain and simple, it&#x27;s the best by far.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and does a very good job cleaning up my neck in the spots that my other electric razor doesn&#x27;t. Very easy to clean up and holds a charge longer than the directions indicate. I have been very happy with this razor so far.</li>
            <li> Great delivery, and it works really well.... I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> Works great love my new trimmer</li>
            <li> 1st.. Fast shipping, thanks amazon.&lt;br /&gt;2nd.. Good quality, strong, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;3rd.. I&#x27;s all-in-one no need to paying another shaving machine.</li>
            <li> Changing my review from 5 stars to 3. In my experience, the battery life is only good for a few days before it needs charging, which sucks because the charger stand is kind of an eyesore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it&#x27;s charged, the cutting mechanisms work very well, with no snags or problems on my ginger neckbeard.</li>
            <li> This is a very good body trimmer. I have been through countless trimmers in the past 6 years and this one by far gets the closest cut to the skin. I also like the long design of the instrument, it allows you to reach difficult places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bad thing I can say about it is that it does tend to pull your hair from time to time. You have to go slower which definitely takes your trimming time longer than usual.</li>
            <li> The battery really does not hold the charge well. ifixit website has a page on replacing the stock battery with aftermarket NiMH AAA batteries. It requires soldering skills, but I&#x27;m going to look into it. This is a vast improvement over Norelco&#x27;s 1st gen Bodygroom, which required constant brushing-off of the trimmed hairs. The combs on this one stays in place well, and don&#x27;t require brushing off the combs until you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> works great. Battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver in Freshmen year of college for portable and waterproof use. It has stood up years of use and still works great to this day (2/2012 to 6/2014).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variable length selection is a great, but I mainly just use the shortest option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually leave it standing on the charger ready for whenever I need it. If I transport it, it usually needs to be charged.</li>
            <li> All in one convenience, and reliable. I&#x27;ve used this for several years for all my grooming needs - hair cuts (crew cut), shaving, and body grooming. Battery lasts long, and it just keeps working year after year. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great unit w great battery capacity..</li>
            <li> I liked the older model better.  This one cuts the skin more.</li>
            <li> Easy to use in the shower!!!</li>
            <li> Crappy quality.  Their model below this model works better.  Won&#x27;t buy Norelco again.</li>
            <li> This body shaver does the best of any I&#x27;ve tried. You have to be patient using it, not going too fast, and it does give a close smooth shave without nicks or cuts. The battery life is excellent, too.</li>
            <li> When my old Norelco sideburns trimmer died on my, I was researching for a replacement.  The old one lasted more than a decade and cost me $37 (bought in 1999, died in 2012).  This BodyGroom 7100, however, quit working on me after two years and cost me $54.88 at the time.  I am not currently generating income, so I tried to fix it.  At first, I spent half-hour just to take the blade apart, and I cleaned the sideburns trimmings, which I thought to be the issue.  And the trimmer worked again for a couple more days before it quit again.  Now I put some mineral oil in it, and it works again (for now).  So yeah, if your BodyGroom quit on you, try that first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second issue I have with this model since the day one was, it can only work in &amp;#34;wireless&amp;#34; mode.  You can&#x27;t trim your sideburns while plugged into the outlet.  I understand it&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s intended to be used wet, so such design will prevent accidental electrocution, but I prefer having the option to plug in, so it doesn&#x27;t die on me in the middle of things.  I didn&#x27;t actually do an exact measure, but it&#x27;s around the neighborhood of 30 minutes per full charge.  It might not be enough juice for a full body grooming for some of you, so be aware of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging unit is badly designed.  It&#x27;s lightweight and can tip over easily, given the groomer itself has a nice weight to it.  And there is no holder for the power wire to keep it in place.  Combine all those designed flaws, and you get a unit that can tip over very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the unit itself for doing its job, I guess it&#x27;s okay.  That&#x27;s why the three stars.  Still wish for a plug-in mode, so it has more power.</li>
            <li> Best in quality and performance. Ordered second one as gift. Holds charges well in between. I carry it in all my long term trips</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first reading some of these reviews. But after my experience I use this shaver for everything. I can use with shaving cream, in the shower, I can use it without water and it still shaves good. You can use it on all parts of the body and it gives you a shave that&#x27;s close and doesn&#x27;t leave you itchy the next few days. It&#x27;s overall the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Got this for Valentine&#x27;s Day for my boyfriend to replace his old shaver. This is great because you can use it in so many ways! He shaves off chest hair and trims and shapes his beard. Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.  It gets him smooth everywhere, something he thought would never be the case.  He never nicks himself (as long as he has a mirror) and uses this in the shower as well.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it, I like to use it for full body grooming.  Very comfortable and effective.  To quote a line from Royal Pains, it works &amp;#34;from the shoulders to the boulders.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very good improvement on BG2020 model. Awesome features, including individual controls for each end, battery indicator, and pivoting head. Great battery life.</li>
            <li> This is the only body groomer that I have used so I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it against, but overall I find it to be pretty good. My only issue is it tends to take a long time to actually shave. This may be a problem for other devices as a well. I also don&#x27;t really like the shaver as it doesn&#x27;t seem to work well on my hair compared to the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this not sure what to expect and I have been very impressed. When I am buying an electric RAZOR that I plan to use very close to my nether regions I do some research. Using electronic devises in the shower is a point of concern, but this worked great in the shower. I would suggest using the trimmer end dry as water will lay hair down and make it harder to get an even cut. I charged it and used it three times before putting it back on the charger and could have used it more before recharging it. Three times may not sound like much, but there&#x27;s a lot to trim on this one so I find that to be pretty good. I was concerned with how expensive the replacement blade was, but it suggest changing it only once a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I trust this around my groin.....is there anything more that needs to be said.</li>
            <li> This gadget does everything, trims and shaves all body parts, very well.  I would like for the trimmer guide to allow cutting a little shorter and for the cutting blade to come all the way out to the edge.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;d like to give it 4 1/2 stars if it were possible.</li>
            <li> I like this product but it is with a poblem on amazon link, because you show some lengths integrated that does not belongs to the 2040 Pro.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Have used this twice since I bought it like a month ago. Not that hairy but it does a nice job and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin. Will have more to offer on prolonged use but right now, I have not a single regret.</li>
            <li> The purpose for this groomer is to care for intimate areas.  The rotating head on the shaver is a very much appreciated comfort item and also increases the effectiveness of the shaver.  The only caution is that the little teeth that feed hair into the cutting head are metal and they will seize any skin wrinkles and they will cut and/or tear tender skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic battery life does everything I expected it to do</li>
            <li> I really like this and plan to get one for my son for Christmas.Its great for beard trimming, etc.</li>
            <li> This has solved a problem I have had for a long time.  Makes shaving body hair a breeze.  The only thing I would change is a gaurd setting that gets just a tad closer on the clipper side, but beyond that I would not change anything else.</li>
            <li> Great shaper. Recomend.</li>
            <li> I love this prouct ! I shave most all my body For that &amp;#34;smooth Look&amp;#34; and thi is the product to do it. Not only is it easy to use, but it&lt;br /&gt;leaves no razor burns in delicate areas. I would highly recomend this to anyone who shaves thier bodies</li>
            <li> This is a flaky product.  It was OK when it worked, but the battery isn&#x27;t very good and the foil breaks easily.</li>
            <li> Another great item from norelco. It is delicate enough to shave delicate areas as well. Just be careful how many times you go over the same area because it could be a little irritating to the skin. But if you use a shaver for the face you would know that.</li>
            <li> bought this product about 2 weeks ago specifically for my groin area and more, and it trims perfectly. great for when  ur expecting that gift. 100 percent satsified and you can only trim your hair with it so thats a plus</li>
            <li> I am super hairy below the neck and I love this thing.  Both the shaving and grooming end have a top quality sturdy feel and perform well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you can nick yourself if your careless with the shaver, but if you are shaving below the belt with a razor and you&#x27;re not being careful anyway than you should probably seek out a group and share those feelings with others because you are a strange, strange human.  It&#x27;s a very close shaving razor so I guess it&#x27;s a minor tradeoff that you have to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money.  Buy it now.  No regrets.</li>
            <li> This product performed well, only to be used below the neck. Does a good job on all the remote areas.</li>
            <li> This is a great overall product and i love the convenience of using this when I am in a rush. I only had one problem and Philips took care of it very fast. The first one I received was not holding a charge so I contacted philips and the immediately sent me a replacement which worked great.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Extremely easy to use and clean&lt;br /&gt;2) IT WORKS! (worth the money)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) It does scratch the skin (although this is minimal, and might only feel it in very sensitive skin areas)&lt;br /&gt;2) Trimming unit should have another level for shorter hair</li>
            <li> Not a good product . Used in the shower once and never worked again</li>
            <li> Other reviewers were correct, it grabbed my skin and gave me a pretty nasty gash. Maybe I have soft supple skin - I don&#x27;t know, but I do know, it&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> Got this because like so many other men here, needed something to clean up on the parts we are all too embarrassed to talk about.  Yes, I tried and its glorious. You must be careful though, because its still blades moving really fast, but it&#x27;s the best yet.  Fast, easy, and effective. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> best body groomer i have owned</li>
            <li> This thing works great and is far better than a razor.  You do have to be careful and be patient.  But I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> Best bodygroom in the market.</li>
            <li> Has lasted me years and trims very well. Sometimes it&#x27;s easy to put it in the charger in a way that it doesn&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The main shaving and trimming parts easily break down for cleaning. It works just as well as the day I first received it which is spectacular. One charge lasts about half an hour which is plenty of time to cover a fair amount of space. I would certainly buy this again in a heartbeat and I can&#x27;t imagine shaving without it.</li>
            <li> The best mens shaver you could get.</li>
            <li> Made what used to be a pain in the groin a cinch- trim all of the things in seconds while in the shower. Would highly recommend to any guy looking for the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; manscaping tool.</li>
            <li> GREAT BODYGROOMER  -  BOTH FOR MEN AND WOMEN!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This trimmer lasted just over a year, used roughly once a month. Now it no longer takes a charge.</li>
            <li> I like it - it will save me money from purchasing razor blades.  I minus&#x27;d one star as it will pull your hair if its too long so shave often.&lt;br /&gt;It is not very good at getting edges right so I still have to use a razor blade to clean edges up, but it handles the rest of my facial hair.  Let&#x27;s see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I was not inclined to review this product at all - 1,200+ reviews is plenty - until today. Once again, this trimmer was out of juice and unable to be used. So, again, I had to use the hedgeclippers I use for my head to trim my man bush. Cue the Sabre Dance by Khachaturian. What prompted me to finally review this product is the tiny knick right at the base of my penis that won&#x27;t stop bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the original Bodygroom and it was fantastic. No more living by the seat of your pants trimming your kiwis, as the original Bodygroom advertising detailed. So, when my wife discovered, essentially, Bodygroom 2.0, it was a no brainer Christmas gift. Oh, why did I toss my old Bodygroom so hastily?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ridiculous thing can&#x27;t hold a charge. At all. I charged it for 24 hours and less than 5 minutes go by before the inevitable hum of the razor slows. And let&#x27;s say I use it for a minute. I don&#x27;t think that it will even turn on a day later. A stark comparison from the original Bodygroom which held the charge well and for the long haul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I am, with a Hello Kitty bandaid at the base of my penis. I think that&#x27;s a fair reason for a one star review. The knick, not the unfortunate choice of bandaid. While you can say, why not just wait - charge it and use it tomorrow even if it will work for a short time. Well, it&#x27;s been a week at my in-laws and my wife and I have been waiting patiently and the forest downstairs was quite overgrown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Norelco for cheaping out on the battery. I will never buy your products again.</li>
            <li> Constantly out of battery and needing to be charged.  Never seemed to work well.</li>
            <li> I had the previous model, and like any tool after learning how to use it have found that there&#x27;s really no other or better option for your \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot;.  It is a little scary to use until you get used to it, but the adjustable shaver is great - no losing attachments, and like I said, the other end on your sensitive bits just takes some time to learn.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone for grooming needs.</li>
            <li> Have it for some time    this is my third norelco product    its not perfect, nut its not bad    problem is that i lost the plastic comb  and if u order it from Philips site   it costs 20$ which is a third of the entire product    insane, not very customer friendly too.   i will definitely take that into consideration next time when i buy something    if anyone know where replacement for plastic comb can be foundpls email  malakai984@hotmail.com</li>
            <li> I Have Had This Bodygroom For 7.1 Months And I Love It.I Use It On All Parts Of My Body Including My Legs Because I &#x27;Weight Train And I Am A Track Runner.All In All This Is A Device I Should Have Had When I First Had Body Hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy. A guy that wondered for years how it was done. You know, how a man can have absolutely no hair down there (below the belt, above the knees). Did they use hair remover creams? Did they (gulp) wax? Did they pluck? Did they use electric clippers? Did they use a disposable razor? Electric shaver?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a guy that has tried his electric beard trimmer/shaver and the flip-up clippers on the back. It never turned out well. It was scary. I knicked myself every time I tried (drawing blood in the process). I liken my attempts to taking outdoor power-shears to tissue paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if your like me, you have hair you don&#x27;t want down there. It makes you sweat and smell, and it&#x27;s just plain ugly. Your skin in this region, however, is extremely soft and extremely thin. You&#x27;ve tried other methods and have given up every time (with fear of doing something horrible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So imagine my surprise (and skepticism) when I happened upon this product on Amazon. I thought; yeah right, there is no way an electric anything could shave me down there without serious harm, rash, or worse. And then I read all the wonderful reviews on this product by other Amazon customers who came before me (my favorite thing about Amazon). After reading all the positive reviews I convinced myself to just try it; and write an honest review for all the skeptic guys out there (like me) that don&#x27;t believe there really could be a device that could actually work for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first experience:&lt;br /&gt;I received my product quickly. According to the directions, it needed to be charged first - dang it! Fast forward one day; shaver fully charged. Before my shower, I sat down on my favorite throne (aka &#x27;toilet&#x27;) in the house (in my birthday suit), said a short prayer, built up my confidence, and gave it a shot. I took it slow at first, convinced it would end in disaster. And then, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes... IT WORKED! Not a knick, not a rash - just smooth hairless skin. In fact, it worked so well, so fast, I couldn&#x27;t stop myself. Which is why the top half of my thighs are also hairless now. To my surprise, to my bewilderment, this thing really works, and better than I imagined. IT REALLY DOES. The reviews on this product are TRUE! And yes, I shaved it ALL - the bolt, the nuts, the bag they came in. It&#x27;s all hairless now, and its SMOOTH. Not even stubble left behind. It&#x27;s as smooth as my face feels right after a good shave; smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. It&#x27;s an unusual feeling to have no hair down there, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days:&lt;br /&gt;Still hairless, still smooth (unlike my face which has stubble within hours of shaving). Still no rash (another surprise). I&#x27;ve noticed I haven&#x27;t sweated as much down there, and there is no longer a yucky smell after a day of activity. In fact, it&#x27;s been 2 days since my last shower, and I still actually feel kinda clean down there. Crazy, I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Guys, don&#x27;t hesitate any longer on this purchase. JUST BUY IT. If your not satisfied, just return it. But really, EVERY MAN NEEDS THIS, PERIOD. I&#x27;m baffled that this thing isn&#x27;t marketed more to men. More of us need to hear about this device. It should be taught about in school!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I am so happy I took a chance on this product. I hope every guy out there gets one of these and has the same experience I have. What more can I say? I&#x27;ll be confidently recommending this one to all my guy friends, including you guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************************&lt;br /&gt; UPDATE: SEPTEMBER 2012&lt;br /&gt;***************************&lt;br /&gt;I wrote my original review on this product in January 2011. I&#x27;ve now owned these for a total of 1 year, 8 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With exception to a shortened battery life (I have to recharge before use), it still operates and looks as good as the day I received it. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase and the price I paid.

            <li> What I like about this product is now I can trim the groin and underarm areas without any nicks or cuts very closely. I have only used this product twice so I can&#x27;t say if it lasts a long time. The having to charge it up was a little annoying however the charge lasted for me the whole time I used it (about 20 minutes at a time). Also it was a little confusing in that one end is used one way and the other end is used another way as you will see in the directions. Nevertheless the product is what I was looking for as it does what I need without any discomfort at all. I highly endorse this product.</li>
            <li> For swimmers who need a full body shave this is ideal.  Smooth shave, easy to use.  Does the trick.</li>
            <li> First off, I recieved this product faster than expected and have opned it for a couple months now.  I use it once every 3 weeks or so.  I am used to getting the cheap trimmers from Target or Walmart for under $20 - I have 2.  I figured that since I am now approaching my mid 20&#x27;s, it&#x27;s about time I step my game up to something like this so that I don&#x27;t have to keep replacing those litle cheapies on an annual basis.  Thus far, I have used this device twice, the trimming function works well, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  Since I have only used it twice, I have not yet had it diw on me mid trim (becasue you have to wait until the battery dies before charging to maintain battery life).  The only thing I must warn about is that when trying to navigate seemlessly around your beanbag area, gentlemen, the side face-up on the picture will make minor cuts here and there.  Like I said, it does the job but there are still minor improvements here and there to be made, such as the battery having to die before charging and drawing testicular inevident blood samples.</li>
            <li> This groomer is solidly built and holds a charge well. It&#x27;s waterproof -- at least shower-proof which is what I need.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this, you&#x27;re probably as excited about this product as I was, after reading all the glowing reviews of it. Unfortunately, I ignored the negative reviews, and now I wish I hadn&#x27;t.    Oh, let me tell you the ways that this product has disappointed me:    -Numero uno: The GIANT gash in an incredibly sensitive area on my body, courtesy of using the shaving end. Who ARE these other reviewers who say that it&#x27;s impossible to cut yourself with this product?! I was very, very careful with how I used the groomer. I went very slowly, followed the instructions, and did all the necessary prep. Even before I cut myself, I felt very uneasy having this groomer down there, and you might feel that way, too. My instincts told me that it was a bad idea to have something sharp, electric, and buzzing near my nads, and I should&#x27;ve listened, because my instincts were right. i figure that if I&#x27;m gay, and even I am unable to use a grooming product successfully, then there&#x27;s no hope for all the straight guys out there, and the product&#x27;s gotta be flawed. Plus, a nick or two I can understand, but seriously, my wound is definitely full-on gash status, people. Ouch. (And in case you&#x27;re curious, I tried the shaver both wet and dry. Gash was courtesy of the wet shave, and I pinched and nicked myself a couple times when using it dry. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference between the two styles. I was lucky I didn&#x27;t cut myself with it dry, too.)    -Two: The inefficiency of the shaver. Let me recreate for you what happened most of the time I used the shaver, when I wasn&#x27;t busy getting a giant cut: 1) I see a couple of short hairs, all on their lonesome, begging to be shaved. 2) I try shaving the area. 3) Nothing happens. Hairs remain standing. 4) I try a different angle. 5) Nothing happens. 6) I try a different angle again. 7) Nothing happens. 8) I try the last possible angle available to me, short of bending the space-time continuum. 9) Nothing happens. The hairs are STILL there. 10) I sigh and give up. So let me get this straight: When I use this shaver, either it cuts so close that it makes a crater in my skin, or it&#x27;s so far off that in FOUR different attempts it can&#x27;t even shave two little hairs that a normal razor could easily pick off? So wait, what&#x27;s the point of this thing?    -Three: The trimmer is decent, but could be better. As opposed to the completely useless shaver, the trimmer did have some value. I was able to trim a lot of areas on my chest, back, and no-no zone that needed some tending. And it wasn&#x27;t too much of a hassle. But I found, particularly in my groin area, that the trimmer didn&#x27;t always work. There are some odd angles down there that make it hard to bring the trimmer across the skin. This isn&#x27;t entirely the body groomer&#x27;s fault, obviously, but I figure if the thing&#x27;s job is to trim body hair (and we all know what specific region of body hair that most buyers are interested in trimming), then it better be designed in such a way as to make that a little simpler. It seems to me, though, that the trimmer head is a little too wide to be able to line up properly with areas in the groin. There&#x27;s not always a lot of surface area to work with, and the designers of the product should have accommodated that circumstance better.    -Four: Price. Enough said.    I&#x27;d really encourage you to think about what you want from this product before buying it. If you&#x27;re interested primarily in trimming hair outside of the groin, then fantastic! This is a great product for that. If you want to trim body hair and groin hair, then this is a decent product, but know that it can get a little tricky when it comes to trimming groin hair. If you want to shave close and be bare in all your unholiest places, then I think you&#x27;ll be disappointed with this product. I&#x27;ve had more success with disposable single blade razors for sensitive skin that I bought from CVS. Yes, it takes longer than a fancy and chic electric razor (I know, I was hoping to avoidthe wet shave with this groomer, too, you know), but it&#x27;ll get the job done, you&#x27;ll save some money, and you probably won&#x27;t end up with a band-aid on your balls. Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> This body groomer is awesome! It works great - close clean shave and no irritation. It gets the job done so much faster than the regular shaver. Follow the direction in the user manual and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> it is a great product. little bit on the expensive side but does what it says.    Only thing I wish is if it was waterproof.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for 2 years and still is going strong. But there are some things I have learned when cleaning up my gentleman&#x27;s sausage and veg. Only use the trim side of the razor on the body, if you use the close shave side on your skin it will get irritated even if you do use a lot of shaving cream. WARNING! what ever you do, do not use the close shave side on your veg basket, trust me once you cut yourself there you never do it again. Instead i just use a disposable razor. Another issue i have noticed is the battery power is not as strong when i bought it, but hey I cannot complain I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years, but i would say it can last for 20mins which is more than enough time for me. The reason why i gave it 3 stars is because you can only use half the product, unless your into cutting your veg basket then go right ahead. But trust me its not worth trying. Pretty much buy a disposable razor for a close shave and use this to trim... Happy Cleaning</li>
            <li> This little gadget does everything it says it can.  On one end is an adjustable clipper for trimming hair;  on the other end is the shaver head for removing all hair down to the skin.  It&#x27;s touted for use from the neck down, but I&#x27;d bet it would do a fair job of shaving one&#x27;s head, if that&#x27;s your thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lessons learned from use:  don&#x27;t press the shaver hard against the skin.  Use light pressure and make several passes (much like using a regular electric shaver on your face).  If you&#x27;re using it on an area where the skin is loose (think you know where I mean), &amp;#34;stretch&amp;#34; the skin moderately tight with one hand while using the shaver with the other.  That way, you don&#x27;t nick anything and there&#x27;s virtually no skin irritation.  The heads detach for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are specific about charging the battery.  To avoid shortening the battery charge capacity, they tell you NOT to charge it after each use.  Use it repeatedly without recharging until you see it&#x27;s indicator light flash orange - that means there&#x27;s 10 minutes of run time left and it&#x27;s time to recharge it.  When you plug the charger in, the indicator light will flash green while charging;  when fully charged, the light shows steady green.  They recommend that once or twice a year you run the unit all the way down to a dead battery and then recharge it.  I just did that (for the first time) and it fully recharged in exactly one hour as advertised.  Pretty simple.</li>
            <li> This is my shower trimmer for all body hair.  I love the ability to flip it around for trimming v. a close shave.  It glides well in every area - my chest, genital area, under my balls, across my back.  The design makes it incredibly easy to trim all of the hair from your back and shave it smoothly with just a few passes.</li>
            <li> Ah yes, manscaping. So nice when it goes right, absolutely terrible when it goes wrong. The BodyGroom Pro is a pretty good unit for any sort of trimming or shaving needed below the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimming end with the adjustable guard works OK, but not great. That&#x27;s alright though, as that is not why you&#x27;re looking at purchasing this. The shaving end cuts very close, leaving you with smooth skin after you are finished. It also works very well on the privates, which is a plus. However, if you are not careful (don&#x27;t go too fast!) you can end up nicking yourself and it hurts. This is not like an electric razor for your face; a little more finesse is needed for best results. Also, make sure to keep your skin tight and the foil flat against your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is waterproof as well, so if you prefer shaving in the shower like me, no worries. Both the foil and plastic guard pop off for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these and the batteries on both have made the product useless within a few months both times.</li>
            <li> This is one great shaver! I was very worried about this thing biting (if you know what I mean) but after using it for over a year I have become a pro! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it will get you if you are carelessly speed shaving but if you are careful you will have no problem. I will get another one if this one dies.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing! Best combo personal grooming tool I have ever owned. Sure that are better shavers and better clippers, but this thing does both well and is very versatile. Also the battery lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> Great body gromer, works as expected even after two years of purchase</li>
            <li> Best thing for your bikini line ladies!!</li>
            <li> The BodyGroom is good but the foil/shaver head does not last a year like they say it does, and it does not hold a charge for very long</li>
            <li> SENT BACK POOR QUALITY</li>
            <li> Since I have this machine, I forgot about the trouble of shaving body parts. I use it to shave mainly the pubic area and since I use this machine, the area looks clear without the red spots left by the blade shavers. Shaving other areas like in between the legs, chest and armpits is absolutely painless. The battery duration is impressive. It was definetely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Best product from Philips. Shaving yous twins is a treat with this one, no cuts no ingrows hairs. I never thought its going to be this much easy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  The trimmer works on all parts of the body without pinching, in all directions, and leaves a nice stubble length trim (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re shooting for!) at the #1/shortest setting.  The foil shaver works well too, and appears to be well made to minimize replacement foils.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t like to hold a charge. I recommend every time the charging process finishes, restart it. The more times you charge it, the longer you can use it.</li>
            <li> Words good for face ! Great Seller</li>
            <li> Durable, good and quick shave. This product does it&#x27;s job well and is made well enough so that it won&#x27;t need to be replaced</li>
            <li> Worked well for about a year then it stopped charging normally (the light ceased indicating charge level). This past weekend, I burned myself removing it from the charger and tonight I contacted Norelco for warranty service. I&#x27;m currently waiting for a call from &amp;#34;Claims Administration&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted! Good looking practical well constructed Trimmer/shaver.</li>
            <li> awesome. This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. at first I was skeptical and I was very scared to use this product in a quick manner, but now I use the trimmer to shave my genitals every 5 days with no worries or cuts or bleeding or bumps. I&#x27;ve had this thing for about 8 months, and it just works. Period.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 2 weeks....not a 5 star yet...but I think it will be....all I can say is &amp;#34;it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit almost 3 years ago, and it works as intended. The issue I am having is with the batteries. For the first year I got about 20-30 minutes of use before the unit needed to be recharged. The second year it was closer to about 15-20 minutes, but still enough time for me. The past 6 months or so I would only get about 4-5 minutes, and finally, now I get about 30 seconds. I followed the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions of not recharging until the unit was dead or almost dead (you can tell by the indicator light), but I feel like the battery should last longer than 3 years. I suppose this is how it goes though. Perhaps the pricier units will last longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a body groomer before, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  I use it once or twice a week and it does okay.  I have noticed that it still leaves a small amount of stubble behind (at least stubble that you can feel).</li>
            <li> Lets me get all my man parts with no issue. Either my old trimmer was horrible or this one is fantastic. Such a huge difference and my last trimmer was not cheap. Everything in one piece is nice.</li>
            <li> Definitely gets the job done</li>
            <li> I purchased a norelco Body Groom blah blah blah years ago when I was in London. I bought it to shave my body and maintain that shaved status for a performance. I loved that trimmer when I returned to the states I used my universal converter so I could keep using the trimmer with british plug. It died last year which really saddened me for it was great for my body and with the trimer clip it was PERFECT for trimming my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT!!! Now I have this new one and it kicks my old trimmers butt. I will always love that old trimmer but this new upgrade after the old ones death is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers smooth body friends!</li>
            <li> Works great.  very easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> Well first off, I&#x27;m not a guy but I did buy this for myself.  I was looking for a good quality razor to shave the more intimate areas and men&#x27;s products are notoriously better made than women&#x27;s.  After reading some reviews, I settled on this one.  And yes, it&#x27;s not as close as a razor shave but it feels so much safer!  I don&#x27;t have any issues with this.  The shave is fairly close, it doesn&#x27;t get hot and doesn&#x27;t hurt.  And I was concerned about getting things caught or scraping myself and that doesn&#x27;t happen.  The charge seems to last a decent amount of time as well.</li>
            <li> Works very well in the shower.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it is perfect but it works very well and gets the job done.  Using this outside of the shower is not as smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this case! Wish there was a little more protection for drops thogh</li>
            <li> 5/5 - Great trimmer. Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/5 - Okay shaver. Probably better off just getting a trimmer and not paying extra for the shaver. I normally shave with a razor but tried this electric shaver instead... took me 1.5 times as long and wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I like. I won&#x27;t be using the shaver too often on this unit.</li>
            <li> Used this to trim my body hair. I&#x27;m half Asian so I&#x27;m not very hairy, just a bit of nipple and armpit hair and some moderate growth in the crotch/anus area. It does a good job but you have to be careful when navigating around your nether regions as it will nick your nads without the guard. I had a few painful moments but those can be mitigated if you take your time. No pain, no gain, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not brave enough to try to use this on my butt crack. I originally bought this for crack clean up as I had an ex who liked to...well I won&#x27;t go into specifics but she enjoyed paying special attention down there. So I was planning on using this to make it a better, happier place for her to visit but after nicking myself grooming my crotch, no way was I gonna try to turn myself into a Chinese contortionist to groom my butt crack. We broke up a few months ago so it&#x27;s no longer a priority.</li>
            <li> The product fulfills the promised, the battery lasts a long time. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Works AWESOME! Once you get used the shaver heads it is easy to trim up the entire body. Best shaver I have owned.</li>
            <li> Really good bodygroom</li>
            <li> This Body Groom is awesome, it can be used for many applications and it can be used in the shower! I have always trusted Norelco NS once again they didn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
            <li> Love this product i just wish it will last longer or the battery  will last longer</li>
            <li> I used to use a pair of scissors and disposable razors to keep my underarms and nether regions \\&quot;hair-free\\&quot; and in the process had experienced my fair share of cuts, burns and frustration. So, in 2011 I bought this groomer after some research and haven&#x27;t had to look back since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its shape is great to hold and the pivoting head can navigate through the treacherous regions like a good 4WD off road vehicle. The charging is cord-free, and the battery has yet to give me any troubles in terms of holding its charge or running out before I was done, and it typically takes a good half an hour or more to complete one \\&quot;session\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works well for mowing the longer hair. I keep an extra pair of head, for sometimes in a pinch, I have even shaved my face with it, and it did do a pretty good job there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It truly is 100% waterproof in that I can use it in the shower and cleaning becomes a breeze. to clean the head I will sometimes take the head off and use a can of compressed air - this really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have become so accustomed to using it, that at this point this is a necessity for me. I will highly recommend it to anyone looking for an all-around groomer.</li>
            <li> This was advertised to be a clean shave, but at least for me it leaves a bit of stubble whether I use it wet or dry, against or with the grain, with or without shave lotion. I do like the trimmer side much better, great for touching up the eyebrows and &#x27;stache, just not as impressed with the shaver as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review for an, ummm, friend.  Yea, that&#x27;s it.  I would never manscape and I don&#x27;t know how this shows as being an Amazon Verified Purchase for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer has been used twice and works really well.  Battery life was more than enough for armpits, front torso and nether region.  The instructions for removing the foil were poor and I cut my finger the first time.  The easiest way that I&#x27;ve found is to put my fingernail under the grey plastic piece on one of the corners and pry/pop the foil off.  I use the trimmer end for armpits and the foil end for everything else.  The key with the foil end is to go slow and steady, keeping the skin as smooth as you can.  Also consider that a stray short-hair here and there might be an acceptable alternative to potentially drawing blood in bumpier regions.  I&#x27;ve only used it dry and believe that&#x27;s probably the easier way.</li>
            <li> This is the tool you have been looking for! Stop reading reviews and order it now. Going on a year and nothing bad to report. Easy on the nether regions.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. Have searched all over for a good quality trimmer and this really fits the description. The materials used on the build are great and I love the versatility of having the two ends dedicated to different tasks. I have used other trimmers and got cut on sensitive areas. This one didn&#x27;t get me cut and actually exceeded my expectations on trim quality.</li>
            <li> While this razor would make a great beard trimmer, it is lacking in the body trimmer section, mainly because it doesn&#x27;t provide a very close shave, especially with the buzzer side. The features it has are all well and good, the cool charging cradle works well, and it&#x27;s very nice to be waterproof, but the plastic adapter that covers the bottom part is simply too big, they need to include another one that is about half as thick, even on it&#x27;s lowest setting its leaving a significant amount of hair, and if you take it off you&#x27;re going to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> There are a couple things I don&#x27;t like. The trimmer end could have finer blades on it (I&#x27;m used to the Wahl personal grooming trimmer). Also the shaver end could be higher quality. It seems a bit cheap and I can confirm the comments about not being capable of a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;But I still like it. The dual ends is cool. I&#x27;m not into the head changing (and they usually are really cheaply made). This is a solid personal appliance. Other than the shaver foil itself, everything is well built and nice materials. I really like the brushed metal body. It&#x27;s ergonomic, and easy to handle (all around your body). Not a real good close shave, but I&#x27;m not a businessman, so it works for me.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time. Works perfectly wet or dry. Philips Norelco is my new shaving brand. Battery LED is a great feature</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for. The first time I used it I got a few cuts. The secret was to go really slowly and gently. The second time I used it did not leave any cuts just pure smooth baby skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it! You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Great improvement over the former model which was antiquated and not durable.  Highly recommend purchasing updated version and recycling earlier Norelco Bodygroom device.</li>
            <li> High-quality very versatile</li>
            <li> Keeps me in check from heat to toe.</li>
            <li> This is a great body shaver that works.</li>
            <li> I had two of these, the first got left at a hotel and I liked it enough to get another.  The second one after just a few months got really weak which means pulled hairs.  It works ok as a body groomer but the guide is too rounded to get hairs to stand up for a good cut.  I use a wahl clipper set for this task since it has a much better guard.  The shaver doesn&#x27;t work well at all unless you want to go over the same spot a bunch of times.  Finally after about 6 months the second one really started to work slow and barely take a charge before it broke completely and just got hot when put on the charger.  I bought a different groomer this time, not worth it for something that only lasted a few months at 100%.</li>
            <li> This product got the job done, but I would not say it was perfect in any way. I&#x27;m not a person paid to give a review to this product or anything, this is my honest opinion. I had long hair on my arms and armpits. I tried the trimmer part, but it didn&#x27;t work very well. I don&#x27;t think I really understand how to use the trimmer. I read the instructions, but it didn&#x27;t help. The shaver part is my favorite. It mowed down my long hairs on my legs, belly button area, arms, and armpits. However, the annoying thing is that you have to shave over the same areas multiple times. You have to look at your arm from different angles to catch hairs you couldn&#x27;t see before. Also, the lighting of the room you are in does matter. I walked out into my living room after shaving where there was natural light coming through the window and the light made hairs show up like magic that I couldn&#x27;t see before in my bathroom. It was irritating that I had to shave off the missed hairs in all these random places, but I&#x27;m some what of a perfectionist. I recommend buying it, but just be prepared to spend at least more than an hour doing a full shave if you want it looking perfect (arms, legs, armpits, feet, private area, and belly button area). As I said, it is able to get the job done, but at the expense of irritating you from time to time.</li>
            <li> Worked great just wish blades lasted longer. Provided a close shave everywhere a guy needs it. I&#x27;d recommend buying this and a few of the extra heads for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas.  He likes to shave n trip everywhere and this does the trick</li>
            <li> I get cut by this thing every time I use it on my balls. And it draws blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally write humorous reviews, just to be an a-hole. But this time I&#x27;m not kidding.</li>
            <li> the battery lasts for 1 shave, then the next time you charge it be prepared for less than 5 minutes of shave time. After that, not even 10 seconds. There is a serious internal design flaw with this product. I&#x27;ve had a replacement sent to me more than once, and each of the units have the same exact problem. I&#x27;ve asked management to contact me back, but I never heard from anyone at Norelco (plus I&#x27;ve sent all of the units back for testing. I paid about $80 for a shaving device that I got zero use out of.</li>
            <li> Because of how the trimmer sections stick out on the shaver end, I do not see how you can shave in any area that is tight without nicking yourself with the trimmer sections.  This seems like a really poor design to me. Clearly, others love this device but I do not see what they see in it. It seems well made but where those two trimmers are seems to make the shaver part unusable in tight areas, which means seeing blood.    The stand is also a dumb design. Most shavers and trimmer have just the unit itself and a cord for charging it. This gives you this nice, fold out stand. Problem is you cannot charge the device without the stand because the stand conducts the electricity. Hence, unless you love the idea of displaying your bodygroom pro on your counter, you will have to keep track of three things, not two, and get out three things, not two, when you want to charge the device.    I think the unit is well made. It&#x27;s just got design issues that make it something I wish I had not purchased.    Comes with 45 day money back warranty from Norelco.  I called to take advantage of this.  Person took all my information.  They (Norelco)  did not follow up further as they said they would.  Terrible service.     Update months later.    I tried to return to Norelco with their 45 day warranty.   Nothing. No follow through.  No money back.  The device is a loser and the company seems worse.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it multi-functionality. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> I does what it says on the box, much beter than a previous non philips model i had, and very reasonably priced. this does not catch skin and it great that you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Let me be honest with you guys. I didn&#x27;t think that this machine will be very gentle and as efficient with sensitive body parts. I bought it, took the risk, and was amazed how soft and nice the shaved area after using this machine. Don&#x27;t hesitate if you&#x27;re looking for a body shaving machine. I used in shower and sometimes before. Both ways work just perfect.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li> It says not for use above the neck line but that is the only thing I use it for. Excellent beard and moustache trimmer and the shaver keeps the parts you want smooth and clean. For those complaining about the longevity of the battery I have to wonder... Did you read the directions? Particularly the section that says once charged you&#x27;re supposed to use it until it dies before charging it again? I&#x27;m guessing you just keep it plugged in and are charging it every time it&#x27;s on the base. Tsk tsk...</li>
            <li> This thing works flawless. Does not leave any cuts and works smoothly. This is a definite buy if you want to shave your private area. I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this groomer a lot, and it is the absolute best. No issues with nicks and cuts, no matter the part of the body you use it on (manscape).</li>
            <li> Love it! The best combo for me since all I need is to trip my facial hair with one end and body hair withe guide on the other end. I no longer have to travel around with 2 different razor. Solid construction, easy to use and a zip to clean!</li>
            <li> What a great product!  On one end is a regular shaver that is great for just trimming up my body hair, and on the other end is a close shaver/foil shaver.  I can use this thing on my most sensitive areas without worrying about nicks or scratches!  The ends of the tiny cutters are rounded so they don&#x27;t let any small skin folds get in the blades and because they are rounded, they don&#x27;t scratch me either!  I have been using for a long while now, and I&#x27;m still glad I purchased this!  My girlfriend appreciates it too! :-)</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get this out of the way: this product is made for the hair that grows in places other than your head.  First, it works great as a bush whacker, no blood so that&#x27;s always a good thing.  It&#x27;s bit a few times, but no blood.  I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it will bite!&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this works great for a neck trimmer.  It cuts close enough to the skin and is good at edging.</li>
            <li> Battery last for about 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> It is not as soft and smooth as other more expensive brands but it does its job. It scratches more than others but I still use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool, and adjusts easily to trim beard, mustache and eyebrows.  I can even clean up my hairline pretty well between haircuts.  What it doesn&#x27;t do well is get things really clean in tighter and harder to reach areas (like directly under my nose).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the shave function, but the trimmer is excellent.  The only thing keeping this from getting a 5 from me is that fact that it&#x27;s large size makes it a little cumbersome.  But otherwise, great device.</li>
            <li> This is solidly constructed shaver that feels good in your hand.  The trimmer is very nice and works well.  The main shaver however suffers from a major design flaw that made me almost put this device though a window.  If you look on either side of the main cutting foil you will see unguarded trimmers.  Well, without saying too much, if the pivoting head happens to rotate down or at an odd angle for just a second then your sensitive parts meet unguarded cutting metal.  I&#x27;ll use the trimmer I suppose, but I&#x27;m going back to other methods (a regular razor is better) for other grooming.</li>
            <li> I just received this product a two days ago. Very pleased with the performance of this groomer. I should clearify that I&#x27;m male, and have been \\&quot;man scaping\\&quot; for sometime. Most recently I started to shave my legs, ( actually spilled some hair remover on my legs and liked the look so I kept going) and after all the different products: waxing, hair removel lotions, different types of electric shaver, razors, this groomer by far does the job. The results on my leg were much better then anticipated. I did not groom for a couple of weeks prior to ordering and receiving this product. I only had to do a small touch up the following day. I was able to reach most of my back which has always been a problem. Only wish it come with a 2-3 inch attachment on the handle to make it easier.    Note: Shave in different directions. This worked the best for me. Also, did not use in shower. Think it works better when hair is dry.    Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the Body Groom Pro and the features it has.  I have used&lt;br /&gt;it a number of times.  I like it&#x27;s unique  features and how easy it&lt;br /&gt;is to use</li>
            <li> As the title says, I used these about four times a month for 24 months and now the battery won&#x27;t make it through a single beard trimming, even after being on the charger for days.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both like this product. Haven&#x27;t had any issues other than trying to figure out how to clean it. Much better than other similar products.</li>
            <li> the only con so far after two uses is that the foil blade seems to not cut very well, especially in the shower. thats a small price to pay for awesome though.</li>
            <li> I just got this product delivered today and while I was reading through the cleaning instructions....I tried to remove the head as directed for cleaning ....but there does not seem to be an easy way to pull it of..&lt;br /&gt;you have to be careful that you don&#x27;t damage the foil and also accidentally don&#x27;t hit the shaving button while pulling the head off....I really liked the product...but ...not the design....&lt;br /&gt;May be this order which I received could have a flaw in it...so...Im not sure....I am returning this product back...</li>
            <li> Been using for three weeks or so and it is amazing. I spent a loooong time reading reviews and finally decided on this one, still with some worries about negative reviews. However, right when I used it, I fell in love. Note to others: When you read reviews of people chopping up their area below their stomach and complaining that it was the razor&#x27;s fault, it probably was not. If you&#x27;re going to be shaving down there, you have to be careful... simple as that. If you don&#x27;t have great motor skills, then I personally wouldn&#x27;t attempt to shave down there.    I also used this on my face. I know it says not to, but like I said before, if you are careful it will be fine. I was able to clean up those pesky single hairs that my normal Braun electric razor could not get.    Have not had any problems with the battery. I do not use this everyday, so I know that factors in there somewhere. If you are looking to get a close enough shave that feels smooth, this works. If you are looking for baby bottom smooth, ditch the razors and just use Nair.    Good luck to those deciding</li>
            <li> I agree with the people who rate this lowly because of almost cutting off their balls, I would never suggest using this product to shave your junk; however, as a body shaver it works most excellently.  It made quick work of my Sasquatch back hair, and was long enough that I could reach all areas of my back without assistance from the wife.</li>
            <li> Tried many body groomers, this by far is the best. Easy to use, comfortable, no snags...lasted about 2 years, buying another right now.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, only complaints is that I like to have a longer length setting for the beard trimmer, and the stand is a little easy to tip over.</li>
            <li> Me cortaba alguna veces</li>
            <li> Does a great grooming job, just need to be careful as then edges can sometimes nick, charges fast and the charge lasts a while</li>
            <li> Who knew hair grew in so many different places other than your head? This product works great. The two kinds of trimming functions help with the . . . uh . . . various regions of your body. Everything works well and there&#x27;s been no problem using it in the shower. The battery lasts plenty long. It&#x27;s easy to grip and use even when wet. I&#x27;ve had very few hair-snagging issues with it, which my body is thankful for.</li>
            <li> Overall I am impressed with this trimmer. A little on the high side as far as price, however once you use it you&#x27;ll know where your money went. Easy to use and clean. I have had several trimmers over the years, and this has to be the best I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaves almost as close as a razor, without the bumps caused by blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this trimmer to anyone looking for a quality body hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver, awesome design allows for quick trimming and comfortable skin afterward. The charge lasts a long time and is really quick to refill at just around an hour.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to get a trim without the horror of scissors and exposed razors. It&#x27;s water proof, which makes it perfect for use in the shower.</li>
            <li> This unit runs well and the battery charge is excellent although if you are looking for a close shave, forget about it. Body groomer in my mind meant no more disposal razor shaving for my sensitive skin. This shaver is really designed for trimmiing up the chest , legs, and back on hairy individuals (trimming being the key word here). I shave my skin smooth for athletic purposes and dealing with the summer heat at work. If this describes you, don&#x27;t buy an electric body groomer at all and find some really good sensitive skin shave cream plus a fairly expensive razor because this will give you the best results. So in summary, motor great, battery great, comfort so-so, usefulness not so good.</li>
            <li> great machine and the battery lasts for a very long time. When the light starts to flash, it still runs strong</li>
            <li> I am a female and was looking for a personal shaver.  I love this one and am happy with the purchase.  It is easy to use and goes over personal areas very gently.  I have never had a knick or cut with this shaver.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t give a soft smooth shave.  It gives a very close cut and does the job but it is a bit rough after the shave.</li>
            <li> this is the first body grooming sistem that i can use with totally confidence that i will no get hurt... very high recommended</li>
            <li> Product works well.  Sometime rough especially around the edges. can leave irritation marks.  it takes a long time to get smooth skin on abdomen.</li>
            <li> Does the job as described with minimum nicking AND its waterproof. Good charge, design results.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco Bodygroom BG2040 is fairly large. It has a good nonslip grip, that works well even in the shower. While the grip works in the shower, the trimmer itself had lack luster performance when wet. It worked well while dry. It cut hair evenly and has not nicked my skin, even in sensitive areas. The adjustable trimmer length is a nice feature. This product has been very easy to clean. I haven&#x27;t had to charge it beyond the initial charge yet, but I have only used it a few times so far. I would recommend this trimmer, however it is a bit pricey for a body groomer.</li>
            <li> My fiancée got me this for Christmas and I love it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to shaving my body with a regular blade razor. I am a runner so this helps with chaffing and I am now able to shave whenever I desire. Since I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream or even be in the shower, this is extremely helpful for quick touchups on the fly and convenient. Performance is excellent. I never realized that a smooth shave on the body in any area was possible with an electric razor, but with this one, it is. I&#x27;ve gotten great results and would recommend it to anyone trying to stay smooth without all the hassles. Great product and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to use mainly like a regular electric razor. I typically don&#x27;t shave off all of my facial hair. I usually use a Beard trimmer to shave down to stubble. My wife would like me to shave off all the stubble more often. Even though the instructions state not to use the foil shaver above your neck, I have been using it on my face and it works good.    I like the fact that the shaver and trimmer are built into one device. I can shave smooth or use the trimmer to shave down to short stubble. To shave smooth, I have always used a Norelco 3 head shaver, AND a beard trimmer first to shave close enough so the razor can then be used without going over and over longer facial hair. The shaver on this product has a small beard trimmer blade on either side of the foil shaver. That makes it possible to use the shaver head only to get a close shave even when you start out with longer stubble.</li>
            <li> the trimmer on the bottom is nice. the double sided trimmer on top was a stupid design. it is hard to trim a beard without hitting other hairs and messing up.</li>
            <li> I had BG2020 model before and this is like night and day. Works excellent on all body parts! I would highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> I shave my torso with this, and so far it is good battery last long and I am pleased with it. I just keep writing more because i am trying to reach the minimum limit... 2030 the one model down is equally good.</li>
            <li> actually I give this tool to friend and he was very happy with it and like it very much. Its very flexible and handy.</li>
            <li> This product is also works well. I used it once and had no issues at all. I like this product too.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, I&#x27;m so glad I bought it. Used to use a $10 razor that I had to recharge for every use and it was just junk. Decided I need to upgrade and this is what I chose because I could use it for practically everything. One end is great for shaving my face, and the other end is great for trimming hair on my body, even the lower extremities. Plus, it&#x27;s waterproof. Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Shape is perfect for reaching the pesky lower back hair - you can reach all the way, almost to your spine. I&#x27;m not a hairy guy back there, but it found some strays!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, &#x27;A friend of mine&#x27; told me not to use the flat end on your &#x27;berries&#x27;. That skin is awfuly thin and gets caught. At least thats what my friend told me</li>
            <li> Great product.Love it. Very good for sensitive skin and shaving close without any shaving cream. Would buy another one if this one broker for any reason.</li>
            <li> A great tool for the obvious ---- there are many things out there but this is versatile, water resistant and sharp without any nicks on the nooks and the battery holds a super long charge.  I made the right choice on this tool.</li>
            <li> Good:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-Can be used while in the shower&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;-None at this point&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended?&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this has eliminated the need to groom outside of the shower, and thus, the need to clean up.</li>
            <li> Nice for body shaving. Better than i expected.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very happy,the transaction was veri excellent,the item is very very good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. To date I have never experienced a nick. Gets the job done. Removes the hair completely. Norelco does it completely.</li>
            <li> Just as many reviewers (who initially convinced me to try this groomer) have said, this thing works wonders. Gone are the days spent nurturing wounds in &amp;#34;delicate areas&amp;#34; due to razors, scissors, etc. While you do need to take your time with this groomer around sensitive regions, it is forgiving and rarely hurts (generally only if I begin to rush or apply excessive pressure). The trimmer on the side opposite the shaver is very handy for shortening leg hair, etc. without actually removing it all. This groomer makes it easy to get clean down there, and makes the experience much less painful, not to mention the results are much better. Seriously, try this out!</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations.  Grooming my beard to specific length was easy and comfortable.  Shaving smooth my chest hair using the foil end was a little scary at first, but I became very comfortable after a few strokes.  My arm pits were next and although I have extremely thick hair there, i was very surprised with the outcome.  I will not shave the pits again, as there is other issues with that area, i will only trim there and feel confident this unit will do well.  I moved to my lower area where I am smooth also.  Using the foil end is ok,  I prefer using a regular razor there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is the charging set up.  It took a while to figure out how to even get the 7100 plugged in.  Seems to be unstable sitting in the charging holder.  That could use a little more engineering.</li>
            <li> This is not for shaving facial hair but is instead a body groomer primarily designed for men. The trimmer work great and works particularly well for trimming leg hair (different lengths can be selected) or bushy chest hair. The flip side is awesome for shaving neck and back hair or virtually any other hair below the nape of the neck. It can safely be used almost anywhere, except it indicates it&#x27;s not made for the face or private areas. I love it because it can be used safely and without help from mom by a teen boy to trim long leg hair if that&#x27;s an issue. It&#x27;s rechargeable and also cordless, which makes it so easy to control without a cord getting in the way. It&#x27;s caused no irritation in any places where it has been used by my teen son and husband. It&#x27;s a high quality bodygroomer and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The battery won&#x27;t hold a charge after 3 months. Shopping for a different brand now, as this is my second unit that&#x27;s failed me in the same time period...expensive junk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy guy. From head to feet and everywhere in-between. Most of the time it doesn&#x27;t bother me except when I wear a collared shirt with chest hair popping out or a short sleeve shirt with arms that look like they need combing. The thought of taking a razor to my body didn&#x27;t sound manly. (give me the old James Bond not the new clean boys)&lt;br /&gt;But, I thought maybe a little trim would be okay. So, I purchased this great little Norelco BodyGroom and I&#x27;m as happy as a cat in a seafood store. It&#x27;s adjustable so I can trim as much or as little as I please. It&#x27;s gentle enough around the manly areas so don&#x27;t worry about that. I clean myself up every few months and feel great. And, one end is a regular razor so I can give myself a quick shave when in a hurry. All and all a great purchase for me.</li>
            <li> I have used it now for 3 years and it still delivers as new! Never had any cuts or nicks with this groomer. The titling head is a very good feature. The battery life is also great. All in all, thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> I have bought two of these, and neither worked for very long.  The first one stopped working for no reason after about 8 months. I bought a second in November last year.  Now after 5 months, the blade is so dull it wont cut hair.  I will not be buying another Norelco.</li>
            <li> The best trimmer I have used! This has been a great purchase for me, no nicks or cuts.This trimmer works great for trimming all body hair I will recommend this to anyone looking for a trimmer.</li>
            <li> battery lasts a long time.  Versatile.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done for the most part. I find it difficult to get all the private area shaved as it doesn&#x27;t cut all the hair down there. As other reviews mention, be VERY careful in this area. If you have just the slightest wrong angle, it will nick ya down there and make you say things you shouldn&#x27;t. Hair everywhere on every use.  The end with the close shave/foil end falls off very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: battery life is great. Doesn&#x27;t take long to recharge it, but it lasts days and days before having to recharge it.</li>
            <li> shaves the husband&#x27;s back with ease...best on the market and worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li> Does exactly as advertised! Do be careful, sometimes excess skin may get caught up, especially the really sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes off really easily to wash, and so far works like a charm during warm showers.</li>
            <li> The bodygroom norelco is okay.my only problem about this is the guard included has is not applicable for small hairs</li>
            <li> I wish the trimmer part was a little wider.  I use this tool for my bald head and not body.  I works great.  I like the lithium battery.  It seems to last much longer than my old nimh.  It should be much better to travel with too.</li>
            <li> Battery is very bad. Does not hold more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to splurge and get my husband a nice razor for Christmas. The razor itself is a great quality - has lasted him over a year. However, unless this razor is plugged in all the time, it will die on you halfway through your shave. Make sure you have an outlet you can designate to this if you decide to purchase.</li>
            <li> Shaves good and the pros end there. I have bought 3 of these and they continue to fail. You cant leave them on the charger or they will fail to hold a charge in the future and become paper weights. If left on the charger they will die after 3-5 minutes of use. Complete junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are we expected to set an alarm to remind us to remove this thing from the charger? Sorry I dont have time or desire to do that. I have a lot of different clippers and trimmers and they all have batteries that can be left charging without completely dying. Change the battery type and the product will be a solid 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another model that uses the same head that I got as a set at Costcos. I recommend that over this product. That version hasnt died yet and I have left it charging.</li>
            <li> This is ok, but not great, the shave isn&#x27;t that great and it cut my pelvic area.</li>
            <li> Coming from a plug in buzzer, this is great,</li>
            <li> Does everything I need to, and works great in the shower.  My only problem is sometimes I go a little overboard with the body grooming...</li>
            <li> Excellent product. 100 % recommended!</li>
            <li> After reading a couple of the customer reviews I was a little concerned regarding performance. After receiving the product and following the directions closely I had no problems at all and the product performed well and as described by the manufacturer. I am pleased that I made this purchase. I am pleased that I will no longer have to suffer razor burn or irritation again.</li>
            <li> Easy safe body shaving&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it always</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle. Excellent trimming without the worry of a knick where you don&#x27;t want it!</li>
            <li> Best personal groomer! Quickly and easily cleans up below the waist with no nicks or cuts. Bodygroom has been my choice for over 12 years.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my friend. He loves it and uses it on a regular basis. Money well spent</li>
            <li> I had been contemplating this purchase for awhile, and finally made a decision when the price was right. Best purchase. Works wet or dry, all over, head to toe, and everywhere in between! No knicks or cuts, easy to use. The right tool for the job.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has very thick coarse hair and would have to shave everyday. Now with this razor he only shaves twice a week and gets a close shave. I haven&#x27;t seen him this happy with a razor ever! Lol! Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this!</li>
            <li> This is far and away the best groomer you can purchase and not feel ripped off. Does EVERYTHING a good groomer should do and then some.</li>
            <li> Well made and great product. Great for trimming unsightly body hair and leaves the skin smooth. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to try one of these, because I figured how can you return something like this after you&#x27;ve tried it out?  I was happy it gave a close shave both in and out of the shower.  Easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> It´s worth it´s price!  no other product I have tried had work as well as this one.  If you body groom very often this is the product for you.  Don&#x27;t take any risk if you are grooming your private parts, with this one you do it secure and fully confident!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a product to keep the genital organs in the shower as advertised. It takes care of initial hair trimming with no problem. If you want to totally remote pubic hair - you will find you are left with a stiff stubble that ultimately needs to be shaved with cream in the old fashioned razor. I would not recommend the product based on its cost and results.</li>
            <li> Great for shaving the man region.</li>
            <li> My Philips Norelco BG2040 Body Groom Pro is a pretty fair tool for shaving my back and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;Even with the more than average length it still is a little difficult to reach all areas. I am getting more&lt;br /&gt;dexterious as I adapt to the groomer. I still don&#x27;t know how to pull the head off in order to clean. I am meeting&lt;br /&gt;with much resistance so am reluctant to pull to the extent of breaking the unit. My rating will probably get better&lt;br /&gt;once I am more familiar and skillful with the groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You</li>
            <li> My husband likes it because it does get very close to the surface and stays smooth for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how well this product works.  I am very glad I bought this and so is my wife!</li>
            <li> This thing does a very good job.  Only complaint is that it loses a charge pretty quick.  I end up rotating body parts that need trimming.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer.  No nicks and cuts.  Safe for all body parts.</li>
            <li> Works okay.. I&#x27;m neither disappointed nor overly excited about the product..</li>
            <li> This groomer has a nice, solid feel and is very easy to use and clean.  I started out with the trimmer, then the shaving head (groomer).  Shaves nice and close leaving a smooth surface.  Just take your time while shaving.  I did not feel any pulling or experience any irritation.  The instructions are rather sketchy as far as removal of the shaving foil head.  The diagram is very vague but the directions do mention to hold the shaving head from the plastic housing only.  Just take your time and think before pulling off the shaving head.  Once you have an understanding of what they are trying to convey, it is a breeze to remove.  The groomer comes complete with a charging stand and charges the groomer within one hour.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews both positive and negative. I have used Norelco products for many,many moons. I can remember my dad&#x27;s Norelco Razor on the bathroom counter as I was growing up. My first electric razor was a Norelco. I ordered this because of my history with Norelco. One time I had gotten a competitors brand razor and had a bad experience with it,so went back to Norelco Brand and haven&#x27;t left. This groomer is an excellent product and is absolutely painless and has a solid feel and very comfortable to use. I give it a thumbs up in style and use!!![[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Philips Norelco Bodygroom Pro Grooming System, Black / Silver]]</li>
            <li> Let me just start out by saying \\&quot;where has this thing been all my life\\&quot;? As a former bodybuilder and a lifelong advocate of the hairless look, I have been in various stages and phases of shaving parts or all of my body for the past 30 years! All I can say is how many hours could I have saved over the years had this thing been around? I shudder at the thought, but it would be a LOT!!!!! Probably weeks of my life all together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing works great! Where it really shines is taking down a full blown hairy area, and getting you down to smooth. What used to take hours (like my legs for example, after they were grown out for winter) is literally done in minutes now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintaining areas is a breeze, and I have never had any issues with cuts or nicks.&lt;br /&gt;I would advise to use wet, and with some light soap for lubrication, as that seems to work the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;As long as you are sensible, and don&#x27;t put the side trimmers at a right angle to your skin, you will never even feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now back to the entire body smooth look and have to say with this shaver it is an easy task. Otherwise it was just too much work to try and maintain. Plus now I never have to deal with ingrown hairs or other bad side effects of the razor, on areas that don&#x27;t like to be shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just get it...it is money well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Update.I have been using for over a year now and it it still works great! I have dropped it numerous times now in the shower, and no problem. But, the last time I dropped it it hit just right and bent the blade head. I was probably due for a new one soon anyway, but just a warning to watch it and be careful in slippery conditions.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer. Only problem is that the trimming comb broke after 6 months of use.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Philips Norelco Bodygroom Pro Grooming System, Black / Silver]]This product is great value for money and does exactly what it says on the box. I have used it for the last 3 months and it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Been using the bodygroomer for over a year and so far it&#x27;s made my hair related tasks much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beards - This has been a great tool for keeping my beard neat and even without letting myself go full blown scare the women away with my mass of scary face hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below the belt - Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. This isn&#x27;t the end all be all to making your junk pretty but it will do a lot of the heavy lifting down there. If you have a good hour to kill you could probably get everything to an ideal state but you will probably still need to go in with the razor for some fine tuning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Current battery life I cannot tell. I have never used it till the battery died in the entire year I&#x27;ve had it. I use it weekly but I also finish up my hair tasks in about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend. It&#x27;s now apart of my regular man grooming.</li>
            <li> Been using the Bodygroom for a few months now and I really like it.  Gets a nice clean, smooth shave with ZERO bumps or razerburn.  Good job Norelco!  Battery life is quite impressive as well.  If you&#x27;re on the fence...just get it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love it. Easy. Good battery.</li>
            <li> Great products and is easy to use.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  It allows you to clean up and look smooth and hair free in a short time.</li>
            <li> I have been using the BodyGroom for several years now and is the best thing since slice bread for manscaping.</li>
            <li> This is the best body groomer on the market. I have had at least three groomers and this Norelco is the best.</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my junk. It does the job well, it&#x27;s like a turtle shell down town these days.&lt;br /&gt;The battery last a long time between charges, it&#x27;s water proof and super easy to rinse off. Do yourself and those you love a favor and buy one of these.</li>
            <li> stopped working after 2 months</li>
            <li> Husband was very happy with the purchase.  Shipped quickly and operates as expected.</li>
            <li> This is much better than the old version. Quieter, less painful, and more convenient with the attached clippers. Definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shavers I&#x27;ve used. Works great both in and out of the shower. You just have to be careful around the sensitive areas. Especially when using the trimmer. Against bare sensitive skin it can cut you.</li>
            <li> Works great for Man scaping does the job still need to be careful at ground &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;. But does great job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my first time to buy a body groom, and tbh this one is amazing. it really feels like a high quality product and it does the job right, just go ahead and get it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. Nothing has worked for me to get rid of the &amp;#34;itch.&amp;#34; After using this, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve been hairless &amp;#34;there&amp;#34; and have had no itch. It&#x27;s freaking awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET THIS. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This thing is very frustrating. Something that I wish worked and was easy to man-scape isn&#x27;t helping and just causing head-aches. It doesn&#x27;t cut body hair good at all even when you trim it down before shave. and you have to pass multiply times to get all the hairs, plus it does knick the skin on occasion. Hairs get caught in the blades and trimmers.</li>
            <li> Boy o Boy does this hurt my balls!!</li>
            <li> Let me cut to the chase. I bought this cause of a review stating that it was an amazing personal ball hair cutter. They were not wrong. It is amazing!</li>
            <li> Works great!!! Trimmer works better dry but the shaver is great in the shower.</li>
            <li> Finally got one of these after looking around for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy I chose this one. Everything works perfectly and just like I wanted it to. You&#x27;ll of course get the best results when you take things slow when using this. I got no cuts or knicks at all when using this on every single square inch of the privates area. Haven&#x27;t used it in the shower yet so I&#x27;m not sure if that will be better or not for me. Overall, I&#x27;m very glad I got this since other shavers in the past had always cut me and took much longer to make everything just right and nowhere as good as this does. This does everything very quickly and makes everything come out just about as close as shaving using a razor. Like others have said, it is \\&quot;shaft, sack, and starfish\\&quot; safe. Extremely happy, great results! Just gotta make sure you follow the instructions to keep this great manscaping tool working for as long as possible. Holds the battery charges pretty good too.</li>
            <li> This little bad guy is amazing, shaved my nuts in the shower in under five minutes. Want to get rid of the gorilla salad? This is the solution!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and he loves it. It cuts his body grooming in half with a close quick shave.</li>
            <li> I had the original Bodygroom (no longer sold) and loved how it worked for over 6-7 years.  I bought replacement heads and it continued working.  Finally, the mechanism that holds the foil unit in place gave out and I decided to re-up and get a new one and went with the Pro, thinking it would be better than the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing better is that it had the trimmer attached, which I use often to trim my beard (and it does a very good job of this).  The foil side has cut me often in some sensitive places.  I used to be able to trim the verge quite easily and quickly with the old model.  With this one, I have to go super slow and I still will find myself bleeding where a man doesn&#x27;t want to be bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for a better alternative.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he kept saying he wanted an electric body shaver that he could get slightly wet. When he first received it he was a bit unsure but now that he has had time to actually use it he really likes it. He has used it in the shower as well and it works very well. The charge seems to last a long time and we have had no problems with it at all.</li>
            <li> Meh. Trimmer really not so great.</li>
            <li> This product is great and safe for under arms private areas. It is not razor sharp close. But it does cut the hairs pretty well and makes you look good</li>
            <li> this is a very good razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;even though others say you cant use it for mustache and beard areas, i have had great luck in those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over all a great buy.</li>
            <li> Updated Review:&lt;br /&gt;My excitement was short-lived. Just over an year after I purchased it, the trimmer part is dead, though the groomer works fine. Now I have to go ahead and purchase another trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier review:&lt;br /&gt;I am a happy customer. Loving it. Design is perfect and the performance is top notch. I had bad experience with shavers and body groomers earlier, but wanted to give them another shot and researched quite a lot, reading all the reviews about different groomers. I picked Norelco based on reviews and I am happy i did!</li>
            <li> Works as described, haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. Works great! would but again. Just go slow and you will have no issues. Trim down with sides then use the flat shaver head.</li>
            <li> This machine is honestly a godsend. It makes the shaving of your balls, ass, and taint incredibly easy and convenient. I think I nicked myself once while shaving the pubes, but it certainly didn&#x27;t hurt much and within a minute I corrected myself and haven&#x27;t nicked much since. Having both an electric trimmer and shaver on one razor is incredibly convenient, and given how quickly and effectively this thing works I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The Body Groom Pro is a solid trimmer, the weight and solid feel are just right for long trimming and grooming sessions. The trimmer has five length settings that work well and lock into place fairly secure (you can make it slip with excess pressure) and holds well under normal use. The rounded edges of the guard, on the trimmer, slide smoothly over skin without scratching or pinching. Trimming of body hair (after your initial grooming) only takes two quick passes to maintain your desired results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil shaver does an adequate job; the shaver does leave some stubble behind but it is only noticeable if someone is a foot away from you. The results for the shaver may be better under wet conditions but I only use my Body Groom Pro outside the shower, so I can&#x27;t speak to the results it provides under wet conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit holds a long charge; I have achieved 50-60 minutes of run time between charges (which will give you 3 or 4 trimming sessions before the need to recharge). The charger works fast; the charger only takes about an hour to fully charge and you&#x27;re ready for another 50-60 minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, cleaning is also quick and easy. Both the trimmer and foil shaver open easily (including the removable guard) and only take about a minute to clean.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of getting a close shave around the next and back.</li>
            <li> The shaver part doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I would like and requires multiple passes even when I move slowly.  Also if the shaver was 2 inches longer it would be easier to do the back.  Luckily I have long arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned quite a few different trimmers in the past five years. My wife dislikes body hair just as much as I do and this trimmer makes it easy to keep it all under control. I&#x27;m very happy that I went ahead and purchased this trimmer and in the next few years, if it lasts that long, I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd different Phillips Norelco BodyGroom and am very pleased with this. I use this for body grooming as well as shaving my face with it every day as it isn&#x27;t as harsh as a strait razor.</li>
            <li> Best body groomer I ever used.  Does an excellent job.  Smooth shave without irritating delicate skin.  Easy to use.  Top quality product.  Highly recommended without reservation.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a man groomer.  This is the best.  I have read several reviews of this product and the ones like it.  It works great on my beard and mustache and my man parts.  It is not a face shaver as the design is different then face shavers.  The shaver on both sides are easy to clean and it feels good in your hand; the opposite side does not interfere with the other side.  It is impossible to have both operating at the same time. This item was truly engineered as a man groomer.  Would buy again if I have too.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth it to upgrade to this version of the BodyGroom, over the cheaper versions. I used to own the basic version, and in order to cut to a length, you had to clip one of three cheap plastic covers that were hard to take off and broke or got lost easily. This version has an additional setting and doesn&#x27;t require any extra parts. It is also a sturdier product that feel better in the hand and looks better, with the stainless finish, too.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are that it is a little hard to take apart to clean, and the folding charging stand sometimes collapses on itself.</li>
            <li> Something my husband likes to use.  It works in both the shower or at the sink.  He didn&#x27;t complain about it pulling like some of the other electronic shavers we have tried.</li>
            <li> Consistent with those who suffered a battery/charge problem with this unit, my battery died as well. Did work well while it lasted but I won&#x27;t buy again for fear of premature battery death. Lasted less than 5 months.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best razor out there . even just for a trim.. n not full shaved ..amazing alll around body groomer</li>
            <li> As the product name states this trimmer is great for the whole body. At least on one end. I wouldn&#x27;t use the shaver in really sensitive areas but once you get the hang of it you can get a very smooth finish. I would recommend to any man keeping a beard full and neat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of body groomers and this one is the best by far. The pivoting head provides a comfortable shave in curvy areas. As a pilot, I am on the road more often than not. After a full charge at home, I am good for 10+ day trips.</li>
            <li> Nice design, holds a charge really well, does seem to do a decent enough job of facial hair trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;shaving head&amp;#34;, they recommend taking it off and cleaning it  out after usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All well and good, and I did figure out how to do that, but getting the thing back on again, or to stay on again... was and continues to be an annoyance.  Doesn&#x27;t really seem to &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; that well into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other side, haven&#x27;t messed overly with body hair trimming, but for a &amp;#34;beard trimmer&amp;#34;, I like to get to almost a five o&#x27;clock shadow look when I trim up my beard and mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard that they have that is in place precludes getting a &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; look,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an old trimmer (19.00) one that I got at Walmart and am toying with getting another of that brand.  (no, don&#x27;t have the brand name on hand).  It&#x27;s cheap, but the last one I had lasted a good 3-4 years before it ate through the razor guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, here it is Philips/Norelco Allin1 Grooming Kit (G485, G480)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issues I had with that unit was that it wore through the guard, but that was as I say after several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a nice looking thing if nothing else.</li>
            <li> This is a great product it shaves everything and then the other side is a trimmer for things like armpits I love this no problem at all, and its actually waterproof.</li>
            <li> This gets everything. I&#x27;m not really worried about cutting myself, and there&#x27;s a lot less razor burn than regular razors. If you want smooth, hairless skin, but you&#x27;re tired of the hassle of shaving, this is for you. I trust this thing pretty much everywhere.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine, no nicks or cuts. The razor side is a mean machine, I reckon it could remove bunions at 20 paces if misused.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is a slightly different story, it does the job, but I find I&#x27;m not getting as close a trim as I would like with it set on number 1. This might of course just be down to my technique and I&#x27;ll be adjusting that to see if it makes any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the instructions leaflet quite bewildering and confusing, not helped by such small print and diagrams, and that was with my reading glasses perched across my snozzle.  I still can&#x27;t work out how to remove the trimmer for cleaning, the diagram doesn&#x27;t seem to bear any relation to the instrument in my hand, and nothing seems to give as one would assume would be the case according to the leaflet. The razor side does remove easily , but again to my mind the diagram is not as realistic as I would like.</li>
            <li> Awesome except for the fact that the trimmer sides adjustable length piece is bendy plastic. What happens when bendy plastic is pushed against something? Oh that&#x27;s right, it bends. Guess what happens when your trying to cut your hair to the same length with a bendy plastic measurement tool? Oh that&#x27;s right, you get mixed length cuts all over. Terribly stupid design flaw in an otherwise great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result I only ever use no length or the lowest length (rests against trimmer surface) to guarantee accuracy.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is good shaver is ok</li>
            <li> I love it and would give it 5 stars if I could shave my face with it. Unfortunately my beard is took thick and too coarse for this razor.</li>
            <li> This body groom is really good, but after few moths the battery had problem, but I bought the same one again because I like it</li>
            <li> Works great... Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a shaver would but still...</li>
            <li> This is probably the greatest thing ever invented. If they double the price tomorrow you should still buy it without a thought.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, have used a couple times ,1st use was good it seemed quit tame and  up on the 2nd use it sounded a little aggressive so I have not used on the boys just around them, which I am still satisfied with .</li>
            <li> This razor is the ideal concept, however, it lacks in function. The longest charge this razor has held was 15 minutes prior to needing a full recharge. Also, the shave head constantly falls off the unit when using the razor end.</li>
            <li> Well, I used it for the first time today. I followed all the instructions (I even saw a review on youtube about the specifications and things alike) and I can say its a good and safe product to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not 5 stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, in my humble opinion, nothing can beat a normal (but good quality) razor to shave down there. I did use it carefully and nothing bad happened. No cuts, no pain whatsoever.. but I feel its more work for an ok result, not a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most ppl dont use it in the shower.. well, I did since its easier to clean the mess. I will definitely try it while being dry the next time because I might get better results that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is awesome.. I dont know why ppl says its a bad idea to combine the trimmer and the shaver. They both work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I still think a razor does a better job when it comes to shave duty and its less expensive and faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it wasnt for the trimmer I would be dissapointed.. specially since its not a cheap product. Dont get me wrong, the shaver is nice, but I guess a was hoping for a miracle shaver... a product that I could use like it was soap to shave everywhere no problemo. Maybe this product is perfect and I&#x27;m just asking for too much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing.. this product might be perfect for a hairy guy.. I&#x27;m not one of them, so that might be the reason why using normal razors are better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this was helpfull!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
            <li> Threw my braun away, this thing is great.  Long battery life, waterproof for shower use, and hasn&#x27;t done much damage yet.  You can&#x27;t just whilly-nilly jam it into your more sensitive areas, but if you&#x27;re careful, it&#x27;ll do just fine.</li>
            <li> I read all the glowing reviews on here and was super excited to try this out. I was really sodas pointed when I got it. I tried both dry and wet, and both times the trimmer failed to get any significant amount of hair. The clipper end did better, and got most of the busy bits out, but the trimmer just couldn&#x27;t finish the job, even on my legs, which should be easy.</li>
            <li> Meh.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving end doesnt shave completely at all, im serious. A regular razor will LITERALLY do a better job at shaving than this!! I laugh at that fact alone on how ridiculous of a rip off it is. If youre looking for a clean shave, trust me, this isnt it.&lt;br /&gt;As for the shaver and the trimmer combo, thats a plus for me. At least now i have a trimmer i can use. (Trimmer isnt the best either.. i feel like there are better trimmer out there for a better deal too)&lt;br /&gt;If you dont mind going over the same spot 5-10 times to get that clean shave, by all means get it. But honestly, while ur at it, buy a better one.. bleh i cant emphasize it enough.</li>
            <li> Plain and simply put without beating around the bush. (see what I did there?) This is the best male ball, taint, ass shaver in the business.  If you guys want the truth there it is.  Leaves no rash afterward.  Doesn&#x27;t cut you although you don&#x27;t want to rough house the jewels either.  Very smooth to use in shower or just sitting on the toilet and going at it.  If you have the amazon jungle down there use the trimmer first then finish it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to any guy who has a lady friend who loves it when the balls are smooth as silk and there is no risk of a cough up.</li>
            <li> This works as advertised. Definitely not for the face though. Anywhere else this does the trick better than any of the others i have tried. Well worth trying it out as long as you remember to take your time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband and he loved it it is awesome and you do not have to use a razor .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I bought this product as an upgrade to the previous model. I liked the previous model, but it broke on me after only a few months where the head attaches. So I was glad this model had the double sided setup, cause that means no more changing heads and risking parts breaking on you. However, on this model they added a swivel to the shaving side head, which in my opinion makes it more difficult to shave the hard to reach areas because somethings always swiveling away from where you want it to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find that the shaver doesn&#x27;t cut quite as close (or quite as good/efficiently) as the previous model. I find myself having to go over areas more than I would on the other model to get the same result. But other than that it&#x27;s still the best groomer you can find right now. If you have the older model and it&#x27;s still working great, I see no reason to upgrade to this. But if you&#x27;re deciding between the 2, this one is worth getting just for the dual head feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And perhaps in the next model they&#x27;ll make a lock switch so you can decide when you want the head to swivel or not.</li>
            <li> You can get cheaper clippers elsewhere.  I purchased similar clippers on Ammazon that were cheaper and will last my entire lifetime.</li>
            <li> First time using it and I used it on my &amp;#34;personal area&amp;#34;. Well, It&#x27;s not that sharp. It hurt me once while I was using it on my balls. Trust me, you don&#x27;t want to taste that pain. All I can say is just really take time. Keep slowly.</li>
            <li> This is most definitely the best Bodygrooming device that I have used. Very easy to use, well constructed body shaver at a fairly reasonable price. I have given the Norelco Bodygroom 2040 a Five star rating based upon the results I have achieved through a few occasions of use. Painless trimming or shaving. I think most of the negative feedback regarding this product revolves around the life of the battery. But, some people might expect electronics to last far longer, and assume this will be the last body shaver they purchase in their lifetime. I will be happy if I get about 2 years of life out of this product...if that happens, then this shaver will have far exceeded my expectations. I tend to believe that if you follow cleaning , maintenance, and charging instructions, that electronics usually hold up fairly well over time. Another gripe that I&#x27;ve seen on the reviews for this product are in reference to the ineffectiveness of the trimmer features of the unit. I thought the trimmer worked most excellent, but I would advise taking the time to trim longer body hair with scissors before using the trimmer on this shaver. It will operate better, and pregrooming will reduce hair from pulling or tugging, or clogging the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, the only flaw I could point to with this product are with the cleaning instructions being a bit vague about how to remove foil shaver in order to clean the unit. The picture is accurate, in the portrayal of the motion necessary to remove foil shaver, but a bit more direction in regards to this would be helpful. A 15 sec video? All I am saying, is that I could easily see someone unintentionally damaging foil head because the directions are not very clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this shaver is well worth the money spent. Saved considerable amount of time grooming, and offers outstanding pain free shaving results. I have sensitive skin...and no red bumps from the use of this shaver. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This thing has done everything that I wanted it too, especially on the sensitive areas. It does nic you every now and again but my solution is lotion before shaving and then I never have a problem.</li>
            <li> item is as described, it&#x27;s quality made, so far it&#x27;s holding fine and looks like it will last for some time.</li>
            <li> According to my husband the face trimmer isn&#x27;t worth anything. He uses that to shave with before he uses a straight razor and he says its not even good enough for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says the body trimmer is great. But kinda bought it for the purpose of it being both</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this model for over 2+ years. It&#x27;s called a BODYGROOM...works well for the sensitive parts of your BODY...especially below the neck.&lt;br /&gt;My wife used a similar shaver marketed for Women. She no longer uses that product...this IS her NEW Groomer....</li>
            <li> Best body shaver I&#x27;ve had. I see a lot men reviewing this product. This product is just as good for women. I use it for my legs, armpits, and bikini line. I&#x27;ve had this product for 2-3 years now and it still working well. I haven&#x27;t had to replace the shaver head yet. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver. Works perfectly as described ands is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this groomer gets a bad rep for just trimming the body it is great I have never cut myself or anything.</li>
            <li> The worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. Now that i have some time u can truly say it, the upper head doesn&#x27;t last a long time. it breaks very easy and i bought a second one and happened the same, also doesn&#x27;t retain charge at all. I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but you need to know this before getting it.</li>
            <li> It works well for my needs. I don&#x27;t shave my body, but like to keep hair controlled and this does the job. It can cut pretty close if needed. I&#x27;ve only used it for dry use and works as it should even below the belt (not big on personal &amp;#34;bird nest&amp;#34;). As you can read, I got this only for it&#x27;s trimming ability so I&#x27;m uncertain about it&#x27;s shaving but, being Norelco, it should work fine.</li>
            <li> Worked fairly well for trimming unwanted body hair, but the battery life vanished after several months. Now it won&#x27;t even hold a charge.</li>
            <li> So, as a lady, I have previously owned and loved a Panasonic lady&#x27;s shaver, but wanted to see if I could find something that was shaped better - ie. could be held in different, less awkward angles and get the same effective trimmage. I decided to check out a man&#x27;s shaver and see how that goes. Very scary to use the trimmer edge around the ladybits, but if you go slowly and angle properly you shan&#x27;t get nicked. Cuts fairly close as well. Overall, so far so good. Will update after varied uses.</li>
            <li> Yes I bought this about 3.5 years ago, so I can&#x27;t complain much, but it&#x27;s dead in the water as of 4 months ago.  Really seems like the battery life should be better for a rarely used groomer.  My older Norelco 3-headed shaving razor is older and still has plenty of life.  To cap it off, it requires &#x27;surgery&#x27; to replace the battery, no simple way to update that part.  It works as advertised, just would prefer to see it work longer or be user serviceable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many of the other BodyGroom models, and this model is by far the best.  My previous BodyGroom had issues with the razor head popping off.  This is well built and does a much better job without razor burn or hair pulling.  I believe the pivoting head makes a big difference with comfort and efficiency.  Good buy--I&#x27;d recommend this model of all the BodyGroom shavers.</li>
            <li> Title pretty much says it all. There is definitely a lot to the bodygroom, and it does most things well enough, but none quite as well a dedicated tool. I&#x27;ll break it down:    The Trimmer:  Works almost as well as the trimmer this replaced ([[ASIN:B001GQ3GEY Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer]]) and the comb is much smoother, that is, it doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin as I use it. The maximum length setting (5) is more than long enough for anything I&#x27;d ever use the trimmer for. The minimum length, however, is not quite as short as I&#x27;d like. My old razor had an attachment that was about 1/2 the length and it was really useful getting a nice smooth fade along my neck. I&#x27;m still able to get the fade, I just have to take the comb off and be extra careful.    The Shaver:  The foil is decent enough that it gets the job done but, just like the trimmer, it&#x27;s not as good as other electric shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past. It required a few extra passes to get everything sufficiently shaved. The precision trimmer, similarly, works well enough that I&#x27;m not complaining, but not quite as good as other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;ve found there&#x27;s a nice rocking action to the shaver end and it works really well on large expanses that I keep hairless. Basically, on the up stroke (against the grain), it rocks so the trimmer clears away any longer hairs and/or fuzz; then on the down stroke, the foil finishes the job. That alone cuts the time needed to clear such expanses in half as well as eliminates the need for a separate manual razor.     Overall:  The one thing the bodygroom absolutely excels at is its sheer versatility. You can be using the trimmer side one second, and the next be using the foil. All you have to do is push the button to turn the trimmer off, flip it over, push the button to turn the foil on, and you&#x27;re on your way. Another huge plus is the utter lack of attachments. Coming from the Wahl with 19 bazillion attachments, it&#x27;ll be nice to not have to carry a separate ziplock bag with the attachments whenever I travel. One thing I will miss about the Wahl (at least when it was new), is the amazing battery life. It would last a few weeks (5-6 full trims) on a single charge. I&#x27;m not sure about the battery life for this one yet as I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I was able to do a full trim (15-20 min) basically straight out of the box even though the manual said to charge it for 10 hours first.     So, in summary:    Pros:  Jack of all trades  easy to clean  switches between functions super fast  super sweet rocking action on the shaver end  NO ATTACHMENTS!  battery life seems more than adequate in my limited use so far    Cons:  Master of none  kinda big which makes it somewhat difficult to maneuver in tight spaces such as between the legs</li>
            <li> To keep this rather short, it does what Philips says it will do. It looks and performs good, and has many features (it&#x27;s an all-in-one machine!) that will help grooming of any area. While the \\&quot;manual\\&quot; says it&#x27;s not intended to be used above the neck, it does still also work great for trimming your beard or side burns. It also works great for the chest. It just takes some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer will easily remove the hair that&#x27;s been there for a few months. To get the rest though, it will take some time, if you want it to be baby smooth. The shaver head will indeed get rid of your hair and make your skin nice and smooth (and WITHOUT any irritation, to boot!), but as stated, it will take quite a few passes before it can remove all the stubble that was left from the trimmer end. You can&#x27;t expect to just power through the stubble with the shaver end, otherwise you won&#x27;t get it all...or worse, you&#x27;ll yank some of the hairs while trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning and charging is a breeze, and have had no problems thus far. The battery life seems average so far. Nothing special. Sometime it will sound as if it&#x27;s going to die soon, but it will still go for a bit longer. So that&#x27;s nice. I will usually charge it after usage, and then when I go to use it again (a week later), it has no problem grooming my areas all in one charge. Just don&#x27;t expect to be able to do a couple days in a row, without charging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, as expected, this can still cause some razor burn or draw some blood if you&#x27;re not too careful in the sensitive areas. It will just take some finesse (and perhaps some satisfaction of not getting SOME areas as smooth as you&#x27;d like)...or maybe I just need some tougher skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #1: I&#x27;ve been using this about once a week (or every other week) for the past year. (I&#x27;ve owned it for just over a year now). The battery life has gone down a bit, but I can still get a the job done on one charge. HOWEVER, don&#x27;t expect to be able to do your whole body on one charge after using this on a normal basis for a year. I&#x27;ve found that now it will basically last long enough to take care of the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas, and a little more -- say chest and/or stomach. But that&#x27;s about it. Don&#x27;t expect to be able to make yourself spic-and-span from the neck down if you&#x27;re quite hairy from the neck down. It&#x27;ll take a full-charge, plus another partial charge (I&#x27;ve found this out the hard way). If you&#x27;re just maintaining those areas, you should be fine, but if you&#x27;ve let them grow out and expect to hit them all in one charge, you&#x27;ll be disappointed. I&#x27;ve learned to deal with it, and adjust my \\&quot;schedule\\&quot; accordingly. With that said, part of the short battery-life may be because I charge it AFTER I&#x27;m done using it...and then won&#x27;t use it again until a week later. Perhaps if I just waited until I NEEDED it, and then just charged it right before, it would be better on the battery. Not sure. I just wish there was also an AC Adapter \\&quot;attachment\\&quot; that we could use if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this to \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; my entire head/scalp for the summer, and it worked just fine for that. No bogging down and no irritation from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE #2: I&#x27;ve now had this for about 2 years. Battery life has suffered. I barely use it anymore. Maybe twice a month...and usually only to do some final trimming/detailing. I&#x27;ve been using hair clippers (more powerful and not reliant on a dead battery) for tougher jobs or when I let my body/face hair grow out. With that said, I ALWAYS have to charge this Norelco trimmer before use...otherwise it will die within minutes. However, even with a full charge, this trimmer is still not lasting long enough to do the job. I&#x27;m limited to one area of the body per charge. Also, the main reason for this update is that I have noticed while it is charging, the razor will actually TURN ITSELF ON for a few seconds. It&#x27;s turning on the shaver (not trimmer) end for some reason. I take it off the charger and put it back on, but then an hour later it turned itself on again for a few seconds. Very strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #3: Exactly 2 years later and this thing is totally dead. Won&#x27;t even charge anymore. The green charging light doesn&#x27;t come on, and when I turn the shaver on, it only lasts for a second. Pretty pathetic. The actual device and how it functions was great. The battery issues just kept getting worse and in turn caused me to constantly lower my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My device was JUST outside of the 2-year warranty. However, I contacted Philips and they were kind enough to still send me a replacement handle. Hopefully that will solve the issue.ut then an hour later it turned itself on again for a few seconds. Very strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #3: Exactly 2 years later and this thing is totally dead. Won&#x27;t even charge anymore.

            <li> I do not shave for astetics so if a hair gets missed here and there i don&#x27;t mind so much.   1. I was very leary about buying an electric shaver for the downunda&#x27;s if you get my drift. I have been \\&quot;burned\\&quot; before using one. Needless to say when i began to use this unit I was very very very very very careful like i am with other items. Turns out i needn&#x27;t be so careful with this item. That&#x27;s not to say grab it and go wild but i Did a full shave (even areas where before i wouldn&#x27;t DARE) and not a nick,pinch, or oopsie the whole time. I also found that a little shampoo or body wash facilitated the shaving tremendously. It did a great job shaving the belly button too! being fat that area is quite rounded and i was able to shave it quite well. I would reccomend going slow with the razor and cleaning it frequently.  Now being a man i&#x27;m probably not as picky as a woman might be about quality of shave so i&#x27;m not sure how well this would work for a woman shaving her legs. Probably i&#x27;d not reccomend it.    2. The charging station is only a 4 star assembly in my opinion. I wish it captured the shaver more securely but it is more than adeqate with a cord length long enough to string across my double sink and mount it opposite side of my plug.    3. This comes with a cleaning brush (for when your dry shaving or have let the razor dry) personally i don&#x27;t use it because i shave in the shower and water wash the unit often.</li>
            <li> This is great for body hair and your pubes, won&#x27;t pull on anything and will leave your body feeling smooth</li>
            <li> This shaver does what it says - I use it for my beard and some various body hairs. Not the closest shave, but it does the job of several shavers and you can easily use it in the shower.    Mine stopped charging after a month or so, but Norelco customer service got me a new one in about 3 days in a painless warranty process. Not so thrilled about the charging mechanism dying, but the customer service was excellent.</li>
            <li> This body-groomer works as expected.  I took away two star as you can hurt yourself if you are careless while shaving some non-smooth skin (wink-wink). Take away another star as the battery doesn&#x27;t last longer than ~20 minutes of using</li>
            <li> My old Norelco Bodygroom stopped working after much use and 4 or 5 years time.  I decided to upgrade to this model.  It is a great body shaver.  It is not really meant for your face, so ignore people who don&#x27;t read directions and then write reviews.  I love it.  I think it pulls a little bit more than the previous model (could be the amount of time since my last shave though), but cuts better, closer and reaches farther.  I am a very hairy guy, so I put it to the test.  I used it to trim my side burns and eye brows also.  It worked great for those, but that is as far as I would go for face use.     It is a personal item, but if you are comfortable giving it, this gift is perfect for the guy who has tried or would like to try trimming things up.  I can&#x27;t imagine a better off to college gift.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and easy to clean.  Does an excellent job without a hassle.  I would definitely recommend the product and seller.</li>
            <li> The shaver is alright. I had BG2020, it was better not to have the 3D Pivoting Head. Specially when your shaving sensitive areas you don&#x27;t want the head to move. I like the fact that it has a dual shaver on both sides. Plus having the adjustable length thingie already attached to the shaver so no extra attachments to worry about. Next time I will probably just go for the BG2020 again, its cheaper, small and does the job!</li>
            <li> The groomer works fantastic. When you open the box it has to charge, but it is really nice. The attachments are all in one so there is no fumbling around or losing anything. The trimmer works great and is easy to use. I would recommend this to any male who wants to trim body hair.</li>
            <li> This device represents an upgrade you should consider if you have been using a standard clipper for body grooming.  The battery outlasts the Wahl model I have owned for years, and the size of each head, clipper &amp; shaver, allows more nimble navigation than a standard clipper or face razor.  The clipper is ideal for trimming, and the shaver is close enough for body work (but is neither intended for, nor would be sufficient to shave one&#x27;s face; the directions flat out tell you not to in fact).</li>
            <li> Decent piece of equipment; does everything you would want it to do fairly well. I got a close shave and only two nicks which were probably my fault for rushing through the ordeal. The charger stand takes about 30 seconds to get used to/figure out how to fit the shaver on it, but I didn&#x27;t read the instructions that came with it either. Giving 4 stars only because there is no travel case included. I cannot speak yet on if it is worth the price over the lower end models, but it feels very solid and high build quality. It feels like it is going to last a while.</li>
            <li> Just got my Philips Norelco BG2040/34 Bodygroom Pro Grooming System last night, charged it all night, woke up and used it this morning before work. AMAZING!!! I can&#x27;t believe how great it works! I&#x27;m VERY pleased. It&#x27;s able to trim on all surfaces no problem at all. The design is perfect, contours your body and is heavy/sturdy in case of drops. Plus it&#x27;s waterproof so using it in the shower is the best place anyway. I will never need another razor; I&#x27;m telling everyone about it. Thanks Philips for another great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Steve</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy one, you wont regret it. This thing has given me the closest and most comfortable shave and trim that I have ever had.</li>
            <li> This sucker works great! as long as you&#x27;re careful down there and pay attention to what you are doing it works great. battery life is great, the low charge indicator is a great feature, lets you know when your about to run out of juice. Would highly recommend it highly to anyone wanting to go clean down below.</li>
            <li> This thing is great for trimming hair with that bottom end.  As for the shaving(top) part, It does an ok job.  I usually use it when my scruff has gotten too long and it shortens whiskers making it less irritating when I go over it again with a normal nonelectric razor.  To put it simple, If I were traveling and had to bring either this or a normal razor, I wouldn&#x27;t depend on this one alone.  I&#x27;d probably just bring a normal razor.</li>
            <li> real user friendly--the pivotal shave head is very convenient and far better than the Remington I was using. Would recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different products that claim to work better than they actually do.  This one lives up to its hype!  A little more than I usually drop for a body groomer, but it is definately worth the money.  Great design and feel to product.  Not plasticy or cheap feeling.  Charges great and great combo of cordless/waterpoof.  You can get really close with this and can skip the shave.</li>
            <li> I received the product with no troubles. It works perfectly, as soon as I opened it, I tested it in my body, it has no pulling-feeling, and it&#x27;s really gentle with the skin. The trimmer is perfect, it has 5 lengths, but I think it is plastic maiden, and I think it might break easily. The shaver works almost as a razor, the shaving is pretty close, but if you use it  in different direction it has nothing to envy to a straight razor. The instructions said, that you have to get used to the machine, and your shaving will improve in several weeks, If it is true It would be better than a razor. I just tried it once, and I am already pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some issues when removing the blade of the shaver, you have to grab and pull, just the blade, not the plastic zone around it. I tried to pull all the parts together and I nearly broke it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well i&#x27;m really satisfied so far with this product. I hope it works as good as now, in a few months.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut you and it works well.  I just hope it lasts longer than the last model I had from them.  It fell apart after 4 years of little use.</li>
            <li> Was given as a Christmas gift to my boyfriend and he said it was the best body hair trimmer he has ever used.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to shave my groin pumpkins and the surrounding regions for the last 1.5 years. This is far better and easier than using a regular shaver. I cannot recommend this enough. I use the pivoting end for the delicate bits (almost everything down there), and the fixed end I use at the longest setting to keep my leg hair in check. I nicked the pumpkins 2-4 times in the first half year of usage. Since then, I&#x27;ve had enough practice to know how to use the shaver and haven&#x27;t nicked them since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TECHNIQUE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The thinner and/or the more the skin folds, the lighter pressure you should apply. Don&#x27;t apply any pressure at all near the thinnest, most fold-ey, most vulnberable skin, the shaver should skim a millimeter above such skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Use the edge trimmer to lightly skim the skin of the sack. The most vulnerable and risky part to shave is the part of the sack directly on and below the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Always shave against the direction the hairs point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The skin on the pubic mound and between the leg and the sack are thick and tight enough to use the shaving foil for an extra close shave. Be cautious when doing the perineum, the part in between the scrotum and the backend, its bumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Shaving gel is better than shaving dry. Its best to let your skin soak in warm water in order for the hair folicles to relax, however its easier shaving the sack when its cold, which causes the skin to pull tight. The best is to soak in warm water, come out of the water, apply shave gel, and shave everything except the sack. By the time you&#x27;ve done that, hopefully your landing gear will be up due to the cold air on them, the skin is tight, and you can have an easy and safe shave.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, doesn&#x27;t leave you irritated like other razors and does not cause ingrown hairs like using a regular razor. Probably one of the best investments I could have made for my self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This groomer is a must buy for any guy that enjoys the hair-free or trimmed lifestyle. Your girlfriend or wife will agree :)</li>
            <li> Far superior to wet shaving. It is WELL worth the money. Smooth skin every time. I don&#x27;t really use the adjustable groomer part but it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time and trims really close. Really durable and also doesn&#x27;t pull like cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> This product is sturdy, holds a charge well, easy to use and is well put-together.  The reason it&#x27;s getting 3 stars is because I typically have to go over an area multiple times to get all of the hairs.</li>
            <li> Compact and easy to use will recomend it to any bear who likes to be shaved in..easy to clean and store</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new shaver...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is the best!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent construcci&amp;oacute;n materials etc!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best ever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability 100%</li>
            <li> Before this I had bought two cheap trimmers that have different heads for nose, etc. and they were terrible. They broke after several months and their batteries needed about 12 hours to charge to work for one hour or less. When I ordered Philips Norelco, I expected it to be much better than those cheap things, and fortunately it was. I don&#x27;t wan to shave my legs and hands, so I need the shaver for my back, and the trimmer for other parts. They both perform very well although the shaver should be used carefully, or it may hurt. The trimmer is very strong and cuts hair from all over the body easily. The comb is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or irritation. The minute I received the machine, I used it for three hours non-stop and it didn&#x27;t even get warm. Overall, a very well built and strong device.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER written an amazon review before, but feel inclined to tell people how crappy this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a FANTASTIC groomer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased 4 over the course of the year...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 groomers you say?!?!  You must be a hairy man!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That may be true... but that&#x27;s not the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased 4 of these groomers because each one I purchased failed within 2 weeks.  The unit literally died... would not charge, would not turn on... kaput... gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It performed FANTASTIC for those few short weeks though!  It&#x27;s a pity.. could be a great product...  THUMBS DOWN NORELCO!</li>
            <li> Im torn with this, its ok. I use it and i want to return it but probably wont. I wish you could shave your face with this then it would be a useful things. but id have to bring that and my electric razor which is pointless. It does well for the groin area and doesnt cut me, i dont know how people are cutting themselves, im not even that cautious. i think the guard needs more settings amongst other things..still its ok and will shave your body fine i guess.. just not impressed</li>
            <li> I purchased this based of all of the great reviews. One problem, the shaver head isn&#x27;t that great. It doesn&#x27;t buzz smooth to skin. The trimmer works fine. I use the trimmer head, then the shaver, then I finish with a Mach 3 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be too worried about the scary factor of going down there with an electric trimmer. Just take it slow and after a couple of shaves your body gets used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I would look for lady products. They would probably do a much better job &amp;#34;downstairs&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this is very nice and I mainly use it dry.</li>
            <li> My husband shaves ALL THE TIME.  He use to use 3 differnt shavers for differnt parts. With this one he only needs one.  So far so good. :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shaver that could trim body hair and shave.  The product works but not quite as well as I expected.  The shaver works the best but you do have to go over the area multiple times in some cases to completely shave the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is good for thicker hair but is worthless for fine hair.  I like a Wahl trimmer much better if you are looking to trim and not shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this is a bit pricey for an electric body shaver.  I debated returning the product but decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle and am still using the product.  I have a Wahl shaver and using that to trim in lieu of this product.</li>
            <li> This product is as stated in the Ads, a good groomer where you can maintain different areas the way you like. The only disadvantage I found is the weight of this shaver which raelly feels heavy while doing the work.</li>
            <li> Before buying this trimmer, I researched reviews, hoping to find one that would not cut me in sensitive places. Read the reviews on this product and you&#x27;ll agree that, in that sense, it sounds like the holy grail of trimmers. Sadly, those reviews are likely written by interns at Norelco. How else could one explain the fact that this trimmer produces the same nicks and cuts that every other model I&#x27;ve tried has produced. That aside, it works as well as any other product of its type. Just don&#x27;t expect a pain-free, nick free experience, you&#x27;ll be painfully surprised.</li>
            <li> Today I used it for first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model made me happy and cover my expectations that I had for all of my styles that I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you want to be happy with your shaver you need to know what do you need ? (I mean most important point is what style(s) do you need ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then search for the model that can cover your style(s),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then buy the optimum one compare to your budget, quality, brand, life time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good luck and have fun</li>
            <li> Best Bodygroomer yet!!!</li>
            <li> Over all this is a very good product, my only compliant is that the shaving head is difficult to remove without stabbing your fingers on the hair guards.</li>
            <li> The reviews of this product are accurate. It is easy to use. The trim guard works great for grooming to the length that you want. The shaver side works like a charm. No more razor burn or razor red bumps.</li>
            <li> I do not buy this kind of objects because i think they are ripping me off but this one truly works. I shave where it counts with it ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you really want that clean clean shave, you nust use a razor but other than that, To me it worked.</li>
            <li> Very good but not as close a shave as a shaver for face. It is safe, but it still gets the skin folds if they are too folded, no bleeding yet, but be careful. I&#x27;m going to give it back as this never happened using a blades and they&#x27;re relatively inexpensive. You can easily managed doing a lot of what this does with you electric face shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The side that has a trimmer with a comb is what is most useful, but that can be replaced by the trimmer on my face shaver (currently a Braun series 7 790 cc).&lt;br /&gt;Like most foil shavers, it is loud.&lt;br /&gt;Like most new Philips shavers it has a flimsy stand for a charger.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews have stated that it doesn&#x27;t charge after some time, it hasn&#x27;t happened to me, so beware!</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco products before and I was happy with their built quality and performance. When I started my research for a versatile body groomer for my sensitive areas, I first looked at Norelco products and this one had good reviews. So, I decided to give it a try. Overall I am very happy with the purchase, here are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It is a shaver and trimmer combo.&lt;br /&gt;- Design and ergonomics are excellent. It is very sleek looking.&lt;br /&gt;- You can use it both wet and dry - I tried it works just fine with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;- It is very good for sensitive areas, I used bad products as well, so I can easily compare. You still need to be a little careful but you can tell that this is designed for total body grooming and it can handle any area nicely.&lt;br /&gt;- It is cordless and charge is decent.&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning after usage is easy.&lt;br /&gt;- The skin-protecting shaving head is made from hypo-allergenic materials, and you can see the difference after having, you don&#x27;t get any rash or itching due to the shave, again this is important for the sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Shave is half way decent, it doesn&#x27;t get everything in one pass, you need multiple passes but for a guy, I don&#x27;t think this is as important.&lt;br /&gt;- price is a little on the higher side for a groomer but I think it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen many negative reviews about the charging/battery. I have only used it a few times, and I cannot speak for that. I have only seen some reviews about it being painful, my experience is just the opposite. I found it very safe to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final verdict is that it is a very good body groomer.</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate groom solution for any man who wants to keep his body&#x27;s hairs tidy and looking good without waxing or using scisors &amp; etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device has two sides with different functions: one (the upper side) was built to eliminate any kind of hairs without irritation in EVERY area of the body, including that one down there. It is unbelievable indeed, it wraps off all undesired hairs without hurting or irritating your skin! The other side is a hair machine and you can set the length from zero to 5, which allows you to cut your hair and mantain your beard looking good without removing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resuming:: it is one of the best electronic products I&#x27;ve ever bought, the cost/benefit is unbelievable! Every man should get one himself as soon as puberty starts...</li>
            <li> I love this!  It&#x27;s waterproof, holds a good charge, has a nice shaving foil side, and the trimmer side is great too for beard and other body hair maintenance (it&#x27;s my favorite trimmer I&#x27;ve had, good for necklines, sideburns, chest etc...)!  It&#x27;s a great all in one tool.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, but you need to shave same place some times to get a better finish, some times really annoying thing. Comparing to other that I used, this was the best.</li>
            <li> You can definitely punch, tear, and bleed.  You will yell expletives.  But I haven&#x27;t found anything better on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** not suitable for chest hair - razor preferred.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but it&#x27;s too big and heavy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Like descripted, happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works really well, thanks</li>
            <li> Yep, from using the #1 for my head and goatee, to more...carefully-trimmed areas, this razor can handle it all. I think you, Philips, and my manscaping-insistent girlfriend thanks you (so, technically, I thank you again)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, you can shave your head, trim and shave your facial hair, and trim those other vital areas, all with equal precision and ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor holds a charge very well, too, though I tend to just keep it on the stand.</li>
            <li> Works great for me. The fine (close shaver) is a little to big for my girlfriend to use.</li>
            <li> Norelco&#x27;s BodyGroom Pro does an amazing job with my brows and mustache. I can almost clip everything with my eyes closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product&#x27;s packaging is one of the worst I have seen in ages. It is so impossible to open that it broke a box cutter as I tried to cut along Norelco&#x27;s &amp;#34;cut here&amp;#34; line. There is no excuse for hard-to-open plastic packaging. Shame on them.</li>
            <li> The razor works better than the other models and the 2 different sides are perfect for triming and shaving. The problem with the product is the razor stand that wont support the razor at all. It has 2 weak  magnets to hold the razor, but its imposible to make them work.</li>
            <li> But the way the stand works is very weird.  I also wish the attachments could be stored with the stand in a built in compartment, etc.</li>
            <li> It can go where the sun don&#x27;t shine without any nicks or cuts.  I definitely recommend this product.  It is worth it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> Do not buy the cheaper models. This is what you need.</li>
            <li> this razor is decent at best, i havent really been able to find a great shaver for manscaping since i used my roomates in college one.</li>
            <li> Good , but if you have long body hair there may be some pian</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, fast shipping, good fit.</li>
            <li> So far it has been awesome. This really feels like a quality product.</li>
            <li> Great thing to own! It seriously cuts through hair! Best razor of any kind I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Perfect for any hair needs. This product gets close and is able to be used in the shower. Easy to clean and easy to charge. I have had no problems with the batteries and use this multiple times a week. Incredible product for the price.</li>
            <li> Not great for my goatee as it doesn&#x27;t precision shave to trim down some areas. Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This product is a nightmare. I started using the end with the cover and everything was fine. When I used the other end I noticed blood all over my body. I freaked out. They were not deep cuts but a lot of small cuts and skin burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot understand how this product is in the market unless I received a defective product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it ZERO stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay Away.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older unit I had. If I had known this was so much better I would have purchased it much sooner. I am very happy with this unit.</li>
            <li> Works well, holds a charge for forever too. Close, comfortable shave. Very sturdy in your hand as well. I have not used the hair trimming side, though I imagine it works just as well as the body razor</li>
            <li> The was a good investment.  Works great, no problems.  Holds a charge for several uses.  Charges fast.  Works wet or dry.  Had it for a year now.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I thought this might be the groomer for me (arm and leg hair). It&#x27;s ok, but expensive for what you get!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts for a good 1/2 hour of trimming&lt;br /&gt;Medium close on the shaving side&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;If you remove the length adjusting guard, be prepared for cuts!</li>
            <li> it clearly works as stated on the advertisement and its worth a piece one should have. i am using it regularly and its works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a good product so far, nice trimmer but could have had lower sizes for the trimming part in order to be more helpful. Easy to clean and mantain both heads of the product. As a whole product, very well put together and got it in time.</li>
            <li> Works great a little heavy to maneuver the underside of groin area but with help it is perfect!</li>
            <li> Fantastic for manscaping lol, just got this baby this morning and first impressions are great. Hopefully it keeps this up and the battery lasts as long as it does since I read some reviews about the battery draining after a couple of months of use. For now though, highly recommended for manscaping and daily use!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for the good handling and shipping speed and product quality</li>
            <li> This product worked great. I bought one for my sons. They to use them and it seems to be working fine. But I was shopping at target and found them for $20 cheaper plus no shipping costs</li>
            <li> Bought this for as a Christmas present for my wonderful son n law and he loves it! Great product to purchase!</li>
            <li> This product had a very high rating and based on a few reviews, I purchased it. Unfortunately, I should have read the bad reviews more. It simply just doesn&#x27;t cut it. Literally. You have to go over everything many times and even then you still find stray hairs and have to use a razor. Save time and money just using your good old razor blade. Amazon was very good about the return process as always though.</li>
            <li> It says it is only a body trimmer but I use it to trim my beard. it is great! the battery lasts a long time and can be used in the shower. I am VERY happy with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> i owned many BG2030 and I love them. this time i got this BG2040 and its fail me. thought its a higher model should be better but totally disappointed. its left me small cuts and bumps I have to shave again with regular blad because its does not shave close enough if I press harder then I will get more cuts and bump.. last but not least the Charge Stand it the most stupid and annoying... I hated is so much.. NOT RECOMMENDED. BG2030 WAS BETTER...</li>
            <li> I upgraded from the older blue model to this one. This one is a little too sharp for the &amp;#34;boys downstairs&amp;#34;. It does get you clean shaven all over but just be aware that you can&#x27;t speed shave downstairs like you could on the older model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for several months now. It works very well, still have not had to recharge, and no nicks or cuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the multi-capability of this device one end for delicate grooming and the opposite end for longer hair</li>
            <li> It will nick you.  I have to go over the same spot several times regardless of whether I am in the shower or not.  Therefore it irritates my skin.  I would still recommend it because of the price and it is a lot cheaper than you will find in stores.</li>
            <li> This shaver gets the hair *almost* completely gone, but not as close as a razor and cream.  If you&#x27;re after the hairless LOOK, it is more than adequate.  If you want absolutely no stubble in any direction - baby&#x27;s butt smooth, it falls a little short.  It&#x27;s better than any electric razor I&#x27;ve seen, althouhg that&#x27;s not as great a complement as it sounds.  I still give it five stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible for an electric razor to get any closer. One word of caution - don&#x27;t press too hard to try and get too tight.  When shaving the &amp;#34;boys&amp;#34;, this thing will bite you if you&#x27;re not careful.  Keep the skin pulled taut and tread lightly until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> this is a pretty good trimmer with a few flaws, theres 3 trimmers for this 1 for longer hair for months of hair growth , 2 the trimmer for closer cuts after you used the one by itself... right next to number 2 trimmer is  trimmer 3 which is like a foil type of shaver is the best part it cuts close like a shave without any irritation,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons,&lt;br /&gt;1 trimmer by itself is ok could be wider&lt;br /&gt;2 trimmer sucks because it pulls hair&lt;br /&gt;3 trimmer/shaver is great gets really close without irritation and its powerful, this part alone is what made me happy</li>
            <li> I was super excited about this newer, supposedly improved, version of the BodyGroom.  I had the original, loved it, then lost it in a move, and wasn&#x27;t in the financial ballpark to buy another.  The BodyGroom Pro is an awesome, sleek design.  It actually kind of adds to the decor of my bathroom.  The charger dock/holder is awesome.  But it doesn&#x27;t perform as well as the original.  Remember those commercials where they shaved the kiwi?  Yeah....not this time, Norelco.  I became used to flying through my manscaping on the original.  I am still not comfortable doing that without thought and attention paid while focused on certain areas.  If you get it at a decent price, it&#x27;s decent, especially since it charges so quickly, and the LED takes away the guessing game...and it starts to flash yellow when the charge winds down, so you&#x27;re not as caught off-guard if your manscaping goes long.  But I&#x27;d more readily buy the original.</li>
            <li> I have had two of these trimmers, and while they both work well for trimming and maintaining unruly body hair, they WILL lose their ability to hold a charge within a few months.  For 70 dollars I expect a better quality than this.  Spend your money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Not a cure for razor burn like some reviews say. This is not a forgiving shaver and the flexibility of the head and cutting blade is over-hyped and mostly ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no added value here over the $30 Mangroomer and this shaver is rather large and awkward in hand. Returned after a week.</li>
            <li> This model really works at mowing though unwanted hair.  The dual-purpose aspect of this makes it really easy to use.  It did cut me once (because I was careless).  Being careful will yield results you&#x27;ll like.</li>
            <li> We all know why you are buying this....and it works. This product is really a game changer. I resemble wolverine so I was looking for something to remove my natural snuggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have not cut myself&lt;br /&gt;Very good battery&lt;br /&gt;Very maneuverable&lt;br /&gt;Durable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used in the shower, but for the BEST results use this first THEN use a razor for the easier shaving areas (Note: this step is recommended for those individuals who may be mistaken as a werewolf. Otherwise, avoid).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note:&lt;br /&gt;Just because this thing is safe and difficult to cut yourself with does not mean to go crazy when using it. It is a high powered machine and can be scary to use at first.</li>
            <li> This shaver does exactly what you want it to do. Its perfect for, ahem, sensitive skin, and the guarded trimmer on the bottom of the shaver prevents nicks. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many trimmers in the quest for an excellent trimmer I can rely upon. In that quest, Norelco hasn&#x27;t always faired so well, but they have never been truly awful.  I saw this product as an opportunity to have a wet/dry trimmer that might work fair.&lt;br /&gt;It has exceeded my expectations of fair and works excellently.&lt;br /&gt;Wet or Dry, this trims well, cleans easy, charges fast and is an all-around good device.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to both family and friends looking for a full-body trimmer.</li>
            <li> For a body groomer, this is an acceptable tool.&lt;br /&gt;It is not designed to do the heavy lifting of a mans beard Shaver, although with a better battery (Li-ion), and a better foil, it could have been a all in one answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it specifically to see if it could handle beard shaving. It can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not interested in shaving any other body parts.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that are, this shaver would work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to hold, and operate with 1 hand, and I do like the double ended Shaver/trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I do think this could have been a much better product if some improvements were made.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely under powered, only using a NiMH battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend this shaver to anyone, due to it&#x27;s price, and lack of versatility.</li>
            <li> It was an experiment. I usually use a non-electric razor and cream, and after being nicked one too many times, and having my skin feel raw after using it, I went back to the low-tech version. Maybe it just took more getting used to that I was willing to give it.</li>
            <li> I have persuaded my hubby to trim a bit more.....and this jewel makes it simple and fast enough that he does not complain about using it.  In the beginning I helped him use it, but he handles it all now.  No problems with nicking, or pulling hairs.  Just a great man hair tamer.  Now that he is used to it he loves it.  It&#x27;s cooler, cleaner and he just feels better.  I think so too!</li>
            <li> this shaver works good and it holds a charge for a long time before you need to plug it in. The bottom is great for trimming my goatee, and has 5 different length settings.&lt;br /&gt;It works good wet or dry and can easily be washed off after you&#x27;re done by running it under the tap.&lt;br /&gt;The top is for grooming everything else, and the heads pivot to make it follow your body contours, just be careful when manscaping as the &amp;#34;pre-trimmers&amp;#34; can nick the dangly bits and make you bleed. If the blades on the &amp;#34;pre-trimmers&amp;#34; were closer together they wouldn&#x27;t be able to grab your skin and nick you (only an issue when manscaping). If it wasn&#x27;t for that i would give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This works well, but there are a few negatives to this product which really lower the rating for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipping end (with adjustable size) gets clogged with hair very easily, making it a pain to clip large areas at a time (I use it to maintain my short haircut).  You have to constantly brush out the clogged hair to continues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimming end works well enough, but also gets clogged easily requiring frequent brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on-off switches are too easy to accidentally switch off while in use.  You really have to watch how you hold this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges easily and seems to last even through longer jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One feature that I *thought* it had (but was mistaken) -- an extension handle to allow you to use it on hard to reach areas on the back.  Yes, I&#x27;m part apeman, and would like to use this to keep from looking like George &amp;#34;The Animal&amp;#34; Steele.  It&#x27;s nigh impossible to reach my entire back.  A handle that extended your reach would prove invaluable.</li>
            <li> While the shaver dual head design and charger is nice, the battery life dwindles after a few months. I bought two, but for some reason the second one&#x27;s battery life was much worse. I wish they gave the option of replacing the battery.</li>
            <li> Pros: Easy to use, easy to clean, can trim hair to desired length or cut it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Requires multiple passes with the razor part to get all hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an awesome product for all necessary body-hair grooming needs!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money do not purchase this item,does not perform as advertised!!</li>
            <li> works very well, very versatile.  just wish it had an extendable handle. eight more words to allow this to submit</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied! I ordered a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; one and I got a used one with pubic body hair in it! Yes it was covered in black thick pubic hair after I unboxed it. Be warned!</li>
            <li> Does the job well hacking and trimming your lawn to a tee.</li>
            <li> First use....It&#x27;s bigger than it looks, so you have plenty of length to reach all the places....like the back of the neck where hair grows around the collar.  And it works well in the nether regions....no rash.  The one suggestion I would put forth is...&amp;#34;Watch the angle of approach and take your time!&amp;#34;  This is better than a razor and it worked better than expected.  The trimmer end also works well for beard trimming.</li>
            <li> It worked really will. But than I lost it. So I plan on buying a new eventually.</li>
            <li> Okay so I was a bit pessimistic even though this product had plenty of good reviews....&lt;br /&gt;It is great... not practical for back neck shaving (according to my wife)  but I love it for body shaving...&lt;br /&gt;Have to keep it from her since she is looking for a shaver for her armpit...&lt;br /&gt;Gotta hide it... all mine .. not sharing.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong...</li>
            <li> i guess maybe I just got a bad one, but this thing can&#x27;t hold a charge at all.  I can leave it on the charger for a day and it&#x27;ll work for about a minute and a half.  Always been like this.  Total waste of money.  Also, it really doesn&#x27;t do anything any better than any other shaver.  I used to have one of those with the vacuum function and at least that was good for preventing a mess on the sink.  This one is pointless, really.</li>
            <li> Like every other guy that&#x27;s sure to be reading this review, I was looking for easier ways to keep.... things... cleaned up. I read many of the glowing reviews here, and decided to drop the cash and hope for the best. Bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are really only two things that this item does well:&lt;br /&gt;-Trim back &#x27;the bush&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;-Minimize the chances of cutting yourself (compared to a razor)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to the first, you can use any pair of hair clippers to do just as good of a job (and probably cheaper). The good side for this item is it&#x27;s battery powered and works in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to cutting, there is a reason I said &#x27;minimizes&#x27;. There are still 4 places on the shaving side that can leave some quite brutal gashes if you&#x27;re not careful (which you should be considering the target area). I would not trust this anywhere that isn&#x27;t smooth and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the rating boils down to however, is the fact that arguably the key feature of this item doesn&#x27;t work. You cannot shave with it. At all. It&#x27;ll cut the hair down to around a mm high, but this looks absolutely terrible. You cannot get a remotely close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be attempting to use it this week as an every-day tool, and see if things improve over time. If they do, the rating will rise. But as of now, it&#x27;s looking like a return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day three of the week edit: got fed up with it yesterday and ended up razor shaving. That actually made it work really well today though. You definitely have to shave every day with this tool, or things get too thick for it to shave. What seems to be the biggest issue is precision. I don&#x27;t shave everything, and maintaining crisp lines with this tool is quite difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: Still testing.</li>
            <li> This bald dude tried three waterproof shavers before the BG2040. They all jammed or broke within a year or two. This one feels much sturdier and still works well after being dropped a couple times. Excellent battery life too. Recommended.</li>
            <li> A weird charging station. Isn&#x27;t that great of a product.  Go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I am what you can consider a really hairy man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried about every type of hair removal you can try from home.&lt;br /&gt;-Nair and other hair removal creams work, but can irritate your skin and give chemical burns in certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;-Shaving leaves razor bumps (which I, along with many others hate!).&lt;br /&gt;-Waxing hurts the most of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used cheap trimmers and electric shavers before, but I would always have to go over the same spots over and over again. Also I would get a lot of cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco BodyGroom Pro is great. The shaver and trimmer have rounded tips to reduce cuts (which is great!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use this all over your body! And the people saying this is a poor product because they cut themselves in their crotch region, are just inexperienced in trimming the hair down there.&lt;br /&gt;Plus a cut or two are preferable to a shaggy forest of hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps, and you should confidently buy this product!</li>
            <li> The BG2020 was a simple and effective unit and after it died after 11 months I requested warranty repair via phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips CSR was polite, understanding and effective. Explaining to me the BG2020 was discontinued she immediately shipped out the BG2040, which is superior in nearly every metric to the BG2020.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BG2040 is a noticeably better made product superior in manufacture and use (the motor vibrates less and is quieter and there is a charging light on the device. 50 minutes use from an hour charge, reportedly. While it does not use attachments, there is a removable adjustable attachment on the smaller end. The smaller end more easily navigates nooks and crannies and suits my needs better than the old BG2020 with attachments. The pivoting head on the larger end is a welcome feature I did not know I needed and makes for a much safer, smoother trim. (So far.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While $50 might seem a bit high for the actual item received, it is only a few dollars more than you might wish to pay, and if it works for at least 2 years it will be a good value. Having first hand experience with customer service, I am very confident that if anything goes wrong Philips will make it right.</li>
            <li> Great upgrade from the old style.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have used this groomer in all areas below the belt and have recieved fantastic results.  No razor burn any more!  It can be a bit tricky to get the &#x27;pouch&#x27; perfectly smooth due to the hair growing in different directions, but with practice this becomes more easy.  The only time I have nicked myself with this shaver is when I removed the plastic guard of the trimmer side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge for a very long time, I can go on vacation for a week and be fine on battery when I return.</li>
            <li> I have been happy over all with the Philips Norelco BG2020. When I purchased the first Philips Norelco BG2040 I figured it would be an upgrade. Lets break it into 2 parts. The buzzer and the shaver. NOTE: I have no comment on price. I don&#x27;t care what it costs as long as it works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver&lt;br /&gt;I am very moderately hairy on my trunk legs and back. Light soft hairs that grow long on my chest. Nothing crazy at all... about 1/4 spacing between hairs. The 2020 was great for shaving. Used it in the shower for years with no problem. However the shaver blade would fall apart after a few months so I would constantly have to replace it. Even save on the \\&quot;hoo-ha\\&quot; No nicks or pinches and it would get very very close. Close enough you couldn&#x27;t see it. Also no razor burn on hoo-ha legs chest and pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2040 just pain old sucks. I returned the first because it was so bad I figured it was defective. The second was the same. It basically doesn&#x27;t cut the hair. I didn&#x27;t feel any pinching but I wound run over a small 2in area over and over and over and I would miss plenty of hairs every time. Am I carzy. How could it be so bad. I might understand if I had lots of hair but I don&#x27;t. Hair length at cut. I have tried both afresh growth and long term growth 2+ months. Its the same for both. It doesn&#x27;t work. I tried every angle when holding it at it doesn&#x27;t change it&#x27;s effectiveness. I tried dry and wet. Same results. They dropped the ball on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reverse side (Buzzer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok. Never use a buzzer to trim remaining hairs on the Hoo-Ha and pits. If I keep going over and over the area it does a nice job. I would hope it was a once over but at least it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind spending the constant money on replacement blades for the 2020 then it&#x27;s WAY better</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband a year ago for christmas. he still uses it till this day.&lt;br /&gt;f&lt;br /&gt;dg</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this since 2012.&lt;br /&gt;It does ok, it doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave, just gets it down to about 1/8 inch?&lt;br /&gt;I guess that isn&#x27;t too bad. Maybe use this before using something to finish the job?&lt;br /&gt;The other end is ok to shorten hair you don&#x27;t want all gone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure about the one hour charge claim. Mine takes over 12 hours for the green blinking light to go out after usage.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer available for trimming those &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying this because Jordan Schlansky uses it.  Even though he is dead inside, he seems to only buy something that he is passionate about and has researched heavily.</li>
            <li> Frequently Bought Together&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ER-GN30-K Nose, Ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry with Vortex Cleaning System $12.48&lt;br /&gt;I did not get him</li>
            <li> Great body shaver. does exactly what it needs to do below the belt. I will say be slow and patient and you will get the hang of it. in the end its only hair and if you cut too short or its uneven just try again.</li>
            <li> Made shaving my balls less mutilating and more fun.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it, Takes off hair quickly,but we finish of with triple head for a little closer cut.</li>
            <li> I probably would have given this product four stars had it not failed about three months after purchase.  While attempting to remove the foil cutter, the plastic that mounts to the cutter on the left side cracked, rendering the shaving/close proximity trimming side of the groomer useless.  I have yet to return the BG2040 to Philips and discover how they handle warranty claims, but it is one of the more expensive options available on Amazon, so I would have expected better durability.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get right to it. We all know why we need and want this. BUT is it worth the risk? The answer is YES! I was shaking with fear when at first attempt. To my great surprise, everything went SMOOTH! Caught my wife using it on her legs. It&#x27;s now hidden. ITS that good.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd one of these I have bought.  The last one lasted less than 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it works, it works well.  However, I have had either the motor or the battery die within months on the three that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Great product, simple and effective on the tricky to reach places. Very happy with my purchase definitely money well spent.</li>
            <li> This could be a product that should fit the needs of most men, but there are a few major limitations that prevent it from being worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life - Apparently the trimmer end requires a significant amount of power to run, or it has its own battery that is defective, because no matter how long I charge the device, it starts to blink an orange warning light when the trimmer is running.  The orange light is supposed to mean that there are 10 minutes left, but ever since I first started using the tool, the trimmer has not run longer than 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver angle - I may just have never gotten used to using the shaver portion properly, but it seems like I have trouble getting either of the trimmers at the right angle. Also, the head tilts unpredictably and there is no locking mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functionality - I realize that this device is not intended for beards, but I am frustrated by how poorly it performs anywhere above the collarbone.  I do not expect it to perform a shave like my Braun razor, but I would like for it to trim side burns and shape my beard a bit, but both of those tasks are far beyond its capability.  My other two complaints are based on the normal, expected usage of the device, but it is disappointing that they could not take it a bit further and design something that could handle any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably should have sent mine in for a replacement, but at this point I am going to look elsewhere for something that better suits my needs.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use</li>
            <li> Also a gift for my significant other. He loves it. It takes care of everything.</li>
            <li> Great Product. This is worth the money.  Quick and easy to use and very portable. The shipment took a little longer that it should have but that was okay.</li>
            <li> Very well designed product and worth the higher price v competitors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- Solid feel and easy to hold and control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- Blades on either side are shaped to reduce irritation - do not feel sharp tips compared to cheaper products I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3- Motor/mechanism strong enough: does not snag or hesitate while cutting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4- I like the two sided approach&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5- The cutter end flips open for easy cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A minor complaint, I could not see an easy way to remove/dismantle the oblong shaving unit for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I bought this unit because I wanted a rechargeable trimmer I could use in the shower, and it does that part well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the foil shaver end on my face in the shower and it just doesn&#x27;t do a very good job. It seems to work better when shaving at the sink when your facial hair isn&#x27;t softened by the hot shower water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also haven&#x27;t managed to remove the foil end to clean it properly. My wife and I both tried and gave up because we didn&#x27;t want to break it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, though, the trimmer side works well. The piece that comes on it adjusts to 5 different lengths. This is much better than the cheap kit I used to have with a bunch of different plastic ends that cluttered up my sink drawer.</li>
            <li> When Purchasing this product I read the reviews and the guy who gave the indepth, detailed, book long body imprint of personal male grooming, gay display of how it feels to utilize this product., and ordered it for my huisband, and what was said was 100% true in terms of product ability. Great And Nice looking product!</li>
            <li> It really does work. It looks good, with its stylish induction charger/stand, and it cuts through hair really well. The battery life is good, and the trimmer works well. It does not give the very closest shave, however. I can live with that for the convenience of using it in the shower. It is very waterproof, and it glides nicely using body wash as shaving cream. If you want to take care of body hair quickly and easily, give it a try.</li>
            <li> The best body groomer I have ever owned hands down. I also own the BG2020(Which is good as well) however if you have the extra cash to dish out, you will not regret buying this one.</li>
            <li> This is the most efficient product of its nature in the market right now.....period.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with its quality and efficiency.  I am a fan of Philips items, and this equipment just confirms that I do have a very good reason for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only minor suggestion : that trimmer is kind of useless because that shaver end is so god damn excellent that the trimmer has a subduded role here !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, terrific product !</li>
            <li> So far so good. The product works as described. Very happy with the purchase. Wish Philips included a pouch for the trimmer in the package.</li>
            <li> Can get the job done. If not used carefully if tends to scratch and sometimes pull a bit.</li>
            <li> Probably just bad luck. This product doesn&#x27;t hold its charge so I can barely get 5-10 mins out of it before it shuts off.</li>
            <li> It is a well made product</li>
            <li> This thing worked a few times for me for head shaving and body trimming. But not any more.  The last two times I took it off the charger to use it, it was low on power and made shaving my head painful and laborious. I felt like snapping it in half after 20 minutes of basically brushing my hair out tonight. That was the last straw.  What&#x27;s more, it charges in a way that requires the stand, which you must fully unfold and set on a nice even surface, where it&#x27;s still pretty unstable. I guess it&#x27;s supposed to look super-chic, but it&#x27;s more tedious than anything. Would much prefer a straight plug in the bottom. Or at least a system that&#x27;s geared more toward function than form.  Very disappointed. My money&#x27;s on something else.</li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent for shaving all areas, but not a true BODY groomer since it is nearly impossible to get your entire back without being a yoga expert!  I have not had the \\&quot;nicking\\&quot; issues others have had, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust ANY shaver to get that close \\&quot;down there\\&quot;.  Other than that, I am a hairy guy and this does a great job for all other areas!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it works great....as advertised.  I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower though. I would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product, I recommend this to any guy who wants to have balls you can grip like two ripe grapefruits or raisins.  The room I now have in my pants is quite unbelievable without having Dr. J living down there. Also great for mowing down your unnattended armpits and back and shoulder hair for all those Chewbacca&#x27;s like myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results I got using this Body Groomer. The Norelco gives me the same results I got when I used a razor, a smooth shave all around and no pain. My whole body is looking nicely groomed, since I started using the Norelco, just ask my girlfriend, we are both very pleased with the results. The quality and style of the Norelco far exceeds what you would expect in a Body Groomer. If your worried that this Norelco won&#x27;t give you a close shave and get all the hair, put all that aside, because this Norelco really does work great at removing the hair in all areas, whether you have thick or thin hair. All in all I would recommend this to anyone and guarantee that you would be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with this shaver is the 8 hour charge time for I think it&#x27;s 1-2 hours of trim time. After one or two uses I have forgotten to put it back on it&#x27;s stand and had it die on me mid groomage. Other than that it works great both ends work exactly as needed and the charging station is a pretty slick design that doesn&#x27;t look bad on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I have been using beard trimmers for years to trim down there getting cut all the time. The BG2040 is safe to use on your private area no problems at all. Note I was careful not to push down very hard trimming my member and the boys. They are sharp blades and for obvious reasons accidents can happen but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with clippers of this type but they do cut pretty close. They work well on the chest and below. I&#x27;m prone to ingrown hairs and these clippers are no exception, I still get them.</li>
            <li> My first use was on my face, and the foil shaver did a decent job, so for those wondering, you can use it on your face. However,  not sure if you&#x27;d want to use something on your face that you&#x27;ll use on your junk too. I bought this to shave my denver nuggets without cutting them. This thing does the trick. Smooth as eggs with no nicks or cuts. Another person said it was starfish approved, and I&#x27;ll have to concur with that.  The teeth on the edge of the foil shaver don&#x27;t move like a clipper, it&#x27;s basically just a metal comb that probably lifts the hair so the foil shaver can cut them. You will not have to worry about cutting your junk if you buy this.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item on April 30, 2010, and it is still going strong. Used in shower, wet and dry and nothing seems to stop it. I thought for sure the battery would have given out by now but noooooo. Thinking about getting a new blade set for it here on Amazon after all the cutting this thing has been through. It has not been babied at all. Even used in shower then tossed out on the rug on many occasions. Great product and obviously a beast. Will take care of any area that needs tamed.  Get one, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> In the wild world of manscaping one must be willing to try new ideas, and sometimes suffer the consequences.  We live, we learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use this item more than a few times and now merely wish I could pass it on to someone I hate (no, even I don&#x27;t have anyone I hate that much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem (at least for me) is: I have very fine hair, not a lot, but gotta keep the edges trimmed so the lawn looks good.  This device of self inflicted torture does not clip the hair, it catches it like a wad of gum. Then it gives a not so gentle tug on your follicles (just to let you know it&#x27;s doing something and thus setting off the pain numbing endorphins held within each and every one of us!) all accompanied by that wonderful whirring sound to let you know that it is indeed powered up and that you are not just imagining that you turned it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now pumped full of rage, endorphins, adrenaline, and an overall contempt for having to do this in the first place, I&#x27;m now ready for my wild night with the woman!  (Girls, I never had any idea, but now that I do...well, I don&#x27;t know what to say.  Complete loss of words. uhm, thank you????)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you are looking for a wonderful electric toy with which to satisfy the deep masochist you are, then by all means...get this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone else, don&#x27;t bother...(unless you really have someone in mind that you&#x27;d just love to give them this as a \\&quot;gift\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> This has multiple uses, but it never holds its charge! It balances on a silly holder that is just built to look cool on your sink top.  No matter how carefully you place the Bodygroom, it never seems to be positioned correctly to charge.  When it is charged, it works fairly well</li>
            <li> Although this product is marketed for men, I bought it because of the majority of rave reviews. As it is designed to shave body hair, I thought it would work well for my legs and underarm areas. This shaver gave me pretty bad razor burn and also cut me badly in several places. I guess this is due to the edges of the blades being exposed as other reviewers have stated. I thought this was a characteristic of all electric shavers, but fortunately, it is not. I just purchased the Panasonic ES2207P shaver, and the difference is night and day. NO nicks or cuts, and a close shave with very few passes needed. If you are a lady, or a man who wouldn&#x27;t mind a pink shaver, I would pass on this one and get the Panasonic ES2207P. The Panasonic is also more economical as it is priced below $20.</li>
            <li> after a few months it turns itself on, running down the battery (best case) and/or wakes us up, especially when it falls off the shelf in the shower onto the floor (3 am - worst case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it was charged up it worked just ok, often pulling hairs and cutting skin, leading to bleeding.</li>
            <li> tried every angle and it won&#x27;t cut enough. You have to go over the same spot 5 times to get a little cut</li>
            <li> This was a great trimmer while it lasted, but the battery has failed after 18 months of very light usage.  Battery charge life had been exceptional until the very end, and now it will not hold a charge at all. I was able to exchange it at Bed Bath and Beyond for a replacement, but 18 months is too short of a battery life. Otherwise, I&#x27;d give it a 5 star rating for actual functioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After getting a new replacement unit from BB&amp;B, the replacement has lasted less than 12 months and 4 light trims, and the battery is now unable to hold a charge. Totally unacceptable for a product this expensive. I&#x27;m going to try replacing the batteries myself with quality cells from an electronics store&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I replaced the batteries myself with NIMH Sanyo Eneloop AAA cells (2). No soldering is required but some disassembly is required. The original batteries were cheap junk.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband who has a very hairy back. He loves it. First we use the trimmer to get rid of the long hair and then we go over it with the razer side to get rid of any stubble. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> The shaver is good....but the grooming end is worthless. Should be a narrower option to shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I like it -- not in love with it.</li>
            <li> I owned the previous version of this groomer and found this to be a more efficient less bity version that works excellent everywhere you need it. Another excellent product from Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> Been using the Norelco for several weeks now. It does a pretty good job on my upper legs. The shaving area is small, so you have to pay attention to how it is used. Time will tell if it is as good as using the Braun shaver I had been using. I still use a blade for the boys though.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great, I&#x27;ve been using it for 9 months now. There is DEFINITELY a learning curve in using the shaver, and so you do need to be careful how you use it. The thing I did wrong once (and only once) is that I first tried to use the extension trimmer side on my genital area to get my hair shorter before using the close-shave double-blades. That was a BAD move - because the plastic guard has it&#x27;s guard wings too far apart, it allows loose skin to get in between and the blade is not built for \\&quot;bare\\&quot; shaving... so my scrotum skin actually got caught and then was nicked by the blade and I bled enough to learn a hard lesson. But it wasn&#x27;t a deep cut and it wasn&#x27;t excruciating pain, it was just enough to learn I can&#x27;t do it that way anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s very intimidating to use anything electric on your genitalia... It&#x27;s hard to trust this shaver at first, especially when in my case when it had already \\&quot;bitten\\&quot; me on one of the first uses... I was jaded because of that. but I kept using it and I&#x27;m really glad now, because I use it all the time and gives me the results I want. Basically, I&#x27;ve learned that i can only use the extension trimmer to keep myself groomed in the area around the genitalia, but I MUST use the close-shave double-sided blades ON my genitalia. The blades on that side are built so that they are so close together, it&#x27;s almost impossible for any skin (even loose skin) to get caught in between the blades. The blades are a micro-factor when it comes to distance between them, only separating enough to really get hair fibers in between them to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This electric shaver technically will NOT ever get you a shave as close to a razor will... but honestly, it&#x27;s pretty darn close enough. Hair grows way too fast for me to want to use a razor that frequently around my genitalia, and if you use this shaver every day then it will be smooth enough. You really have to let your hair grow for like 3 days for it to be that noticeably rough downthere... but if you use this shaver daily or every other day even, you&#x27;ll be happy with the smoothness it achieves especially considering the alternative is either a sharp razor to your skin, painful waxing, or using some chemical hair removers on your skin. No thanks!!! This little buddy is a fantastic solution to keeping a smooth, safe groom that you (and your lady) will love.</li>
            <li> Very usefull, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;-Battery is only 50min but I haven&#x60;t used more than 20min with my legs, very fast.&lt;br /&gt;-I can&#x60;t use gillette because I got a big allergy for a week and this product avoid me the allergy&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-You skin won&#x60;t end like if you use gillette&lt;br /&gt;-If edges touch skin do some allergy at difficulty areas like behind the knee</li>
            <li> Really gets the tough spots</li>
            <li> this product works well the charging stand is nice the cord goes into the stand and it all just fits together well. the battery will hold a charge for a long time only down side to this is that the clippers do not do well on coarse hair. the tend to bog and even kind of tug at the hair.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I bought this item. I travel quite a bit and I needed one for home and one while I travel. I got the new one and charged it and brought it with me on a business trip out of the country. It did not have a charge when I got there. I figured I must have charged it wrong. Tried again when I got home with both chargers and the battery drained. I can&#x27;t travel with the box and after a few weeks my wife had already thrown it out, so I can&#x27;t return this item now.&lt;br /&gt;At least I have the original, which I am very satisfied with. I would just reccomend to anybody purchasing this item to check the charge before throwing away the packaging as you very well may have to return, which I no longer have the luxury of doing.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!  Works as advertised.  I have used wet, wet w/shaving gel, and dry.  It works well every way that I have used it.  First time you use it, it may take a little longer until you get the best flow and direction for use of the device.  Will get you smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works great! Easy to use. Very well built and looks nice. I have sensitive skin and this works good. Doesn&#x27;t leave any bumps.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I was not sure how efficient it would be before I ordered it, but looking back, I have no regrets whatsoever . Its battery life is awesome and does a great job of getting rid of all the unwanted hair from the neck below. Its quite easy to use once you get a hang of it (which doesn&#x27;t take long) and it has been, for me,  the most comfortable way to remove all the unwanted hair. Although I prefer using it dry, which is a breeze to be honest, the fact that it is water proof is only an added advantage and makes it that much easier to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that is a must have if you cannot stand having excessive and unwanted body hair! I recommend it 100%!!</li>
            <li> They need to come up with a way to allow the shaver to SHAVE not shred the tender skin of the male genitals. It&#x27;s very difficult - at least when you have a belly to look around - to get a  close, safe shave with this product.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and easy to use for all hair control needs from the eyebrows on down.</li>
            <li> Does an okay job.  I prefer very close shaves and this doesn&#x27;t get me there.  Okay for quick touch ups and for trimming.  I still have to resort to a regular wet razor for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Awesome machine !!! Works very well...</li>
            <li> did not meet my expectations. does not shave smoothly or completely like a razor would.</li>
            <li> It cuts hair like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps to keep you really trimmed and professional looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, trims your body hair to display a man that takes pride in his presentation.</li>
            <li> Great product for body grooming.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor a little over a year ago. It worked well while it worked. I used it in the shower on my body and face (they suggest you don&#x27;t do that but I&#x27;m not going to buy a separate razor for my face). Anyway, I traveled with it to LA this summer and it suddenly decided to stop taking a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One night--this is true--I woke up to this strange buzzing sound. At first I thought it was the smoke detector. But it sounded more like an electric razor than a smoke alarm. Did my roommate wake up at four in the morning and start shaving? Unlikely. That&#x27;s when I saw the ominous blinking light of my Philips Norelco Bodygroom razor. It turned on by itself! And it wasn&#x27;t even plugged in! I grabbed it and tried to turn it off but the buttons did nothing. It just kept buzzing, furiously. My roommates woke up from the noise. I panicked and wrapped the razor in a dish towel and then hid it in a kitchen drawer. I realized this might burn the whole apartment building to the ground, so I took it out and stared at it for a full minute. Do I throw it out the window? Stomp on it? Finally, I put the razor back in its cradle and plugged it in--this worked for some reason. And it hasn&#x27;t worked since. Now when I plug it in it gets REALLY hot so I don&#x27;t plug it in anymore. Smart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately for Philips, the warranty is already expired and I&#x27;m stuck with my haunted bodygroom razor forever.</li>
            <li> I had previously owned the Philips Norelco BG2020 BodyGroom. I thought a lot about the change between the different options currently available of the bodygroom. Ultimately I decided to pay a bit more than the BD2028 or the BG2038 thinking that the previous one had lasted over 7 years. Its a great change and its definately worth it. It charges extremely fast, its very very comfortable and, more importantly, it trims very well because of its 3-D shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definately recommend it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very difficult to use in sensitive areas!</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery and as described.</li>
            <li> From start, the battery would not hold a charge. I followed the instructions, but needed to recharge after each use, lasting 5 minutes or less. After about 3-4 days of this, the battery would not charge up at all. As a result, the shaver is useless. I can&#x27;t believe a company with the reputation of Philips Norelco would market a product with such a defective part.</li>
            <li> I like the shaver but I need new blades where do I</li>
            <li> Just as many other reviewers state, you can shave EVERYTHING with this groomer.  I tried it both dry and with some shave gel and much prefer shaving with the gel.  Dry wasn&#x27;t bad and there were still no cuts, the gel just helps things to glide along.  No nicks, cuts or irritation when shaving anywhere on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint and reason for 4/5 stars is that it is difficult to keep a straight line going since the foil is surrounded by the trimmers and the plastic area.  I like to leave a little strip on hair in certain places and getting a symmetrical cut is nearly impossible using just the foil end.  The trimmer on the back with the guard removed helped to clean up the areas missed but not as smooth as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> my husband got this for trimming and all and no issues with it the packaging was great as well and he loves that the head moves along the shape of his body when he shaves.Also make sure you put it in the charger the right way or it wont charge.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Bodygroomer is easy to hold and works very well.  I had one previously and used it extensively.  I went on several sites looking for a groomer and Amazon had the best price for this particular item.  I am very happy with my purchase and find it does exactly what I bought it to do.</li>
            <li> I owned the previous version of this item and it worked great but you had to change heads for the different tasks.&lt;br /&gt;This one does not only look better, more modern and it has the shaver at one end and the trimmer at the other (no more head changing) and it comes with a more modern looking base.&lt;br /&gt;The feel is smoother and it seems manufactured better. Well worth your money.</li>
            <li> Works very well for facial hair shaving/trimming and for &#x27;manscaping&#x27;. Looks sleek in its stand too. I use it for a quick face shave if I don&#x27;t have time to shave with a razor.</li>
            <li> Cut my body grooming down from an hour to about 10 min, which is perfect for last minute date nights. No complaints or regrets.</li>
            <li> This works well and doesn&#x27;t cut. You should still exercise caution, and I only use it after the shower on clean&amp;dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer is meh, shaver is a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trim first and then use the shaver. This shaver leaves the skin super smooth when used right. Take some time with it and imagine that you&#x27;re working on the Mona Lisa. Once you&#x27;re done and it&#x27;s done right, you&#x27;ll be happy. She&#x27;ll be happy too.</li>
            <li> I could have thrown 50 dollars in the trash and cut myself on purpose! What a piece of crap. I have always used a razor and never once cut myself but i thought maybe there is a better way. WRONG!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost Halloween, buy one of these and go nuts with it.</li>
            <li> Did everything I expected. Very good product. I would recomend it for anyone looking to tidy up any place you that needs it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other body-grooming devices in the past that either a) broke b) did not work as promised c) did not actually trim hair all that well or d) had a lot of additional pieces that, if lost, rendered the device useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco&#x27;s BodyGroom Pro models avoids flaws A through D, and actually has not detachable pieces, which is great. Good for travel or keeping at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because the battery life isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> I am a female and I can&#x27;t stand women&#x27;s trimmers - they just pull too much. I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for over a year and I use it all the time. No need to get Brazilian waxes and in turn, deal with ingrown hairs. This does a way better job :)</li>
            <li> Shaving my noggin&#x27; with a razor won&#x27;t be happening, but this works perfectly.  Also is great to trim up the old &#x27;stach.  I haven&#x27;t tried using it wet, but it helps make cleanup easier being waterproof.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and after only about 10 uses it will not re charge. The battery life was not good to begin with, only getting one-use before it had to be charged again. Not a big deal but I can&#x27;t believe it quit working so soon. The directions for the first charge were followed and he never left it sitting on the charger too long. Definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is ok it works fairly well but still could work better.  It does not shave as closely as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> Although the design is nice the performance is lacking. I also own the smaller Norelco with all the different attachments and find it&#x27;s not only more effective and versatile but does a better job as well. This unit tends to pull and snag and has a significant ouch factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also lacking is a trimmer so you can forget trimming facial hair. This unit might be fine for some guys but I have found it both cumbersome and uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I love this &amp;#34;groomer&amp;#34;. The dual purpose heads on either end are really handy. My only complaint is that I wish the &amp;#34;floating&amp;#34; head on the shaver part felt a bit more solid when it&#x27;s rubbing against the skin. It sometimes gets caught on some skin and the head tilts in a weird way. Other than that I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li> The product is very noisy and vibrates a lot. I wonder still I could return it as I used the product several weeks later after getting the shipment.</li>
            <li> Designed to double as a beard trimmer and skin shaver. The skin shaver tugs at the hairs - and I&#x27;m NOT hairy.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the value of this product. Multifunctional, yet simple to use.  And it provides a close shave.</li>
            <li> This thing shaved poorly, never held a charge for long enough used it twice before giving up, greatly diminished my opinion for Philips</li>
            <li> This is a great body razor. It gives a close shave better than some other razors that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a year or two and it works well when its charged. It dies pretty fast. The close cut side lasts longer than the corse cut side which I use a lot for trimming my face. I think the issue is that the parts have a lot of friction and it causes it to have to work harder to move the cutting head. The other side being more contained and smaller, has less friction thus lasts longer. The other negative is that you can&#x27;t use this while its charging or plugged in. I have had several other batter operated trimmers that you could use while plugged in and I prefer that. This model does however work while in the shower if needed which is a plus over most other models.</li>
            <li> I love the unit, but the stand sucks</li>
            <li> nice shave. feels great. well made.</li>
            <li> I serched the Amazon site for a &amp;#34;lady&#x27;s cordless shaver&amp;#34; for my wife. The shaver was much too big and clumsey for her. She did not use it at all we returned it. I belive the shaver is intened for men who feel they have too much body hair. It would probally work very well for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through two of these units over the past three years. They trim great. But there&#x27;s an Achilles Heel -- the adjustable Comb Guide. (play the scary music here....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, like me, you clean out this tool after each use, that means that you also take off the Comb Guide as well. There&#x27;s a black pushbutton on the guide that breaks off after a while. And once it breaks off, the guide won&#x27;t stick in the position you&#x27;d like to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips was nice to me the first time this happened, and they sent me a free Comb Guide. That one broke after a few months, so I bought a brand new unit. And then last week the Comb Guide on the new unit broke and Philips wouldn&#x27;t send me a new guide. I then ordered two replacement guides (to have one as a backup) -- cost me a total of almost $40 including shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the brand new guide on the Bodygroom, and -- (drum roll, please) -- the button flew off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that I&#x27;m returning both guides for full credit and will retire my Bodygroom. I&#x27;ve already gone to Costco and purchased another Philips Norelco groomer that seems to have a more rugged comb system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I can&#x27;t recommend this unit at all.</li>
            <li> They have improved on this model so much. Now you have to realize a shave will never get you a smooth shave like a razor. However, this comes &amp;#34;close.&amp;#34; LOL. I mad a funny.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to trim hair with. This device aggravated my skin and the beard trimmer was sun par. I give it a generous 3 stars.</li>
            <li> The price may be a little steep compared to other products designed for the same purpose, but you are definitely getting what you pay for here. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> This shaver does exactly what it needs to do. I use it everywhere and I (and my girlfriend) am very appreciative.</li>
            <li> It is a great groomer that does all that it should.&lt;br /&gt;Does it cut or nick? No, unless you are attacking your hair like its a hedge in the garden.&lt;br /&gt;It takes time to trim down thicker and longer hair as the cutter can get clogged.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver on top is great for removing hair completely - and it doesn&#x27;t pinch, cut or leave ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Put down the razor or scissors and buy this - your balls will thank you.</li>
            <li> soy ciclista, y despues de haber ensayado las maquinas de afeitar de cuchilla,  las barberas electricas y cremas depilatorias.  lo mejor es esta maquina para rasurar el vello de las piernas, la espalda y el corte de la zona pubica.&lt;br /&gt;en las zonas donde se puede enquistar el vello he usado el trimmer en cero y despues de 3 meses de usarla nunca se me han vuelto a enquistar o a producir foliculitis.&lt;br /&gt;en el area genital se puede usar la rasuradora sin provovar las dolorosas cortadas de una barbera eletrica. el trimmer tiene los niveles apropiados y deja un buen corte.&lt;br /&gt;yo personalmente la uso una vez a la semana en las piernas. es rapida y corta bien el vello.&lt;br /&gt;la recomiendo totalmente.</li>
            <li> Because Man has a new best friend!!! I can not believe how well this shaver works. I took it out the box, charged it up and completely shaved everything but my face in under 15 minutes. I hit the arm pits, knocked those out in seconds. I went over, and under, and through the bush... and even the johnson and johnson. I only knicked myself once down in the tender part because I didn&#x27;t stretch the skin well enough before going over it, but it barely hurt and I just kept on truggin&#x27;. This BodyGroom is a dream machine. I&#x27;m smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom all over and my ego is through the roof right now.  Oh yeah... I feel good! Da na na na nah!</li>
            <li> I had the BG2020 for about a year.  I lost the cord.  I heard good things about the 2040 and decided to just go to the next level.  The BG2040 Body Groom Pro does the job but tends to pull hair in sensitive areas.  I also got a slight burning sensation in the area where I was working.  I thought maybe I had cut myself, but I hadn&#x27;t.  If I could find a cord for the BG 2020, I would definitely go back to it.  It provided a more comfortable shave.  As it is, I will stick with the 2040 for now.</li>
            <li> This groomer works great for my husband. Especially likes the trimmer. The cost from Amazon was also a plus and it arrived quickly. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I like to use it to trim my bear and keep my neck clean.  It does all of this very well.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and charge. Solid product.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my oh-so-awesome bf; his trimmer broke after he came to visit me and he started shaving - let&#x27;s just say he looks like a newborn every time he shaves, not to mention his constant need to nick himself more than a few times while shaving. He got the trimmer and used both sides to trim/shave his facial/body hair. It works very well, battery lasts an amazingly long time (I also used this to cut his hair after it started growing out). The shaver has not ONCE nicked his sensitive skin and the trimmer gives him the option of keeping his beard at different lengths. It&#x27;s easy to clean and recharges pretty fast (about an hour or so). This product says \\&quot;do not use on facial hair\\&quot; but as you can see, he has not been following that rule at all. The shave is VERY close to the skin and leaves it super smooth; my bf&#x27;s facial hair took a couple days to grow back to his shadow. All in all, he has only used philips shavers/trimmers - and he believes it&#x27;s good value for the money! :)</li>
            <li> Does everything I need it to do without any &amp;#34;pains&amp;#34;.  No knicks so far and the battery life is outstanding.  I&#x27;ve had it for nearly a year now and I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once.  I don&#x27;t use it daily though, perhaps just once a month.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best damn trimmer I have ever used. I&#x27;m a damn bear, thick coarse lumberjack hair. This thing makes me a silky smooth honey badger.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Using since 2011, still working without any major issues&lt;br /&gt;- Works for 10 minutes with single charge, enough for grooming needs&lt;br /&gt;- Works in dry and net conditions&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer last for 6 months with 2-3 times monthly usage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life and charging times can be improved</li>
            <li> Fits right on ones hand. Seems reliable, works as expected. However it needs its dock for charging and this creates a need for a more than usual space for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> What can I say. It effortlessly trimmed my man areas in less than 10 minutes with no cuts or pain. I LOVE THIS TRIMMER!</li>
            <li> I have used this consistently &amp; its actually exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Very practical and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> very nice i liked  it</li>
            <li> Works great! My husband used 9ne for 3 years and I just got him a new one. Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Disappointed pulls the hair.</li>
            <li> Excelent service.&lt;br /&gt;Quality and pontuality, product arrived on time scheduled.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend and hope to make business again soon.&lt;br /&gt;Good price also.</li>
            <li> The groomer is the best I have used. It works well with the private parts as long as you are very careful down there, but who isn&#x27;t careful with their own private parts. It works well on the chest as well. I use it more dry than I do when wet. The only negative on this product is the charge life. Sometimes it runs low on charge if I have been using it for more than 15 minutes. I just put it on the charger and quick charge it for a few minutes and it is ready to use again. I love this Body Groomer.</li>
            <li> This model of the Norelco Body Groom is drastically better than the BG2020 model.I feel completely safe using it and it produces really sexy results. I find it to be sack, shaft, and safe. I recommend this razor to any man looking to feel sexy and safe.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is pretty good.  I&#x27;m not gonna say it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had, but it&#x27;s not the worst either.  It&#x27;s nice that you can take it into the shower with you, and I like that you can get a nice close trim with it... but it&#x27;s not as carefree as I&#x27;d hoped when it comes to nuts.  All I&#x27;m saying is, be gentle... I guess that goes without saying, but from all the other reviews I had read I thought it was just gonna be a relaxed easy going experience with these.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t have it all it&#x27;s just the fact with the price it costs ~70 bucks. I do however wish it didn&#x27;t make such a big mess (needs a collector while it trims so you don&#x27;t have to work hard cleaning pieces of hair.</li>
            <li> I got this body groomer for my husband because his old one went out after 5 years of service.  I was worried that he might not be happy with this one because I have a ladies Philips trimmer and it pulls on hair so I was not sure about getting this brand but after reading many positive reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I am happy to report that my husband is very happy with this model of Philips Norelco.  It is easy to hold and has adjustable hair length trimmer.  He has used it multiple times per week for over 6 months now and has had no problems whatsoever.  Thumbs up to Philips for creating an awesome body groomer!!!</li>
            <li> Holds the charge. Cleaning is very easy. Excellent for bear trimming and body grooming. No more cuts.</li>
            <li> Smoothly handling the most difficult places to shave,&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use, Wet and dry, smooth touch no allergy, Loved it,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the great thing is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet no complains.</li>
            <li> good product. Like it !</li>
            <li> Works great! Worth paying a little more for the quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent product by Philips. Very easy to handle and convenient to use. Good to carry in travel pouch, battery charging period is just nice.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty expensive. I only sprung for it because of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Adam Savages tested.com podcast \\&quot;Still Untitled: The Adam Savage Project\\&quot;:  Beware tools which claim to be \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot;.  This statement applies to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything functions, but nothing functions well;  it gets the job done, but not very efficiently.  For instance, the screen-end doesn&#x27;t save any time over shaving with a good standard multi-blade razor. And, I think it actually hurts a little more than a razor &#x27;cause it plucks a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other end, the \\&quot;clipper\\&quot; end, is also performs poor, especially with the guard on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither end does well in the water, which sounded good when reading the reviews, but makes no sense, since you want the hair sticking up, not laying down, stuck to your skin under the adhesive and cohesive forces of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to do one thing - groom. It works. It isn&#x27;t the end-all-be-all of body grooming tools, but I don&#x27;t think I could&#x27;ve found a more reliable combo for the money. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to trim up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have purchased a corded trimmer, this one gave me more skin irritation than I expected.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this thing. it doesn&#x27;t work well. it hurts your skill some times. i bought another Braun shaver to shave my body</li>
            <li> Shaver works well when it works.  But it won&#x27;t keep a charge.  Have went through 2 replacements already and both have the same issue. You follow instructions and charge it, you undock it like it says, and then if you let it sit out a day or two and try to use it, it will no longer have a charge.  I actually really like the shaver itself, but the charging issue is really annoying.   Update- third replacement was the charm.  The charging is as advertised.   changing this to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I am writing for my husband for this review but I feel that I am able to convey his opinion.  The idea is good in having a blade on each end but the handle is only comfortable when using the rounded end.  However, on this end, the blade has a tendency to pop off occasionally. My husband will most likely be returning this item if it is not too late to do so.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple years daily. Still working like a champ. Battery is great. Buy the replacement head, but don&#x27;t change it too early they last a long time</li>
            <li> With this trimmer you can literally remove hairs everywhere, you just need common sense in sensitive areas to nor hurt yourself with the teeth.</li>
            <li> Fantastic as a general hair groomer.  I don&#x27;t use the shaver part much at all, but use the trimmer frequently.  Really &amp;#34;cleans up&amp;#34; the body all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only odd thing is the noise it makes, thus 4 stars.  You don&#x27;t notice anything unusual while you&#x27;re using it, but after you stop it&#x27;s kind of like there&#x27;s a slight ring in your ears.  This could just be me and my ears of course&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend this thing though</li>
            <li> Not suppose to knick and boy not only does it knick, but knicks badly</li>
            <li> I use it to shave my body hair.  It works really well, and stays charged for a long time.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> this is a great body groomer, works great for chest hair, and works really good below the waist line, if your woman likes you trim and proper down below, this will work great for you, even if you want to go totally hairless, just take your time and you should be all set!!</li>
            <li> This bad boy is smooth. Cut my shaving time in half and almost the same results as a normal razor. This is my first ever electric body razor and I now know I was missing out! I can not live without it now. I recommend this to everyone looking for an electric body razor.</li>
            <li> Great body groomer. It works just like the other positive reviews state. I kept contemplating whether I should make the purchase and now I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as they make it out to shave. It a typical razor. Nothing good or bad about it.</li>
            <li> i use the product to shave below the neck.  i have used the earlier version.  this one is better.  but with the same rider -- stretch the skin of the area you intend to shave. if not, you can get some nasty nicks.  i like the moveable head and the feel of the unit in my hand.  i have not found anything to dislike.  the quality of the product is certainly better than expected.  do remember not to leave the unit charging when not in use.  i use it once a week. a 20 minute recharge at most and it is ready.</li>
            <li> The trimming feature is neat, simple to use, and works well. The shaving size is a little sub-par however. It doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as closely as I would like, and the teeth-like part edges of the razor is almost painful in more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I own a Phillips beard trimmer as well. This seems to work as well as that device if not better. It also uses the same charging connection so I only need to have one cable if I travel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite think about Phillips bathroom electronics are their simplicity and length of time before I have to plug them in and charge them again. Once again this meets my standard. I didnt have to plug in in for a month after opening it (This was on factory charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge cradle is small and fits perfectly in my medicine cabinet sideways with the Razer in it. Storage and allowing it to dry this way are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes apart easy after you figure it out the first time for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin with the appropriate shaving gel and works well in the shower. Waterproof as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have lost any faith in Norelco products!  This is probably the most expensive product on the market, yet its performance is lousy at best!  The cutter is constructed of cheap material, and the motor does not turn fast enough to warrant a good, clean and even trim of my goatee.  The battery life lasts a little over 20 minutes of use - if that, and the performance is considerably weak after the first 5 minutes of use in a full charge, thus rendering it quite useless after that and until the next recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard can never be trimmed evenly when I use this machine, nor can I trim it short enough (stubble), which is what I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is totally useless... shaves NOTHING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another negative: you&#x27;d have to place the trimmer on the holder in order to charge it - which is especially annoying when you travel extensively as I do, and wish to reduce the amount of items and clutter you carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the design is futuristic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: SAVE YOUR MONEY and don&#x27;t even think to buy this lousy product.</li>
            <li> Great. It works. Love it . . This is a great product. Buy this if you really need it. It helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you .</li>
            <li> I bought this and the Multigroom Pro to compare. this one is heavy, and the silver seems nicer, but the weight means it&#x27;s more likely to slip out of your hands in the shower. there is also a larger ridge than the multigroom, which makes it hard to get into the intimate crevices, and leads to some unexpected bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this one is nicer on your counter, but the multigroom is better for close quarters &amp; travel.</li>
            <li> Bought this after reading the reviews. It really works great, doesn&#x27;t nick you up even in the sensitive areas. The charge seems fine as long as you&#x27;re not trying to do your whole body at once. Great product, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am experienced in shaving my chest and groin.  I&#x27; e been doing so for over 10 years.  So, I bought this thinking that the money would be justified by a great trimmer.  It sucks!  I used it straight out of the box after about an hour charge.  It had a full charge after that.  I then attempted to shave my chest and groin area.  I had about half inch long hair on my chest that I had to first trim before the the thing would shave it.  My chest hair is not that thick either. This was strike one.  Strike two was that it is painful to use.  Constantly you will little nicks that, if you&#x27;re like me, will drive you nuts.  The final blow was when it cut my sack.  That was the first and last time I will use a Norelco product.  I will be taking it back today and purchasing a. Braun shaver.  Don&#x27;t waste your money in this terrible product.</li>
            <li> Not everything i wanted in a razor... trims and shaves pretty well but you might have to run through the same patch of hair more than once and in some cases in different directions.. just got it yesterday shaved my legs with it and it did a pretty decent job.. Not a bad razor at all..</li>
            <li> My complaint with other personal groomers from Braun and Remington that I&#x27;ve used is that they sometimes pull rather than cut hair. While that&#x27;s not a huge problem when trimming facial hair or the hair on your head, it&#x27;s a dicey situation when trimming in the more \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco, however, does a great job. Cuts quickly and zero pulling. I mostly use the hair trimming side (the end that has the adjustable length guide) since I only want to keep things tidy rather than go for the full bald effect. It&#x27;s gentle even when using it without the length guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it has independent switches for either end, and that the charging stand is easy to use. There&#x27;s no need to switch heads or use attachments since everything is built-in. That keeps the counter clutter down. Plus, it looks nice, and has a very solid feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to trim in the nether regions, and want to make sure you the process is pain-free, this is the best one out there that I&#x27;ve tried. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very useful &amp; decent value. Wet/dry mode works well and charging stand is easy to use. Overall I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Its a very good product! I&#x27;m using it and i&#x27;m very pleased of the performance. I have a lot of body hair but with BG2040 i&#x27;m able to clean it without any difficulties</li>
            <li> Well, I read the reviews first and can&#x27;t say I was disappointed at all. This thing is a beast, but a gentle one. If your looking for something to take care of your undercarriage (balls, pubes, anus) this thing is the best. It&#x27;s also a great beard trimmer. Yes you have to take your time but when your shaving your balls don&#x27;t you always take a little time?</li>
            <li> Took a chance on this refurbished item as I often do, but got bit by this one.  I purchased this over a year ago had it about a week or two and seemed to work fine, then it came on by itself, wouldn&#x27;t turn off until it drained the battery fully, then it wouldnt take a charge or work again afterward. Luckily I hadn&#x27;t tossed my old razor yet and reverted to using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after the problem (days) Hurricane Sandy hit and I lost power for 2 weeks so the issue became such an afterthought that I didn&#x27;t pursue returning the razor and by the time it crossed my mind I was past the warantee period...  I tossed the razor a few months later and got a new one as a gift this Christmas and I thoroughly enjoy the new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, I like bargains, trust refurbs for the most part and only had minor issues with other electronic refurbs I&#x27;ve bought in the past, but this being electromechanical was probably a bad refurb decision and I&#x27;m out about $50 due to distractions from utilizing the warrantee.  Despite the fact that it had a warrantee, it still would have been a lower graded review since of the inconvenience having to deal with a defective item in the first place.,</li>
            <li> The Norelco Body Groom Pro does work well. A single charge on the battery seems to last indefinitely. Can be used in or out of the shower but I prefer using it out of the shower.</li>
            <li> First off, I must say that if you don&#x27;t know HOW to use the razor to shave your Kiwis you WILL cut up your twig-n-berries, this is not an opinion, this is a fact. This is why I say it&#x27;s not perfect, with that said, once you figure out how to use it correctly you will probably never cut up your frank and beans again. To save you some time, DO NOT try to use it like a hair trimmer, that is the fastest way pain on this thing. You have to hold it PERPENDICULAR to the area you&#x27;re cutting at all times and let the \\&quot;edge trimmers\\&quot; pivot on to your skin. The second the shaver over a 45 degree angle to your skin, you will cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It does shave your sausage and meatballs pretty close, pretty DAMN close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s waterproof so you can use it in the shower, though I suggest you don&#x27;t cause it works best on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The beard attachment is well designed, no extra attachments, it&#x27;s all on there with a click per hair length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The warranty is AMAZING. I literally just got done text chatting with an online representative that took my serial number, purchase date and is promptly sending me a replacement unit with a prepaid send-the-old-one-back box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Dosen&#x27;t hold a charge for too long, you can&#x27;t leave it alone for 2 weeks and expect it to be ready for you to shave a second time, leading me to have to leave it plugged in, which wastes energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Takes a little while to charge, i&#x27;d say at the absolute minimum 30 minutes, and that won&#x27;t get you much cutting time, assuming your fruit basket grows thick lush hair.</li>
            <li> Excelent machine and excelent price, good for every Body for women and men , conhratulation for this machine good luck!!!!</li>
            <li> I used to own the BG2020 until it died.  I thought this model would be a significant improvement over my three year old Bodygroom, but not really.  I still have to make mutiple passes over the same area to get a semi-clean appearance.</li>
            <li> I must be doing something wrong  every time i use it around my  testicles i get blood and bleed a lot not happy might need some help here...</li>
            <li> Should have purchased this a long time ago. After having used this full body groomer, won&#x27;t be going back to any other brands.  Rechargeable and holds charge for a while. The charging dock doubles as a stand and looks great too.</li>
            <li> I just got the Bodygroom today and patiently waited for it to charge before testing it out. I have used many trimmers/shavers targeted towards women and really haven&#x27;t been impressed. They either tug the hair and cause pain, barely trim, or leave really scratchy stubble. I&#x27;ve never been one to actually shave down there because the few times I did it, oh my goodness, worse decision ever!!! Not only was I worried about cutting myself, a day later I would get horrible bumps and be itching like crazy. I&#x27;ve tried the creams to help and other methods to reduce irritation, but I will never shave with an actual razor down there again. It is not worth the day or 2 smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the Bodygroom is perfection. Gentle, easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t irritate? Need I ask for more? I thought the pivoting head might help since us women are a bit curvy down there and it did. Reminds me of my Venus razor I use on my legs and underarms. I went in quite a few directions, only tugged a hair once, I think that&#x27;s because I wasn&#x27;t pulling the skin taught like I usually do. Other than that, I am now almost entirely hair free and the stubble left behind doesn&#x27;t feel like there is a jagged edge. With some more patience I could probably get rid of the leftover stubble, but I don&#x27;t mind it since it isn&#x27;t so blunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy another Remington smooth and silky or Phillips bikini perfect. The men&#x27;s shavers are where it&#x27;s at ladies! I&#x27;m pretty sure my husband will want to use this now though. Maybe I&#x27;ll have to buy him one too. :)</li>
            <li> Have owned it for a couple months. I bought it to trim my hair before an IPL treatment. At first I had false expectations, like it was going to shave as close as a razor. It doesn&#x27;t, it is still a trimmer. However, it does a great job if used as designed. It may nick your skin on lose areas, like your privates, but is a thousand times safer than using a regular razor or a normal hair trimmer, and the nicks are small and unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;The blade on the trimmer will remove any kind of hard hair, it works smoothly and it&#x27;s easy to clean. The saver works fine, it can hurt a little if the hairs are too long, so I suggest using the trimmer first and then the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product! Easy to charge, use and clean.</li>
            <li> Update: I talked to Philips customer service and they send me out a new one. The new one&#x27;s battery life has lasted one year so far and the battery life is now diminising but there is no product that can clean as well as this one so I have upped my reviews to 3/5 stars. If they can get the battery life to last 3 years plus then i&#x27;ll be more than happy to give it a full 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This electric razor is well designed but it has two main design flaws. The first is that the unguarded main razor will cut into your flesh and the battery life is now dismal. Basically...needs a new after every 2 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pathetic battery is the main design flaw and they need a battery that will actually last.</li>
            <li> Great body groom shaver. works well in the shower also.  Easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> Pretty good shaver, seems to be as sharp as ever, doesn&#x27;t tug on my hair or anything like that. I have used it a few times a week for almost 2 years. The outside prong on guard for the clipper side snapped off, I will have to get another one from the mfr. at some point... for $15!!!!     I wish the clipper head was a little bigger like the shaver side, it takes a while to do larger surfaces, like my BALLS :)    It&#x27;s nice that it can be rinsed out, because when tiny little hair dust gets in the trimmer, it slows down a bit and seems like it needs a charge, when it actually just needs a cleaning.    The detent on the lengths on the clipper side is a little sloppy, it seems to just rely on the tension of some flimsy plastic, and has dropped from a 2 to a 1 mid-shave a couple times (but I&#x27;m a little heavy-handed). If you push down while shaving, it will move the guard, so be careful. You can hold the guard in place pretty easily so it doesn&#x27;t move if you are nervous about that. I go with a 1 on the face these days, so there is no threat of it going lower for me.    The way the charger works is pretty nice, but you have to make sure the light goes on, there isn&#x27;t a positive click or anything when you rest it on the cradle.    After reading a few articles and looking at the competition today (I was thinking of upgrading) I have decided to stick with this trimmer for now, it is as good an option you can find out there at this price.    Remember: ladies don&#x27;t want you all hairy down there, more than you want THEM all hairy down there!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: My rating for the Norelco bodygroom is based on my experience with it. I am not representative of all people so please take my negative review with a grain of salt. The Norelco did not work for me, therefore, I cannot rate it highly. That is not a reflection on it&#x27;s build quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the bodygroom to enter the world of being hairless just to see what it was like. I&#x27;ve been doing weigh training and high intensity interval cardio for quite some time. Naturally, I wanted to show off the new physique. I mean can you honestly blame me? I have very sensitive skin so I figured a regular razor was out so, after seeing the high reviews on the norelco bodygroom I thought hey, maybe this would work! Nope. Not for me. Hindsight being 20/20 I should have known better but nothing ventured nothign gained right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now first off, the Norelco Bodygroom is a very, very well made piece of equipment. It&#x27;s solid and durable, not to mention waterproof! None of the parts wobble or are loose. The unit features two ends, a basic trimmer akin to a hairclipper with multiple settings. The trimmer guard is attached to the unit with a little \\&quot;push lever\\&quot; that slides up and clicks in place to get the setting you want. I never used the trimmer, but this strikes me as odd as if you push too hard when actually trimming wouldn&#x27;t it click back down? Perhaps it&#x27;s not the case for most due to the number of high reviews but the thought crossed my mind. The trimmer was a little loud when I switched in on just to see but it didn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest. It&#x27;s a motor. It&#x27;s going to make noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other end is the shaver which has two low-powered trimmers on either end, so you can cut your hair down to a short length before it gets shaved. The shaver worked rather well (at cutting hair), and this is the key, in flat areas. From my experience, the shaver wasn&#x27;t entirely consistent. On some areas of my chest and stomach, it chopped the hairs off no issue; smooth as glass. There are some areas though that this thing just wouldn&#x27;t shave. A particulary troublesome area was the bony center in between one&#x27;s pectorals. The head is too big to maneuver in there. I tried multiple angles but couldn&#x27;t get it. It also just wouldn&#x27;t be consistent right on my pectorals and I could feel hairs longer than the others that it just wouldn&#x27;t want to grab. Now I know that electric razors in of themselves aren&#x27;t perfect, but even if it didn&#x27;t cut FULLY I would at least expect a consistent cut if that makes sense. I could probably blame some of the inconsistency on the fact that I am one hairy dude; I&#x27;d say my hair is pretty thick too so honestly it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the trimmer just couldn&#x27;t handle my type of body hair. Once I was done I knew that the recovery was going to be a nightmare. As I&#x27;m typing this I still have razorburn all over my front. It&#x27;s been awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond this I can&#x27;t review the item any more than my preliminary experience. I ordered this through Target and I immediately returned it the next morning. This review is not to say this might not work for those with much thinner, or much less body hair. In fact it&#x27;d probably be a wonder tool for you. For those of us who are very hairy, I&#x27;d recommend just doing some manscaping with clippers with a short guard or no guard with maximum taper. Save yourself the suffering of it growing back, especially if you have sensitive skin; this thing will give you razorburn like you&#x27;ve never had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up I cannot give this more than two stars beacuse of my bad experience. Again, I am sure it would work for many but it&#x27;s simply not for me. I will stick with my good ol&#x27; Wahl Chrome Pro clippers and just trim it all!sue; smooth as glass. There are some areas though that this thing just wouldn&#x27;t shave. A particulary troublesome area was the bony center in between one&#x27;s pectorals. The head is too big to maneuver in there. I tried multiple angles but couldn&#x27;t get it. It also just wouldn&#x27;t be consistent right on my pectorals and I could feel hairs longer than the others that it just wouldn&#x27;t want to grab.

            <li> Absolutely great!! This trimmer is to be used on the whole body below the neck!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and clean, 5 different lenghts so you can start with the longest and work down to desired hair length!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months and its still awesome. I have coarse hair and it does a dang good job using it dry style. I use the trimmer end if its longer hair, then i go back over it with the other end to get it super close. Good battery life. I wish it were changeable for in the future, or that it could be operated from an outlet.  Other than that it&#x27;s a solid buy.</li>
            <li> So this is a very competent razor with a great handle and easy cleaning. The shaver is pretty difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor makes you feel so comfortable that you can use it anywhere, which is a great achievement. I could not get any use beyond the &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; closest setting so that is all I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great razor but I don&#x27;t think it was worth paying that much for what I ended up using it for so just keep your needs in mind before going for this premium offering.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for facial grooming, etc. I was disappointed the trimmer itself is too big for a fine beard trimming. Plus the buzzer itself is kinda big for edging.  I was hoping it would work for body and face too.  I guess, their original advertisement indicates its for body only.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Still working well after 2 years of use. The blades are still sharp. Very easy to use. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. This was his birthday present. When I asked him how much he liked it and what should I put on the review he said, and I quote \\&quot;Good s*** niggah\\&quot; hahahaha. He likes it, and it shipped really fast. I have no complains about it, except I think they should come with a pouch to store after use and for traveling.</li>
            <li> The device is excellent and meet my expectation, it is as is described, and it is doing his functions professionally</li>
            <li> Ihad one of these and moving the charger was lost having satifaction using this I purchased the same one and still are satified</li>
            <li> This thing is great. I have been using it for about a month now. I am a pretty hairy guy, and tired of being so. This shaver does a great job. I use it to shave my face, trim my mustache, shave the back of my neck, the back of my shoulders, and my back, trim my chest hair(which is thick), and even the hair down below. The shaver has a fine trimmer on either side of the shaver screen. It cuts the long hairs off, then shaves smooth. I use it to shave &amp;#34;the jewels&amp;#34; with no problems. Does a quick, great job. Takes me about 15 mins to do everything, once a week. The adjustable trimmer works great on my mustache and chest hair. I highly recommend this shaver. The charger base is great too. Just set the shaver in the base, and it charges up, then shuts off automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the Mangroomer Pro for my back. Its horrible. Big, awkward, sharp points on trimmer head, does not trim close. Do not buy it.</li>
            <li> This item was for my son, who thinks it is a great trimmer, especially for the price. It recharges quickly and is easy to clean. It gives a smooth shave!</li>
            <li> All-in-one device that makes grooming as easy as possible.  Works perfectly as intended.  Great product from Norelco that should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old and suffered through women&#x27;s razors all my life. I finally wised up and bought a men&#x27;s razor...and I love it! My legs are so smooth, along with everything else I&#x27;ve shaved. Love that I can use it in the shower, too, if I want. It holds a charge quite a while and has all the features you could want. The attachments are built-in, which is great. No fumbling with them or trying to find them when you need them. I don&#x27;t care if it isn&#x27;t pink or dainty looking or that it doesn&#x27;t have a girly name. It works.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got this, thinking it would glide right across my sack taking the hair with it, but no!!!! Every time the foil even touched it it would nick it, then I got really frustrated and jus tryed to fight thru it ( worse idea ever!!!) it sliced my skin, and now I&#x27;m on the toilet as I type this trying to stop the bleeding on the family jewls)&#x27;:, plz if u care for ur groin at all do not get this, use a regular razor and save urself the pain!!!</li>
            <li> It is perfect. You can do anything with it without pain...</li>
            <li> I had the same experience as others here, I&#x27;ve used past models, they shaved great but the blade kept falling off. On this the blade stays in place, but it won&#x27;t cut hair. Good clipper on the other end though.Too expensive to have these issues.</li>
            <li> I KNOW NOW THAT I&#x27;M NOT ALONE WITH NOT LIKING HAIR DOWN THERE. IT CAN BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE DURING WORKOUTS AND SEX. THE BODYGROOM PRO CAN BE ADJUSTED TO TRIM BODY HAIR AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS. IF SHAVING YOUR PRIVATES, PULL SKIN A LITTLE TO TIGHTEN, GO SLOW. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAIN SINCE I STARTED USING. I THINK MY WIFE LIKES THE NEW LOOK ALSO!</li>
            <li> Truly amazing trimmer wet or dry, for the body...neck down.  Time and patience is key when using foil head over sensitive areas, plan a little extra time and you will be amazed with your results.  I read complaints about it not shaving close enough, like shaving your face make sure the pull the skin taunt and again take your time, nicks and cuts can be easily avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second one, the first lasting two years, rechargeable batteries don&#x27;t come with a lifetime warranty on any product  - be sure to replace the foil head and cutting blades every six months to avoid razor burn or hair pulling (ouch), it&#x27;s like any other electric razor, the blades do get dull cutting courser hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still old school when it comes to removing facial hair so I&#x27;ve not used this product on that area of my body, a five bladed shaver keeps my face baby smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Great product: It gets the job done  it would be nicer if the trimmers of the razor side could be used without the razor itself. the trimmer side works great.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;great shave&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Lacks the ability to make a short trimm</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it offers both the &amp;#34;close shave&amp;#34; on one end and the adjustable trimmer on the other.  My only complaint is that the close shave end seems to tug at the hairs quite a bit.  The trimmer end, even on the closest setting, does not get close enough to cut the skin, which is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Ok, let&#x27;s stop beating around the bush. Pun intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking at these reviews, you have an area you are concerned about trimming. Maybe you nicked your balls with a razor. Maybe you yanked some hair out of the shaft with one of those hair clippers. Maybe you burned the living crap out of your taint with some hair remover cream. Whatever, all of that stuff happened to me and more...what can I say, I am a hairy bastard. Not just a little bit hairy, like hunted for my pelt hairy. After trying EVERYTHING, this is the winner. This trims it with no pain, and the form factor is brilliant...no attachments to deal with, just one elegant, minimalist, clean piece of tech. Holds a charge for a really long time.Allows more frequent trims which take much lest time than the semi-annual hair fest you are staging in your bathroom now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it can trim that too. Just buy it.</li>
            <li> Whoever thinks this is the final answer must have no hair to begin with this is just a regular ol foil over norelco with blade that pinch and pull long hairs first this no differebt than trimming with clippers then going over your body with an electric foil over shaver old school norelco crap DOES NOT LEAVE SMOOTH FINISH</li>
            <li> Very light and quiet.  The trimming end works great for trimming your body hair.  The shaving end does not work as well, but will provide a smooth and painless shave with some effort.  Looks great.  Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Well designed and clean groomer. Recommend to every fellow hairy beast out there.</li>
            <li> The blades are rounded making it very smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;It still pinches your ball-sack if you are not careful but that is a risk one must take.&lt;br /&gt;Still, it is strong to shave my head and beard twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery could be better but I am asking for a lot since I only change it once every month.</li>
            <li> It-s just perfect, this product meet all my expectations, for face and body. 100% recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Great groomer! The two ends of the groomer make it convenient to use on any body part and customize the length.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price, does the face too, although, they&#x27;d rather you buy a second of their products...</li>
            <li> Excellent product.... Easy to trim my body hair... I use it twice a month.... worth every penny...</li>
            <li> My son said this is the best Christmas gift he received!</li>
            <li> I have had my bodygroom pro for over a year now and i must admit that the first thing that i am annoyed about is the not so long lasting battery. i can probably get 10-15 minutes after an 8 hour charge. it&#x27;s annoying that i have to time my shaves. they need to improve the battery in this badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also am not a fan of the stand which makes it stand out for everyone to see...it&#x27;s suppose to be a discreet item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the trimmer is great but not that great for leg hair. great for trimming down there and arm hair and arm pit but does not do so well for legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the shaver is great, but i recommend that everyone purchase a norelco shave cleaner. it will keep this shaver in top condition and really get rid of the stuble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the head does not pivot as much as i would like it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, this is the best bodygroomer they have come out with and is excellent for a multiple reasons. but it can be better. i would like to have a little more power and better battery life and pivoting head be a little more flexible.</li>
            <li> If you can snag this for $50, then I say go for it! I actually purchased this item from Target&#x27;s price cut, for $50, because I wanted the convenience of having it instantly. Philips Norelco products have usually lasted me a few years and this shaver is quite an upgrade from their older version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer guard still seems a little cheap and I wish they gave you a backup. Due to the design of the trimmer, it does not have a pointy end and it makes it some times difficult to trim near ears. The aluminum body is a nice touch!</li>
            <li> It has a very good build quality. It does the job perfectly. It has become my everyday shaver and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it in months. One of my many Philips hygiene products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lady and I love this thing.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this groomer and it works well most of the time. We&#x27;ve noticed that the clipper end has always been weaker and looses power much more quickly and than the foil shaving head even after coming off the charger after several hours.</li>
            <li> I know this is kind of a pricey item but worth far more than what you can get for $20 cheaper.  Its made for grooming.  Its light, doesn&#x27;t have a ton of attachments to loose and modern.  I&#x27;ve been  looking for this kind of body groomer for a long time!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the unit.  pulled my hair when used.  did not like the feel of it on my skin. would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like the Norelco BG2040 Bodygroom pro. It does a excellent job of trimming all the areas needed. Great product.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2YR5TCUXZR33P]]This is my second Norelco Bodygroom product, and just like the first one, it stopped working about a year after the warranty ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is supposed to work wet/dry - yet when I described the issue to Philips Customer Service - he identified the issue as \\&quot;water damage\\&quot;. I suppose I can&#x27;t be too annoyed since I did get 3 years of good use out of this shaver. It is a good shaver when it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The video \\&quot;review\\&quot; is what happens to it once it gets water damage.</li>
            <li> Exceptional product.  It removes unwanted body hair efficiently and safely - on any area of your body.  It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> best body shaver for men ever.  It can be used everywhere and anywhere including your sensitive parts.  My friend uses his to trim his hairy ass arms and legs, etc, I use it to trim my side burns and privates.  Battery lasts a long time and being able to use it in the shower on softened skin make it the best man hi-gene tool.</li>
            <li> Was looking for an all around groomer.  For the money, this thing is not worth it.  The foil side is perfect for long hairs, but has lots of trouble cleaning up shorter hairs, takes several passes to get cleaned up nice below the waist.  As far as the trimmer goes, it&#x27;s borderline useless.  It will cut long hairs but that&#x27;s about it. The one plus is they look good on my bathroom counter, design is very nice looking. I found myself going back to my old ugly looking Wahl clippers that i purchased from Walmart for half the price. Heck even my Gillette Fusion Pro Glide with the built in clipper setting does a better job (at trimming).</li>
            <li> GREAT product!!!  Better than I expected!</li>
            <li> SAVES MONEY DOES A GOOD JOB NO MESS SO WHATS LEFT BUY</li>
            <li> This overly heavy and cumbersome body groomer doesn&#x27;t shave wet hair, even though it&#x27;s shower compatible. The only way the hairs will be shaved is if you pull out each hair to be shaved individually. Also, not nearly enough power.</li>
            <li> I received mine a few days ago and have already used it, simply the best thing I ever used to shave my coarse and thick hair without any cuts or bruises. However, there are some flaws that I don&#x27;t understand how Philips didn&#x27;t notice or I am wondering if they know it but chose to ignore it, firstly, there is no carrying case included, so you&#x27;ll have to take that in mind if you want to protect your shaver from accidental damage, or even just to store until you need it again. Secondly, the light is useless, it only lights up when the battery has approximately 10 minutes of power in it, it doesn&#x27;t light up when you put it in the charging dock so you know if it is charging or not, it lights up when the battery is full but then it goes off after 30 minutes. Lastly and the most annoying thing for me is that you have to charge via the charging dock, you can&#x27;t plug the power supply directly to the trimmer, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp trim and it is very quiet.  The microscreen razor is great for close up shaving.  My only complaint, is why they had to make the charger cradle so complicated. It was difficult to get the clippers aligned to the charging prongs. I would prefer a charging jack where you just plug in the chord and forget it.</li>
            <li> I bought this one as a replacement for the first one I had, after buying replacement heads it&#x27;s started to bite and cut in the area&#x27;s that they say it&#x27;s designed not to bite or cut. I replaced the heads twice on that one. I decided to buy a whole new one hoping it would work as great as the first one I purchased before replacing the head on it. Yet this new one came out biting and cutting from day one. I&#x27;m so ticked off because I gave this device great praise when I first got it the first time, I praised it thinking I had found my miracle for grooming those sensitive area&#x27;s without the fear and pain of getting bit or cut and no irritation.  Well all of that changed some how because the heads are not the same as from the very first one I bought because the replacement heads and the head that comes with it when you be a new device are mean they hurt and I&#x27;m disappointed b/c it worked perfectly the first time around.</li>
            <li> it is very good i only wish i could plug it into an outlet i would be able to use it longer otherwise it does a very good job.</li>
            <li> shaver works well and replacement blades are reasonable. unfortunately instead of making it lithium ion they put two AAA NiMH batteries in it. This wouldn&#x27;t be such a big issue except they didn&#x27;t make them removable. if you are gentle you can replace them, but they are not meant to be replaced and it&#x27;s not simple, you have to gingerly pull the contacts off the batteries which are soldered on and then make sure the battery connections are in place and the battery pack is making all the necessary connections along with the connections to the charging prongs. better just to buy one that has a quality battery or allows you to replace them. These batteries held up long enough for me to use it one full session before recharging when it was new. After a year or two they faded out</li>
            <li> Really liked the body groom razor, would recommend this item.  The only problem we had was the replacement shaver had to be replaced already and it is around 29.00 with shipping,</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over two years now.  I have had ZERO issues with it.  It is water proof so in the shower is so much easier and no mess.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  On one charge I can remove excess body hair on 3 separate occasions.  Comfortable, doesn&#x27;t nick sensitive areas........Adding to review after using for a couple of years.  As noted by others, the rechargeable battery is crap.  Need to buy a new one at least every few years.</li>
            <li> As a groomer, this one works pretty well.  It is not effective underwater, as it was advertised to be, but it is versatile on dry skin and is great for neatening up.  The battery does not hold a charge very long, but it&#x27;s acceptable.  My complaint is that it stopped charging after 1.5 years of use, and the cost of a new charging stand is $35.  The cost of the new complete charger is $55, the same price of the new unit! I have been working with the website, but their support is impossible.  Cannot recommend this company.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS! I could not be happier, best purchase I&#x27;ve made. If you&#x27;re looking to get great results I 100% recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you want it to trim you&#x27;ll love it but don&#x27;t except to get a &#x27;close&#x27; shave because this is not the tool for the job!</li>
            <li> I have a Norelco BG2020/31 which is essentially the same shaver head only it has clip on combs for trimming instead of the trimmer on the other end.  The BG2040/34 (here) is probably more efficient for trimming as the clip-on combs require lots of repetitive strokes from all angles, but my review has to do with the shaver portion.  It does shave closely, but as a few other reviews have mentioned, it can cut you regardless of what the manufacturer says.  I was recently shaving the top of my penis close to the base and the shaver took a pretty good bite (1/8 diameter) of skin which took a while to stop bleeding... not to mention it looked like it might be some other kind of sore - think STD!  I use it mostly dry before showering as I have found that it works better that way.  I also have a Wahl trimmer, but doesn&#x27;t shave close.  For the most part, this is the best product I&#x27;ve used for shaving my testicles &amp; genital area as razors are tedious, but I am very cautious and keep the skin pulled smooth!  I&#x27;d certainly be happy if anyone could suggest something better....</li>
            <li> I bought the BG20240 based on positive reviews, but cannot personally recommend. The trimmers did not really trim the hair and the blades on each side of the shaver tended to pull the hairs instead of trim them. I certainly would not use in delicate areas! And yes, I did read the directions. I returned to Amazon for refund.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but I haven&#x27;t found anything better yet. I&#x27;ve had this for almost 3 years and just started having battery problems. The battery problems were typical for 3 year old (cheap) rechargeable batteries. It would hold a charge just long enough for about a single use and then need to be placed back on the charger. Not terribly inconvenient, but I knew it was just a matter of time before that wouldn&#x27;t work. I came back to Amazon to order a replacement and see what other models might be available, but I would have been fine ordering this model again given it&#x27;s performance. In the questions area there is a tip on replacing the cheap rechargeable batteries with 2 AAA batteries. I used the white Amazon basics and I&#x27;m back in business. My guess is these quality batteries will last much longer than 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro-tip: For delicate areas, take your time. Work in layers if you&#x27;re working with long hair. Thinking of mowing the grass, if it were too long you wouldn&#x27;t put the mower on the lowest setting. After continued use, you&#x27;ll see 2 changes. One, you will get better at finding a technique that works for you. Second, your skin will change and be less sensitive to the trimmer.</li>
            <li> This product is better than expected.  I was on my way out when it arrived.  So I tried it on a spot on my chest just to see how it works and I ended up doing my whole upper body and needles to say I was late getting to my appointment.  The ease of using this body groomer is awesome.</li>
            <li> For most of my life, I&#x27;ve been pretty cheap about grooming. But after dreading too long the process of using a regular trimmer to get a sub-par and often painful result, I splurged for the BodyGroom Pro. It was a great decision and the first use was amazingly easy and refreshing. A quick charge on the stand was all it took for a full charge and there wasn&#x27;t a nick on me afterward. The compliments that followed were all the confirmation I needed that it was worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans and stores easily. The design is very sleek and solid, so I look forward to using this for some time!</li>
            <li> Its not bad. It just takes such a long time till you get a decent job done. Dosent shave fast or good. I returned it.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty legit, I can use it everywhere/ anywhere with out getting cut! Some areas are more fragile and require a little technique... Or a soft touch!</li>
            <li> A couple things really stood out to me. Some may think it&#x27;s an advantage or disadvantage depending on how you look at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Duel-End Design:&lt;br /&gt;- They do not cut the skin so they were honest there&lt;br /&gt;- They make the shave very messy (they cut the hairs before the shaver causing hair to go everywhere)&lt;br /&gt;- They allow for a better looking (if you ever have a habit of missing a few hairs these rarely miss a beat) and faster shave (they cut the hairs shorter allowing them to easily be cut by the shaver)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bodygroom Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Very convenient to have this with the shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, being someone who likes to grow out the beard a little before shaving again, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it considering the hassle of cleaning up after each shave from the Duel-End Design. If you shave every day, I would recommend it. If you like to grow it out a little like myself, you may want to think again.</li>
            <li> For this kind of money wouldn&#x27;t&#x27; you think they could have put in a lithium battery? We are in the 21st century right?</li>
            <li> After years of being nicked by electric razors, I&#x27;m glad to have finally found this product. As another reviewer stated, this device truly is shaft, sack, and starfish safe. The fact that you can use it in the shower makes it even more ideal. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As stated in all the other reviews this product is amazing, I didn&#x27;t buy this off Amazon, but I wanted to put my 2 cents in, because this where I got my review for this review, I was a bit skeptical because of some of the negative reviews but all the positive ones helped encourage me to buy it I&#x27;m very happy I did this is all around shaver, it says for below the neck line but I have used it trim my beard, and used electric shave with it to shave my face and was just as smooth as proglide and faster, also I let my nether region grow out for a long time to full length, because the girlfriend doesn&#x27;t like it bald down there and I didn&#x27;t have money for the longest to buy anything that helped, so I was scared the trimmer was gunna pull or hurt and be a total mess, it was amazing the hair came off like a breeze with no pain, and just fell into toliet, this product I definitely recommend to all men it is amazing!</li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco BG2040 is THE BEST shaver I have ever purchased to date. I have owned several other Philips shavers in the past and I will say that they certainly have improved quite a bit! Like the other people have said, this shaver is good for practicably anywhere on your body. I have trimmer my face, hair, chest, back and even in the lower region and it gets the job done. It has a very smooth shave and I definitely recommend buying it! You won&#x27;t be disappointing. I have been using this shaver for the past week now and so far so good.</li>
            <li> This is the only shaver I&#x27;ve had that doesn&#x27;t mess up the groin area. It works very well on all areas including the face. You can tell it is made with high quality parts.</li>
            <li> I like this new razor I got. It was an upgrade after my older one would not hold the blade any longer. The only bad thing I can say is that the pivoting head angle was kind of awkward and in some areas it did not give me a close shave. But I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Guys, I am telling you, this is the perfect solution.  I have been using this for about 4 weeks, and I love it.  The design is great, works in the shower, 5 different length settings and makes total body grooming much quicker and faster than you might imagine.  I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I took the time to write this one because the product is that good.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge and it won&#x27;t even turn on anymore.  Seemed to worked pretty well when it actually worked, but don&#x27;t know what to do now.</li>
            <li> Well the product is great... but you better don&#x27;t need to replace the shaver&#x27;s head ( $20 ) simply absurd !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to replace it since after 6 months the head begins to lose the main net,so no way to continue shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about it.</li>
            <li> It was just what my husband wanted and it did a very nice job.  Having the ability to just turn the shaver from top to bottom to go from shaver to trimmer is really great.  Well worth it.  Got all the body hair off although left a little stubble on chest first time.</li>
            <li> I was using one of those Wahl haircut clipper sets for my \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; for years and would get the occasional cut here and there and sometimes in very sensitive areas so I decided to give this a try.  I cannot be happier.  Even on the lowest/shortest setting on the clippers I never snag my skin and can work so much faster without that worry.  The addition of the foil shaver just adds to the versatility of this device. DO NOT HESITATE.  HIT THE ADD TO CART BUTTON!</li>
            <li> too small to be a decent body trimmer. I can&#x27;t reach most of my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shaver side is completely useless for me,  simply does not shave worth a damn.</li>
            <li> I bought this Philips BG2040 groomer by Norelco on August 17th, 2010 the\\&quot;green blinking light\\&quot; stopped in 2012. I thought possibly since I ran it down to the point the buzzing stopped, I killed the initial minimum battery level. So I  placed it back in the Handle Charger properly to try to recharge itself, NO blinking green light. Only Two Years Old now kaput.! It did a good job for those sensitive areas of fine hair on a man&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li> I give it a four star review bc its my fault that i bought the wrong thing. I wanted a beard trimmer and saw that this was the best hair trimmer, i ignorantly purchased it without taking into consideration the fact that it said BODY GROOM. I used it on my body and works well, the shaving head is a bit too abrasive for my liking but I may be holding it wrong against my skin, idk.&lt;br /&gt;2year update: I bought it in May of 2015, the clipper side has been having issues a about 6 months. The foul side is working as good as ever. It runs out of battery a bit faster than it did when it was brand new. I&#x27;d buy it again but I&#x27;m sure it still has at the very least another year of life left.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Very well engineered. However...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...let&#x27;s just say it works best when the bathroom is cold.</li>
            <li> It is a good razor for body hair, but not great for your face or beard.  I like my beard short and it doesn&#x27;t adjust enough.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do and well. Would give 5 stars, but the battery doesn&#x27;t seem to stay strong long enough, but then maybe it isn&#x27;t made for daily use as I use it.</li>
            <li> It came with a charge.  Once that ran out, it never recharged.  Battery or charger was faulty.  Looks nice, but worthless product.  Unless of course you consider 12 dollars per shave reasonable.  Update: changed from 1 star review to 3 star review.  This is because it only took 5 minutes on the phone with Philips Norelco to get a new one shipped via Fed Ex for free.  Very friendly customer service.  Hopefully the second one holds a charge.  When the first shaver had a charge it shaved flawlessly and was comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Great product! Shave well, long battery life, goes in the water, cannot hurt yourself...</li>
            <li> Great for removing body hair on chest and pubic area ... It is very easy to use and reliable.  Clean up is a snap and battery lasts a long time during use.  More importantly ... no complaints from the gf !</li>
            <li> Just stop looking around and get it.  Everything I&#x27;ve tried was such a waste I never used them twice.  This is so cool with it&#x27;s settings: you really can&#x27;t make a mistake on grooming levels for your hair all over your body. It&#x27;s soooooo easy to set.</li>
            <li> Will be interesting to see how long this one lasts. Had a cheaper model that gave out after about a year or so.  I&#x27;ve been using things like this for about ten years for the clean head effect and they used to last a couple of years. This one is nice and working well so far. It is not really designed to be portable.</li>
            <li> Good product, but as with most gadgets in my house its currently collecting dust. It really yanks on hairs...best used north of the equator.</li>
            <li> The cutting edges are don&#x27;t sharp.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer level she&#x27;s sting is little use. As even level 1 leaves long hair&lt;br /&gt;Shaver doesn&#x27;t give a clean finish and shave</li>
            <li> Update. I have changed my recommendation. You can see my original review below. In short the product does what it is supposed to to and extent. However the main problem is the lifespan of the device. It is designed to fail. The battery had given out and it will no longer charge. It is dead. The worst part is the way it was designed the battery compartment on the inside within the razor is specifically designed to be too small to fit your standard AAA batteries. Meaning you can not fix the dead batteries on your own. In essence by design this device has a short lifespan and there is nothing you can do to fix it. They intentionally crested defects likely for the purpose of getting you to buy a new one.   Alright so I got this guy here. Came already set up. The battery may or may not have any power in it when you get it so I would suggest charging right away. Removes any disappointment.  To the product. Parts remove easily for cleaning and it does exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to. Can be used for shaving almost any area. Guys please do not buy this if you are looking for something to shave your boys with if you catch me. You will have a bad day. However every other area it is great. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I dont know if it&#x27;s going to destroy my privates, did not buy it for that..but, as an all round trimmer, used on facial hair and to trim between cuts, it does work well and battery life seems quite adequate.&lt;br /&gt;I use it dry.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is easy to use, easy to clean, charges quickly and I have never ran out of a charge. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I thought it will be clean and fine shave any where on the body. But it is not. And also the blades are not sharp I guess. I have to couple of times to get clean shave or groom.</li>
            <li> Easy trimming.I use it on legs mainly.Haven&#x27;t used the shaver,though, since I&#x27;ve had a bad eperience in the past and I&#x27;m a little hesitant.Anyway the trimming is really smooth and the results are excellent with no irritations at all.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! Sometimes you buy a product and realize that the product is not the same as was described in the description but with this product is it exactly as described and works exactly as described. Additionally, they said it is for your chest down, well i shave my beard and shave my head with it (i keep my head bald). And I absolutely love the different shavers or groomers. That attachment at the top can cut the hair anywhere on your body (i lost mine, so I have ordered a new Replacement Trimmer/Shaver Foil which is great because when you take it out to clean it, and your careless like I was you can lose it. Ok I&#x27;m going off on a tangent here but this product is wonderful. Get it already!!.</li>
            <li> So far I like the body-groom, even though I haven tested all its features.  I will update my review once I have more info. on its performance.</li>
            <li> Solved my problem and it do work as it says, only problem (for me) is not so comfy but i think i could get use to it.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect grip and materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend ? YES</li>
            <li> So far so good. I think this probably could be improved by having a wider cutting head.</li>
            <li> For the first year of so this was a great product. Then the plastic apparatus holding the top blade on the trimmer broke - it&#x27;s a simple pop out blade, (just apply pressure to the blades with your thumb after removing the plastic thing that controls closeness of the cut) easily replaceable - BUT apparently Philips doesn&#x27;t make replacement blades????? Don&#x27;t know what that could possibly be about...</li>
            <li> I simple love this BodyGroom because it doesn&#x27;t procuce irritation. In the past I have used razors to shave my body but after 2 or 3 days the itching was the worst.. If you want to buy this and pretend to get a super close shave, it isn&#x27;t for you because, it do a really good job, but you could feel a litle bit when you pass over with your hand... For me is just fine.</li>
            <li> it is worth to have. it is very good and safe to be used to clean the down areas. Also it is very good for shaving the face but I found it to be slow and takes time to have a very good shave.</li>
            <li> Phillips as stopped producing replacement parts such as the shaving head that should be replaced every year.</li>
            <li> One year later; operating as intended. No functionality complaints. Ease of use and ergonomic shape make for a great shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.  No nicks and cuts.  I&#x27;ve tried several others and this is by far the best body trimmer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Great motor that powers through coarse hair. Spread skin w fingers so it&#x27;s tight and let this great trimmer mow it smooth.  Happy with this product</li>
            <li> This is an excellent body groomer.  Shaves everything below my waste with no irritation and leaves the skin smooth.  I use it on my chest, back, arms and legs and everything in between.  The best way to groom your junk is do not pull the skin tight and go slow.  You would really have to be trying to cut yourself with this groomer</li>
            <li> This company has made a great product, let it be known. Will update later if problems arise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this one for about one year. Use it for goatee, sideburns, pits, etc.  I infrequently shave my face with it. You need a steady hand around some body parts because this one is not forgiving....OUCH!  The shaver head is just OK. But that is not my priority. The other end works better and is easy to clean. I&#x27;m rarely trying to get really close on body parts so it meets my expectations. The only bad.....the battery. After about 6 months it began to weaken significantly to the point now it is good for about two minutes after a full charge and the the light starts blinking. It also takes forever to charge. I could live with all this if the initial cost wasn&#x27;t higher. Now it seems much more like an extended disposable. Fifty bucks for a year of shaving, not such a great deal. But probably not the worst.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Now....May 2013.....battery completely quits 2 years and two months from purchase. Two months out of warranty, I should have paid closer attention. But still a battery life of two years is pretty weak. I read Wahl has better warranties. Clearly there must be better values out there.</li>
            <li> the shaver was useless. the trimmer was next to useless as it did an uneven choppy job. I got the most effectivity out of the trimmer without its guard. That was better than the actual shaver. Even then it never gave me anything close to a smooth effect.</li>
            <li> This is the best gift ever. It works fine and i like it alot and thanks and good bye and thanks again</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer side (bottom of the device as pictured) is excellent and works very well. 5 stars. The shaver head is a single head shaver with &amp;#34;edging&amp;#34; trimmers on both sides. The trimmers are handy but buyer beware: the shaver is about as rough a shave as you can imagine. It is harsh on your face and would not likely satisfy you for a daily shave. Two stars for the shaver side. The battery lasts forever it seems, and the device is easy to clean. The charging stand is aesthetically pleasing on the counter top which is kind of a nice unexpected bonus. Overall: I had hoped for a shaver that did it all in one gadget. Due to the rough shave of a single cutter head, this one isn&#x27;t it. That said, the beard trimmer does such a nice job it&#x27;s worth ignoring the top side of the shaver if that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re after!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain, gave a quick once over dry, shaved it pretty close, still would recommend using a manual blade for that ultra-close shave, but only after using this and only if needed :)</li>
            <li> The BodyGroom Pro 2040 is a very good multipurpose razor. It works well as a hair clipper and beard trimmer, and cuts all body hair gently and effectively. Cleaning it is about as simple as running it under water.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old trimmer with this for use as a beard/stubble trimmer. Perhaps it&#x27;s just my tastes, but the foil side snags far too much when my beard is on the longer side (1/4th inch) and cuts way to close regardless. I like a stubbled look and this cuts down to almost clean shaven (yet not fully clean shaven for those of you hoping for that) so it really just left me with an ungroomed lazy look. The adjustable side is much better but with no guard on it has trouble powering through my rather thick facial hair. For the price this thing is worth it and all things considered I like it better than the last shaver I had but I could certainly see room for improvement. I&#x27;d buy this razor again, but not before looking around at my other options for something better.</li>
            <li> I had aproblem with battery keeping a charge.  Vendor performed an exchange, seems to be working fine.  Good razor, versatile. Recommend this product and vendor. Great customer service!!</li>
            <li> In a body razor, what else can you ask other than, &amp;#34;Does it do the job or not?&amp;#34;  Well, this product does the job without hurting and is very quick.  I have had no problems with it, and it cleans easily.</li>
            <li> this is a good product, the only thing there may be a question about is the longevity of the product</li>
            <li> Lightweight easy to use, powerful with a close cut. Have used daily with no problems. The charging stand however is a little annoying as the shaver has to be placed a certain direction/way in it, not a big deal but a con, none the less. Would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for a couple years now. It&#x27;s solid and reliable and even my wife has started using it for some of her grooming needs. The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars from me is the battery is a bit temperamental. Don&#x27;t make the mistake of leaving it on the charger when not in use, the battery seems to form a memory and will start to lose power near the end of grooming. I was able to correct this to a small extent by repeatedly turning on the unit and leaving it running until it stopped on it&#x27;s own and not returning it to the charger until it wouldn&#x27;t turn on again. An auto shut off feature for charging would have been the perfect compliment to this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second BG Pro so you can say I am pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One point to notice: this is a small appliance with small motors so don&#x27;t expect it to last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw that the performance decreased last year I did change the foil but I was still not 100% happy so this time I just bought a brand new one and I am very happy I did it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical like many people and scared of it cutting me but I have to say there was no reason for that. The product works fantastically and does what it says. Leaves you smooth like a babies bottom. I would highly recommend this product to anyone and already have.</li>
            <li> The battery life in this trimmer is terrible. I&#x27;m lucky if I can trim my chest before it dies on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This replaced an older version it is good quality. I like the double sided trimmer no more changing heads.  i.</li>
            <li> The design and functionality of this groomer is perfect for anywhere. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year and no complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I own the previous version but the charger good fried while I was traveling in Asia! So, I decided to buy the latest model since the charger for the older one was about $13. The design and ease of use did meet my expectations. But the actual grooming was disappointing. I have a bit of hairy bottom and every time I used the previous model, I had the smoothest shave. I felt like I had a baby bottom from touch. But with the new one, It feels very rough after grooming and feels like it&#x27;s not grooming close enough. So, I tried putting the blade from the old one into the new one and looks like blade from the older model gives way smother grooming / shaving.</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected and more. Absolutely fabulous! Beautifully made. I had gray hair all ovef my chest that I hated, as well as a hairy back which women hate. I wanted this for a long time and was so happy I did.</li>
            <li> I own both the Mangroomer (older model) and this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BodyGroom produces a very close shave similar to the kind of shave you would get from an electric beard shaver on your face. Smooth and soft. The charge seems to last a very long time and the shaving head is replaceable which is definitely a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mangroomer on the other hand produces the same kind of shave you can get if you were shaving your face with a hair trimmer. Pretty much a six o&#x27;clock shadow. So the BodyGroom is definitely the better product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only advantage the Mangroomer has over this item is that it is extendable and you can use it to reach the lower parts of your back if you have hair in those regions. With the BodyGroom you can only reach your shoulders and the upper portions of your back. So if you&#x27;re looking for a groomer for your back you&#x27;ll most likely need the Mangroomer. If most of your hair is on your upper back and your shoulders then the BodyGroom is definitely the better product and the right product for you.[[ASIN:B000HQ0L2E MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver]]</li>
            <li> So I was trying to replace my BG2030 one that fell and broke and so after reading the reviews, I decided to try this out.  It was the newest one and it didn&#x27;t have so many parts you have to keep track of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer worked out great.  I don&#x27;t like a lot of hair so trimming down under and on the stomach worked great.  The only part that was a pain was cleaning it every so often.  As for my back, that was another story.  Because I had the other one my back never gets that hairy anymore...I just shave when it gets noticeable which is every week.  The 2030 is smaller so therefore it was better on the back.  And this pinches my hairs, not screaming pain but pain enough where its get annoying after a while.  I think it has to do with the moving shaver. So my back only got halfway done. I most likely will be buying the previous version of this again.  If anyone could recommend a good back shaver that is not the Mangroomer, thanks in advance.</li>
            <li> Well exceeds expectations!  Close shave with the foil and the trimmer really does the job and has a variety of length adjustments.  The charge really holds and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> Simply the best groomer. Perfect and gave me no scars.&lt;br /&gt;Really really happy with this purchase..</li>
            <li> This body groomer has no attachment combs, I wonder what use it is without attachment combs and yet it is called a body groomer. I ordered this product and found out it has no attachment comb, I am returning it. It is not useful to me.</li>
            <li> excellent groomer.  I can shave everything comfortablly from the neck down.  No fear of nicks in delicate areas and so much better than a razor for the private parts.. 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> I bought this off Amazon after shaving with a value shaver for years. I shave my legs, arms, small area on my chest, and pubic region about every three weeks. I got this relatively fast, as usual with Amazon. I charged it up and was upset I didn&#x27;t find it until now. Its extremely easy to use, safe on ANY region of your body, and not very loud at all. I just use the general grooming side for all my body except I use the foil side to smooth out my arms so they look and feel smooth. Its amazing. I am writing this review years later as I have bought another one(at Best Buy which I paid more for) because this one suddently quit. Apparently it is a problem with this model after a few months of use but I defintaley got my moneys worth out of it. I would suggest buying a product protection plan or keeping the two year warranty information just in case. Overall, you can&#x27;t do better in my opinion if your wanting to keep your body well groomed and don&#x27;t want hurt yourself in the process. Very smooth results as well, but expect to spend some quality time on yourself if you want to look good.</li>
            <li> I am first time user for this kind of product&lt;br /&gt;And the response is awesome&lt;br /&gt;I feel it is basically design for Personal parts only&lt;br /&gt;And for this price it is best deal. :)</li>
            <li> Works very well. Does everything its advertised to do.</li>
            <li> I love the ergonomic shape of the shaver and it works great. After a year, the battery is useless. It has to be charged after every use.</li>
            <li> If you want something practical to keep the brush under control, this is a very good machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has two sides, so one is for longer hair (with an adjustable head) and the other side is for a closer finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might take a little bit of getting used to, but it works just fine after a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Experience far above expectations. Best in class, easy to use and keep it clean. I would recommend it for all future users.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is awesome. My husband used to love his bulky corded Wahl trimmer. Until we got this Norelco BodyGroom Pro which is Super Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE: Cordless.&lt;br /&gt;Long Battery Life.&lt;br /&gt;Two Ended trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Multiple height adjustment&lt;br /&gt;I am probably going to buy a 2nd one of these. My husband is pretty hairy so we usually use up the battery up in an hour (exactly what it promises). It is fairly quiet too which is great.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to get too hot like some trimmers. The blades are easy to clean. It feels lightweight and portable in your hand.</li>
            <li> Honestly this is one of my greatest investments. Not in the fact that it cost me a lot, but for the amount of times I use it and how useful its been, heck yes its an investment! I use it on my chest, abs, inner thighs and bean bag (you know what I mean)...and it does the job well every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to man scape, get on this thing.</li>
            <li> Was a nice gift for my boyfriend. The product is definitely sleek and attractive. He said it worked well for the first few months. Every now and then, he&#x27;s complain of skin getting caught in the wrong place.</li>
            <li> I was looking at myself in a mirror one evening, and it finally truly occurred to me that having neglected shaving my nether regions for 24 years, it was really rather nasty and unruly down there.  So I started looking at my options, and initially I was terrified to make an attempt - horror stories of badly conducted traditional shaving methods and waxing are abundant online.  Even in the stories that result in a non-mutilated and less hairy ending, complaints of excessive itchiness for days to weeks are present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I came across the BG2040 on Amazon, and after seeing the glowing reviews for it took the plunge and purchased it (Not from Amazon, I found a better deal locally)  The unit comes with a charging stand and small cleaning brush to help clean out any excess hair that gets stuck within it.  When you initially purchase it, you&#x27;re supposed to let the groomer charge for a full hour before using it.  Since it was late at night, I opted to simply let it charge overnight.  The next morning I grabbed the groomer, put on my game face, and took the plunge starting to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and have/had never shaved before down there, you will notice that initially you&#x27;ll experience a few split seconds of mild pain as all the hair gets pulled around.  It&#x27;s nothing worse than getting pricked by a toothpick or something equivalent though.  After the first few seconds this feeling resided and to my delight hair was just falling off like mad into the toilet below me.  Obviously you can&#x27;t go zooming with this thing at mach speeds, but the trimmer end (the flat pivoting head) is really great at simply contorting to your shape, and it smoothly shaves around any object you put in it&#x27;s path without damaging anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end it took me about 5-10 minutes to finish.  The groomer is easy to clean, you just pop off the head and rinse it off with water.  I have since used this on 2 other occasions to equally good success.  At no point have I experienced any more itching than is typical when unshaven.  I&#x27;ve tried the device in both a dry environment and in the shower.  While it works in both environments, I prefer using it dry - as it&#x27;s easier to see how you&#x27;re progressing without all your hair being drenched and clinging to your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this groomer to anyone who would like to take care of themselves in a typically inhospitable region to ordinary hygienic devices.e I experienced any more itching than is typical when unshaven.

            <li> I bought this device about 6 months ago.  It was OK.  Never really seemed to do anything great but was serviceable in a few areas.  The battery life was never very good though.  It would last long enough most times but had to be constantly charged.  If I charged it and then let it sit unused it would completely lose the charge quickly.  Well now it appears to be fully charged but only the foil end works the other seems to have seized up.  I have tried to clean it thinking it may just have some hair stuck in it, but nothing seems to work.  So it will be going in the trash and I will get something else.</li>
            <li> I got few peaces of these machine, one for me and rest as a presents. Mine is broken( top part of the shaving head, secure net to protect you from blades) aswell as one of the presents that i gave. Very dissapointed. I cant use it anymore, its cutting my face and i have to shave on a dailly bases since i work in a cruise industry! I thaught that i can depend on phillips an thought that phillips is a good and famous brand. Dont by it, it was a second most expencive machine online and this happened.... So bad</li>
            <li> There is a difference between this and other grooming tools.  It&#x27;s far safer and easy to use than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  You can use it anywhere.  Well made.</li>
            <li> So first off, let&#x27;s talk man to man. I&#x27;m a 20 year old guy, and I&#x27;m Indian. We&#x27;re super hairy, just straight up. I know firsthand that it gets pretty uncomfortable with too much of it when it&#x27;s not only on your head or face. I&#x27;m not really talking legs here, I&#x27;m talking about the place where we take our pride in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first time I&#x27;ve EVER used an electric shaver. I&#x27;ve never used one for my face, always a manual razor (gillette fusion and shaving cream). So it&#x27;s safe to admit that I was really scared. I read almost like 50 reviews, some raved it, some ranted. But here&#x27;s my input from a guy who just started shaving his crotch with an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use cream and a razor, but that was just awful. I wouldn&#x27;t cut myself a lot, but it just felt like I had to be incredibly careful, and afterwards (a day or two) I&#x27;d get horrible razor burns and the itchiness was unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is a Godsend. The trimmer:(which I think works best when your hair and skin is a little moist, but not wet. That way it doesn&#x27;t catch and tug) It&#x27;s great, it has \\&quot;length\\&quot; settings to go from longer to shorter trims. I basically went from long to short since I was a little nervous cutting it with this shaver. No pain at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay great, all trimmed. The shaver now - I think it works fantastically with cream, not so much. It seriously does not give you any cuts. Just don&#x27;t jam the shaver into your skin, obviously. Let it glide with just a little bit of force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works exactly the same as if you used a razor and cream. Ridiculously smooth. Your girl is gonna love it, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can recharge this thing, which is so nice (pretty quick too!) and the full charge lasts about 5 shaves for me. And my hair grows back really fast. Comes with a small brush to clean off the hair, and it&#x27;s easily detachable to clean with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is a perfect shaver - I spent 60 bucks on my first electric shaver because I trusted people buying this from Amazon, so hopefully you can trust my two thumbs up here too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about two years ago and have been happy with its use. It has a good battery charge and has done anything I&#x27;ve asked of it with regards to hair maintenance. However, during a recent move I left the power cord attached to the charging stand, and it somehow got bent in a way that the cord end broke off into the charging station. As a result, I need to replace both pieces. Calling Philips, this was going to come to approximately $40 plus shipping, which to me is ridiculous since it&#x27;s the cheap, non-mechanical part of the device. I&#x27;m probably just going to purchase a new one instead. I like the device and it works well, but the cost of the replacement parts has me a bit sour overall.</li>
            <li> I bought this item back in July 2012. At first I was pretty but not totally disappointed in it. The ability to cut hair to various lengths appeared to not work well but the shaving end worked fine. After I&#x27;ve used this for a while, I&#x27;ve gotten to &#x27;learn&#x27; how and when use the various cutter lengths and am now very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> Works good not going to sugar coat anything i bought this as to trim my pubic area. it gets a nice shave. It will not get it as smooth you will still have a stubble feeling. Also don&#x27;t trim on your balls or penis if you nic yourself it is a little painful and will start bleeding.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine, no complaints about that.  But when i shaved my upper arms and tried to clean up the top of my chest it pulled my hair, very uncomfortable and also left a mark on the lower private area, no fun.</li>
            <li> This thing worked great, did everything as advertised until about 18 months of occasional use when the battery stopped holding a charge. Now it&#x27;s completely bricked, won&#x27;t even charge when plugged in.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this trimmer performs on my thick and often groomed beard. The low rating is due to a battery that will only hold about 3 minutes worth of charge after only a year of use. Buy something else.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to this model of the BodyGroom after having owned the three prior generations of this device.  It has grown in size now, due to the two separate ends for shaving/trimming versus clipping.  Prior iterations of the BodyGroom had a detachable head that you could swap out for clipping versus shaving/trimming, and detachable combs to fit onto the clipper to control the length of clipping.  This newest model has it all self contained on one handle (opposite ends), with no separate heads or combs to attach or lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving/trimming head is improved compared to the prior version, as the head is now articulated (it swings forward and back) to better match the contour of your body.  For those of you that are apprehensive about using this device in sensitive areas - don&#x27;t be.  If you go slowly, and are careful to pull the skin taut ahead of where you are shaving, then there are no nicks, period.  The shaver/trimmer end works well at removing hair while not risking injury to your sensitive parts, a phenomenon that I could never fully avoid despite how careful I was when using a razor with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipping end has a self-contained comb that adjusts via a sliding-locking button to control the length of clipping.  It clips body hair smoothly without pulling.  The self-contained comb works well and is a vast improvement over separate combs for each length on prior versions of this device that could easily be lost or broken when snapping them on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging stand works well for the 1 hour it takes to charge it, and it folds away flat for easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend the BodyGroom Pro!  Fearless body hair grooming, including sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> The shaver/groomer is great, but for one thing: the charger/charging mechanism.  It can only be used on the stand, which is terrible for convenience, space saving, and - of course - travel.  Furthermore, the charging stand is cumbersome and the shaver does not always set right in it.  I&#x27;m torn on my review, because I love the way the shaver works, but the charger is such miserable engineering, I have to go with two stars - I would not order it again.  I would find a similar product, with more convenient charging options.  The designer of the shaving mechanism should be promoted; the designer of the charging mechanism should be embarrassed and should be fired.</li>
            <li> Fantastic body groomer!  Absolutely no irritation.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  My skin looked like a dog chewed on me when I was done. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly as advertised. Believe all the hype, use it right and it is completely smooth and silky, tis all.</li>
            <li> Gets close. The blade does the rest.</li>
            <li> Greatest body groomer I&#x27;ve tried.  The trimmer side can cut hair down to like 1/8 inch but can also leave hair longer.  Works great to keep arms and legs trimmed.  The foil shaver gives a nice close shave and leaves the skin smooth almost like a waxing.  Great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty nice, but it&#x27;s really the only thing I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;ll occasionally tug the hairs, and I&#x27;ve been nick&#x27;d a few times when I was being less than careful. It doesn&#x27;t provide a super close shave, but it&#x27;s a really quick and easy way to take care of the job. Occasionally it will miss some hairs, and it can be really difficult to cut them for some reason,  but the disparity between the hair length isn&#x27;t that big. Irritation is pretty minimal...the skin reddens a bit...but I don&#x27;t really prep my pubic area or the razor; I turn it on, take care of business,  then set it back on the charger. If I were to prepare, there probably wouldn&#x27;t be an issue. I&#x27;ve used it both dry and while in the shower, but I can&#x27;t decide which is more effective/comfortable. I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and it&#x27;s still running like the day I bought it, which is much appreciated.</li>
            <li> It works great in all the hard to reach areas and very easy to use.  Really great product.  Try it</li>
            <li> Purchased to trim body hair and to do a little manscaping.  The trimmer guard can be removed, and the closeness of the trim is just what I was looking for.  Just go slow and take your time.  Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Be careful when using on your delicate areas - the way it removes hair on the foil side is literally by ripping it out. It can sting. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product after you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market!!!</li>
            <li> While I do like the trimmer itself, I can&#x27;t understand why they would set up the charging station like they did. You&#x27;re never 100% sure it&#x27;s set in correctly and there is no light letting you know either.</li>
            <li> Life changing machine. This device makes me feel more comfortable about my body and it gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> This thing must have been made by the gods so that we mortals could be as smooth and sexy as them! I can&#x27;t possibly recommend it enough, what would have normally taken me hours to do, this thing mowed everything down in half the time!  You just have to be careful when you get to the testicles, It&#x27;s easy to get Impatient but you have to go at it slowwwwly, take your time and approach with delicacy and you will have sculpted yourself perfection!</li>
            <li> I just bought this nice little shaver and so far I am pleased with its performance. I read a lot of the reviews on this website and I&#x27;m not really surprised by the negative reviews though, so let me list a few of my thoughts on it.&lt;br /&gt;1- I gave this shaver 4 out of 5 stars.  For something like this to get 5 stars it would have to come with a hot chick (or guy if that&#x27;s the way you swing) to do the shaving for me! I think some people are setting their expectation way to high for a $50 shaver. Ya it is $50 and might seem pricey, but come on a good razor costs $15 or more and you have to replace them almost every month. The hair on a guys body grows in so many different directions that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to be able to get a perfect finish.  If you&#x27;re looking for a baby smooth finish then just stick with a razor. This isn&#x27;t going to give you that.&lt;br /&gt;2- People are complaining that is doesn&#x27;t work well on trimming their beard or mustache. Maybe some people can&#x27;t read the writing on the box where is specifically  says that this shaver is for shaving everywhere BELOW the neck!! You can&#x27;t expect great results in that area when it tells you right on the box that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s for.&lt;br /&gt;3- Finally shaving the nether regions.  This isn&#x27;t something where you just grab a shaver or razor and master the first time!! It takes practice and patience. I was very pleased with its performance down there. I used the trimmer first and then flipped it over to the shaver to finish it off.  No nicks or scratches to be seen!!  Just take your time and like they said get the skin nice and taut haha..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I think it was a good purchase. It doesn&#x27;t give me a razor like finish like I had kind of hoped for but I can shave with a razor if I want that. Trying to shave a weeks worth of growth on my legs or arms with a razor is a nightmare, but if I go over it with this shaver first it shouldn&#x27;t take much time at all!!  I&#x27;m not sure about the battery life though, but if it&#x27;s like most shavers the battery will last well for the first part of its life but like all cordless things out there the batteries are going to deplete over time.  Anyways I hoped this helps you in your decision.</li>
            <li> After reading sll the great reviews on this bodygroomer i decided to pull the trigger. As a big guy with my share of chest hair that i wanted gone i can say this groomer works great. I prefer to use it in the shower as other users say in their reviews. As i use this also in the groin area and i can say it does a great job in delicate areas and i have had no&lt;br /&gt;Mishaps with cutting or pain in the jewel area. I recommend this to anybody who is looking for a great bidy trimmer</li>
            <li> This item has been great.  I have been terrified to put an actual razor blade anywhere near my manly parts, so I had a little trepidation about this item, too, but I&#x27;ve gotta tell ya - there were absolutely NO issues with hair removal down there with the BodyGroom Pro.  Plus side - if you let it get a little unruly, use the other trimmer side first to knock the bush down a bit, then go in with the foil blade side.</li>
            <li> I will say that when this works it is the best body groomer there is. However, that is very rare. I have purchased two of these. The battery life usually only lasts a few minutes. I follow the instruction manual to the T and it makes no difference. For the first couple uses it works fantastic but then it starts to die on you. This has happened to me with both that I have purchased. I tried calling Philips and they don&#x27;t recognize it as a model that they sell. Be warned.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading lots of positive reviews.  Well...  how should I put this....  They must have tougher skin.  I pulled skin taunt like advised and as soon as I touched the shaver side to my bag I saw blood and felt a pinch.  I thought OK maybe I did that wrong.  I tried again with very very light pressure and had a little better result, but basically i don&#x27;t let the shaver foil touch my skin.  Then as for the trimmer edge of the shaver side, that got me too.  I looked closer at it and it appeared that the trimmer itself wasn&#x27;t machined the same on both sides and one side was ok, but the other side had sharp edges.  I had to call the manufacturer and send them the foil trimmer piece. after a couple weeks I received a replacement.  I tried the new one and zap. Another pinch and blood from the foil.  For this to work without injury you must pull your bag very taunt.  I find this a bit difficult while trying to move the shaver around at the same time.  Seems a regular razor is easier and faster and just as dangerous with a cheaper price tag.</li>
            <li> Forget all the negative comments if you focus below your nrck &amp; this will prove to be a good buy!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one did not work for me as there was not enough power nor speed to shave body hair.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time perfectly packed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver/groomer  performs exactly as described in all the five star reviews predicted.  Gets rid of any and all unwanted hair ANYWHERE on my bod, even the very most intimate spots leaving them smooth to any tongue that may stray into the spot.</li>
            <li> As the name says this is not for the face it is for everything else. It is great on the arms and legs, chest and back and under arms. You need no training for those areas. BUT for the groin area that takes a little practice if you are doing it yourself. DON&#x27;T get in a hurry take your time. IF YOU DO HURRY you will come up with  some NICKS where you do no want them (and they hurt!!!!!). So go slow. Don&#x27;t do the groin all in one day, do it over 2 days. Less chance of razor burn. REMEMBER that area has not seen the light of day since you were 11 yr. old. OH, one other thing, I BET your partner put you up to this, isn&#x27;t that right!! If me/she did, give them the BodyGroom and you just lie back and enjoy. Here is a tip, make sure you partner is in a REAL GOOD MOOD if not get some Band-Aids READY!!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried, picked this over a mangroomer.  It takes some finess to get comfortable, but this thing rocks.  You want that nice smooth look, especially the boys, this is your go to.  Best in the shower with soap.  The trimmer has enough settings for your beard if you want it for that as well.  Overall, its worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this device from two month ago. I used for my chest and armpit. It does what should do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;strongly recommended</li>
            <li> Wet and dry.  Use in the shower without fear.  The charge lasts for a long time.  Many months between charges for me.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the manscaping. Works very well!! Way better then my basic shaver I used to use. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> very good. This product absoluetly matched my expectations. It is really convenient to use on your body. I recommand to all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other guys problems were using the thing. I love it. Best shaver for the twig and berries I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year, its been decent for trimming, but definitely does not give a smooth feel at all for those who are hairy. The battery life is terrible, 20minutes tops so you pretty much always have to keep it on the charger. I do not use this on my shaft or scrotum, razor is much better for that area and much less likely to get cut. This is just good for trimming large areas like chest, pubic area, and good for butt with a lot of shaving cream. But never expect silky smooth, anywhere, with this shaver.</li>
            <li> and it was just an average shaver.  Would not pay this much for this product again.  Overall, I&#x27;d say buy the cheaper electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good body groomer that could also function as a shaver. This product had the accessories but not the capability. Using it for really anything caused tug and pull on the hair. I don&#x27;t have the long of hair to begin with but it wouldn&#x27;t be able to cut through it in one, two, even three passes. I&#x27;d recommend buying a heavy duty hair clipper and then using attachments to get the desired look you want.</li>
            <li> like I said in the title... you take this razor to your nut sack and it doesn&#x27;t totally tear it up. what more can you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and yes, I alternate between my crotch and my face and it&#x27;s still all good!</li>
            <li> This tool is so handy, sturdy, and attractive.  It works great and the charger is stylish enough you can leave it out on the counter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got that bald with a goatee look goin&#x27;. This makes it easy to catch up before a shave, and 1 second later trims my beard perfectly, then under the faucet for a rinse. Much better quality than others I&#x27;ve purchased including Wahl. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like the razor. It really gives you a quick and close &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; of everything you will need to use it for. BUT, for my unit at least, the battery life is an extreme disappointment. My battery on a full charge lasts no more than 6 or 7 minutes. I always have to stop halfway thru the job, recharge the razor, and finish the job the next day. I really can&#x27;t stand that... The razor has always been this way. I just came back here to read the specs, and laughed when I saw its supposed to last 50 minutes. I probably was shipped a defective unit</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing!  It takes me from hairy beast to sexy stud quickly!  I use the trimmer to taper down all my hairy body parts to a respectable length and the shaver part to keep my back baby smooth and pre-adolescent.  Good battery life, I love the charger, and its water proof!</li>
            <li> I shave my balls with one side and my face with the other. Its probably gross, and I don&#x27;t care. It works well.</li>
            <li> This shaver works well. Far better than the VS Igroom i had before it. Removes longer hair very easily but still does not shave as close as a razor and takes quite a while to shave effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Works best dry. Does not seem as effective in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Very good if you have sensitive skin as you can shave every day if you want and it leaves no rash at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Australian buyers keep in mind that it comes with an american power plug and requires an adapter (about $5.00 off Ebay)</li>
            <li> I think I red most of the reviews last year when I bought this piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;I tried wet shaving with water, with shaving cream, shaving gel and dry shaving. the bottom trimmer always causes me to bleed if I shave down there when taking the guard off. I cant erally keep the guard on because it wont get some hairs at all. The top one cuts the hair really short causing skin irritation and redness, sometimes the edges trimmer causes me to bleed too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really sick of this shaving thing. I used hair removal cream yesterday and it didnt work (it kinda worked before but not this time and my skin got really irritated) so I have to get rid of the deformed beaten hair but just looking at this trimmer (fully charged) makes my precious marbles crawl up in their sack trying to hide from this blood hungry monster.&lt;br /&gt;I know its one of the best.. It should be right? with all the reviews and recommendations?? well, that&#x27;s the only reason that made me choose this one but it simply didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Recommended 100% built to last does it&#x27;s job very well and for its price could be considered a steal don&#x27;t think twice</li>
            <li> First one of these I owned lasted about 3 years which seemed satisfactory for heavy use.  The second one only lasted 3 months and today decided not to turn on no matter what I did or how long I charged it.  Probably bad unit but I am still out $70 on something that should at least last a  year or so...</li>
            <li> This tool is exactly what a men&#x27;s body grooming device is supposed to be. It is simple to operate, easy to manipulate and effective.</li>
            <li> spectacular in everything but the following downsides:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- there should be a finer level for the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;2- the 3D pivoting head can still have improvements especially when handling the groin area, one should take his time and get used to maneuvering/handling it more.</li>
            <li> Economical price, found as described and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple, fabulous and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended, will deal again in future for sure.</li>
            <li> Eazy to handle and quick to charge.  However,  the charging stand is awkward and tippy.</li>
            <li> The machine doesnt almost shawe your body it only cuts a litlle bit of hair ( with the wide part ), its not a bad product but -  for Philips and 2014 technology i say its a waste of money</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll use this trimmer a couple times a month.  I use it to trim my sideburns, neckline, chest hair, and hair below the belt.  It really does a good job doing that.  The only problem I have with it is that it can&#x27;t hold a charge, and it takes FOREVER to charge it in the first place.  Which wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if you kept it plugged in all the time, but I don&#x27;t have the counter space or the need to waste electric.  What normally happens is I forget to plug it in until it&#x27;s too late.  A 20 minute charge will get you about a minute of shaving time, and when you&#x27;re trimming all over, that&#x27;s just not enough time. So, that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars instead of five...the crappy battery.  I also never use the &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; end, only the adjustable trimming end.  If they would replace the shaving end with a cord...that would be my ideal trimmer.</li>
            <li> To be clear, I have only used this product four times at this time of this writing.  I have, however, garnered a good sense of it&#x27;s capabilities and drawbacks.  First, this is the best grooming product I have used to-date.  This thing has the capabilities to power through dense hair growth without the need to constantly clean out a razor blade, and has the added benefit of not irritating my skin.  The head is a typical electric razor head with shears on either side.  This allows for with or against-the-grain shaving that generally clears all of the hair in one pass, and without the need to use two different tools to get the job done.  Like any electric razor, you are not going to get a razor-blade close shave, but the difference is negligible unless you absolutely need to be baby smooth.  I have not had the misfortune of running out the battery at this point, so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s longevity; however, you have nothing to worry about even if you shave your entire body in one session with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve raved about the product, allow me issue a warning to those who, like me, groom their groin area.  As I previously stated, this has a standard electric razor head with shears on either side.  This means that it is fantastic for smooth skin, but not for wrinkled skin.  It is safe to use on the pelvic area, upper thighs, and the crease of your thighs.  It is not however safe to use on either your scrotum or shaft.  Any experienced man-scaper is familiar with the erect and stretch methodology of shaving this sensitive area, but this product is not even safe to be used with that method.  While I didn&#x27;t incur any serious injury, I was cut several times while attempting to use this device.  For those wishing to shave these particular areas, you&#x27;re going to want to stick with the razor blade or standard electric razor head.  Admittedly, I glanced over the manual, so it might issue a similar warning that I missed.  In either case, you have been warned.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality and precision product.  It works perfectly for manscaping.  It is safe and easy to use.  It looks, feels, and handles great.  It does not pull or nick.  It just glides over the skin.  I had been using a Wall clipper but that was a bit dangerous on raw skin.</li>
            <li> The shaver head is a bit of a pain to keep clean, but the waterproofing is absolutely fantastic. The battery lasts a long time between charges, gives ample warning if low charge, and charges quickly. Have an extra shaver head blade on hand, the foil will eventually wear out and become unusable quite suddenly.</li>
            <li> Not the same as shaving- no way, but as close as you can get to it without shaving.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I&#x27;ve only used one other body groomer before this one. I don&#x27;t want to mention the make of the other one for negative publicity but Philips Norelco is definitely the superior one! I absolutely love the fact that you dont have to keep it plugged in for ages to clip two inches of hair! It literally works for 50 min after one hour recharge! It&#x27;s got quite an ergonomic design and overall I&#x27;d rate it as outstanding. As for the Amazon services, I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the shipping but it&#x27;s such a pity that Amazon doesnt have an Australian online store (it&#x27;s only Kindle store). Please consider the Aussie market, you&#x27;ll have many buyers. This also helps prevent our banks charging us exorbitant exchange rates.</li>
            <li> Less than two years after purchase, the rechargeable battery is dead and it no longer works properly  - also the microscreen end is virtually impossible to clean.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good enough for 15-20 minutes of use, but you definitely need to charge between uses. Not really powerful, but works well without the guard to trim down an already thinning dome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have given it 4-stars, but I think the screen on the shaver side is rather delicate as it was damaged with no apparent mishandling in the first few weeks. It costs $15 to replace, and isn&#x27;t covered under warranty. So, be careful when travelling with it since there is no head cover for the shaver.</li>
            <li> VERY nice BodyGroom blade!  I have to give it a 5 because the product is GREAT and the cost is more reasonable than the other expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Good product. I have been using it for my chest and legs. I would say it gets done about 80% of the job. I didn&#x27;t got any cuts, just make sure how to move it against your body and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Works well in and out of water. Charges fast and does a good close clean shave in all areas you need to shave</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, very safe too use and looks durable.</li>
            <li> Perfect for getting rid of hair anywhere you need haven&#x27;t cut my self with it yet and it works like a charm good battery and leave little to no stubble</li>
            <li> i ordered this to some of my friends and co-workers and they all liked it.</li>
            <li> I searched the net for a while to find a decent machine but many of the reviews were discouraging and conflicting. Anyway after some months I decided on this one. I bought it for me (not a man) lol. It works very well. I use it on all the regular areas women shave. I&#x27;ve only ever used it to dry shave. It gives a close shave (obviously not as perfect as with a razor blade). I would definitely recommend it and buy another if it&#x27;s still on the market when this one needs replacing. So far I&#x27;ve had it for 8 months. I haven&#x27;t had to replace the head yet and it still works as well as when I first started using it. It charges very quickly (in less than an hour even though charging time says an hour). The charge holds well too. I&#x27;m hoping Philips keeps making products like this as I know in the world today it&#x27;s all about making a fast buck, make a product to last only so long so that ppl have to go out and buy another within a short time frame. My last machine was also a Philips but it was an ancient model (something from my parents era) lol. The quality was very good too.</li>
            <li> Great product... for a while.  I like the wet/dry and as long as you&#x27;re careful with the clipper guard it won&#x27;t slide while clipping.  Be careful not to keep your thumb on the slide as you&#x27;ll drop down to lowest guard by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after a year or so the batteries don&#x27;t charge and it&#x27;s only good for a few minutes of underpowered clipping.  I&#x27;m going to attempt to replace the &amp;#34;non-serviceable&amp;#34; batteries myself as a few others have to see if I can salvage some life out of this thing but the batteries that came with it were just terrible.</li>
            <li> It does a good job getting all the hair, but as you &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; it over your skin, the hair it is shaving sort of collects under the buzzer and then causes the blade to start nicking your skin a bit.  If you are shaving your back or chest, this hurts a little.  However, if you want to shave in the &amp;#34;more sensitive places&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m very scared about what might happen.</li>
            <li> I liked the design but it did feel like it pinched the more delicate areas as per my sweetie&#x27;s critique</li>
            <li> This is my second BodyGroomer.  I only bought it because I lost the last charger when I moved.  I am still using the original BodyGroomer but with the new charging cord.  It&#x27;s been About four years now and the original is still going strong.  The price of the second one was worth it because I like this groomer THAT much!</li>
            <li> holds a charge good, razor burn is very minimal, works good in the shower, works as good on the tree as the yard. the charging stand is a little flimsy, but works</li>
            <li> My husband loves this gift. He said the razor is very comfortable and easy to use and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> This is a rather pricey groomer, but it&#x27;s great quality.  Definitely pay more to get the swivel head like this one has.  I have quite a bit of body hair and it&#x27;s not the smoothest.  This can get a decent smooth shave in just about any location on the body.  However, with my thick hair it comes back pretty quick and isn&#x27;t the smoothest the next day. It would be great for someone with thinner hair.  I definitely enjoy the product and will continue to use.  It can be used in the shower or out; however, I find it works better on a dry body.  Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  This body groomer does a good job.  The battery last awhile &amp; it works in a variety on situations.</li>
            <li> this thing works great i was very suprised when i used this. the first time was a bit tricky getting the right angle but after i figured that out i couldnt be happier</li>
            <li> I had been using my Norelco 3 rotating head shaver all over and it worked well, but I decided I wanted to try something made for below the neck. Far below the neck.  I had tried the Body Bare shaver, but it is only effective as an after-the-shave shaver and managed to nick me.  I have to admit I was a little concerned about buying this groomer, given some of the reviewers complaints abou the edge blades.  Those reviews made it sound as if one would be taking an electric hacksaw to his nether regions.  But, since the good reviews far outweighed the bad ones, I decided to go ahead.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  It does a very good job for an electric.  No electric will shave as close as a manual razor, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re expecting, don&#x27;t bother. Having said that, it gives a very close shave. No ingrowns, no itching.  Compared to the 3 head Norelco I have been using, it does give a somewhat closer shave.  But, if you already have a 3 head Norelco, I can&#x27;t say this is worth getting, unless you don&#x27;t like the idea of using your face shaver elsewhere.  Back to the BodyGroom:  It does an admirable job of shaving smoothly and closely everywhere in the nether regions, without nicks or other drama.  About those side cutters --- I don&#x27;t see how people are getting cut by them.  It&#x27;s not like they are a set of exposed teeth.  Even when not placing the shaver properly, it didn&#x27;t give the slightest pull or nick.  I also like that both the shaver and trimmer can be cleaned by washing them off.  The charger stand is a bit gimmicky, but works fine.  Quite a few of the negative reviews referred to very short battery life.  Unlikely as it is, I wonder if those people perhaps didn&#x27;t read the instructions?  One thing a little unusual is that the instructions state that the shaver should NOT be charged after each use.  Rather, the battery should be allowed to run down almost completely before recharging.  The problem with that is the charger also serves as a cradle for the shaver.  It is therefore tempting and logical to want to put the shaver in the cradle when done with it.  Of course, one can unplug it and use the cradle that way.  Since most such electronic devices suggest only perodic run-downs, it&#x27;s a bit of an annoyance.  Having said all this, I have only had the unit a few days, so I can&#x27;t comment further on the battery life.  To summarize, if you are looking for a body groomer that shaves very close, is forgiving of its use, doesn&#x27;t cut, pull or irritate your skin, this is a good one.  If you are looking for a wax job, you won&#x27;t get it.ore tempting and logical to want to put the shaver in the cradle when done with it.  Of course, one can unplug it and use the cradle that way.

            <li> Its great I don&#x27;t have any problems with this amazing body groomer ^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for every man that would like to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, for now. There was another one I should have bought instead. But for now it will have to do.</li>
            <li> The over all fit and feel of the device is great. That said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top trimmer had a real problem catching my fine chest hair. It also didn&#x27;t cut it very short. The hair wasn&#x27;t visually noticeable, but you could still feel it. The bottom trimmer was awful, having to pass the same areas over and over to get an even trim. I would also not trust the top trimmer to be used in your &amp;#34;ahem...area&amp;#34;, it catches skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to make a good every other day basic trimmer, but doesnt even come close to waxing, razor shaving, or even a good electric razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for over 2 months and I can&#x27;t say anything negative about it.  It works like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Shaves well and works well but the battery life is pretty bad.  If i leave it unplugged at all it will die whether in use or not.</li>
            <li> This thing is absolutely incredible!  For so long I&#x27;ve been struggling to trim and shave my boys (down there ;)) yet I&#x27;ve always nicked myself so many times.  I had come to realize that that pain wasn&#x27;t worth it so I stopped only when I didn&#x27;t need it trimmed.  Then I came across this product by accident.  I was a bit skeptical but reading all the great reviews from users like myself I gave it a shot and boy oh boy!  I&#x27;m not looking back.  My troops are smoother than a baby bottom.  I can&#x27;t believe it.  Now I don&#x27;t have course or thick hair down there so I&#x27;m not sure how good of a job it will be for u men but I have to tell ya please if your interested and wanting your boys nice, clean and shavin down there it&#x27;s well worth a shot.  I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.  The thought of shaving bumps, itching, and scratching down there after a wet shave turned me off totally so I always used clippers to get as close a shave down there as possible.  Try it, I really don&#x27;t think you will regret it.  Amazon has an awesome return policy so if your not satisfied you can always send it back.  Happy shaving(below the belt)! Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who are complaining about the foil side yanking out hairs, I experienced this as well, however I figured out that you must trim the hair down with the razor end first if its too long for the foil side to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed by the size of the razor, I have an older Phillips one that is quite a bit smaller, and I&#x27;m sad that the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, this razor does an awesome job, I use it on my face and for body hair and I am very happy with how it performs.  The foil side does a good enough job that I don&#x27;t have to use my traditional wet razor very often anymore.</li>
            <li> One of the best body groomers I have used so far. I have been a true Philips Norelco fan since beginning - but this product made me vouch for it to all buyers.. NOTE - It will work in all voltages (power supply) from 100-240 V... great and must buy product ! Gotta use it to feel the difference ...</li>
            <li> I bought it after reading other reviews from Amazon. And yes, the reviews don&#x27;t lie. Its amazing! Easy to use, safe and can be used everywhere.</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer! Worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> Simple to use, very smooth shave without irritation and good battery life.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to shave my legs, removing lot of hair. It works better out the water, in this way it doesn&#x27;t get stucked with foam an hair mix, saving lot of time!&lt;br /&gt;Very safe!</li>
            <li> E o melhor do mercado. Facil de manusear, excelentes laminas e permite aparar os pelos com facilidade. Alem disso, possui varios tamanhos de corte. Muito bom.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.. This is the latest in their line of groomers. By far the best.&lt;br /&gt;Love the new charging station and self clean..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for male grooming. It&#x27;s a huge benefit being waterproof u can take it the shower with u and do all ur grooming and clean it at the same time</li>
            <li> The comb doesn&#x27;t fall out of place (which makes trimming a lot faster and safer(, it is much smoother, and there are now 5 trimming sizes opposed to 3! The item is a bit expensive... but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Purchased in February 2012, and they battery completely died in January 2015, which puts it out of warranty range. Note that because it charges only while in the cradle, it is totally uselessl once the battery dies. I&#x27;m disappointed that the battery is not user-replaceable and I have to buy a new trimmer.    That being said, the device worked well enough for about a year. The battery then seemed to lose it&#x27;s charge after about 30 seconds of use.</li>
            <li> The unit seems well designed and works well so far.  It works well for the personal &amp;#34;landscaping&amp;#34; it is intended for without any nicks or cuts.  Given where it is intended to be used it is great that it trims only what it is intended to trim.</li>
            <li> awesome all around body trimmer and shaver would recommend this to anyone. Great idea to get an all in one.</li>
            <li> Aright...so I have a decent amount of hair on myself and its pretty thick as well,&lt;br /&gt;but with all that said this machine is GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it sensitive areas between my thighs, under, on the scrotum, between the cheeks&lt;br /&gt;over under and all around...i&#x27;ve not cut myself and i&#x27;ve not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this investment and think you&#x27;ll be too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its got a great clipper and a great shaver...both ends work well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he&#x27;s very pleased with it.  I can&#x27;t give a full review, obviously, because I&#x27;m not the one using it, but he&#x27;s used it several times and seems satisfied...and he&#x27;s difficult to please with these types of products.</li>
            <li> Superior to older models. Good battery life, shavung head stays in place well, easy to hold, close shave.</li>
            <li> very good thanks for sending greetings from Venezuela all perfect very good thanks for sending greetings from Venezuela all perfect</li>
            <li> OK, let&#x27;s be serious. Guys are wimping around saying \\&quot;down there\\&quot; and how scared they were to try it. Forget it. You can use this to shave your legs, armpits, chest, back, and yes, around the penis and testicles. You can even shave your butt and buttcrack. It works as advertised. You might want to be careful around sensitive areas, but that&#x27;s common sense. I mean, if you somehow eunuch-ize  yourself with this, it&#x27;s probably your own fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this works on tough hair, though mine isn&#x27;t all that thick, so gorilla-types may need more. The results are great, and my S.O. loves the feel and looks afterward. I started out just shaving leg as a cyclist, then chest and underarms when I got back into weight training, now it&#x27;s just as well to shave it all.  Or let my S.O. do it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a year.  I don&#x27;t use it as often as I could, but it&#x27;s always charged and ready to go.  I&#x27;ve used all of it&#x27;s functions with all of the different adjustments and it has all worked well without one mishap.  I remember reading reviews and comments over a year ago before choosing this unit, some quite entertaining and some rather awkwardly juvenile descriptions of \\&quot;your junk\\&quot; which were were also sometimes entertaining, as least as far as being in a locker room can be.  Don&#x27;t be afraid boys.  This grooming implement won&#x27;t hurt you.  I can&#x27;t think of a design that would work better all around.  And when you think about all the functions this item offers it&#x27;s not overpriced.  Being cordless is wonderfully freeing.  Go for it.</li>
            <li> I have had this since 2010. I have also had it replaced once by Phillips warranty. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It works well actually. Except for the fact it will die before I am done using it. The charge just doesn&#x27;t last at all. It takes a whole night charge the thing. I use both sides of it and it works great. Eventually the power just starts to give and it slowly dies before I am done using it in one session. I got a replacement from Phillips which did the same thing after a short while. Initially when I get each time the battery is great. Just doesn&#x27;t last though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be looking for a different product in the future to serve my needs. Maybe one with a corded option would be nice as well?</li>
            <li> Despite very little use and fewer than a dozen charge cycles, this thing won&#x27;t recharge. Would not buy from this manufacturer again. It&#x27;s also quite fiddly to keep in the cradle for charging, and the thing can&#x27;t be plugged directly in, so even if it&#x27;s only the charger that died, the whole thing is now unusable. Bottom line: bad design and poor performance for a rechargeable appliance.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  Didn&#x27;t hold a charge and I ultimately threw it away after just a few uses.  There is a market for a good bodygroomer but this one sadly misses the mark.</li>
            <li> Great tool for any man not wanting to look like a wooly mammoth!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product.  It is a waste of money and does not do the job properly.  I purchased this item because I wanted to something to serve as a beard trimmer for the little bit of the year when I need that and as a shaver for the majority of the time.  The trimmer works, although it is not that great, but for a two in one that is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the shaver is another story.  With my old Norelco, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with a few days worth of growth.  However, with this, there exists levels of hair that are too long for the shaver and too short for the trimmer.  What is too long with this was not too long with older Norelco models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now even when trying to use the edging too, it will catch hairs on your face.  Today was the final straw though as it latched on to hair that should have been short enough to shave and cut my face.  Electric razors should not gash their users.  If you shave every day, this is a good tool to use, as it gets a good close shave.  If you are more infrequently than that, stay far away from this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the adjustable large trimmer not for body shaving.  It&#x27;s powerful and very sturdy build I&#x27;m sure it will last long.  Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for long but takes like 15mins to charge so that&#x27;s not too bad.  The body trimmer head-end doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be real great but I don&#x27;t really know.  Overall a little pricey for what I really needed or use it for but then again it&#x27;s more for the body hair trimming purpose but I don&#x27;t shave my chest or back or legs soooo yeah, there you go.</li>
            <li> we all know why we buy this! Youll feel safe and gets it close enough without making you bleed. i LOVE IT</li>
            <li> As the old saying goes, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34; This is a quality shaving unit, and will complete any of your body grooming tasks! I also own a Phillips Norelco which I have had for over two years. All I do is replace the head and blades once a year, clean and charge the unit. I have to say Phillips does make some quality products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve clipped my nuts twice. Not quite the hype I expected. Still use it today.</li>
            <li> I had to take some time to review this item because it is in fact the best Grooming System I&#x27;ve bought. I won&#x27;t review this item per say, because there are some good reviews preview to mine. I will emphasize that this item is very smooth, easy on your skin and easy to maintain. My experience so far has been excellent.</li>
            <li> The concept of this product is great.  However the battery lasts for roughly five min for me.  I&#x27;ve had it for a long time and that is all it has ever lasted.  I am going to buy a new trimmer, just not this one.</li>
            <li> This product is really good.. i mean really good. If you are looking for a body groomer don&#x27;t look at any other products, go with this one! It shaves and trims smoothly without any problems.I did though Knick myself where the sun don&#x27;t shine, very minor, but at the same time you cant expect a product that is absolutely perfect.Just be careful and take your time down there gents. Over this product is GREAT!</li>
            <li> Great Produt, great built, battery last a good time. Haven&#x27;t had any problems so far. I been using it fo a couple of months . Will defenetly recommend it for does who need some trimming down under. You can also use it under your arms for does of us that practice water sports like Paddlig.</li>
            <li> good product. Worth every penny.  been looking for something like this for a long time, and love the functionality.  read the other reviews, and it is even better than i expected.</li>
            <li> On the first one the trimmer didn&#x27;t work. The replacement would stop running every 10 seconds. The second replacement now does the same thing after using it about three times.</li>
            <li> Wonderful item! Believe it, works quite good! One of the best part being an international traveler is, it has supply voltage range! Happily use it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost a year and find it to work well for triming beard and what ever else you may choose to trim. While I do not use it in the shower, the ability to run water over it to clean is terrific. I would recommend this product, and I would consider buying it again when the time comes for replacement.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty amazing. I used it as directed in the manual in the shower, and practically one-handed (due to incapacitation of my left arm from a motorcycle accident). I went with the dry-shave method as described in the manual which was to wash areas off with soap and water then dry off before using the groomer. I&#x27;m a dude and I used it on my nipples, chest, stomach, armpits, and the entirety of my private parts. I only felt a couple nicks, but they were VERY minor and no blood was spilled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model since it came out and it&#x27;s perfect for all your trimming needs. This is my 2nd unit, I replaced the first one after the battery life dropped to about 5 minutes per charge. Unfortunately I had the same problem with the replacement unit after a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately though, I was able to replace the batteries in my unit with much higher quality rechargeable batteries and now it works like a dream. It wasn&#x27;t terribly difficult to do, I posted a guide on iFixit for those interested. Now I&#x27;ll be able to use this unit for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps others experiencing battery life problems and I hope Philips/Norelco use better quality batteries in future models.</li>
            <li> I have a Panasonic ES-LA63 full size razor that I use for my face and some on my body but it&#x27;s head is wide so I thought the BodyGroom would be an alternative with a much smaller head. While the head is much narrower the trimming blades don&#x27;t retract which makes it a little tough to get into all areas. It also doesn&#x27;t turn as many RPM&#x27;s as the full size razor which means it has trouble with the occasional single , longer than stubble, hair. But overall it does a fairly good job. It has a good curved shape that allows you to reach most places. It has a very strange charging system where you actually charge up the stand that it sits in. There are two contact points where the razor sits in the cradle on the stand to stay charged. You think that there&#x27;s no way it will stay there without falling out but it doesn&#x27;t. It holds a charge for an incredibly long time. Since I don&#x27;t use it everyday it will hold a charge for nearly two weeks.</li>
            <li> Works well for a lady!</li>
            <li> Works perfect, everything you need from a body groomer. I bought a male one, even though I am a woman and it is gentle enough and with all the power I wanted. The ones for girls take a life to charge and battery dies too soon.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that cuts closely and cleanly.  Easy to maintain.  Adjustments are easy and charging station is efficient.</li>
            <li> I can not express how disappointed I was by this product. It felt like I had shaved with a razor, and then let the hair grow out two days. My skin was very rough after shaving. Not only was it a bad shave, but it was also much slower than a regular razor. The clippers work well, but I recommend just buying better quality hair clippers for a lower price, and then using a normal 4-5 blade razor for shaving.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband. It is very easy to use and works very well. It also works in the shower. Be careful because the clippers are sharp and I accidentally nicked my husband&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t knick your skin like some of the reviews say. The battery life is more then enough. I mean how long do you really need to shave your balls... 10 minutes at most even when you are being extra cautious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried using it wet even though I no you can.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like which may not be the product but more so my own skin... For some reason when ever I use this specific shaver and only this one to to shave my crotch, afterwards I get a few pimples. Which is wierd because I usually do it right after the shower, so there shouldn&#x27;t be anything to clog my pores. And they are not ingrown hairs either, they are just straight up pimples. So I usually avoid using this if I know I&#x27;m going to be having sex with in the next day or so because nobody wants to take your pants off and your crotch has a punch of red pimples. Maybe I just need to clean my foil with some rubbing alcohol or something, because I aftershave down their already just to make sure I don&#x27;t get bumps and for some reason I still do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is my only complaint which may or may not be product related.&lt;br /&gt;I definitly suggest buying this. It&#x27;s the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used on my crotch/groin/balls.</li>
            <li> This trimmer gave me gnarly razor burn on my mans pubis (that&#x27;s a very advanced anatomy joke, most of you idiots won&#x27;t get it). I&#x27;m giving 3-stars because it&#x27;s not necessarily the trimmer at fault, my skin is just too sensitive to handle being shaved clean to the surface, I&#x27;ll stick with my beard trimmer to trim deeeeeeeez nutttssssssss.</li>
            <li> Sure beats the heck out of what I was trying to use before.  My wife loves the smooth finish, she&#x27;s the final judge.</li>
            <li> This does pretty much anything you need except a close shave.</li>
            <li> It shaves well but it&#x27;s definitely not as gentle as it was reviewed a couple years ago when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;The main flaw is the battery. I don&#x27;t know if mine was defective or not but since day one it&#x27;s only held about 4 to 5 minutes of use if fully charged and I never know when it&#x27;s fully charged because it quits charging after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> A great body groomer.  If I had one complaint it would be that the level 1 on the guard cuts too long.  It seems like its more of a 1 1/2 or even 2 than a 1.  Other than that the clipper side cuts well.  The shaver side does a wonderful job of shaving.  Even works great in sensitive areas.  You know like down there guys.  This is the best sensitive area shave I have ever used and now I only need one product instead of using two separate shavers.</li>
            <li> I use this for Everything!!!.. Works great!</li>
            <li> amazing best shaver ever!</li>
            <li> All other positive reviews are true.  This  thing really is worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Best of two worlds. Shaver and trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Loving it</li>
            <li> After one year, the battery no longer holds a charge for more than 5 minutes of use. Other Norelco products that I have owned over the years have far superior battery life that this &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; body groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT recommend based on battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it does work well, wet or dry, and my skin was never cut by the blades.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Love it!</li>
            <li> Purchased over 3 years ago and have been using it about once a week consistently.  Still going strong, and haven&#x27;t had to do any maintenance on it to date.</li>
            <li> i love it, it is a little bit heavy. seems good quality so far</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because a past reviewer stated that it pulled hair instead it was shaving. I decided to go through with the purchase because I could return it if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied. I went to use it and it did indeed pull my hair, so I was a bit annoyed that this reviewer was correct. The machine was on and the hair was painfully coming off my body. However, upon closer inspection I realized that I, stupidly, pressed the wrong button.&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 ends to this piece and the button closest to the end that you want to use should be pushed to activate the blades. This is obvious! I have just never encountered a razor with 2 ends before, hence my terrible rookie mistake. Once I pressed the button and tried again my life has never been the same. This thing cuts hair, all the hair, perfectly. No rash, no pain, no itching, just smooth, hairless areas. This should be a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for every single guy. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this thing, it is well worth the money</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed. It does what&#x27;s mentioned. Very easy to use. Makes your skin soft after shaving. It shaves almost the whole hair. Great product</li>
            <li> Im giving this a 4 star instead of a 5 because of the trimmer--if you want a stubble look about 1mm or a couple days stubble you wont get it with this.&lt;br /&gt;The body groomer is excellent and is great for downstairs like everyone on here says it is- shears hair right off like you shaved it with a razor, thats how good of a shave it does PEOPLE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something that i have noticed about Philips norelco shaving products and i would liek to share with everyone here; is the fact that they have a lot of different grooming/shaving products flooding the market. Since i am an owner of 3 different kinds of Philips Norelco products The bodygroomer 7100 , Norelco Click and Style and the old G bread trimmer i can say that Norelco will NEVER make the perfect product. If they make a hybrid product like the groomer 7100 where the body trimmer is excellent but the trimmer is low powered and does not give a stubble look.&lt;br /&gt;Dont you think Norelco knows that customers would like a stubble look,  if they drop the adjuster for a 1mm stubble look they would of made the perfect product.&lt;br /&gt;The click and style on the other hand the trimmer is great but the shaver is bad and the body groomer doesnt function correctly&lt;br /&gt;Dont you see a pattern?&lt;br /&gt;Norelco will keep you coming back for more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine. Just don&#x27;t use the bottom part without the guard for sensitive areas. It can cut through softer skin if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Love this!! If you trim &amp;#34;EVERYWHERE&amp;#34; you will love this.. Makes it so much cleaner and easier</li>
            <li> I only use this for the trimmer so I&#x27;m not sure about the razor. It would be nice if there was a little longer length setting, otherwise the battery still holds a charge and it cuts cleanly (I&#x27;ve never had it pull once).</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  This makes you look and feel like a man.</li>
            <li> I use it for my arms, legs and butt but it doesn&#x27;t last that long. It lasts half of what it says and I thought it was defected because of this so I returned it and got it replaced with the same one but the same thing.... Don&#x27;t buy it. You CAN&#x27;T use it plugged in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the swiss army knife of hair. I&#x27;m able to fix an off haircut, shave if i run out of razors, trim, erase, etc, and don&#x27;t have to worry about getting anything wet and having it malfunction</li>
            <li> I wish I would of got this a long time ago. works great and super fast. This thing is the champ of body hair remover, faster than a razor and a quick clean job and the wife sneaks it to trim her peach to.</li>
            <li> Excellent design and product for us men. My son uses it to shave his shoulders and chest and othe areas that get more hairy as the months go by. Also, use it to remove hair from our backs. Must be the genes!  Easy to charge, clean and store. Other guys have given it great reviews and I agree with them.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I can shave any part of my body and my neck. That was the biggest one. I get razor bumps REALLY easily, and this worked great for it. Takes a few passes but it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have tried many groomers and this the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. It shaves easily without pulling or cutting especially around sensitive areas. I highly recommend this groomer to all men who usually wax or shave. Charge lasts a long time and blades clean easily and stay sharp. If you shave your genital area, this is the best and painless way to do it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this purchase. I had been thinking about it for a long time and I am now asking myself what took so long...totally worth the price. It stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband for Valentines day :) He loves how easy and smoothly operates. Leaves the skin very smooth. Now i just have to find similar one for his face, the rest of his body is perfect with this Norelco.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that does everything I need.  It has great functionality and versatility, meaning it can be used anywhere on the body with ease.  I needed to shave my neck quickly and this is the first electric shaver I could use on my sensitive neck skin without it tearing it up.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> It is good but Less than expected</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job when it is charged. Glides smoothly and removes hair quickly. I has worked efficiently for several months without any problem. I haven&#x27;t seen its blades getting clogged, etc. they are very easy to detach and clean. The only issue, and a big one, is it takes over 6 hours to charge. Which means, you can&#x27;t afford to discover it needs a charge at the time you want to use to.  You have to check in advance and charge overnight before use.</li>
            <li> I chose a 5 star rating&lt;br /&gt;I like this item because it was something I was looking for to groom my body.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a product like this.</li>
            <li> Bought this for one reason, and one reason only: To shave... er... down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 10 minutes of touch and goes, I finally grew the balls to go at it (excuse my pun). I didn&#x27;t get cut, I didn&#x27;t get stung. Instead, I got smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well on the chest too!</li>
            <li> Performs well. Able to reach my back and works well on all the other parts of the body (chest, groin).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this groomer for about a year and it is still going strong with no issues. The trimming end works great to tame armpits and bikini areas, and the shaving end gives a close but comfortable shave elsewhere. It holds a charge fairly well and is convenient to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> This thing flat out sucks. It hurts to shave any body part with it. It will leave red lines all over your skin</li>
            <li> Love it works great. Just wish you can use plugged in also rather than for charging only.</li>
            <li> This thing is simply amazing.  It works perfectly.  No snags.  Easy to use.  Plus the charging base is sleek and neat.  It will up the intimate regions with ease.  Just be careful.  I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the first body shaver I have ever purchased and I must say I love it.  Sometimes, I like to be clean-shaven underneath and this product does the trick.  I highly recommend this product for shaving in those private areas.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product over other similar products that have been used. Close trim, easy to control and hold. Multiple blades make finding the right cut easy.</li>
            <li> Works amazing. Had it a couple months now. I just charged it yesterday for the first time, as it says to let the battery die completely before charging.</li>
            <li> This works better than the womens version. The charge last forever!!</li>
            <li> The battery life is quite long and should last a few days before needing to be recharged.  This product efficiently and quickly trims and is really a solid device.</li>
            <li> awesome for my private parts! love this thing!</li>
            <li> awesome clean fast, and a really good price</li>
            <li> Works great for body grooming, but only lasts about 2 years before it fails at the switch, so be prepared to deal with the warranty every couple of years (which isn&#x27;t bad to deal with overall) or to just toss them out and buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Love it, it really works. No more Knicks and cuts just smooth.</li>
            <li> I was trying to add this to wish list one night, and accidentally bumped buy with one click on my phone, didn&#x27;t even realize it until I got the shipping confirmation the next day. That being said I did not return it even though I wasn&#x27;t planning on purchasing it yet. It&#x27;s wonderful, works for everything.</li>
            <li> Close shave . . . but the top blade pulls at my hair, not cool . . . I hear you have to shave wet, will give that a try.</li>
            <li> this its a great groomer because has 2 sides to select if you dont want anything of hair or select the other side to control the lenght</li>
            <li> In theory this would be the perfect product. I bought it to stay well groomed and ready to go. I keep it well charged and in good, clean condition. And I have to admit, I was loving on it for about a month or two. However, I think I got too comfortable with the groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware! Learn from my mistakes. Those teeth WILL chew you up. It drew blood (both sides of the tool) on multiple occasions from my most sensitive areas. Yes, I know most people would have stopped the first time it sank it&#x27;s teeth into their nether regions but it seems I wanted it to work too much! Perhaps in the next generation Norelco will fix these looming dangers but for now...be warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it does work great for beards and other less sensitive body real estate.</li>
            <li> I needed a trimmer for trimming chest and the areas down under.  I&#x27;m very glad I chose this one.  The charge lasts for several uses and you have 5 settings for how short you want to cut the hair.  I get the job done in a short amount of time and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  I would buy it again and recommend it to other people.  It was a little more than what I planned on spending at the time but now that I&#x27;m using it on a consistent basis, I&#x27;m glad that I made the investment and believe that over time I&#x27;ll definitely get my money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for trimming and keep body hair neatly in check, especially in areas that can be intimate spots for some special person!</li>
            <li> Its simply awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is my second body trimmer and that is also from Philips norelco, previously i had philips norelco bodygroom(still have it), but when i saw the two sided trimming thing i thought to buy it. And believe me it is worth your money....</li>
            <li> I bought for myself, a woman.&lt;br /&gt;Works without nicks in the lower than abdomen area..you can literally shave anywhere without a cut.&lt;br /&gt;The shave could be closer..nothing compared to razors but definitely gets the job done..safely.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is save your money and buy something else. Battery life is bad, not enough power and my norelco or phillips shaver does a better job for shave. and Wahl&#x27;s (wired) does a better job trimming.</li>
            <li> I love the versatility to use either side of the razor. I use it for several different areas of my body and as a woman I would definitely recommend this</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me.  Ouch..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And had it, I would have kept it despite the fact that the battery NEVER held a charge from one use to the next.</li>
            <li> great body groomer buy it you won&#x27;t regret it, i was a amazed on how fast it arrived i don&#x27;t have prime but it was here with in two days of ordering it</li>
            <li> I purchased the unit in June 2011. It stopped working August 2012. It wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than a few seconds and would get very hot. I contacted Philips and they sent me a replacement unit in September 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That unit stopped working in March 2013. To make matters worse, it would routinely turn on by itself, in the middle of the night. It did this multiple times. When I would stumble out of bed to turn it off, I&#x27;d find it very hot - about to start a fire hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Philips USA and they were extremely unhelpful this time. Basically told me to bug off, despite my product still being two years under warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... please don&#x27;t go on vacation without this thing or you might come back to a burn down house?</li>
            <li> After my last electric razor bit the dust several years ago, I just went back to disposal razors.  Not a good choice for me.  This Norelco is perfect.  It does everything I need and more.  I&#x27;ve had no problems with it over the past several months and wouldn&#x27;t change a thing about it.</li>
            <li> This little guy is awesome. Not used as my every day shaver but great when I need it for traveling or a quick trim.</li>
            <li> Tried a number of Bodygroom models and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I got this body groom razor couple of months ago. I used once on my legs, hands, body . easy to use works great. Doesn&#x27;t work on back though. It&#x27;s difficult to reach back.</li>
            <li> What can I really say, it&#x27;s a shaver that does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do</li>
            <li> Reviews seem over-rated for this product. It does not cut as close as I had hoped and requires way more than one pass to clear hair. I have a $20 facial trimmer than works much better than this product.</li>
            <li> Shaver works amazing. Not like a razor, but close enough. Will be recommending this product to any one that ask about. No bite in the sensitive shave areas. I do my whole body and it does an excellent job. Thank you norelco for this shaver.</li>
            <li> This product really works. Removed hair without cutting sensitive skin or causing razor burns; is also easy to clean and feels good in my hand-easy to manipulate around the shaving area and leaves public area skin silky-smooth.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hung on to this for a long time.  I had an old razor that I hated.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This groomer is totally sexy.  The shape and the design are very appealing, and very manly.  The flip from clipper to foil is perfect.  No pulling or problems with  the cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the size of the foil head.  It makes maneuvering awkward when trying to use it on your sensitive areas down below.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various shavers for my nether regions. The Norelco Bodygroom Pro is hands down the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It cuts course, thick pubic hair in a single stroke. I was able to complete the process is a small fraction of what it used to take. It&#x27;s safe and has guards to protect against nicks -- although, even without the guards, I&#x27;ve found the teeth to be small enough to avoid nicks. The other shavers I&#x27;ve tried have not worked as well as shaving, but the Norelco Bodygroom Pro is now my favorite tool for trimming or shaving down there.</li>
            <li> This body trimmer works great. I does take some different angles to get all the areas on your body and you do have to be patient but it does not cut you or leave razer burn in your sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> best body groomer i have found after trying other. keeps charge for long time and good grip. don&#x27;t make much noise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome for women as well!</li>
            <li> The device itself is great. I picked it up because i realized it uses the same charger as my other Philips Norelco beard trimmer, but this has this strange &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; the charger plugs into to make it charge. So its yet another thing cluttering up either your drawer or countertop, would prefer if the charger plugged directly in, the stand is cheesy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for one purpose, but now we use it to cut my boy&#x27;s hair and mine.  15-20 dollars a trip it adds up in savings.  This is NOT a professional clipper, but it is a very good clipper for the money and being portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not provide a great shave though - for the record.  For my purposes that is a non-issue.</li>
            <li> The bodygroomer works as advertised. No fuss, no complicated things to set up or super long manual to read/memorize. You just charge it up and start shaving that body hair. I normally used the Schick Hydro for my face, chest, arm pits and abdomen though I found it quite inconvenient to always having to put on my shaving lotion, I use Jack Black, but with this I just turn it on and do my shaving. It does a great job on the arm pits, chest, abdomen and crotch area. And yes I&#x27;m including the penis and testicular area as well as it is safe to use around there. The product itself feels sturdy and not flimsy at all. Battery lasts for a good while as I shave once every week and a half it has lasted me for two months before charging. I would highly recommend this item to those who have to keep their body hair in check like myself.</li>
            <li> the shaving head is useless for facial shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the entire thing is almost useless for pubic shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS ANYWHERE ON OR NEAR YOUR BALLS. i have the scars to back up this advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the trimmer part is all i end up using on my pubic mound and gooch. the shaving head goes more or less unused. i dont trust myself waving a double sided high speed reciprocating blade anywhere near my bunghole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, armpit hair trimming works great. its also waterproof. the charging dock is built like crap, but i hardly ever need to charge it.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a face groomer and decided to try this out. Yes, I use it to shave my face mostly. It obviously depends on your complexion and facial hair style. I have blonde/brown facial hair that doesn&#x27;t grow to thick or fast on my face so this actually works very well for easy, quick trim/shave. I have also used it on other areas of the body to trim hair and it works just as well, usually better. If you want to trim certain sensitive areas, it works, just be careful. May not be ideal for those with thick/coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to be able to speed up grooming around the special bits, and still maintain a fairly close shave with minimal pain and difficulty. To these goals I rate the experience a 3/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grooming has been done wet, in the shower. While the groomer will remove most hair, it takes 3-4 passes to get everything thoroughly. This is a little irritating in some of the tighter spaces I find myself grooming in. The edges of the head also have a tendency to pinch skin if I am not extremely careful, which hasn&#x27;t drawn a ton of blood but is painful and has led to a quick banshee-wail on a few occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall strategy is that I have begun using this as a day-to-day in the shower to keep hair neat and under control, and will periodically use a razor to get a nice, smooth finish. This is a little disappointing as my hope was to use this product as my sole groomer, but it has definitely made regular maintenance quicker, easier and something that I stay on top of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The groomer itself is comfortable to hold and use, and the shaving head can be used moving in either direction. Battery life is decent, I usually go a couple days between charges. You can definitely tell when the charge is getting low because it will start to pull hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product. I would recommend buying to help keep up with day to day needs, but keep in mind you will likely need to supplement with something else if you want a smooth, irritation free finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a predecessor to this groomer and was skeptical to buy a newer version since I liked the older one so much. I took the leap per the reviews and am just as happy with this one as I was with the older one.</li>
            <li> This works good on the down low area but I tried it on my chest and abdomen and it wasn&#x27;t great.  I will use it to get the areas that are difficult to get with a razor, and use the razor for the rest.  But for down under it is the best I have used, and ample for body contours that are hard to shave.</li>
            <li> This thing works well as a face shaver, even though it says not to use it above your neck</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor, and I usually have to finish it off with one. Definitely good to be able to trim down all those neglected long hairs at first though</li>
            <li> So far it is a very good groomer. No really problems. Not great for body parts with hair routes that change a lot (facial hair) or uneven surfaces (some head shapes) but great for the body. It even says in the manual not to use it for your face and head, but it works fine enough if you have patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve only done my torso and arms and it leaves everything pretty smooth and clean looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and am very happy with it.  It really holds a charge and does a great job trimming and shaving.  I don&#x27;t use the micro blades much because I prefer a razor, but the trimming edges are perfect if you want to leave some stubble on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest. I needed a trimmer for my undercarriage. This thing is what the doctor ordered. Keeps me nicely trimmed so this Florida humidity doesn&#x27;t get me looking like a couple of round, red fire engines down below... if you get my meaning. So far this thing is awesome, no nicks on da nutz any more.</li>
            <li> a good body groomer. works well for both men and women. wet or dry. it&#x27;s a quality product</li>
            <li> works like a charm, i was skeptical at first cause when i read the reviews, i thought it was to good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;but it shaves perfectly and does not leave bruises or cuts. Great product definitely worth the money. if your wife&lt;br /&gt;or girlfriend hates body hair put in some effort and get this shaver, i am sure she will repay your efforts with something&lt;br /&gt;you have never seen before.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different body groomer and this one is clearly the best.  It doesn&#x27;t knick and it doesn&#x27;t cause a rash.  It has a blade for every part of your body and is reasonably quite as well as provisioned with a strong battery.  I only wish it had the vacuum feature of one of its Philips product cousins, but that is a small gripe.</li>
            <li> In the days of metrosexuality, also men like us need to get rid of some of that baboon hair every now and then, and well, a razor or a regular electric shaver is both time-consuming and scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing however is neither. It´s really easy to use, shaves well and is generally safe to use. You´ll get some cuts here and there, but no scary ones, unless you decide to go all lumberjack on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it perform? Well, I´d say it makes your job easier if you wanna shave anything neck and down. I wouldn´t use this in my face, although it could probably do a good job if you´re just trimming small parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has two sides, one that lets you trim a specific length, and another that´s more for &amp;#34;get it all gone&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;get-it-all-gone&amp;#34; side has a pivoting head which is really helpful since the head follows your body so you won´t need to go inch by inch if you don´t have the smoothest body in history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main problem with it though, is that I don´t think it shaves smooth enough. It´s ok, but it leaves you a bit of &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; hair, which isn´t exactly the nicest thing to touch, and hair grows back very fast since what you´re really doing is just cutting it off. If you want to rid yourself from the hair completely waxing still is the best way. This is however a very good substitute for those of us who are a little bit too scared of the pain that comes with waxing and all the other work you need to do to prepare and finish a wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn´t a perfect tool, but I´d say it´s really close, and definitely better than anything I´ve tried that is a machine.</li>
            <li> bought it for my husband.  he says he likes it ok, but sometimes it pulls the hair a little too much</li>
            <li> very nice, it comes with a charging stand, almost none of these do now. Actually quite convenient to use and switch between the trimmer and shaver. it could have be a little more ergonomic to be used on the face but its ok anyway.</li>
            <li> Awesome groomer.  Just be careful when using in the shower.  I&#x27;ve noticed it is much easier to nick yourself in the shower than while dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is good.  The machine tells you when it is done charging to avoid over-charging and burning out the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No blade lubricants needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all a good groomer.</li>
            <li> good deal, but can&#x27;t shave close like I had expected</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, and very well. You do need to be careful in sensitive areas because no shaver will be perfect. I do feel comfortable using it though, just don&#x27;t but it expecting it to have absolutely no chance of nicking you. Be carefull and there shouldn&#x27;t be any issues.</li>
            <li> I originally gave this a 4* rating, however, as time went on, I find this product fails on the battery. It runs something like 5 minutes on a full charge and then requires a recharge. Hardly acceptable.</li>
            <li> Really not as good as the old fashion razor&lt;br /&gt;To many strikes to be minimally effective&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend it</li>
            <li> Great groomer, works as expected, like the dual sides, don&#x27;t be afraid of it. :)</li>
            <li> A lot better than using a facial trimer for grooming but was hoping for it would be a little smoother.</li>
            <li> Trims very well and I like that I can use it wet or dry. Unfortunately the battery dies fast (even when I&#x27;m not using the product for a while, it seems to be already drained) and recharging takes longer than it should.</li>
            <li> This shaver/trimmer is perfectly suited for taking care of business below the neck. I have used my (very good) electric face shaver for other areas before and been very disappointed. Some how they&#x27;ve changed this thing so that it can shave very sensitive areas without any pain or nicking at all. The trimmer guard covers the blade on all sides so there is no chance of doing any harm with it. It feels way safer than other trimmers i have used with guards that leave one side exposed. Very nice it can be used wet or dry. I wish it came with some sort of storage case is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> If you buy this to do your groin area, underarms, or small areas I highly recommend it! If your trying to do large areas of your body like your chest, legs etc. look for something with a larger head if there is anything else out there. It will do that fine but it will just be time consuming. No worries on cutting you or irritation with this product. First time using it shaved me clean with no issues.</li>
            <li> I have never been more disappointed with a Phillips product in my life. This thing worked ok (not great) when it actually charged but the real problem is that it wouldn&#x27;t sit in its charging station properly so it would never charge. I tried everything to get it to sit right and it just wouldn&#x27;t charge. Eventually I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesistant to purchase the Norelco Bodygroom Pro at first. I previously had bought the 1st generation of the bodygroom when it first came out. Sad to say, they foil shaver broke after a months use. However, I decided to give this a try since Summer is here and the less hair I have, the less hot I get and I get to show of some of progress I&#x27;ve made at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my first try I decided to use on my legs. Mind you, I have really hair legs and it gets annoying and bothersome when I&#x27;m at the pool or sweating. The trimmer settings are great. I decided to use the 5 since I didn&#x27;t want to get rid of all my leg hair since that would a bit weird to me. It worked well and noticed the difference. Works great on your underarms too! Couldn&#x27;t try on my chest since I don&#x27;t have any chest hair but even in the nipple area, which hurts like a B**** when you nick it shaving, was great! No complaints here. I was curious to also try it in the nether regions. I was already anticipating and prepared for some nicks and cuts here and there but it was breeze. To my surprise, the product lived up to its claim that it&#x27;s safe on the jewels lol. The shaver is really gentle and the Bodygroom Pro has a countouring/pivoting head that moves making for a better shave. Phew! What a relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this time Norelco hit it off great this time with this new line of the men&#x27;s BodyGroom. I would definitely get the bro since you don&#x27;t have the hassle of having to change clips and the look of the BodyGroom Pro is hands down a lot more sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every guy needs one of these to make it easy to get rid of any unwanted hair. Trust me, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for grooming the body. You can trim long hairs on your chest, legs, arms, back, and groin. Although it can be time consuming, it beats shaving.</li>
            <li> Not bad&lt;br /&gt;But not that good&lt;br /&gt;Trimming part could be better</li>
            <li> As a cyclist I mainly purchased this to shave my legs for which it does an above average job. Where this shines is in the pubic area. I was always so scared when navigating around my balls because I would occasionally get a nip here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this enough. This is truly a fantastic beautiful device. I would recommend and I would buy this again if anything happened to it. So far I&#x27;ve only charged this once when I took it out of the box and I&#x27;ve shaved from the waist down 3 times about 15 mins each session. I&#x27;m following instructions and will charge this when it gets low on battery life. The instructions also show how to remove the batteries and replace them if it stops holding a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff. Get the most expensive model. That&#x27;s the one you want.</li>
            <li> this was my first electric body-shaver and thus i was a bit anxious. i could not have made a better choice, its easy to use, comfortable on the skin and it does exactly what it is advertised in the product description. this has become my first and only option for body shaver.</li>
            <li> No razor burn and better cut than expected.</li>
            <li> fast delvery and good product</li>
            <li> This product left me with a horrible rash and nicks on my skin for weeks.  It was not very easy to use - back to WAXING!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully! Great body groomer. Easy and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I received the body groom already charged. And until yesterday, after one month of having it, I haven´t had to charge.</li>
            <li> It is a pattern with Norelco rechargeable shavers, that you can&#x27;t use them while they are plugged into an outlet.  Sometimes you just want to dedicate extra time and get a detailed shave.  If you run out of juice mid shave with this shaver, you will have to wait 30 minutes to an hour to get enough charge for the rest of the job.  That is very inconvenient.  The one plus for this shaver is that it has a strong battery which lasts longer and trims hard till it discharges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is decent.  You have to be careful with the close shave head b/c it tends to nick skin.  The trimmer portion is good, and its nice that it is adjustable so you don&#x27;t need different attachment lengths floating around your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/5, could be better.</li>
            <li> Nice that is is waterproof, so trimming in the shower is fine. Never used the shaver side, just the trimmer. It works fine. But the battery is horrendous. I took three stars out because I had to throw the shaver away. I tried replacing the battery but it&#x27;s very difficult. Opening the unit is ok, but may break the waterproofing. The problem is in the battery itself. It&#x27;s two cells soldered together. Using a AA instead is hard because the originals don&#x27;t have the raised terminal (nub) and you need to somehow connect two of them together. Maybe if you solder. I couldn&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I need a new one and I will not buy this again. I would if the battery had been upgraded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year. Works just like the day I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The larger part of the shaver is great for shaving your balls.</li>
            <li> I waited to write this review so I can really give the razor a chance to either be a screw up Or be the AMAZING shaver it truly is!! I&#x27;m so excited, because I finally found a body shaver (mostly for bikini area) that doesn&#x27;t leave bumps/redness &amp; grows in nice without any of that mind blowing itching!! Works really fast (only a couple of passes did the trick). I also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t grow in as fast. I&#x27;m smooth for days! My only worry is that like almost every other shaver/razor that it breaks down after about 1 year (&amp; I have to buy another one), but even if it does, I still would have had a year of peace &amp; no aggrevation w/ shaving. PS~I want to thank the woman out there somewhere that wrote the 1 lone review that I found amongst hundreds of men on this razor when I was researching it. You&#x27;ve helped me decide to buy this shaver! &amp; I TY!!</li>
            <li> I have used many of shaver in the past. This is the best one I had so far.&lt;br /&gt;great quality, quite. It never hurt you.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not great either</li>
            <li> Definitely not the shaver you wanna use on your sensitive parts of body like armpit, pubic etc. It irritates my skin after shaving and it doesn&#x27;t give a perfectly clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, guys and gals, if you wanna just TRIM your body hair, this shaver works fine but you can always buy something cheaper and they&#x27;ll all work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a clean shave, this shaver doesn&#x27;t work as well as a traditional razor like mach 3 with foam...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really disappointed me to some extent...</li>
            <li> VERY NICE GROOMER SHIPPED QUICKLY BY SELLER.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing more than an expensive trimmer.  It doesn&#x27;t give a close body shave at all.  I&#x27;ll go back to using a razor blade when it&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> This has removed a lot of hair from a lot of silly places.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent.</li>
            <li> Never had an accident while shaving the private area.  ;)</li>
            <li> Hi All ,&lt;br /&gt;it is a very good product and i like it , i recommend it for every one</li>
            <li> I bought this along with Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Nose/Facial Hair Trimmer, and I have everything I need for trimming and shaving.  Was cautious at first because of how other products left flesh wounds, but after a couple weeks if use, I am confident in the performance of this product and take little time to trim and shave.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Best if you are in hurry to clean your body hairs.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts long. so I bought it, and did not make a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;The charger is nice too, only thing to be improved must be the price.&lt;br /&gt;The other option is buying two, good and cheap trimmers than this one, better but costly.</li>
            <li> Great buy, quick shipping !!!</li>
            <li> Good trimmed and groomer</li>
            <li> I believe this was for men, but it works great for waomen too!! Well worth it! I really love it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good groomer for a long time and got the Norelco Bodygrom Pro after reading the reviews at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really is a great product. When you hold it is solid, well finished and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a couple of times and with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bummer is the fact that the charger is quite big and that will be difficult to carry around when traveling.</li>
            <li> Be careful guys.  I had to replace a braun bodycruzer because it was lost in a move... This one cut me .. badly.  I think I&#x27;m going to put it away and purchase another braun. :(</li>
            <li> This product pulls the hairs off my face.  This is not comfortable.  Maybe my face is just too soft, but never had this problem before.</li>
            <li> Easier to handle than its predecessor and does a good job of cutting, However, watch the placement of the teeth sides, they will cut skin easily.</li>
            <li> It helps you groom your privates to perfection and those hard to reach areas of your body. Easy yo use and can be used in the shower which is so blissful. Be a little careful while using to avoid zits. Clean easily with hot water. and use the brush to remove hair from the foils. Battery back up is quite okay.</li>
            <li> My best guess is that Philips did not know how these would be received by consumers so the first ones, while good, needed some improvement.  This one is the one they built after they figured out everyone and their father wanted them.  Good quality, smartly designed and does not geth hung up on anything.</li>
            <li> Hits all areas good. You still have to be careful in certain areas. Holds a good charge n is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Phillips / Norelco definitely thought threw things with this product.  Each end turns on independently, and the built in guide is easy to use and saves the hassle of attachments.  This product focuses on what you need, not filling up space with attachments.</li>
            <li> This should be called the bikini area deluxe trimmer and shaver!  Do not let the sleek black and chrome appearance fool you, it is totally made for you ladies.  I have tried it all in attempts to not have an irritated red rash in my bikini area, or unsightly hair.  When I used razors I got what looking like a very unfortunate case of chicken pox and when I used creams that removed hair my skin rebelled by turning bright red.  Neither look was really working for me.  I bought a pretty pink bikini trimmer, buying into the promise that it was made with my female needs in mind.  It totally did a hack job.  Frustrated and confused I decided to give this a try.  It works like a dream!  the trimmer trims well, the foil shaver takes care of business.  No more unsightly rash or hair.  One happy lady.  And as a bonus my husband started using it on his nether region as well, which I appreciate.  Tips: -go slow -trim first, then shave -do not push down hard -clean it regularly -I found using it dry was better than wet, so I use it before I shower and then shower up afterwards  2 very happy customers!</li>
            <li> I love this thing. First body groomer that I enjoy using.</li>
            <li> Works well. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this great product if you need to&lt;br /&gt;a reliable, convenient, comfortable, and smooth grooming shaver.&lt;br /&gt;No shaving cuts, no long-time shaving sessions, a pretty wonderful battery life, and&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s able to be using under shower (waterproof), and more of features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advise:&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first time to use this kind of product, it&#x27;s better to read the attached instructions&lt;br /&gt;to know how to use it or clean it safely and properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it and enjoy!</li>
            <li> My bits and pieces have never been smoother.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to have both a trimmer and shaver in one. The little trimmers on the shaver side help prevents snags of longer hairs. Not once did i nick myself. Just with the #1 setting on trimmer attachments went closer so i could trim closer without nicking.</li>
            <li> my husband love this Philips shaver. he said it&#x27;s the best for shaving around the back of the neck.</li>
            <li> loved it . It did the shaving perfectly</li>
            <li> As shown, arrived on time all fine. Perfect for trimming. Don&#x27;t buy for  the shaving side.</li>
            <li> Great product. Does everything they say it does. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My girl friend says my balls have never been smoother!  We both recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this Philips Norelco for self-grooming (I&#x27;m loathe to use the term &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34;) and have found it to be superbly designed.  Here&#x27;s a rundown of what stood out to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size/Shape&lt;br /&gt;This is probably my favorite thing about it.  The length of it is just long enough to use as a wand of sorts, and the slight curve allows you to angle the trimmer edge on the shaver head to get your back and shoulders or other hard to reach places at a right angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery/Charger&lt;br /&gt;I  like the folding base used to recharge the groomer.  You would think that when you pop the unit into the base it would slide or fall out, but it grips it firmly and the indicator light lets you know it&#x27;s charging/finished charging.  The battery lasts quite a while (I&#x27;d say over an hour to even two hours of solid use) and I have to recharge it after maybe every 4th time I use it. There&#x27;s an independent power button for each of the two heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use/Comfort&lt;br /&gt;Most trimmers will pinch you when you&#x27;re working in tender areas.  I have used it on the MOST tender of areas, and I think you have to be pretty reckless to receive a nip from this one, regardless of which end you are working with.  However, I do think using the clipper edge with the guard removed is by far the riskiest proposition.  I advise against that unless it&#x27;s in a flat spot with tougher/taught skin.  Finally, I like that it&#x27;s water-resistant (I have used it in the shower to no ill-effect).  I like the adjustable guard--it feels a little flimsy but is quick, easy and stable.  Cleaning is easy--both ends either pop open or pop off to be brushed or blown out with canned air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to men or as a gift to a man.</li>
            <li> It works very smoothly and accurately.</li>
            <li> really pulls hair when you shave, I don&#x27;t know if i got a botch one but....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is useful</li>
            <li> Great product! Love everything about it. Have used it for several months and have never been nicked or otherwise harmed, which is an amazing do to the nature of the sensitive parts that must be trimmed. Best shaver I have ever had! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> A great razor. Works well and holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> It works really well. However you will have a bit of stubble. It&#x27;s a good and bad thing. Bad in you won&#x27;t get perfectly smooth with this, but good because then your skin won&#x27;t get as irritated from the hair braking back through. The long/thick hair buzzer seemed to struggle a bit more with fine hair. Had to yank the hair out tight for it to buzz it. I think this may have been more of a problem with my hair than the buzzer itself. Just a heads up I suppose if your hair is more fine than coarse.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that both sides of this shaver are perfect for different purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver side actually does a great finishing job on my face (i.e. getting the hairs that my regular shaver misses) even though the instructions say it&#x27;s not for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer side is both effective and gentle enough to use anywhere on your body, and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very good razor - charge lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Battery life is horrible. There is an instructable found online to replace the batteries with better rechargeable batteries. Do that and you&#x27;ll love this thing. As for the actual grooming, it&#x27;s great. Men should be gentle around the &amp;#34;coin purse&amp;#34; if you use it without the detachable guard. It can, and will, bite. ;)</li>
            <li> This is the best Bodygroom I have owned (I have gone through about four).  I have had it a few years now and it still works perfectly.  However, as with all of the Norelco Bodygoomers, the foil doesn&#x27;t last more than 8-12 months.  Replacement foils are not expensive.</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer with many functions. I bought it to trim facial fuzz, as the epilator I previously purchase caused ingrown hair issues. It works great.</li>
            <li> Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-handles great&lt;br /&gt;-trimmer height adjustment is built on. So you dont have a bunch of different attachments.&lt;br /&gt;-charge lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-shaver side tends to pull my hair once in awhile. However my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li> Awesome body hair remover. I like to trim rather than a close shave. Setting of 4 or 3 depending on the part of your body. Chest and stomach hair can use a 5 setting since hair regrowth on the chest and stomach is a nightmare and hurts for 2 weeks when you opt for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver for for body hair with long lasting battery charge complete with brush cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Shaves and trims as described in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;2. Excellent battery that retains charge for quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;3. Although it says it&#x27;s not to be used for face shaving, I&#x27;ve used a few times with 3 in 1 liquid soap from Nivea for Men. Not a close shave but good enough.&lt;br /&gt;4. Can be used wet or dry. You can use it in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;5. Retains sharpness even after many uses.&lt;br /&gt;6. Easy to clean. Just remove the shaver or trimmer as instructed and clean away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Can&#x27;t think of any. Been using it for 3 years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for shaving body hair all around.</li>
            <li> After 1 year it stopped working properly; i.e. does not cut hair !!!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and decided to take a chance. I&#x27;ve owned it for a few weeks now and it works great. A few buyers stated that it pulled hairs out, but anyone who has used an electric razor knows that there is some pulling. It shaves cleanly, trims nicely, and it takes a sharp razor blade out of your hand and away from anything that should really never be touched by an edged blade.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, very comfortable to use</li>
            <li> Works very well and holds charge for a long time</li>
            <li> Good for chest an back, not so good for down below..Super quiet though, and love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I like the feel and performance of this trimmer. I have not had any problems with nicks or cut while trimming sensitive areas. The battery charge seems to last for a good while, much longer that the trimmer I replaced. I am very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> wow very nice &amp;#62;&amp;#62; the great bodygroom machine</li>
            <li> The shaving part is sharp and safe. I give this product the highest rating possible!</li>
            <li> Pulls longer hair. Hard to put in the charger correctly. I&#x27;m not crazy about it at all, but can&#x27;t send it back. BEWARE of those good reviews. I don&#x27;t think they were all honest reviews.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, this thing does not hold charge.  The batteries were good for about 3 months, and that was with once-weekly use.  The shaving side is also worthless.  It grabs hair and pulls on it more so than cutting it.  The trimmer side is pretty nice.  It&#x27;s quite impressive at giving you a very close trim (without the guard) in the pubic region without cutting.  Unfortunately, the same is not true for the trimmer when it comes to the testicles - you will get nicks and they will hurt.  I had much better luck with a $12 trimmer from Walmart, followed by shaving with a blade.  The the trimmer side does work really well as an eyebrow trimmer.  Ran it in every direction with the guard on, shortest setting (position 1).  It gets rid of bushiness and leaves the area above your eyes well groomed and masculine-looking ... without giving you the appearance of waxing/tweezing your brows.</li>
            <li> Very nice, got tired of the waxing pain!</li>
            <li> Nicely designed body groomer, but I did not get the results I hoped for. The adjustable trimming end works well, however the shaving end takes many passes to remove the stubble in sensitive areas causing some irritation. Good battery life. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> With this product you can shave anywhere, and I mean ANYWHERE and not worry about cuts.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I replaced a $30 earlier model (first version) that I purchased a few years back. It worked well but eventually lost most of its charge and the head would keep snapping off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new version holds a charge much better and the head stays put. The other side is great for trimming long hairs and is recommended if you&#x27;re very hair and want to go completely smooth - use this side first. Also great in pubic area if you just want to trim vs. shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely satisfied with this product, I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a year I think. The only misrepresentation is the charge time. It takes much longer than 1 hour to get a full charge. I&#x27;d say more like 8 hours and you should fully charge it before each use.</li>
            <li> I did not see any other reviewers covering this So I took the plunge and bought this in town and what can I say even though the instructions say for neck down Only this thing works great for keeping my head shaved down almost as close as a traditonal razor blade but without the cut&#x27;s and irritations.  I love it takes less than 5 mins in the shower (using a shower mirror of course) and gets right down next to the scalp without any irritaions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charge lasts as advertised and the unit feels very solid and is easy to handle the shaving part of this unit is&lt;br /&gt;a Solid 5 star and when it finally decides to dull out it&#x27;s got a replacable head. Ps it is very easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;because of this fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works pretty good dry but with some shaving gel and a hot shower this thing is smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now for the trimmer well I would give it 3 stars for the trimmer part (not meant for hair on head at all) but I mean even for the body trim part unless your chest hair is a forest it hard to pin down hair that is laying flat with this trimmer end.  But the shaver had no problems at all (mind you I just trimmed the very top of my chest and back of my neck)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all a great product no matter what your needs are but if you want a nice electric shaver for your head&lt;br /&gt;and want it down to the skin like a razor this one is the one you want.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I was initially reluctant about using this groomer on certain areas of my body, especially since I had never used a foil shaver even on my face.  Gaining confidence from other reviewers, I used it and am very pleased with the results!  It works great and is so much easier and quicker than using a normal razor.  Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product which makes removing body hair task easy but this body groomer is not very good in that. I have to go several rounds over same area before it removes hair.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to clean,  long lasting charge.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It trims wherever I need it to trim. No need to buy anything else.&lt;br /&gt;The charge also holds a long time. You can take this baby anywhere!</li>
            <li> Best electric razor and body groomer, great price great product the best thank you wish I had this 7 years ago haha</li>
            <li> Very good no nasty skin abrasions</li>
            <li> Well built and includes plenty of accessories.  Will nip you if you&#x27;re not careful but overall does a good job and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This shaver is gentle and does not leave nicks and cuts, but neither does it shave really close.  So far, I have only used it twice, I find that a wet safety razor does a superior job.  I find it is hard to manipulate to get to difficult areas.</li>
            <li> you can shave what ever you like with out being afraid of being sting by it</li>
            <li> Product exceeded expectations.  The unit has two ends - one for triming and the other for shaving.  The trimming end has a built in height adjustment that works very well.  There are five different height settings to it.  The shaving end is simple and I did not get any pulling or burns - even in the most sensitive areas.  The only two cautions I have are that you must use the cradle for charging because the groomer itself cannot be connected directly to the charger.  And secondly, the trimming edge is just a little narrow.</li>
            <li> Love it.... Does as it says. I would reccomend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the BodyGroom Pro once so far, but it did a great job. It trimmed my body hair and left me as clean as a male porn star. I must admit, I&#x27;m quite impressed with the results. My skin is as clean and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. It was easy to use. I&#x27;m a heterosexual male, so I had no previous knowledge or experience using such a product, but everything worked out well. Just remember to hold the trimmer at the proper angle to get optimal results.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat let me say I had read almost every review before buying this.  If you&#x27;re the type to let your hair grow out on your body, this is pretty neat to use.  Holds a long charge and you can even use it in the shower.  I tend to shave my body so this shaver really only gets you so smooth before you have to switch to an actual razor.  Shaving down &amp;#34;there&amp;#34; was pretty simple although I was still careful not to go crazy.  If you want an efficient body groomer I&#x27;d say get this one.  I&#x27;m glad I have it and Prime two day shipping is still amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a [[ASIN:B000EG8HLE BG2020]] for a couple years and while it worked fairly well (only one nick with foil&#x27;s comb, which the trimmer in the BG2040 helps to mitigate happening again), I couldn&#x27;t stand the charging routine that NiCad batteries require.  When I went to replace the BG2020 (I dropped it from 2.5m onto tile, still works but not exactly waterproof) I wanted to see if Philips had updated the batteries and I am happy to report:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries are NiMH and, according to Philips&#x27; FAQ, should be charged when nearly (not completely) empty for the longest life.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for body grooming, scissors, razors, other grooming tools from Amazon, this is by far the best. Can be used for anything from beard / face / sideburns to private areas. Has enough power not to get caught or pull hair instead of cut. I would purchase again in a second.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spare the details but had to shave before going in for some minor surgery.  That was really scaring me until I read the #1 review for this product.  Let me just say it did the job.  I would recommend using the bottom (comb&#x27;ed end) only with the guard on first for the major cut.  Then switch to the other side for the final clean up.  Really did come out smooth and didn&#x27;t take long at all.  Not sure this will be a lifestyle change for me ;-) but I do have the groomer now...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the original BodyGroom for years which I loved other than I seemed to replace every year or two.  The trimmer part on this model works great.  I usually trim down chest, arm and &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; and have no problems. However, the shaver part seems to grab/pull hairs which I never had a problem with the original.  I also had it &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; me down under which is not very pleasant and I never had that issue with the older model.  I like the flexible head and the style is great.  I just am not sure about the shaving experience especially considering the price.  However, Amazon was lower than the local &amp;#34;mega lowmart&amp;#34; and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised but does shave as close as I thought it should.&lt;br /&gt;Available cheaper at Target. Somewhat tricky to clean.</li>
            <li> It works fine for me. It seems to hold a charge well. I like the duel cutting heads and adjustable comb.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this inexpensive trimmer.</li>
            <li> It works great for preventing razor bumps in the man region but as far as closeness it doesn&#x27;t beat a regular Quattro blade.  So I use it for the man zone and my cream and blade for the rest of the bod.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband he uses the manscaping side for just that and the beard trimmer too nice to have it all in one! Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Fully charges in one hour.  Works wet or dry.  Has clippers on one end with several guards built in or the guard can be removed for clipping down to the skin.  The other end is a razor which can be used to smooth over stubble.  Its not a good enough razor that it will replace your normal face razor, but it will work in a pinch and works very well for the normal use of shaving below the neck..as advertised.  I think it would also work extremely well on the head as well, but I have not personally tried it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started clipping hair and kept at it with the only nicks coming when the razor was turned to an awkward angle so that the clippers were not running squarely against the skin.  As long as the clippers were kept at a normal angle there were no nicks or rubs at all even against the most sensitive skin areas.  Even then the nicks weren&#x27;t enough to draw blood and were more like a carpet burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hair you want to get rid of, would like something easy that works well and recharges quickly then this razor is a great option.  I would buy it again if I needed another.</li>
            <li> Have used this product three time and it is dead, like a car out of gas. A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> If you have been reading the reviews on this they are all true. This is a great razor for body hair. Absolutely no pain, cuts, or pulling. I love mine - I am so happy that I got it. If you are looking for a electric razor for your body hair this is the one - GET IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of trimmers of various types in the past and used and/or misused them in probably every way possible.  My last one (a beard trimmer) stopped charging after a few years of occasional use, probably because it had cheap NiCad batteries in it.  I decided to get something actually made for multi-use and that was claimed to have better a better battery-type that also hopefully didn&#x27;t take hours to charge.  Based on a few other postive ratings, I grabbed this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this a few times now, but so far, I&#x27;m impressed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros--&lt;br /&gt;-It charges in hour or less&lt;br /&gt;-It seems to have a much stronger/faster set of motors than any other I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;-It has a separate trimmer end/motor from the close-cut shaver end/motor&lt;br /&gt;-No futzing around with various attachment types just to do different cuts of different lengths or different places&lt;br /&gt;-sharp and makes quick work of most all types of hair&lt;br /&gt;-didn&#x27;t pinch, cut, scrape, or otherwise hurt me, even when I used it on the most tender parts, and I even used the shaver end it on everything down yonder!  (And yes, I&#x27;m a guy, so that could have been messy and traumatic).&lt;br /&gt;-With minimal effort, it really did shave closer than any other trimmer/shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  A blade would be closer, but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons--&lt;br /&gt;-A tad more expensive than I would have liked; I&#x27;ll forgive that if it continues to perform for a few years at least&lt;br /&gt;-Unusual/proprietary charging &amp;#34;rack&amp;#34;.  It actually makes sense once I understood the design to be waterproof and hence not have holes for a plug on the unit itself.  It&#x27;s just that it initially confused me (no, I didn&#x27;t RTFM) and I wondered if there&#x27;s any way for that design to go flaky with such minimal contact points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond cleaning it under tap water, I haven&#x27;t tested the waterproofness of this, although I understand that might be a significant factor for some.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Use the shaver side when trimming the twig and berries. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different groomers and this is the best one so far. Would buy again</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 10 stars if the battery would charge correctly. I used this body groomer everywhere and I mean everywhere and it works perfectly. I never had an issue with the charge the first 10 times I charged it. And now it just doesnt charge at all and its too late to return it so I&#x27;ll be looking for a new product that has a battery that doesn&#x27;t tie after 10 charges.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing... Worth buying it for perfect body grooming..&lt;br /&gt;Highly accessible to all your private parts, making life simpler..!!!</li>
            <li> I read on another Amazon review on a females razor and she had said that it&#x27;s better to buy an electric razor for men for the legs. I am so glad that I listen to that review I wish I would&#x27;ve thought to use this razors sooner for my legs it makes them so smooth I can use it without meeting any type of shaving cream or water it works better on my skin dry I can put lotion on right after using it&#x27;s just perfect</li>
            <li> I have been using body trimmers for about 5 years now.  This is a very good one, I shave my arms and it works very well, I also shave down under and it works great.  You still need to be careful but it does the job almost as good as a razor.  I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for what it&#x27;s advertised to do. I bought this hoping to quit using razors, but soon realized that razors are just much better in every way possible, except the price.</li>
            <li> ok it works perfectly all over. and i mean all over. no cuts or pulls and its a little odd then wet it and its all good.&lt;br /&gt;** your private areas will be safe including the boys, i&#x27;d recommend that area being wet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;battery life is fine i&#x27;m not using it everyday or more than once a week.&lt;br /&gt;cleans easy, and pulls apart quick and easy too.&lt;br /&gt;trims clean and even&lt;br /&gt;shaves nice skin tight and very smooth&lt;br /&gt;the edge trimmer is nice works&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve got kinda sensitive skin and its fine with no creams/gels/forms or anything just water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you have to use the charging stand to charge it. not a bad thing but not my preference.&lt;br /&gt;i kinda wish it had a turbo speed. i think it would trim faster but just faster&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve had other groomers this in the top 2 i&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> The head is smaller so you can&#x27;t cover as much surface area as quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman and I use it for my legs and my bikini area.  I love the thing.</li>
            <li> This is a really great shaver/groomer. It&#x27;s virtually impossible to nick or cut yourself with it (although it did happen once with me), so it&#x27;s ideal for guys who might be a little careless when it comes to trimming. The plastic attachment for the trimmer end works great and you can change it up and down depending on how long or short you want to keep or cut hair. I find that sometimes even the shortest setting might not be short enough...but that&#x27;s where the shaver end comes into play. It can be a little difficult to shave some parts, but overall it does a good job of what it advertises. Plus you can use it in the shower. The only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; part about it is that it&#x27;s a hassle to clean...hair gets almost all over this product if you use it like I do, and if you want to maintain it you have to take it apart and make sure all the hair is out. But that&#x27;s not a huge deal. Another thing that can be annoying is the charging dock. Sometimes the unit does not like to stay in the dock properly so it ends up not charging. Be sure the light is lit up and stays lit so it charges. The metal contacts on the plastic dock and the unit don&#x27;t like to stay touching properly all the time!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an older model of the BodyGroom. It is perfect for removing hair from where i don&#x27;t want it. I take it to the gym and use it in the shower there. My only complaint is there is no wrist strap attachment so you can&#x27;t easily drop it to the floor when showering and your hands are wet and soapy, which the older model had.</li>
            <li> I got this as a replacement for my 4 year old plain norelco body groom. However I am going back to what I have been using since the body groom pro is not smooth at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rolling capability of the foil shaving head makes the cutters drag on your skin as you run the foil shaver across your body. Also the cutters don&#x27;t cut very well since the plastic mechanism which the cutters/foil shaver sit it to allow it to roll ends up getting in the way of cutting hair since it rolls unnecessarily into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoever designed this stupid &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; functionality so it follows the contours of your body, must have never used it on himself. I&#x27;ll go back to the basic model or another brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s two, two, two clippers in one!  Having two layers of trimming power really makes this product worthwhile. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The battery in this product is HORRIBLE. It has been charging for past 5 hours and when I start using it it runs out in like 10 minutes. absolutely useless. Could&#x27;ve been better if battery lasted longer or it was possible to plug it in and use it.</li>
            <li> Makes manscaping soooo much easier especially in the lower areas which you need the most concentration..:) And its double ended to make the groomer an all in one which takes up less space.</li>
            <li> when i purchased this thing... i figured it would be like all the other razors... its seriously the best ive ever used... not cuts and no burns and i can use it anywhere. get it.</li>
            <li> Best body groomer/shaver for the money. Such a close buzz, on all body parts!</li>
            <li> Excellent service and item</li>
            <li> better than any razor on the market. Easy to use, do not use shaving foam. Works amazingly well. buyi. you will never use anyhting else</li>
            <li> The two different heads, work very well and gives a very nice shave, easy to use and very fast..a nice cut without cutting the skin...and a good battery life</li>
            <li> I thought with all the positive reviews this would be a good shaver for a man but it is definitely not.  I have been mangled.  That&#x27;s the only way I can describe it.  Even with holding the skin of my scrotum tight, this shaver ended up snagging my skin and ripping my skin causing bleeding.  I had tried it once before and it pinched me and caused a minor bleeding incident.  This was two tries and now I am tossing it.  The blades are unprotected and touch directly on your skin.  That&#x27;s scary and terrible.  I have no idea how this shaver got on the market.</li>
            <li> Great product, i love it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about getting this for man-scaping but after my first use I am amazed by this product. The dual buzzers by the shaver help to make it more comfortable and easy because it cuts longer hairs down and then has the shaver right there to shave it clean. I also loved how you don&#x27;t only have to go in one direction because the head pivots which allows you to go back and forth until the forest is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give one tip though, on the more sensitive areas I would say be careful and go slow if you are using the shaver side, if you go too fast ya might nick yourself a bit but I did notice that going slower eliminates that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also am one to be known to have sensitive skin and I have yet to have a problem on my upper legs and my inner elbows which is where I usually break out if I use a normal electric shaver or a razor and shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I love this product and I recommend this over having to go get waxed etc.</li>
