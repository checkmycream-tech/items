            <li>I took a chance and LOVED IT</li>
            <li>these r so much better!</li>
            <li>after using the conditioner that it comes wid ur hair feels and smells so much better!</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair at all which is the amazing part.</li>
            <li>Mine is more of a chocolate brown which is what I was going for.</li>
            <li>So I bought this after many reviews.</li>
            <li>Upon seeing so many reviews of this, I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More than the recommended time.</li>
            <li>Better than it did</li>
            <li>do recommend to buy more than one box.</li>
            <li>so it was able to withstand heat, humidity, and lots of water</li>
            <li>This is great for people who want a lighter brown color, but don&#x27;t want to completely bleach their hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and whenever I want to do this again or just for a touch up, I will buy this!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with Etude House&#x27;s Bubble hair dye in the red that they sell, and it didn&#x27;t work too great despite it being a brand catering to mostly Asians.</li>
            <li>accurate color</li>
            <li>(though I do see some strands not as light as others, but that&#x27;s not the brushes</li>
            <li>My hair is now a light brown--not orange like on the box.</li>
            <li>So excited</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a more gentle dye to lighten hair, then I would recommend the Milk Tea color instead.</li>
            <li>which I loved coz I would wet my hair twice a day during this summer to stay cool every day</li>
            <li>first of all this isn&#x27;t like the ones we buy here in america!</li>
            <li>The packaging was amazing and the instructions where in English</li>
            <li>When I finally use the conditioner they provide, my hair felt amazing.</li>
            <li>I left this in for about 30 minutes and my hair got to be a nice chocolate brown, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have used Palty dyes in the past and I always find that they are great quality.</li>
            <li>the first time, after putting the product in my hair for an hour (way longer than suggested, but</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I have been dying my hair bleach natural brown for a little over a year now and it is perfect because it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>Overall, this is great to get a much lighter hair color from dark hair.</li>
            <li>I defiantly do recommend palty and seller&#x27;s delivery was really fast</li>
            <li>i still hadn&#x27;t dyed my whole head&lt;</li>
            <li>If you have a lot of hair or more than shoulder length hair, one box is definitely not going to be enough.</li>
            <li>So disappointed, but lovely color on roots :P</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;but be WARNED that it has high copper tones</li>
            <li>Made My hair so soft and it isn&#x27;t hard to apply the smell wasn&#x27;t strong so that was great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing is that since it is a bleach dye, it will damage your hair somewhat, but not as much as the blonde hair dyes.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and one box barely covers my head.</li>
            <li>The shades come out pretty much like the color scheme on the back of the box, so for black or dark brown hair, you can lighten your hair by quite a lot.</li>
            <li>but I do have very stubborn dark hair.</li>
            <li>I only use shampoo for color treated hair for the first few washes and then I go back to my regular Head and Shoulders shampoo.</li>

            <li> and I thought if I buy the lightest blonde it would at least turn out a light brown because I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t go completely blonde on my black hair</li>
            <li> advice is if you have a lot of hair,  or if you have long hair get multiple boxes.  </li>
            <li> In your hair long enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like other dyes that barely dye your hair, this one will make your hair the color it provides</li>
            <li> /&gt;After buying this Palty hair dye, I didn&#x27;t have much hope except that maybe the fact that it contains bleach would at least give some effect to my color even if I did dye it before a medium-shade color.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It did not cover Grey hair</li>
            <li> The color was at this dark dirty blonde for about a week or two until it evened out and now my hair is a nice dark natural brown that is a few shades darker than the box shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10</li>
            <li> but my hair has come out exactly like the box because I leave the hair dye in for at least an hour!</li>
            <li> but did not dye my hair that was previously died, only died my roots.</li>
            <li> I have naturally black hair since I am Asian, and wanted to have a lighter brown.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I knew it wouldnt be as harsh as a regular bleach kit</li>
            <li> I have dark black Asian hair</li>
            <li> Still, not much of a difference other than the damage of chemicals (crispy, split ends).</li>
            <li> would recommend, especially for those who have black Asian hair and have tried everything, and I mean everything.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell which is nice because I hate that the American dyes always smell horrible and give me a headache.</li>
            <li> They went from an extremely dark red-brown to almost a dark dirty blonde shade, especially at the roots (which I found weird, but maybe this product works even better on virgin hair).</li>
            <li> u noe how the american brands leave ur hair feeling all icky n rough after u dyed ur hair?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to find hair products at the local store that will accommodate for just how stubborn my natural black hair can be.</li>
            <li> I have really dark hair,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly my hair dint turn out that color it turn to a dark brown .</li>
            <li> I am Korean, so I have dark hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark brown</li>
            <li> This dye works for my dark black hair.</li>
            <li> Now when I say naturally black, my hair is literally the darkest dark brown in the sunlight, so indoors</li>
            <li> like I said, my hair is a stubborn black with now some dye in it), my locks lightened.</li>
            <li> my hair was like almost black, I&#x27;ve always wanted lighter hair</li>
            <li> but after I rinsed and blow dried and styled my hair</li>
            <li> youtubing a few reviews</li>
            <li> I hate spending so much money on a salon for bleaching my hair and for it to look straw like and gross.</li>
            <li> very little shampoo,</li>
            <li> and the shampoo too small.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look dried out from the chemicals which is a plus!</li>
            <li> , I mean I like that</li>
            <li> and my intentions were just to do a subtle ombre.</li>
            <li> no good and hurt my hair.</li>
            <li> So for those of you that gave this a poor review, you should try again.</li>
            <li> After I washed it off, my hair didn&#x27;t feel horrible.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t smell horribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very easy to apply and came out good!!!</li>
            <li> So I bought this product of from Amazon after watching reviews for this on youtube and since I&#x27;m Asian I have really dark hair, So before I dyed my hair using store bought box dye&#x27;s and I thought if I buy the lightest blonde it would at least turn out a light brown because I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t go completely blonde on my black hair but after I rinsed and blow dried and styled my hair I only saw some brassy tones and it gave some red tints to my hair which I didn&#x27;t want at all. Then I herd about palty hair dyes and I decided to give it a go and it worked! I am really happy with my result. I defiantly do recommend palty and seller&#x27;s delivery was really fast and I will be using palty again.</li>
            <li> first of all this isn&#x27;t like the ones we buy here in america! these r so much better! u noe how the american brands leave ur hair feeling all icky n rough after u dyed ur hair? well this one doesn&#x27;t! after using the conditioner that it comes wid ur hair feels and smells so much better! after using this one i started to like em and so this brand is wat i use 2 dye my hair nowadays</li>
            <li> this color suck. no good and hurt my hair. and the shampoo too small. but smell good. very little shampoo,</li>
            <li> I have dark black Asian hair and I used this to retouch my roots. I put 1/3 of the bottle in and left for 30 min. There was a noticeable difference, but definitely not as blonde as the picture suggests. Mine is more of a chocolate brown which is what I was going for.</li>
            <li> So I bought this after many reviews. I&#x27;m not asian (hispanic) but I do have very stubborn dark hair. I hate spending so much money on a salon for bleaching my hair and for it to look straw like and gross. Because of all that, i cut my hair short and let it grow out. I now have shoulder length hair. Upon seeing so many reviews of this, I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s say it works. Amazingly! Did it bleach my hair? Yes. It lightened to a brown that is around the same area as the woman in the box. I was happy! The packaging was amazing and the instructions where in English so I didn&#x27;t struggle at all. Plus the brush they had made everything come out evenly (though I do see some strands not as light as others, but that&#x27;s not the brushes fault).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for 50 minutes. More than the recommended time. But that&#x27;s because I know from experience that my hair takes a lot longer. After I washed it off, my hair didn&#x27;t feel horrible. I was happy alone with that. When I finally use the conditioner they provide, my hair felt amazing. Better than it did before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I ever buy this again? Yes. This now will forever be my go to product. It&#x27;s easy to apply and whenever I want to do this again or just for a touch up, I will buy this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend to buy more than one box. If you have a lot of hair or more than shoulder length hair, one box is definitely not going to be enough.</li>
            <li> accurate color but did not dye my hair that was previously died, only died my roots. So disappointed, but lovely color on roots :P</li>
            <li> This dye works for my dark black hair. My hair is now a light brown--not orange like on the box. It&#x27;s not like other dyes that barely dye your hair, this one will make your hair the color it provides and it doesn&#x27;t smell horribly. My hair doesn&#x27;t look dried out from the chemicals which is a plus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Asian roots, so living in America it&#x27;s difficult to find hair products at the local store that will accommodate for just how stubborn my natural black hair can be. Now when I say naturally black, my hair is literally the darkest dark brown in the sunlight, so indoors it&#x27;s pitch black.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with Etude House&#x27;s Bubble hair dye in the red that they sell, and it didn&#x27;t work too great despite it being a brand catering to mostly Asians. After months of even going to a salon to color my hair, it still wouldn&#x27;t budge in lightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After buying this Palty hair dye, I didn&#x27;t have much hope except that maybe the fact that it contains bleach would at least give some effect to my color even if I did dye it before a medium-shade color.&lt;br /&gt;For the first time, after putting the product in my hair for an hour (way longer than suggested, but like I said, my hair is a stubborn black with now some dye in it), my locks lightened. They went from an extremely dark red-brown to almost a dark dirty blonde shade, especially at the roots (which I found weird, but maybe this product works even better on virgin hair). The color was at this dark dirty blonde for about a week or two until it evened out and now my hair is a nice dark natural brown that is a few shades darker than the box shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/10 would recommend, especially for those who have black Asian hair and have tried everything, and I mean everything.</li>
            <li> Made My hair so soft and it isn&#x27;t hard to apply the smell wasn&#x27;t strong so that was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly my hair dint turn out that color it turn to a dark brown .</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I am Korean, so I have dark hair. I left this in for about 30 minutes and my hair got to be a nice chocolate brown, which is what I wanted. If you want the color on the box you will have to do multiple treatments or use a stronger bleach first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is if you have a lot of hair,  or if you have long hair get multiple boxes.  One box won&#x27;t be enough to cover everything.  I</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I knew it wouldnt be as harsh as a regular bleach kit and my intentions were just to do a subtle ombre. I dipped my hair into the mixture, combed and foil wrapped for 40 mins. Still, not much of a difference other than the damage of chemicals (crispy, split ends).</li>
            <li> For those of you that are saying that you didn&#x27;t see any results, it&#x27;s because you are not leaving it In your hair long enough. I have been dying my hair bleach natural brown for a little over a year now and it is perfect because it lasts a long time! I don&#x27;t even use shampoo for color treated hair and it still stays in my hair. I only use shampoo for color treated hair for the first few washes and then I go back to my regular Head and Shoulders shampoo. I only buy this now to do touch ups on my roots every so often as they grow out. My hair is naturally dark brown but my hair has come out exactly like the box because I leave the hair dye in for at least an hour! Yes, an hour! And it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair at all which is the amazing part. The one flaw about this hair dye is that you need two boxes when dying your hair. I have shoulder length hair and one box barely covers my head. However, that is the only flaw I see there is. So for those of you that gave this a poor review, you should try again. It does work! ;)</li>
            <li> my hair was like almost black, I&#x27;ve always wanted lighter hair&lt;br /&gt;I had ombred my hair before just the tips&lt;br /&gt;but i still hadn&#x27;t dyed my whole head&lt;br /&gt;after youtubing a few reviews I took a chance and LOVED IT&lt;br /&gt;I have repurchased it around 5 times&lt;br /&gt;DOES NOT WAS OUT, which I loved coz I would wet my hair twice a day during this summer to stay cool every day so it was able to withstand heat, humidity, and lots of water&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a bit orangish, I mean I like that, I wanna work my way up to orange&lt;br /&gt;but be WARNED that it has high copper tones</li>
            <li> I love the color my hair turned out!!!!! I will purchase again when I need a touch up!!!!  So excited</li>
            <li> It did not cover Grey hair</li>
            <li> This is great for people who want a lighter brown color, but don&#x27;t want to completely bleach their hair. I have naturally black hair since I am Asian, and wanted to have a lighter brown. The shades come out pretty much like the color scheme on the back of the box, so for black or dark brown hair, you can lighten your hair by quite a lot. I have used Palty dyes in the past and I always find that they are great quality. The only thing is that since it is a bleach dye, it will damage your hair somewhat, but not as much as the blonde hair dyes. If you are looking for a more gentle dye to lighten hair, then I would recommend the Milk Tea color instead. It also doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell which is nice because I hate that the American dyes always smell horrible and give me a headache. Overall, this is great to get a much lighter hair color from dark hair.</li>
            <li> The color came out great.  I will buy this product again..</li>
