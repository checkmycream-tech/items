            <li>now so glad i can get it online as i cant seem to get it in hair dressers these days</li>
            <li>This bottle of conditioner came leaking from the top cap which was loosened.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite conditioners from Nexxus.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OKAY smelling.</li>
            <li>but no matter how moisturizing they claim to be, they can&#x27;t top this one.  </li>
            <li>will be buying this many times again.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance of it - very clean smelling.</li>
            <li>Light but effective to detangle and give smooth finish.</li>
            <li>This product is great, my hair is professionally colored and soaks up this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair really soft and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>it smells so good and condition really well.</li>
            <li>I have hypothyroid hair that breaks easily</li>
            <li>It is so l light</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t feel like it made my hair silky smooth or even detangled for that matter.</li>
            <li>FABULOUS conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I got this conditioner because it is significantly cheaper than their \\&quot;Humuctress\\&quot; conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair full of body and shine.</li>
            <li>Huge bottle, smells great, conditions without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it since 2002 - left it, and came back to it - and it&#x27;s still the best ever.</li>
            <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like something is weighing it down.</li>
            <li>the best conditioner i have ever used i have fine hair and other conditioners leave my hair very greasey,this leaves my hair feeling soft, and smelling like peaches.  </li>
            <li>This is not a heavy cream conditioner and that&#x27;s what I love about it...</li>
            <li>I love smell but it doesn&#x27;t feel the same as the original one.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, I was turned onto it several years ago when Nexxus dropped a previous line that I used for years..</li>
            <li>but evidently Nexxus Phyto Organics isn&#x27;t making it anymore.  </li>
            <li>use it daily and love the product - both my husband and myself.</li>
            <li>Light conditioning that you can use daily</li>
            <li>The conditioner I really wanted was Babassu Mud</li>
            <li>and this helps me so much.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m using more product to achieve its purpose vs. other conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The fragrance of this conditioner is amazing and people will notice it when you walk past them...</li>
            <li>clean and not soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Hardly any conditioner works for me, and this one is really nice for me.</li>
            <li>Love that it leaves my hair with few tangles.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, leaves your hair soft and supple and manageble.  </li>
            <li>This is not an organic product, false advertising, all the top ingredients for this (and the shampoo) are things I wouldn&#x27;t really even want on my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have medium to long hair, you may just have to use a little more conditioner or try it with the Phyto Organics leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>You need very little of it to make your hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Previously purchased this product from a salon, but now it is only available online.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>but then I don&#x27;t throw/give half filled bottles away of other things.</li>
            <li>Not good for people with fine hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It was recommended to me by my barber because my hair was dry.</li>
            <li> but it works on my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling greasy and weighted down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on other products (biolage, matrix etc)</li>
            <li> so I can comb my hair without snarls unlike other conditioners that may leave me with a rats nest feeling.</li>
            <li> Your hair is not weighed down.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product previously at Penneys then they stopped carring it.</li>
            <li> Conditions hair without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a different looking bottle with a broken pump.</li>
            <li> Smelled bad, really bad and didn&#x27;t feel good in my hair during shampooing or after.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about this one yet.</li>
            <li> The product seems/smells legit, however I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s from diverted stock.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if the pump cap is broken or what.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced a conditioner like this before.</li>
            <li> So, yes, it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> Too bad Nexxus has discontinued this product</li>
            <li> Like Nexxus but hated this product line.</li>

            <li> I love this conditioner.  It leaves your hair soft and feeling &amp;#34;nurtured&amp;#34;, but the best part is the smell (sort of almonds and cleanliness).  Too bad Nexxus has discontinued this product and it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>

            <li> good quality conditioner. Light but effective to detangle and give smooth finish. rinses out well.</li>
            <li> The conditioner I really wanted was Babassu Mud but evidently Nexxus Phyto Organics isn&#x27;t making it anymore.  This bottle of conditioner came leaking from the top cap which was loosened.  But when I tried to turn the pump cap to have it pump properly from the cap, I couldn&#x27;t get it to work.  Don&#x27;t know if the pump cap is broken or what.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling greasy and weighted down.  Not good for people with fine hair</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I CALL IT &amp;#34;MY HAIR PERFUME&amp;#34;. it smells so good and condition really well. I will continue to buy this product</li>
            <li> One of my favorite conditioners from Nexxus.  Makes your hair really soft and it smells great.  It&#x27;s great for colored hair.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, never builds up.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and it smells really great too ! You need very little of it to make your hair smooth and silky.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for many years and it works very well for me. It was recommended to me by my barber because my hair was dry.</li>
            <li> I got this conditioner because it is significantly cheaper than their \\&quot;Humuctress\\&quot; conditioner. It did not hydrate my hair as well as Humuctress did and feels a lot thinner. The conditioner really smells good though! I would probably switch back to Humuctress once the weather gets really dry. This conditioner works well for now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years.  Love that it leaves my hair with few tangles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this conditioner - I felt like it left my hair &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean and not soft and silky.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner since college. I have to order it online. It is so l light and I love the scent!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone was talking about how great this smells. It&#x27;s OKAY smelling. I also didn&#x27;t feel like it made my hair silky smooth or even detangled for that matter. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> Good product i&#x27;m start to used a year ago</li>
            <li> Not sure about this one yet. I love smell but it doesn&#x27;t feel the same as the original one.</li>
            <li> I like how my hair feels after use.  It relaxes my waves.  BUT, it requires a lot of product to achieve the detangling effect.  So, I&#x27;m using more product to achieve its purpose vs. other conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a different looking bottle with a broken pump. The product seems/smells legit, however I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s from diverted stock.</li>
            <li> Very light feeling conditioner but it works on my dry hair.

So, yes, it&#x27;s expensive but then I don&#x27;t throw/give half filled bottles away of other things.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!!!! Works wonders!!!!</li>
            <li> This is not an organic product, false advertising, all the top ingredients for this (and the shampoo) are things I wouldn&#x27;t really even want on my skin.</li>
            <li> Like Nexxus but hated this product line. Smelled bad, really bad and didn&#x27;t feel good in my hair during shampooing or after.  To the point I&#x27;m not even 2/3 of the way through the bottle and I tossed it.  Pricey experiment.</li>
            <li> I started using this conditioner after my hair stylist used it on me. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like something is weighing it down.</li>
            <li> best hair conditioner I have ever found. will be buying this many times again. Leaves my hair full of body and shine.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used it since 2002 - left it, and came back to it - and it&#x27;s still the best ever. The reason it&#x27;s so great is that it detangles and moisturizes with the most lightweight texture. Your hair is not weighed down. I&#x27;ve never experienced a conditioner like this before.</li>
            <li> This is not a heavy cream conditioner and that&#x27;s what I love about it...I have short hair so I can comb my hair without snarls unlike other conditioners that may leave me with a rats nest feeling. If you have medium to long hair, you may just have to use a little more conditioner or try it with the Phyto Organics leave-in conditioner.  The fragrance of this conditioner is amazing and people will notice it when you walk past them...&amp;#34;mmmm you smell so good!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> FABULOUS conditioner.  We use it all the time and I will reorder this for as long as I can find it.  I have hypothyroid hair that breaks easily and this helps me so much.  It is not greasy, leaves your hair soft and supple and manageble.  Hardly any conditioner works for me, and this one is really nice for me. Good for everyone in our family of all hair types.</li>
