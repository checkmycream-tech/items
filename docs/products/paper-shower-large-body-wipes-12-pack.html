            <li>When the bloods pumping and the sweats pouring you will want NOTHING more then to unwrap a papershower and apply onto your body.</li>
            <li>It was refreshing, it cleaned us well, and it was convenient.</li>
            <li>I took it camping with my family, and it was great to have to clean ourselves up when were getting ready for bed</li>
            <li>Easily has become this holiday&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It is the best substitute you can get when a shower is not available.  </li>
            <li>I got these for after light morning workouts and for our emergency/earthquake kit.</li>
            <li>Used a free sample after a three day camping trip.</li>
            <li>As a semi-professional basketball player about to play in the TBL(turkish basketball league), I can tell you from personal experience that there is nothing better then a papershower after a good workout.</li>
            <li>You never know when you might be without water and wanting to clean up.</li>
            <li>I was at Floyd fest this year and did not feel like waiting in the long lines for the showers and in between sets that we wanted to see these came in great for a quick refresher so that we didn&#x27;t stink like the hippies we were partyin&#x27; with</li>
            <li>thanks for making such a great product.</li>
            <li>The dry one didn&#x27;t feel good and didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li>As an avid Mountain biker there is nothing better than being able to freshen up in an instant and PaperShower does just that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a useful product.</li>
            <li>I bought this wondering if it was really worth it or not, but it was SOOOO useful.</li>
            <li>I loved the wet ones.</li>
            <li>Personally, I am a big camper, nothing gets me more excited than a weekend in the wilderness.  </li>
            <li>Papershower is a must have for any avid camper, athlete or any person that just needs a quick cleanup.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell, but they were barely big enough to clean your hands, let alone</li>
            <li>I bought these for my husband who takes many long, overnight bicycle trips.</li>
            <li>, it comes in handy when you have the grandkids out and about - a quick clean up when there is no bathroom around to clean up dirty hands and faces.</li>
            <li>The real test was the underarms</li>
            <li>I only used it because it was handed to me as free promotional give-away.</li>
            <li>after a couple of days in the woods, he can clean up enough to stop by and get something to eat and the people in the restaurant don&#x27;t mind too much</li>
            <li>They really felt like I was getting clean during our camping trip this last summer.</li>
            <li>Does the job they were intended to do, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who loves hiking and camping.</li>
            <li>I felt so refreshed and clean after a long day of setting up camp, fishing, and a fire with all of the germs i exposed myself to.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really use the dry ones; I didn&#x27;t really need to, since it was summer and hot.</li>
            <li>I live in earthquake country and keep some in my car just in case.</li>
            <li>Since these are marketed toward cyclists and such, I expected them to work at refreshing and ridding me of any body odor.  </li>
            <li>The problem is that you can&#x27;t take a hot shower in the middle of the woods.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are much bigger and wetter and I felt very refreshed after.</li>
            <li>Although we live in a high tech world, it is still the simple product concepts like Paper Shower that makes me think: &#x60;Why didn&#x27;t I think of this!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>These help me clean up a little in between.</li>
            <li>However, I would prefer to be able to purchase only the wet wipes, without the dry ones which I do not need.</li>
            <li>With its moist and dry towels, you can clean and dry yourself off in seconds.</li>
            <li>Bar Method is intense but doesn&#x27;t involve much cardio at all and yet this pack didn&#x27;t do anything to help the little bit of odor I had under my arms.  </li>
            <li>I am don&#x27;t really see a need for the dry towel portion</li>
            <li>I know that when I go out and play sports I wish that I had a small and convenient item to clean myself off with.</li>
            <li>I usually carry around a spray bottle of water and to keep myself cool.</li>
            <li>They are big enough to thoroughly wash up after a day of riding, and the dry cloth really does dry off wet skin quickly.</li>
            <li>And note that there seven five-star reviews posted on the same day by seven persons with no other reviewing history.</li>
            <li>Including a separate wet and dry towelette in the pack really makes this product so versatile.  </li>

            <li> Paper Shower is a great product! Including a separate wet and dry towelette in the pack really makes this product so versatile.  Although we live in a high tech world, it is still the simple product concepts like Paper Shower that makes me think: &#x60;Why didn&#x27;t I think of this!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Papershowers are a must have! Easily has become this holiday&#x27;s must have item of the year! You should defiantly purchase one for yourself and others in time for the holidays.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I have a tough time being outdoors in the hot weather. I usually carry around a spray bottle of water and to keep myself cool. This works just as well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it comes in handy when you have the grandkids out and about - a quick clean up when there is no bathroom around to clean up dirty hands and faces.</li>
            <li> Papershower is a must have for any avid camper, athlete or any person that just needs a quick cleanup. I know that when I go out and play sports I wish that I had a small and convenient item to clean myself off with. Papershower does just that. With its moist and dry towels, you can clean and dry yourself off in seconds. This item is a must buy for the holidays or whenever your out and about!</li>
            <li> Personally, I am a big camper, nothing gets me more excited than a weekend in the wilderness.  The problem is that you can&#x27;t take a hot shower in the middle of the woods.  I tried the paper shower product and it was incredible.  I felt so refreshed and clean after a long day of setting up camp, fishing, and a fire with all of the germs i exposed myself to.  It is the best substitute you can get when a shower is not available.  I highly recommend it for anyone who loves hiking and camping.</li>
            <li> I used this duo after a 60 minute Bar Method class when I didn&#x27;t have time to shower before work.  Since these are marketed toward cyclists and such, I expected them to work at refreshing and ridding me of any body odor.  They did not.  Bar Method is intense but doesn&#x27;t involve much cardio at all and yet this pack didn&#x27;t do anything to help the little bit of odor I had under my arms.  I used the wipe on my arms and chest as well, but I don&#x27;t smell there.  The real test was the underarms and it didn&#x27;t work.  The dry towelette seemed pointless since the wet towelette wasn&#x27;t that wet.  The dry one didn&#x27;t feel good and didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I won&#x27;t be buying these again.  Regular baby wipes do the same thing and are MUCH less expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I simply don&#x27;t get it!!!  Nothing more than a wet-wipe.  I only used it because it was handed to me as free promotional give-away. I found that the wet towel left a powdery residue on my skin and the dry wipe had no use at all.</li>
            <li> I literally have had 0 friends my entire life until I discovered paper shower.  Now, paper shower is my one and only friend, and it is always there for me when I need it.</li>
            <li> Papershower is a great product for all to enjoy.  People of all ages will be 100% satisfied after using this amazing product.</li>
            <li> my hubby loves these!  after a couple of days in the woods, he can clean up enough to stop by and get something to eat and the people in the restaurant don&#x27;t mind too much</li>
            <li> As an avid Mountain biker there is nothing better than being able to freshen up in an instant and PaperShower does just that.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!!! thanks for making such a great product.</li>
            <li> I use this after surgery before I was able to get a shower and love them! I had previously used Playtex sports body wipes and they were a joke. I liked the smell, but they were barely big enough to clean your hands, let alone anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are much bigger and wetter and I felt very refreshed after. I got these for after light morning workouts and for our emergency/earthquake kit. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> These came in very handy while camping.  I was at Floyd fest this year and did not feel like waiting in the long lines for the showers and in between sets that we wanted to see these came in great for a quick refresher so that we didn&#x27;t stink like the hippies we were partyin&#x27; with :)  i also use them at work.  I work in a gym and teach several classes a day and do not have time to shower after each one so they come in very handy.  I am don&#x27;t really see a need for the dry towel portion but maybe you do....</li>
            <li> As a semi-professional basketball player about to play in the TBL(turkish basketball league), I can tell you from personal experience that there is nothing better then a papershower after a good workout. When the bloods pumping and the sweats pouring you will want NOTHING more then to unwrap a papershower and apply onto your body. As an athlete, father, and towelette conosur i can promise this is an unparalleled product and anyone and everyone will be happy with there purchase.</li>
            <li> Used a free sample after a three day camping trip. Apparently worked: my \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; friends failed to complain ( as they usually do )when I rejoined civilization. I think the dry towel is unnecessary. And note that there seven five-star reviews posted on the same day by seven persons with no other reviewing history.</li>
            <li> These things are the best invention ever. I train for and race Ironman triathlons, which means I am out for hours and hour training, transitioning between swimming in the lake to my bike and then running. These help me clean up a little in between. I take them to all my races so I can wash my face arms and legs off at the end to get rid of the salt stains, dead bugs and dirt all over me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great for camping and if you have kids.</li>
            <li> The moist towel works as well as any other Adventure kit type.  The dry towel would be appreciated if I was sweaty and backpacking in really cold weather, but that&#x27;s not usually the case.  For warmer weather I prefer the simplicity of one pack of wipes I can throw in my bag.  4 stars because it&#x27;s a great product, just a bit more than I need.</li>
            <li> Does the job they were intended to do, nothing more, nothing less. I live in earthquake country and keep some in my car just in case. You never know when you might be without water and wanting to clean up.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband who takes many long, overnight bicycle trips. He loves them! They are big enough to thoroughly wash up after a day of riding, and the dry cloth really does dry off wet skin quickly. The packets take up very little room in his bike sacks. They are perfect for his needs.</li>
            <li> This is a useful product. However, I would prefer to be able to purchase only the wet wipes, without the dry ones which I do not need. Thank You.</li>
            <li> I bought this wondering if it was really worth it or not, but it was SOOOO useful. I took it camping with my family, and it was great to have to clean ourselves up when were getting ready for bed and we were sweaty and dirty from being outside all day long. It was refreshing, it cleaned us well, and it was convenient. I will definitely buy again for our next camping trip.</li>
            <li> I loved the wet ones. They really felt like I was getting clean during our camping trip this last summer. I didn&#x27;t really use the dry ones; I didn&#x27;t really need to, since it was summer and hot.</li>
