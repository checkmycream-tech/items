            <li>It may not  have ever occurred to me to use a product with the fruit stem cells in it, but it truly is an amazing idea for your skin.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m all about natural and organic cleansers and this couldn&#x27;t be more perfect.  </li>
            <li>When I apply a product to any part of my body I want to know that the product is healthy for my body and hair, as well as it still perform to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>But this is okay.</li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>i love the smell.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I starts as a more gel like consistency but you can work up to a soapy form.</li>
            <li>I love this face soap.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this cleanser many times and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li>and I just love how my skin feels after every wash.</li>
            <li>Yup, I really like this creamy cleanser that smells great.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser offers a very nice smell, which remained in the bathroom after its use.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so fresh and clean, and now boasts a very healthy shine.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use the whole bottle before writing a review so far, I&#x27;m very happy with it and will continue using this product</li>
            <li>Though I wish it made a bit more of a lather when using, it does leave your face feeling clean without over-drying</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, inexpensive, it removes makeup easily and smells gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I also use a little baking soda to help exfoliate, and I am over the moon happy with how my face looks and feels now!</li>
            <li>I have used this product during the morning and at night and have had only great results.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic that it is also cruelty free, no experimentation on animals.</li>
            <li>but I find this creamy wash to be gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>I think it is important to note that if you are a person who needs their face wash to foam, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>What I love most about this product is how little of it you have to use to get a good lather going on your face.</li>
            <li>and it rinses CLEAN, no greasy feeling to my skin afterwards</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my skin feel - soft and clean!</li>
            <li>I am 64 and fair skinned German.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s certainly not as bad as others.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a very mild tingle when you first put it on</li>
            <li>I wish more people knew about this line and this particular product.</li>
            <li>I love that all of the products offered by Andalou Naturals are made with a lot of thought and care, by blending advanced Fruit Stem Cell Science with natural and fair-trade ingredients, with a minimum 70% certified organic content.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many facial cleansers and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is also more drying than my normal cleanser (I use</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was pleased that none of the products caused irritation.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t strip your skin, but somehow magically lifts dirt and unclogs pores, while incredibly gently cleaning your skin and revealing soft, smooth, clean skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy enough with this that while I get tempted to stray, so far I&#x27;ve remained faithful to this product for 6</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>In all my searching I have found my skin likes to have all 3 steps, once a day unless its super hot out.</li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s a creamy cleanser, it&#x27;s super light, I was very surprised about that</li>
            <li>This light formula goes on smooth, does not irritate my sensitive skin and really seems to help relieve congested pores.</li>
            <li>The bottle offers an easy to use pump, with no squezzing required to get to the cleanser.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean after use but not dry like it was overwashed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I have noticed any real brightening effects through using this in combo with the serum, but regardless it&#x27;s a great product.  </li>
            <li>I used it for a few days just to give it a fair trial</li>
            <li>Leaves it feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>ingredients in it are super, Manuka honey, WOW!  </li>
            <li>I used this cleanser for a long time, and I was quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It effectively cleans my face, but I would recommend using a moisturizer afterwards as it can be slightly drying on</li>
            <li>you are cleaning your face with the cleanser, it rubs in very well and cleans your skin with ease.</li>
            <li>I really like Andalou products.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>My face is soft, radiant and calm.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>The product works better than expected.  </li>
            <li>I noticed I wasn&#x27;t using as much concealer after using this for a couple of months, so</li>
            <li>I like the Meyer Creamy Cleanser, Lemon, too early to say if I love it because only been using it a week.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the other products in this line, this one is just so-so.</li>
            <li>my pores seemed to be smaller and i definately felt clean.</li>
            <li>The first 24 hrs, using am and pm my skin felt soft and exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>AND it removes most of my permanent black eyelash mascara.</li>
            <li>I have older combination skin</li>
            <li>I got some soothing vitamin products, eye creams and cool water cloths 3x a day and now after 2 weeks of not using it I am back to normal.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t particularly care for creamy cleansers</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling clean but not overly dry.</li>
            <li>, how did they get it in the bottle in there at such an economical price?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li>Love the product because it is not too harsh and my face responds well to it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very clean and fresh, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out the way other products do.  </li>
            <li>I have decrease the use to only at night now to prevent my skin from getting more dry.</li>
            <li>All in all, if you have super sensitive and/or dry skin, you may want to reconsider buying this product</li>
            <li>I have tried products before with a heavy scent, way too strong for me to continue using.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I&#x27;m sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin and</li>
            <li>but I have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin, prone to sensitivity, monthly breakouts and dry areas, and after years of searching, I have finally found the right cleanser for me!</li>
            <li>I bought this product due to the fact that it&#x27;s organic/natural and it has no harmful chemicals in it like most other skin care lines.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin, prone to monthly breakouts but simultaneously dry much of the time.  </li>
            <li>It took a couple weeks after using the cleanser for my face to get back to normal.</li>
            <li>Origins Perfect World- which DOES contain mild sulfates but no parabens or other nasty stuff).</li>
            <li>generally, they don&#x27;t offer the cleanse that I truly want and they tend to leave a greasy feeling or a film of oil on my face even after I&#x27;ve rinsed.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne prone, dry skin and am in my early 30s.</li>
            <li>This cleanser seriously improves the look and feel of my skin; fewer problem spots and everything feels relatively smooth and invigorated.  </li>
            <li>and I am a pretty pale (but not the palest) Caucasian.</li>
            <li>I am 61 years old and have med to dry skin.</li>
            <li>After years of dealing with SEVERELY blemish-prone skin -- acne, deep acne, bumps, redness, and occasional eczema-- skin that was simultaneously acne-prone, dry, sensitive, and aging, I finally (at age 40!!) found the solution.</li>
            <li>Very creamy on face and becomes tacky - hard to remove, but leaves face soft</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This stuff is amazing. After years of dealing with SEVERELY blemish-prone skin -- acne, deep acne, bumps, redness, and occasional eczema-- skin that was simultaneously acne-prone, dry, sensitive, and aging, I finally (at age 40!!) found the solution. This doesn&#x27;t strip your skin, but somehow magically lifts dirt and unclogs pores, while incredibly gently cleaning your skin and revealing soft, smooth, clean skin. Over the past month my acne scars have faded dramatically, no new breakouts have happened, and all without anything irritating or drying out my skin. My skin is so soft and smooth! I also use a little baking soda to help exfoliate, and I am over the moon happy with how my face looks and feels now! I wish more people knew about this line and this particular product. I was using the clarifying line and it was a little too astringent and dried me out a bit, but the brightening line is absolute perfection! My hat is off to this company. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> The pump gets clogged and stops working after a while. The cleanser is nice, though.</li>
            <li> Meyer Lemon Creamy Cleanser, which works just as well as the  best cleansers that I have tried on my face before it. I love that all of the products offered by Andalou Naturals are made with a lot of thought and care, by blending advanced Fruit Stem Cell Science with natural and fair-trade ingredients, with a minimum 70% certified organic content. When I apply a product to any part of my body I want to know that the product is healthy for my body and hair, as well as it still perform to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cleanser has blown my expectations away. The bottle offers an easy to use pump, with no squezzing required to get to the cleanser. I have used this product during the morning and at night and have had only great results. The cleanser offers a very nice smell, which remained in the bathroom after its use. I have tried products before with a heavy scent, way too strong for me to continue using. I am happy to report that the Meyer Lemon Creamy Cleanser does not suffer with this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are cleaning your face with the cleanser, it rubs in very well and cleans your skin with ease. I am really impressed that this product didn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky feeling at all. It may not  have ever occurred to me to use a product with the fruit stem cells in it, but it truly is an amazing idea for your skin. My skin feels so fresh and clean, and now boasts a very healthy shine.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with the product. can be acceptable Working good as mentioned. But i was looking for a face wash which only contains honey. But this is okay.</li>
            <li> I bought starter brightening starter kit and really loved this. I noticed a difference when I ran out. I bought this and my skin is feeling smoother again. My skin is sensitive and I&#x27;m sensitive to smells but the lemon smell is really nice.</li>
            <li> Andalou Naturals products are wonderful.  I like the Meyer Creamy Cleanser, Lemon, too early to say if I love it because only been using it a week.  It is fantastic that it is also cruelty free, no experimentation on animals.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for smoothing out aging skin.</li>
            <li> What I love most about this product is how little of it you have to use to get a good lather going on your face. There&#x27;s a very mild tingle when you first put it on but it feels soothing within seconds. It effectively cleans my face, but I would recommend using a moisturizer afterwards as it can be slightly drying on really cold days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the cleanser dries inside the dispenser so sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to get it out, but a couple pushes should unclog it.</li>
            <li> I really like Andalou products.  I use the cleanser and the moisturizers.  I have older combination skin</li>
            <li> I had a horrible reaction to this product as well.  After using it a few times, my skin started to become itchy, swollen, and over-dried.  My eyes were puffy and I looked terrible.  I think it may be the citric acid from the lemon that causes this.  My skin is not normally that sensitive and I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this from other products before.  I would not recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It&#x27;s not too thick or greasy and you don&#x27;t need to use much. It&#x27;s natural, inexpensive, it removes makeup easily and smells gorgeous. What more could you want? I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> leaves my skin soft. no irritation. i love the smell. feels like freakin silk :) love! love! love!</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  Leaves it feeling clean and soft.  No lather to get into my eyes.  I also love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the fact that it&#x27;s organic/natural and it has no harmful chemicals in it like most other skin care lines. However, once I started using the cleanser, my face got overwhelmingly dry! So dry to where no kind of lotion could help it. It took a couple weeks after using the cleanser for my face to get back to normal. However, the smell of it was great, a nice citrus honey scent. All in all, if you have super sensitive and/or dry skin, you may want to reconsider buying this product</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, prone to sensitivity, monthly breakouts and dry areas, and after years of searching, I have finally found the right cleanser for me! My face is soft, radiant and calm. I am almost 33 and I am a pretty pale (but not the palest) Caucasian. I use Mineral Fusion toner on a cotton ball and I use the Andalou C + Probiotic moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a firm proponent of the cleanse/tone/moisturize 3-step routine!! In all my searching I have found my skin likes to have all 3 steps, once a day unless its super hot out. I also use the Skin by Ann Webb Organics Lavender Silk Powder Scrub about 4-5 days a week mixed into this wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that others had a bad reaction to the citrus and enzymes... I have had that reaction to other products (a fruit enzyme mask that felt like burning comes to mind) but I find this creamy wash to be gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel - soft and clean! AND it removes most of my permanent black eyelash mascara.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly. Just as described.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.  I starts as a more gel like consistency but you can work up to a soapy form. My skin feels very clean after use but not dry like it was overwashed (some cleaners leave me feeling dry and tight).</li>
            <li> I love this face soap.  I have sensitive, combination skin and this is the only thing I have found that does not irritate me but still cleans well.  I have purchased this cleanser many times and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Works great, even on eye makeup.  Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I love it! I have hormonal acne and this seems to help prevent my skin from breakout. It smells really good and I just love how my skin feels after every wash. I wanted to use the whole bottle before writing a review so far, I&#x27;m very happy with it and will continue using this product</li>
            <li> good product arrived on time</li>
            <li> i have used Andalou products for two years now and have absolutely loved each and every one of them. Unfortunately this really did not agree with my skin at all! It was fine upon application however as soon as i applied my other products which have never caused any issue, it burned horribly. I used it for a few days just to give it a fair trial however my skin started peeling off and was very dry however i coud not apply any moisturizer over it due to the burning.&lt;br /&gt;It did however leave me with a brighter toneand my pores seemed to be smaller and i definately felt clean. Shame&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps use only for oily skin and only in the summer</li>
            <li> The product works better than expected.  Andalou feels so good on my skin.Would definitely buy again.  Great Product.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I used this cleanser for a long time, and I was quite pleased with it. But I think it&#x27;s just a little bit too drying. And does not remove all of my makeup is one step. But it&#x27;s certainly not as bad as others.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin, prone to monthly breakouts but simultaneously dry much of the time.  This cleanser seriously improves the look and feel of my skin; fewer problem spots and everything feels relatively smooth and invigorated.  I&#x27;ve tried so many facial cleansers and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this cleanser after reading the box and reviews.  The first 24 hrs, using am and pm my skin felt soft and exfoliated.  Then the next day or so I had a horrible reaction where my skin felt burned, eyes were puffy and itchy and I looked and felt terrible!  It looked like a bad sunburn and lasted over a week.  I got some soothing vitamin products, eye creams and cool water cloths 3x a day and now after 2 weeks of not using it I am back to normal.  This is the only product that has ever effected me this way.  I am 64 and fair skinned German.  I&#x27;m going back to Signature Club A meltdown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally obsessed with this cleanser now.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t particularly care for creamy cleansers generally, they don&#x27;t offer the cleanse that I truly want and they tend to leave a greasy feeling or a film of oil on my face even after I&#x27;ve rinsed.  This cleanser does no such thing, even though it&#x27;s a creamy cleanser, it&#x27;s super light, I was very surprised about that and it rinses CLEAN, no greasy feeling to my skin afterwards yet my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry, it feels normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in it are super, Manuka honey, WOW!  we all know how expensive manuka honey is, how did they get it in the bottle in there at such an economical price?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I&#x27;m all about natural and organic cleansers and this couldn&#x27;t be more perfect.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It does seem to work as advertised, which i loved. Though I wish it made a bit more of a lather when using, it does leave your face feeling clean without over-drying</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about year now. Love the product because it is not too harsh and my face responds well to it. I would recommend it for my age group. I am 61 years old and have med to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Very creamy on face and becomes tacky - hard to remove, but leaves face soft</li>
            <li> Just a great product!</li>
            <li> Yup, I really like this creamy cleanser that smells great.  And it cleans my face without drying.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item about two weeks after reading the good reviews. I have began using it in the morning and night and i have noticed that it has brighten up my skin. It has also however dried out my skin on my cheeks. I have acne-prone skin :(. I am trying organic products to see if it will help. This product has not helped decrease my acne but it has helped to correct some dark spots. I have decrease the use to only at night now to prevent my skin from getting more dry.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne prone, dry skin and am in my early 30s. That&#x27;s to give you an idea of my skin. I have some sun damage and I swear this cleanser has lightened it. I noticed I wasn&#x27;t using as much concealer after using this for a couple of months, so Yay!!!  This doesn&#x27;t break me out, cause my rosacea to flare up, or dry out my skin. I&#x27;m happy enough with this that while I get tempted to stray, so far I&#x27;ve remained faithful to this product for 6 months(a logn time for me).</li>
            <li> This light formula goes on smooth, does not irritate my sensitive skin and really seems to help relieve congested pores.</li>
            <li> Smells good &amp; chemical free</li>
            <li> Great product.  Was skeptical switching from Dermalogica to an all-natural, less expensive product but I have been pleasantly surprised.  It leaves my skin feeling very clean and fresh, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out the way other products do.  I&#x27;m not sure if I have noticed any real brightening effects through using this in combo with the serum, but regardless it&#x27;s a great product.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I began using the travel set of the Andalou Naturals brightening line about 2 weeks ago. I have very sensitive skin and was pleased that none of the products caused irritation. I think it is important to note that if you are a person who needs their face wash to foam, this is not for you. Its consistency is like lotion. It is also more drying than my normal cleanser (I use Origins Perfect World- which DOES contain mild sulfates but no parabens or other nasty stuff). While I like this well enough to use daily in the mornings, I will not be using this at night. It doesn&#x27;t do a sufficient job at removing my eye make-up (I do not use waterproof eye makeup). It smells nice. I love all of the other products in this line, this one is just so-so.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite face wash. Leaves your face feeling clean but not overly dry.</li>
