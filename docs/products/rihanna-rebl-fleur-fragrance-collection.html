            <li>It came in three days. :-)</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I love the bottle&#x27;s design.</li>
            <li>I love the bottle&#x27;s design.</li>
            <li>When I rec&#x27;d it I loved it right away</li>
            <li>I was kind of scared that it would be strong, because I get dizzy with strong smells.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very unique as well.</li>
            <li>love SWEET perfumes, not the acid ones, and this is the perfect perfume to me, doesnt smell like old lady and it reminds me of flowers.</li>
            <li>It has a unique smell, which I like and it has a bit of patchouli and maybe sandalwood in it, which stays quite nicely on me.</li>
            <li>:) If you love the sample, this is very true to what&#x27;s in stores.</li>
            <li>I love the clean feel!</li>
            <li>I love trying new perfumes and thought this sounded like a great scent...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like Rihanna as an artist but her perfume is amazing!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, but I would caution you to try this out from a tester at the store to make sure you like it before purchasing--don&#x27;t rely on the magazine sample like I did!</li>
            <li>the purfume is beautiful; soft florals with hints of powdery tones.</li>
            <li>This is what my daughter wanted for Christmas, The price was cheaper than in the stores, and the perfume is a very lovely soft fragrance , I am very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and received very quickly!!</li>
            <li>I wish they sold those sizes of perfumes more in stores, so you do not have to commit to a huge 3.4 ounce or</li>
            <li>It could&#x27;ve been filled all the to the top imo.</li>
            <li>Even better that it is available online.</li>
            <li>I smelled this one in a magazine flyer from Macy&#x27;s and Liked it right away.</li>
            <li>Came in the mail shortly after I ordered it, and ohmygosh does it ever smell good!</li>
            <li>Service was very quick.</li>
            <li>not too strong which can make peoples sinuses act up.</li>
            <li>A bit too strong for a summer scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong, but lingers throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong but your presence will linger in a room once you&#x27;re gone.</li>
            <li>the smell is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too strong for my taste.  </li>
            <li>Seems too strong for a summer/spring feel.</li>
            <li>It was too strong for my liking</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet get sexy.</li>
            <li>Opening the box i could smell a light hint of the perfume its soft and amazing!</li>
            <li>The scent is gentle, warm with a vanilla-y fragrance, and not over powering or too strong.</li>
            <li>This is a very good perfume it stays on a little longer i love the scent.</li>
            <li>Goes on a little strong but once it has a minute to air out and blend with your skin, the scent is intoxicating!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li>Huge bottle for a great price, 3 times bigger bottle</li>
            <li>but it fades into a fantastic smell.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, but it isn&#x27;t the real thing.</li>
            <li>The perfume is great, but spraying it on is always a handful - literally, because you have to grip it in your entire palm and spray with your thumb!  </li>
            <li>love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next time</li>
            <li>, i get great complements daily regarding my fragrance</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this product and the price was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Always sexy &amp; intriguing.</li>
            <li>so I am comfortable wearing it at work.</li>
            <li>I also think anyone would be comfortable wearing this scent.</li>
            <li>I prefer light scents.</li>
            <li>I recommended this product to others because it was such a great deal compared to buying at a store</li>
            <li>The smell of this perfume is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The bottle is the only neat thing and it was packaged great..</li>
            <li>Smells so light and spceical.</li>
            <li>Very youthful!!!</li>
            <li>I lovvvvve how this smell &amp; the bottle itself is just sooo pretty!!</li>
            <li>She mentioned that the scent is gentle, warm with a sweet fragrance, and not over powering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li>I was happy I was able to get it for less</li>
            <li>I was excited</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get the Reb&#x27;L Fleur in the mail today, but when I took it out and used it it smelled like alcohol.  </li>
            <li>It has a unique scent that lasts for hours and you can use about three sprays and smell it all day.</li>
            <li>I tried this perfume originally as a sample.</li>
            <li>I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light</li>
            <li>I imagine that the starlets in the 1930&#x27;s and 1940&#x27;s with their perfectly curled hair, always red lipstick, glimmering tailored gowns and classy fur coats or mink stoles had the aromatic essence of Reb&#x27;L Fleur</li>
            <li>No one is more surprised with how much I love Rihanna&#x27;s perfume than myself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, bright, makes you feel young, radiant, special.</li>
            <li>Is original but smell so sweet and go faster</li>
            <li>I use this perfume for date nights and special occasions.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it as a gift for special occasions...</li>
            <li>Overpowering sweet.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>It is on the sweet side</li>
            <li>and i will be buying more real soon.</li>
            <li>I received the smaller version as a gift for my birrhday in September of 2013 and loved it.</li>
            <li>Smells sweet, but not over powering.</li>
            <li>I had a sample of it and after wearing the sample decided to buy a full bottle.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for selling this perfume for such a good price.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like it it was not to sweet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering or too sweet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet without being overpoweringly sweet.</li>
            <li>The bottle is true to size.</li>
            <li>And the smell.... so sweet with hints tropical fruit and  musk.</li>
            <li>Almost as good as the Rihanna perfume that comes in the red bottle {Forgetting the name}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the fragrance reflects a true tropical Caribbean flavour.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really recommend it, it is a very rich fragrance for those who like sweet but not cloying fragrance.</li>
            <li>Strong and pretty smell.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to anyone :) its a sweet scent yet not an over the top sweet smell</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sweet and subtle and delicious!</li>
            <li>I found myself reapplying this spray almost every 3-4 hours: it faded so quickly.</li>
            <li>Got it quickly before holidays.</li>
            <li>Came quickly in 2 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay top dollar for a scent that lasts all day than pay this high price for a scent that isn&#x27;t any longer-lasting than a room freshening spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>Love the bottle, which is a high heel.</li>
            <li>but at the same time it is also very sexy and seductive too (fits who Rhianna is</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a refreshing new scent, go with this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my favorite new scent in years.</li>
            <li>My new favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Have been looking forever for a new perfume and finally found a great one.</li>
            <li>Sexy, simple and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>smells fresh.</li>
            <li>and I liked it instantly.  </li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t seem worth all this work.</li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t seem worth all this work.</li>
            <li>my favorite perfume, by far.</li>
            <li>I own over 15 different perfumes and this fragrance is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Smell is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>It surprised me, because I didn&#x27;t want to like it, but it had something that Rebelle did not have, and I&#x27;m actually glad I go it at that size.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I used my friend&#x27;s perfume and loved it enough to buy it for myself... but somehow now don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>This perfume by far is my favorite signature scent.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>It is more on the soft powdery side.</li>
            <li>worth the money spent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and exception packing!</li>
            <li>they shipped SUPER fast!</li>
            <li>love the smell love love love it and so far it last pretty long.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>Rihanna has done it right with his Fragrences</li>
            <li>the bottle came in perfect condition, absolutely no problems with it taking long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a fan of celebrity fragrances, but I absolutely fell in love with this one.</li>
            <li>It smells warm, rich, and slightly musky.</li>
            <li>It wears off super fast</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very feminine but bold</li>
            <li>I went and bought a second bottle right just to make sure I had plenty on hand.</li>
            <li>love this second time buying clean and light but last</li>
            <li>Love the smell, will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I ordered it from Afghanistan, so it was pretty dissapointing to call her and find out she opened an unmarked box to a gift that wasn&#x27;t wrapped....</li>
            <li>First time I have ever done that.  </li>
            <li>last most of the day.</li>
            <li>I honestly really like this scent!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Smells absolutely divine!</li>
            <li>Oh well, overall, it smells lovely</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with this scent and this was actually my 3rd bottle purchased.</li>
            <li>Most perfumes wear off, this one goes and goes and goes until I actually want to wash it off.</li>
            <li>If you love this, it will last forever.</li>
            <li>Really good everyday scent.</li>
            <li>When my daughter first brought it I was like this smell so good not strong</li>
            <li>In complete and original packaging.</li>
            <li>Smells warm and spicy, not heavy or cloying, and it&#x27;s definitely different.</li>
            <li>and it did not take long to be delivered to my home :-)))</li>
            <li>While there I was able to smell a few others (some I liked, some I definitely didn&#x27;t), and Rebelle was one of them.</li>
            <li>It is also a much better price than most other websites, for the big version.  </li>
            <li>The initial scent is strong when I put it on</li>
            <li>its not too overpowering but still strong enough to be noticed.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell initially but once it&#x27;s on it</li>
            <li>this has got to be absolutely one of my fave scents.</li>
            <li>Scent still intense even after being washed  off  with soap and water.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty vanilla-y and musky, and lasts all day (though, as is normal, becomes lighter as time goes by).</li>
            <li>Waiting until the following morning when I had not applied any perfume yet for the day, I snapped open the top of this sample and dabbed 2 tiny dots on each my wrists to see if I would like it, but most of all, to determine if the scent would cause my husband&#x27;s allergies to kick in.</li>
            <li>It is the real thing...</li>
            <li>I was really unsure about it.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It reminds me a bit of Todd Oldham&#x27;s scent from the late 90&#x27;s, but far more versatile, and I&#x27;d say it can be worn day or night and would be appropriate for either.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>thanks 😊</li>
            <li>It smells so sexy and classy at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I purchased for my teen daughter and finally decided I needed to stop sneaking in her room to use hers and buy my own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did arrive a day late, but it was shipped in a good sturdy package.</li>
            <li>It seems a bit more mature than the other floral/girly celebrity fragrances that are on the market right now.</li>
            <li>Not sure, but just know we both liked it so much and a teeny bit lasted</li>
            <li>This is one of the few fragrances that have fallen in love from the first time I met her.</li>
            <li>Smells AMAZING and last long!</li>
            <li>What an enormous bottle of perfume, and super fast shipping, too.</li>
            <li>A sweet and lasting smell.</li>
            <li>Too many other new scents out there to try rather than go through this each time.</li>
            <li>Too many other new scents out there to try rather than go through this each time.ollar for a scent that lasts all day than pay this high price for a scent that isn&#x27;t any longer-lasting than a room freshening spray.    </li>
            <li>I was so surprised when I got it that it was such a huge bottle.</li>
            <li>and I still have got more than half the bottle.</li>
            <li>but once it is gone, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll stick with my &#x27;usual&#x27; scent.</li>
            <li>During the Christmas rush I went to Macy&#x27;s to buy one of my sisters&#x27; a particular perfume.</li>
            <li>sprayed on wrist and it&#x27;s so strong and bitter</li>
            <li>I bought this blindly per all the great ratings..</li>
            <li>Normally, I just buy what I have purchased before off Amazon.  </li>
            <li>it only takes a small a mount and it lasts all day which is good for those that like it</li>
            <li>this fragrance has a signature scent and its long lasting, i love it</li>
            <li>A friend got this perfume as a gift for a &#x27;secret santa&#x27;, and I smelled it- and immediately loved it.</li>
            <li>Very mature, lovely scent and long lasting!</li>
            <li>It is my new fav.  </li>
            <li>ladies, you know how it is when you receive something new...</li>
            <li>This exactly what I ordered...big-ups to Fragrance Net....</li>
            <li>The fragrance smells quite a bit different than it did in the magazine, and this was off-putting at first.  </li>
            <li>I can actually imagine Rihanna smelling like this because it&#x27;s sweet yet spicy at the same time if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>however I am constantly &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; it in the morning because it is much better than any of my other perfumes!</li>
            <li>Nice if it is what you like, however very heavy smelling scent for my taste and compared to tester in store which is why I gave it only two stars.</li>
            <li>I have become addicted to it, and have gotten SO many compliments on it since I began wearing it!</li>
            <li>Just to be able to use it to the last drop, my hubby now holds the bottle for me tightly in two hands and I reach over and spray myself.</li>
            <li>Just to be able to use it to the last drop, my hubby now holds the bottle for me tightly in two hands and I reach over and spray myself.</li>
            <li>I normally like very sweet perfumes and this satisfies that but has a little extra sophistication to it.</li>
            <li>But it wasn&#x27;t it is soft  </li>
            <li>No complaints thus far.</li>
            <li>I like soft smells .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft but has a presence.</li>
            <li>than two weeks ago I went to Walgreens and they had all of their Christmas stuff marked off.</li>
            <li>As it wears, it loses some of its darker notes and gets more of a floral/spicy scent.  </li>
            <li>I think they all stink and/or smell the same or very similiar</li>
            <li>My sister loved it and thought it smelled just like buying it in the expensive department stores.</li>
            <li>The half filled bottle in the picture is the same half filled bottle I got in the mail today, is that just how it is???</li>
            <li>I lasts all day and is unique so that you don&#x27;t smell like every other female.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, but I&#x27;m not sure if it last too long.  </li>
            <li>was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>The item arriced well before I expected it and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>when it arrived since I have a hard time wearing perfume, it evaporates on me very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I got it for my sister who is a major Riri fan.</li>
            <li>The others are expensive name brands, however, this perfume is the one perfume I get the most compliments on!</li>
            <li>It was shipped within a decent amount of time, I didn&#x27;t have to wait long.</li>
            <li>but I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>Once I spritz my whole body with other scents, the scent stays all day.  </li>
            <li>It smells pretty but was a little to musky for me</li>
            <li>Half the price of department stores and the same exact, quality perfume.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t totally disappear, but it does considerably lighten depending on how long you wear it throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It actually smells like it has a strong patchouli base when first applied, which wasn&#x27;t really what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Also, I just got back from a trip in the Caribbean, where things such as alcohol and perfumes are usually cheaper and tax free, and when I saw this product in the stores it was still much more expensive than what I payed on Amazon!  </li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s my favorite perfume to wear.</li>
            <li> It came in three days. :-)</li>
            <li> I love this scent.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle&#x27;s design.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle&#x27;s design.</li>
            <li> When I rec&#x27;d it I loved it right away</li>
            <li> I was kind of scared that it would be strong, because I get dizzy with strong smells.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very unique as well.</li>
            <li> love SWEET perfumes, not the acid ones, and this is the perfect perfume to me, doesnt smell like old lady and it reminds me of flowers.</li>
            <li> It has a unique smell, which I like and it has a bit of patchouli and maybe sandalwood in it, which stays quite nicely on me.</li>
            <li> :) If you love the sample, this is very true to what&#x27;s in stores.</li>
            <li> I love the clean feel!</li>
            <li> I love trying new perfumes and thought this sounded like a great scent...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like Rihanna as an artist but her perfume is amazing!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, but I would caution you to try this out from a tester at the store to make sure you like it before purchasing--don&#x27;t rely on the magazine sample like I did!</li>
            <li> the purfume is beautiful; soft florals with hints of powdery tones.</li>
            <li> This is what my daughter wanted for Christmas, The price was cheaper than in the stores, and the perfume is a very lovely soft fragrance , I am very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and received very quickly!!</li>
            <li> I wish they sold those sizes of perfumes more in stores, so you do not have to commit to a huge 3.4 ounce or</li>
            <li> It could&#x27;ve been filled all the to the top imo.</li>
            <li> Even better that it is available online.</li>
            <li> I smelled this one in a magazine flyer from Macy&#x27;s and Liked it right away.</li>
            <li> Came in the mail shortly after I ordered it, and ohmygosh does it ever smell good!</li>
            <li> Service was very quick.</li>
            <li> not too strong which can make peoples sinuses act up.</li>
            <li> A bit too strong for a summer scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too strong, but lingers throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong but your presence will linger in a room once you&#x27;re gone.</li>
            <li> the smell is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too strong for my taste.  </li>
            <li> Seems too strong for a summer/spring feel.</li>
            <li> It was too strong for my liking</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet get sexy.</li>
            <li> Opening the box i could smell a light hint of the perfume its soft and amazing!</li>
            <li> The scent is gentle, warm with a vanilla-y fragrance, and not over powering or too strong.</li>
            <li> This is a very good perfume it stays on a little longer i love the scent.</li>
            <li> Goes on a little strong but once it has a minute to air out and blend with your skin, the scent is intoxicating!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle for a great price, 3 times bigger bottle</li>
            <li> but it fades into a fantastic smell.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, but it isn&#x27;t the real thing.</li>
            <li> The perfume is great, but spraying it on is always a handful - literally, because you have to grip it in your entire palm and spray with your thumb!  </li>
            <li> love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next time</li>
            <li> , i get great complements daily regarding my fragrance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this product and the price was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Always sexy &amp; intriguing.</li>
            <li> so I am comfortable wearing it at work.</li>
            <li> I also think anyone would be comfortable wearing this scent.</li>
            <li> I prefer light scents.</li>
            <li> I recommended this product to others because it was such a great deal compared to buying at a store</li>
            <li> The smell of this perfume is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The bottle is the only neat thing and it was packaged great..</li>
            <li> Smells so light and spceical.</li>
            <li> Very youthful!!!</li>
            <li> I lovvvvve how this smell &amp; the bottle itself is just sooo pretty!!</li>
            <li> She mentioned that the scent is gentle, warm with a sweet fragrance, and not over powering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li> I was happy I was able to get it for less</li>
            <li> I was excited</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get the Reb&#x27;L Fleur in the mail today, but when I took it out and used it it smelled like alcohol.  </li>
            <li> It has a unique scent that lasts for hours and you can use about three sprays and smell it all day.</li>
            <li> I tried this perfume originally as a sample.</li>
            <li> I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light</li>
            <li> I imagine that the starlets in the 1930&#x27;s and 1940&#x27;s with their perfectly curled hair, always red lipstick, glimmering tailored gowns and classy fur coats or mink stoles had the aromatic essence of Reb&#x27;L Fleur</li>
            <li> No one is more surprised with how much I love Rihanna&#x27;s perfume than myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh, bright, makes you feel young, radiant, special.</li>
            <li> Is original but smell so sweet and go faster</li>
            <li> I use this perfume for date nights and special occasions.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it as a gift for special occasions...</li>
            <li> Overpowering sweet.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> It is on the sweet side</li>
            <li> and i will be buying more real soon.</li>
            <li> I received the smaller version as a gift for my birrhday in September of 2013 and loved it.</li>
            <li> Smells sweet, but not over powering.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of it and after wearing the sample decided to buy a full bottle.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for selling this perfume for such a good price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it it was not to sweet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering or too sweet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet without being overpoweringly sweet.</li>
            <li> The bottle is true to size.</li>
            <li> And the smell.... so sweet with hints tropical fruit and  musk.</li>
            <li> Almost as good as the Rihanna perfume that comes in the red bottle {Forgetting the name}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the fragrance reflects a true tropical Caribbean flavour.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really recommend it, it is a very rich fragrance for those who like sweet but not cloying fragrance.</li>
            <li> Strong and pretty smell.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone :) its a sweet scent yet not an over the top sweet smell</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sweet and subtle and delicious!</li>
            <li> I found myself reapplying this spray almost every 3-4 hours: it faded so quickly.</li>
            <li> Got it quickly before holidays.</li>
            <li> Came quickly in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay top dollar for a scent that lasts all day than pay this high price for a scent that isn&#x27;t any longer-lasting than a room freshening spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Love the bottle, which is a high heel.</li>
            <li> but at the same time it is also very sexy and seductive too (fits who Rhianna is</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a refreshing new scent, go with this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my favorite new scent in years.</li>
            <li> My new favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Have been looking forever for a new perfume and finally found a great one.</li>
            <li> Sexy, simple and not too strong.  </li>
            <li> smells fresh.</li>
            <li> and I liked it instantly.  </li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t seem worth all this work.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t seem worth all this work.</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume, by far.</li>
            <li> I own over 15 different perfumes and this fragrance is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Smell is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> It surprised me, because I didn&#x27;t want to like it, but it had something that Rebelle did not have, and I&#x27;m actually glad I go it at that size.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I used my friend&#x27;s perfume and loved it enough to buy it for myself... but somehow now don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li> This perfume by far is my favorite signature scent.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> It is more on the soft powdery side.</li>
            <li> worth the money spent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and exception packing!</li>
            <li> they shipped SUPER fast!</li>
            <li> love the smell love love love it and so far it last pretty long.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> Rihanna has done it right with his Fragrences</li>
            <li> the bottle came in perfect condition, absolutely no problems with it taking long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a fan of celebrity fragrances, but I absolutely fell in love with this one.</li>
            <li> It smells warm, rich, and slightly musky.</li>
            <li> It wears off super fast</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very feminine but bold</li>
            <li> I went and bought a second bottle right just to make sure I had plenty on hand.</li>
            <li> love this second time buying clean and light but last</li>
            <li> Love the smell, will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered it from Afghanistan, so it was pretty dissapointing to call her and find out she opened an unmarked box to a gift that wasn&#x27;t wrapped....</li>
            <li> First time I have ever done that.  </li>
            <li> last most of the day.</li>
            <li> I honestly really like this scent!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely divine!</li>
            <li> Oh well, overall, it smells lovely</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this scent and this was actually my 3rd bottle purchased.</li>
            <li> Most perfumes wear off, this one goes and goes and goes until I actually want to wash it off.</li>
            <li> If you love this, it will last forever.</li>
            <li> Really good everyday scent.</li>
            <li> When my daughter first brought it I was like this smell so good not strong</li>
            <li> In complete and original packaging.</li>
            <li> Smells warm and spicy, not heavy or cloying, and it&#x27;s definitely different.</li>
            <li> and it did not take long to be delivered to my home :-)))</li>
            <li> While there I was able to smell a few others (some I liked, some I definitely didn&#x27;t), and Rebelle was one of them.</li>
            <li> It is also a much better price than most other websites, for the big version.  </li>
            <li> The initial scent is strong when I put it on</li>
            <li> its not too overpowering but still strong enough to be noticed.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell initially but once it&#x27;s on it</li>
            <li> this has got to be absolutely one of my fave scents.</li>
            <li> Scent still intense even after being washed  off  with soap and water.</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty vanilla-y and musky, and lasts all day (though, as is normal, becomes lighter as time goes by).</li>
            <li> Waiting until the following morning when I had not applied any perfume yet for the day, I snapped open the top of this sample and dabbed 2 tiny dots on each my wrists to see if I would like it, but most of all, to determine if the scent would cause my husband&#x27;s allergies to kick in.</li>
            <li> It is the real thing...</li>
            <li> I was really unsure about it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> It reminds me a bit of Todd Oldham&#x27;s scent from the late 90&#x27;s, but far more versatile, and I&#x27;d say it can be worn day or night and would be appropriate for either.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> thanks 😊</li>
            <li> It smells so sexy and classy at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I purchased for my teen daughter and finally decided I needed to stop sneaking in her room to use hers and buy my own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did arrive a day late, but it was shipped in a good sturdy package.</li>
            <li> It seems a bit more mature than the other floral/girly celebrity fragrances that are on the market right now.</li>
            <li> Not sure, but just know we both liked it so much and a teeny bit lasted</li>
            <li> This is one of the few fragrances that have fallen in love from the first time I met her.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING and last long!</li>
            <li> What an enormous bottle of perfume, and super fast shipping, too.</li>
            <li> A sweet and lasting smell.</li>
            <li> Too many other new scents out there to try rather than go through this each time.</li>
            <li> Too many other new scents out there to try rather than go through this each time.ollar for a scent that lasts all day than pay this high price for a scent that isn&#x27;t any longer-lasting than a room freshening spray.    </li>
            <li> I was so surprised when I got it that it was such a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> and I still have got more than half the bottle.</li>
            <li> but once it is gone, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll stick with my &#x27;usual&#x27; scent.</li>
            <li> During the Christmas rush I went to Macy&#x27;s to buy one of my sisters&#x27; a particular perfume.</li>
            <li> sprayed on wrist and it&#x27;s so strong and bitter</li>
            <li> I bought this blindly per all the great ratings..</li>
            <li> Normally, I just buy what I have purchased before off Amazon.  </li>
            <li> it only takes a small a mount and it lasts all day which is good for those that like it</li>
            <li> this fragrance has a signature scent and its long lasting, i love it</li>
            <li> A friend got this perfume as a gift for a &#x27;secret santa&#x27;, and I smelled it- and immediately loved it.</li>
            <li> Very mature, lovely scent and long lasting!</li>
            <li> It is my new fav.  </li>
            <li> ladies, you know how it is when you receive something new...</li>
            <li> This exactly what I ordered...big-ups to Fragrance Net....</li>
            <li> The fragrance smells quite a bit different than it did in the magazine, and this was off-putting at first.  </li>
            <li> I can actually imagine Rihanna smelling like this because it&#x27;s sweet yet spicy at the same time if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> however I am constantly &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; it in the morning because it is much better than any of my other perfumes!</li>
            <li> Nice if it is what you like, however very heavy smelling scent for my taste and compared to tester in store which is why I gave it only two stars.</li>
            <li> I have become addicted to it, and have gotten SO many compliments on it since I began wearing it!</li>
            <li> Just to be able to use it to the last drop, my hubby now holds the bottle for me tightly in two hands and I reach over and spray myself.</li>
            <li> Just to be able to use it to the last drop, my hubby now holds the bottle for me tightly in two hands and I reach over and spray myself.</li>
            <li> I normally like very sweet perfumes and this satisfies that but has a little extra sophistication to it.</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t it is soft  </li>
            <li> No complaints thus far.</li>
            <li> I like soft smells .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but has a presence.</li>
            <li> than two weeks ago I went to Walgreens and they had all of their Christmas stuff marked off.</li>
            <li> As it wears, it loses some of its darker notes and gets more of a floral/spicy scent.  </li>
            <li> I think they all stink and/or smell the same or very similiar</li>
            <li> My sister loved it and thought it smelled just like buying it in the expensive department stores.</li>
            <li> The half filled bottle in the picture is the same half filled bottle I got in the mail today, is that just how it is???</li>
            <li> I lasts all day and is unique so that you don&#x27;t smell like every other female.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, but I&#x27;m not sure if it last too long.  </li>
            <li> was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The item arriced well before I expected it and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> when it arrived since I have a hard time wearing perfume, it evaporates on me very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I got it for my sister who is a major Riri fan.</li>
            <li> The others are expensive name brands, however, this perfume is the one perfume I get the most compliments on!</li>
            <li> It was shipped within a decent amount of time, I didn&#x27;t have to wait long.</li>
            <li> but I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> Once I spritz my whole body with other scents, the scent stays all day.  </li>
            <li> It smells pretty but was a little to musky for me</li>
            <li> Half the price of department stores and the same exact, quality perfume.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t totally disappear, but it does considerably lighten depending on how long you wear it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It actually smells like it has a strong patchouli base when first applied, which wasn&#x27;t really what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Also, I just got back from a trip in the Caribbean, where things such as alcohol and perfumes are usually cheaper and tax free, and when I saw this product in the stores it was still much more expensive than what I payed on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> I hate perfumes I normally stick to Bath and Body Works or Victoria Secret sprays because their not over powering or makes me nauseous, but Reb&#x27;l is really nice, clean, and has a floral scent...</li>
            <li> smell not lasting long</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that it may not last as long as some people may desire or want.</li>
            <li> and I read reviews that this was some really long lasting perfume</li>
            <li> When I saw the size of the spray bottle I thought to myself \\&quot;Self, this is going to last a very long time\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and I usually buy high end perfumes.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I walk around smelling my arm all day long.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day long</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t stay on you as long as it would if you purchased it from the mall or retail store..</li>
            <li> I had smelled this fragrance in a magazine earlier this year, and as the price kept coming down I finally had to buy it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if perhaps the tiny samples are a stronger formula to get us hooked, but the sample and the spray bottle certainly do not equate to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That alone amazed me that such a small amount would last so long especially when my hands are in water all day long with the family, handwashing dishes and 5 dogs</li>
            <li> my only issue is the amount in the bottle other than that loveeeee</li>
            <li> Not only that, but those few dabs on my wrists lasted all day, throughout the night and into the following morning although by morning the scent was lighter.</li>
            <li> The only issue I noticed, is that, I&#x27;ve had it only a few days and spritzing it on here</li>
            <li> Every single place I go to</li>
            <li> It is hard to hold and even harder to hold one handed and spray as when it was new.</li>
            <li> It is hard to hold and even harder to hold one handed and spray as when it was new.</li>
            <li> so long I bought the spray the other day.</li>
            <li> my daughter found something that makes my day more relax when I am having a bad day</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected . . .</li>
            <li> This fragrance lasts forever and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I knew that she had two other fragrances</li>
            <li> Not sure who designed the bottle, but have actually lost quite a</li>
            <li> and then it is pretty difficult to get it where you want it.</li>
            <li> and then it is pretty difficult to get it where you want it.</li>
            <li> Was everything I expected!</li>
            <li> You only need a small amt</li>
            <li> Of course I have plenty other options, but</li>
            <li> and I must say, other men always ask what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little off and even so it only lasts a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> so I have to pick my perfumes very carefully.</li>
            <li> Anyway, while I had a scent I had sprayed on my wrist (which I am going to eventually buy, but Gucci can be expensive), I had sprayed Rebelle on one of those hard papers they give you, and I was totally undecided on whether I would be interested in buying it or not.</li>
            <li> but what the heck its not a full bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t mess up a perfume, but I did pay to have it gift wrapped for my wifes birthday.</li>
            <li> Hubby kept hovering close by and mentioned a few times he could no longer smell the scent either even when leaning close and purposely inhaling.</li>
            <li> It has been a few months</li>
            <li> It has been a few months</li>
            <li> I get quite a few compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I have a few perfumes I wear this being one of them.</li>
            <li> They had some perfumes half off, and Reb&#x27;L Fleur (a 0.25 ounce or 0.5 ounce, though probably 0.25 ounce) was on sale for $5!</li>
            <li> And I paid less for this than I did for the one in May!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I expected a much fresher scent.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of all these random celebrities coming out with perfumes that all start to smell the same.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product after receiving a small sample in a advertisement from a department store credit card statement.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this scent after smelling it on a lady that walked past me, had to ask what she was wearing</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t pass that offer, especially since it was random finding it</li>
            <li> I personally think is too expensive for the smell.</li>
            <li> I even took a small one with me on my two month backpacking trip to Italy.</li>
            <li> Not pretty scent and not attractive..</li>
            <li> But this particular bottle has gone bad.  </li>
            <li> The scent is too dull.</li>
            <li> I mean come on its Rihanna</li>
            <li> not just a 3.4 it also came with lotion body wash and a small spray!</li>
            <li> Well at least I cant say its false advertisement.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long and smells very expensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very subtle and feminine.</li>
            <li> I receive random compliments on it when I am out and about.</li>
            <li> I bought this just based upon the reviews and was a bit skeptical to do so</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Ordered the wrong scent..</li>
            <li> even though its the wrong one scent, my mistake.</li>
            <li> SORRY NO WHERE I GET MY PERFUME ...</li>
            <li> Sorry to say it.</li>
            <li> Although  I have a Paris Hilton that I was crazy for.</li>
            <li> It will drive you crazy.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells like a very expensive perfume.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Gotta say I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because I can&#x27;t even return it (flammable material).  </li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s been about 45 minutes, the alcohol smell is going away, but in order to even get a whiff of the perfume I have to stick my nose on my arm.  :(</li>
            <li> No it&#x27;s not :(</li>
            <li> I got a headache! :(</li>
            <li> I hate overpowering smells....</li>
            <li> Just hate</li>
            <li> I have very bad allergies</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> perfume perfecto muy bueno</li>
            <li> Reb&#x27;L Fleur by Rihanna 3.4 oz. was exactly what I expected.  Would definitely recommend and order it again.  The price was great</li>
            <li> Strong and pretty smell. I receive random compliments on it when I am out and about.</li>
            <li> smells fresh. not too strong which can make peoples sinuses act up. nice price for this perfume. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It smells so good. Will definitely be buying again. I gave it 4 stars because despite the package being sealed it looked like it had been used. It could&#x27;ve been filled all the to the top imo.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle for mother&#x27;s day and I love it.  Smells amazing, but I&#x27;m not sure if it last too long.  I find myself spraying a second time during the day.  I went and bought a second bottle right just to make sure I had plenty on hand.</li>
            <li> I had purchased another Rihanna perfume back around Christmas time.  I knew that she had two other fragrances and I chose to get this one.  I received it and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I love the smell.  I lasts all day and is unique so that you don&#x27;t smell like every other female.</li>
            <li> Order it for my grandmother and she loves it she had been begging me for months has the original smell and sent great buy.</li>
            <li> I honestly loved the smell. I was kind of scared that it would be strong, because I get dizzy with strong smells. But it wasn&#x27;t it is soft  personally I loved it :) satisfied</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after receiving a small sample in a advertisement from a department store credit card statement.  I was excited when it arrived since I have a hard time wearing perfume, it evaporates on me very quickly.  I have loved it.  It has a unique smell, which I like and it has a bit of patchouli and maybe sandalwood in it, which stays quite nicely on me.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected . . . before Christmas, nice job! Love this cologne.</li>
            <li> One my favorite perfume every people will just walk up smell me</li>
            <li> This scent is great. One of my favorites. A sweet and lasting smell. Best worn during spring and winter. A bit too strong for a summer scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came undamaged and on time. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I bought this just based upon the reviews and was a bit skeptical to do so but I have no regrets. The initial scent is strong when I put it on but it fades into a fantastic smell.</li>
            <li> Very good high quality</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, but it isn&#x27;t the real thing. It wears off super fast and I have to keep spaying it throughout the day. The one I bought from Macy&#x27;s would stay on me all day.</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME SMELLS REALLY GREAT I LOVE IT WHEN MY BOTTLE STARTS GETTING LOW I PURCHASE ANOTHER BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO BE WITHOUT. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> This perfume spells great! I love it!!! My Co-workers always ask me where do u buy ur perfumes and I as well recommended it to one of my friend. She is so in love with it!</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge!!! I knowy daughter will love it.</li>
            <li> smell not lasting long</li>
            <li> this has got to be absolutely one of my fave scents. its not too overpowering but still strong enough to be noticed. i love it and i&#x27;m on my second bottle</li>
            <li> Beautiful fragrance! I bought this for my daughter. It is her signature fragrance and it smells wonderful on her. Everyone always asks her what she is wearing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this scent after smelling it on a lady that walked past me, had to ask what she was wearing and I liked it instantly.  Bought the entire gift set with the lotion and bath gel.  The perfume is great, but spraying it on is always a handful - literally, because you have to grip it in your entire palm and spray with your thumb!  Not sure who designed the bottle, but have actually lost quite a but of the scent with overspray since I&#x27;m not that great at aiming with my thumb!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this... Everyone around me seems to love it on me.. I have been getting nothing but compliments on this. The shipping was very quick!</li>
            <li> I tested this in a local department store before ordering online. I loved the smell. It lasts all day, but it isn&#x27;t so over-powering that it&#x27;s ALL you smell.  I&#x27;m not usually a fan of celebrity fragrances, but I absolutely fell in love with this one. It seems a bit more mature than the other floral/girly celebrity fragrances that are on the market right now. It&#x27;s sultry, sexy, and flirty. The perfect scent for any occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, of course, the best pricing was found on Amazon. :o)</li>
            <li> lovely scent, I dont mind the bottle but what the heck its not a full bottle of perfume. Well at least I cant say its false advertisement. The half filled bottle in the picture is the same half filled bottle I got in the mail today, is that just how it is??? or what!</li>
            <li> Overpowering sweet.  Scent still intense even after being washed  off  with soap and water. My friends found it offensive and  didn&#x27;t want to be  around  me.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, Rhianna did good with launching this one, it is a very ELEGANT smelling fragrance but at the same time it is also very sexy and seductive too (fits who Rhianna is, it&#x27;s an urban smell to me I love it)....not to mention I was going to purchase the 3.4 perfume at Perfumania but when I started looking online I found that Amazon had the best pricing! I&#x27;m thinking about getting my bestfriend and my sister a bottle for Christmas through Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good and was what I ordered. It made for a great gift and it was on time.</li>
            <li> Smells warm and spicy, not heavy or cloying, and it&#x27;s definitely different. I love it, and others do too. It isn&#x27;t too strong, but lingers throughout the day. What an enormous bottle of perfume, and super fast shipping, too.</li>
            <li> I love love love It!!!  I bought it for my mother however I am constantly &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; it in the morning because it is much better than any of my other perfumes!</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty vanilla-y and musky, and lasts all day (though, as is normal, becomes lighter as time goes by). No complaints thus far.</li>
            <li> Love it! I get TONS of compliments!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t mess up a perfume, but I did pay to have it gift wrapped for my wifes birthday. I ordered it from Afghanistan, so it was pretty dissapointing to call her and find out she opened an unmarked box to a gift that wasn&#x27;t wrapped....</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.  THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS WHAT YOU BUY IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE.  The scent is a little off and even so it only lasts a few minutes.  I will return this.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this perfume when making a purchase at a local dept store. The sample was a dime-sized plastic disc encased in a slightly larger cardboard placard. Waiting until the following morning when I had not applied any perfume yet for the day, I snapped open the top of this sample and dabbed 2 tiny dots on each my wrists to see if I would like it, but most of all, to determine if the scent would cause my husband&#x27;s allergies to kick in. We were both amazed at how wonderfully feminine and light this scent is, without being overpowering or triggering his allergies. Not only that, but those few dabs on my wrists lasted all day, throughout the night and into the following morning although by morning the scent was lighter. That alone amazed me that such a small amount would last so long especially when my hands are in water all day long with the family, handwashing dishes and 5 dogs - I&#x27;m always washing my hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is named Rebel Flower, but neither of us thought it smelled overly flowery. I can identify a hint of vanilla (maybe) and some musk and maybe sandlewood. Not sure, but just know we both liked it so much and a teeny bit lasted so long I bought the spray the other day. Couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gotta say I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. When I saw the size of the spray bottle I thought to myself \\&quot;Self, this is going to last a very long time\\&quot; but I doubt that now. I found myself reapplying this spray almost every 3-4 hours: it faded so quickly. Hubby kept hovering close by and mentioned a few times he could no longer smell the scent either even when leaning close and purposely inhaling. And as soon as I washed my hands/wrists after an application, the scent was gone. I don&#x27;t know if perhaps the tiny samples are a stronger formula to get us hooked, but the sample and the spray bottle certainly do not equate to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using it but once it is gone, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll stick with my &#x27;usual&#x27; scent. I&#x27;d rather pay top dollar for a scent that lasts all day than pay this high price for a scent that isn&#x27;t any longer-lasting than a room freshening spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Aug 2011 It has been a few months and I&#x27;m getting to the bottom of the spray bottle. I have to say I love the bottle design; reminds me a genie bottle. However, once the perfume is about 3/4 gone, spraying or spritzing this becomes a bit of a challenge. The top of the spray bottle is slender and sleek while the bottom acts like a paper weight. It is hard to hold and even harder to hold one handed and spray as when it was new. I find myself holding it with two hands to apply it and then it is pretty difficult to get it where you want it. If I set it on the counter and try spraying with one hand, the bottle walks along the counter, my finger slips off the spray nozzle, and the bottle tips over. Just to be able to use it to the last drop, my hubby now holds the bottle for me tightly in two hands and I reach over and spray myself. Just doesn&#x27;t seem worth all this work. I won&#x27;t buy this again. Too many other new scents out there to try rather than go through this each time.ollar for a scent that lasts all day than pay this high price for a scent that isn&#x27;t any longer-lasting than a room freshening spray.

If I set it on the counter and try spraying with one hand, the bottle walks along the counter, my finger slips off the spray nozzle, and the bottle tips over. Just to be able to use it to the last drop, my hubby now holds the bottle for me tightly in two hands and I reach over and spray myself. Just doesn&#x27;t seem worth all this work. I won&#x27;t buy this again. Too many other new scents out there to try rather than go through this each time.</li>
            <li> Wife is happy with the product, ty.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife as an evening perfume and as a surprise.  She loves it for both reasons :-)</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I loveeeee Rihanna! Proud Navy! And this fragrance is just to die for! I love it so much it&#x27;s sweet and subtle and delicious!</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Wonderful fragrance... and excellent savings!  Made a wonderful Christmas present for my sister!  Super fast shipping and exception packing!</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of many perfumes! I wear the same couple of scents all my life..I hate overpowering smells....I smelled this one in a magazine flyer from Macy&#x27;s and Liked it right away. I went on Macys.com and they didnt&#x27; have any in stock yet....Thank God! Because I then checked Amazon and the price was great compared to Macy&#x27;s....When I rec&#x27;d it I loved it right away and when My Daughter heard that I bought it she wanted one too.......she didn&#x27;t even smell it but Loves Rihanna........She loves it too now.</li>
            <li> It was beyond my expectations! I didn&#x27;t know the bottle was as large and giving it as a gift made everything perfect. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I went to two different stores at the mall to purchase this item and they were significantly more expensive at both stores than they were on Amazon. I searched the item on Amazon from my phone while at the mall. Once I found that it was cheaper on Amazon I immediately came home and purchesed it on line. The item arriced well before I expected it and was exactly what I wanted. If you&#x27;re looking for a refreshing new scent, go with this one. It&#x27;s not too strong but your presence will linger in a room once you&#x27;re gone. It&#x27;s been my favorite new scent in years. A really good buy for the price and the size.</li>
            <li> I had heard from a friend that this perfume smelled nice so I bought it on a whim to see for myself.  I am not a huge fan of all these random celebrities coming out with perfumes that all start to smell the same.  This one is a total exception!  It smells so sexy and classy at the same time.  It lasts all day long and smells very expensive.  I am in love with it.  The bottle is very unique as well.</li>
            <li> This fragrance lasts forever and a little goes a long way. It is on the sweet side but I think it is elegant. It has some deeper more complicated notes to it, just like Rihanna. I imagine that the starlets in the 1930&#x27;s and 1940&#x27;s with their perfectly curled hair, always red lipstick, glimmering tailored gowns and classy fur coats or mink stoles had the aromatic essence of Reb&#x27;L Fleur</li>
            <li> Great!!! like it  a lot!</li>
            <li> I love it, I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Was leaking when I got it and smell different</li>
            <li> It is the real thing... I always loved the smell.</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume, by far. Not expensive but smells wonderful.  I wear it daily.</li>
            <li> I own over 15 different perfumes and this fragrance is by far my favorite. I love that I can smell it throughout my day and even though the smell fades, it has a sexy fragrance even as the day goes on. This perfume will always be apart of my collection regardless how many times I have to replace it.</li>
            <li> Good price and size i love it and i will be buying more real soon. When i recieved the perfume it was the rite size as listed</li>
            <li> I hate perfumes I normally stick to Bath and Body Works or Victoria Secret sprays because their not over powering or makes me nauseous, but Reb&#x27;l is really nice, clean, and has a floral scent... Very youthful!!! My husband likes it as well!!</li>
            <li> I lovvvvve how this smell &amp; the bottle itself is just sooo pretty!! &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> This is a very good perfume it stays on a little longer i love the scent. Although  I have a Paris Hilton that I was crazy for. Now i love the Rihanna perfume.</li>
            <li> What more can one say, it&#x27;s Rihanna &amp; just like her...the purfume is beautiful; soft florals with hints of powdery tones. The scent combines nicely with my lady&#x27;s pheromones.</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love SWEET perfumes, not the acid ones, and this is the perfect perfume to me, doesnt smell like old lady and it reminds me of flowers. The size is perfect, I have had it over a year and I still have got more than half the bottle. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> received in perfect condition</li>
            <li> I freaking love the smell of this perfume.  It is nothing like I thought it would be.  It is my new fav.  I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting but definitely not what I got.  I am so happy I purchased it, and without even smelling it. First time I have ever done that.  Normally, I just buy what I have purchased before off Amazon.  Love this!</li>
            <li> love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next time</li>
            <li> No one is more surprised with how much I love Rihanna&#x27;s perfume than myself. I purchased for my teen daughter and finally decided I needed to stop sneaking in her room to use hers and buy my own. Great scent! Not overpowering. Great packaging and shipped on time! Love!</li>
            <li> I received the smaller version as a gift for my birrhday in September of 2013 and loved it. I wanted it for Christmas of 2013 because I loved it so much and got many smell good compliments.</li>
            <li> Smells sweet, but not over powering. It&#x27;s my new favorite fragrance! It was shipped within a decent amount of time, I didn&#x27;t have to wait long.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Not the fragrance I thought it would be, however does last throughout the day  Nice if it is what you like, however very heavy smelling scent for my taste and compared to tester in store which is why I gave it only two stars.</li>
            <li> Sexy, simple and not too strong.  I get compliments on it all the time. Good job Rhi Rhi :0 :)</li>
            <li> I love this I got it for me for Christmas :D</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is authentic :)</li>
            <li> All I will say is I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s awesome. I really love the product. Amazon is the best. I will use your serve even more.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!! I always get complements especially from men I was happy I was able to get it for less and it did not take long to be delivered to my home :-)))</li>
            <li> When my daughter first brought it I was like this smell so good not strong just right she said leave my stuff alone so I brought my own so many people men and women said that smell so good I work in a supermarket they said I got to get it for my women to put on it put you in the mood and the women said it just make you think of what are you going to do all day I have to be good my daughter found something that makes my day more relax when I am having a bad day</li>
            <li> Lovely scent! I love the clean feel!</li>
            <li> I purchased Reb&#x27;L Fleur by Rihanna, 3.4 Ounce, Eau De Parfum Spray as a gift for my girlfriend...she loves it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Love the bottle, which is a high heel. Sister in law purchased her set from Macys and paid almost triple of what I paid.. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Smell is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  Once I spritz my whole body with other scents, the scent stays all day.  Wish this one did.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> Was everything I expected! Half the price of department stores and the same exact, quality perfume. I love it! Very mature, lovely scent and long lasting!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great experience</li>
            <li> My go-to fragrance. Smells great, lots of compliments, reasonably priced</li>
            <li> love the smell love love love it and so far it last pretty long. my only issue is the amount in the bottle other than that loveeeee it love rihanna</li>
            <li> This is what my daughter wanted for Christmas, The price was cheaper than in the stores, and the perfume is a very lovely soft fragrance , I am very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love. Get compliments all the time when I wear this.</li>
            <li> Horrible! the smell is too strong for me. it just didn&#x27;t work well for me. it only takes a small a mount and it lasts all day which is good for those that like it but I COULD NOT stand the smell. I like soft smells .</li>
            <li> Perfect musky, yet feminine scent for a night out. This bottle has lasted me 2 years and counting. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell initially but once it&#x27;s on it last most of the day. I recommend spraying it up and letting it fall on you. You only need a small amt</li>
            <li> this fragrance has a signature scent and its long lasting, i love it, i get great complements daily regarding my fragrance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this product and the price was well worth it.</li>
            <li> This exactly what I ordered...big-ups to Fragrance Net....thank ya&#x27;ll.!!!!!!!!!!!! I will definitely continue to shop with you guys.! Thnks once again.!</li>
            <li> Its a gift.  But they will love it</li>
            <li> This perfume smells like a very expensive perfume. I had a sample of it and after wearing the sample decided to buy a full bottle. Thank you Amazon for selling this perfume for such a good price. It&#x27;s soft but has a presence. I have very bad allergies so I have to pick my perfumes very carefully. I have no problem with this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. I got it for my sister who is a major Riri fan. My fragrance is Givenchy Organza</li>
            <li> I mean come on its Rihanna you cant lose. Always sexy &amp; intriguing. Yummy scent</li>
            <li> WONDERFULL NEED TO TELL MY FRIENDS</li>
            <li> Great scent. I use it for work and always get compliments.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> During the Christmas rush I went to Macy&#x27;s to buy one of my sisters&#x27; a particular perfume. While there I was able to smell a few others (some I liked, some I definitely didn&#x27;t), and Rebelle was one of them. I knew I wasn&#x27;t going to buy it there for I wasn&#x27;t at the store to buy myself something, and I am one who does compare shopping. Anyway, while I had a scent I had sprayed on my wrist (which I am going to eventually buy, but Gucci can be expensive), I had sprayed Rebelle on one of those hard papers they give you, and I was totally undecided on whether I would be interested in buying it or not. I liked it, but I didn&#x27;t. I was really unsure about it. However, I did not see Reb&#x27;L there to try, which could have been for a factor of reasons since there were tons of people there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less than two weeks ago I went to Walgreens and they had all of their Christmas stuff marked off. They had some perfumes half off, and Reb&#x27;L Fleur (a 0.25 ounce or 0.5 ounce, though probably 0.25 ounce) was on sale for $5! I couldn&#x27;t pass that offer, especially since it was random finding it there anyway, for I don&#x27;t recall finding perfumes like that on the regular. I honestly really like this scent! It surprised me, because I didn&#x27;t want to like it, but it had something that Rebelle did not have, and I&#x27;m actually glad I go it at that size. I wish they sold those sizes of perfumes more in stores, so you do not have to commit to a huge 3.4 ounce or whatever else in case you do not like it. To me it is a sophisticated Oriental scent, which isn&#x27;t overpowering at all so I am comfortable wearing it at work. I also think anyone would be comfortable wearing this scent. I&#x27;m 22 and I would wear it at 32 or 42. It&#x27;s not a bad scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it may not last as long as some people may desire or want. It doesn&#x27;t totally disappear, but it does considerably lighten depending on how long you wear it throughout the day. However I just may be over thinking it, for there are times where I have still smelled it the next day in clothes or whatever, but that is different than body chemistry.imes where I have still smelled it the next day in clothes or whatever, but that is different than body chemistry.</li>
            <li> My daughter has this so I knew what it smelled like.  I always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Ordered the wrong scent..but this is still nice...I was very pleased with shipping..practicality showed up the next day..perfume came bigger then I thought..even though its the wrong one scent, my mistake. ..Im very pleased with the seller..I have a nice perfume for a good price to add to my collection :)</li>
            <li> I bought this blindly per all the great ratings..sooo glad I did!! It smells soooo good!!</li>
            <li> Great product, perfect delivery! For a good price ;)</li>
            <li> I had smelled this fragrance in a magazine earlier this year, and as the price kept coming down I finally had to buy it.  The fragrance smells quite a bit different than it did in the magazine, and this was off-putting at first.  It actually smells like it has a strong patchouli base when first applied, which wasn&#x27;t really what I was looking for.  Over time, though, I&#x27;m learning to like this perfume.  As it wears, it loses some of its darker notes and gets more of a floral/spicy scent.  It&#x27;s not overly floral, which makes it a nice fall fragrance.  Plus, the bottle is lovely and you get a ton of the perfume for the price.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase, but I would caution you to try this out from a tester at the store to make sure you like it before purchasing--don&#x27;t rely on the magazine sample like I did!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, packaged well, great price and made a good gift!  It is also a much better price than most other websites, for the big version.  I would definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift because somebody wanted it. I personally think is too expensive for the smell.</li>
            <li> I normally like very sweet perfumes and this satisfies that but has a little extra sophistication to it. I always get complimented when I wear it. I&#x27;ll definitely keep repurchasing it!</li>
            <li> Quality product ... Recommended</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and received very quickly!!</li>
            <li> SORRY NO WHERE I GET MY PERFUME ... AND I WILL BE WAITING ... WHAT HAPPENS??? HAPPENS?? NEED ANSWERS?SORRY NO WHERE I GET MY PERFUME</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, great price</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it it was not to sweet</li>
            <li> My sister loved it and thought it smelled just like buying it in the expensive department stores.</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume for your buck! The smell lasts all day long. You get a big bottle for a great price!</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING and last long! I always get compliments!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Absolutely love it!! Got it quickly before holidays. Have been looking forever for a new perfume and finally found a great one.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light perfume. I get quite a few compliments when I wear it. Even better that it is available online.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite fragrance. the hint of coconut and vanilla makes for an unforgettable fragrance. i always get compliments when wearing this scent.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say it. It has only the name. I bought last time to two of my friends. They like it. I order again to the same friend for her birthday gift. The next day she was telling me that it was not the same item. It is only using the name.</li>
            <li> Strong spicy scent that lasts! i also like the sleek bottle design! it&#x27;s very feminine but bold which is rebl de fleur!</li>
            <li> She loves this perfume and I was happy to get it for her at a much cheaper price than at the stores</li>
            <li> I will not buy another perfume. I want to Sheryl like this forever! I&#x27;m buying another bottle as a back up! My man loves it, my friends adore it and i am I&#x27;m love with Rihanna just for making a wonderful fragrance. BUY IT!</li>
            <li> love this!! I&#x27;d sampled it at Sam&#x27;s Club and absolutely loved it. Came in the mail shortly after I ordered it, and ohmygosh does it ever smell good! I walk around smelling my arm all day long. :) If you love the sample, this is very true to what&#x27;s in stores. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like Rihanna as an artist but her perfume is amazing! I definitely recommend this to anyone :) its a sweet scent yet not an over the top sweet smell</li>
            <li> The smell of this perfume is intoxicatingly wonderful. It truly lasts all day. When I came home from work at 5:30pm my husband asked me did I spray perfume on before I left work. I said no way, I sprayed it on at 6:30 am that morning and I read reviews that this was some really long lasting perfume and it is. It&#x27;s not overpowering or too sweet, it&#x27;s a sensual womens scent.</li>
            <li> the bottle came in perfect condition, absolutely no problems with it taking long. Opening the box i could smell a light hint of the perfume its soft and amazing!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I expected a much fresher scent. The scent is too dull. I anticipated it to be  fresher</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and the price was awesome :). I was so surprised when I got it that it was such a huge bottle. I plan on getting another one for my mom</li>
            <li> nice smell will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of celebrity fragrances. I think they all stink and/or smell the same or very similiar but this blew me away! I love how it smells. It&#x27;s not too strong. It&#x27;s very subtle and feminine.</li>
            <li> I am not one to go and buy Celebrity Fragrances, but after smelling the perfume on a friend one day, I stopped at a Kohls and sprayed myself. I walked around the store, trying on different things, then left forgetting about the perfume. Five hours later, I got a whiff of it while driving home. I immediately ordered it when i got home and since last year, I have gone through four bottles. I even took a small one with me on my two month backpacking trip to Italy. Of course, it didn&#x27;t make it back home! Everyone compliments me on it, including my husband who doesn&#x27;t like any perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to call it the &amp;#34;getting some&amp;#34; perfume!!! Because when I wear it, I get some! ;)</li>
            <li> My husband got this for me at my request but it&#x27;s too strong for my taste.  I prefer light scents.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of girlie, fruity scents. Ladies, meet the exception to the rule. It smells warm, rich, and slightly musky. It&#x27;s sweet without being overpoweringly sweet. I get compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> My wife mentioned that she liked a sample of this that she had smelled. I bought this online from Amazon for a great price. And, best of all, my wife and I like this fragence very much.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and it ships fast. I recommended this product to others because it was such a great deal compared to buying at a store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this scent. It&#x27;s sweet get sexy. Incredible condition and shipping.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Xmas gift, TWO YEARS AGO.... Yeah, I use it with caution!! This perfume is divine!! I get so many compliments!</li>
            <li> When received it was leaking</li>
            <li> My new favorite scent. Love love love it</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get the Reb&#x27;L Fleur in the mail today, but when I took it out and used it it smelled like alcohol.  I&#x27;m so disappointed because I can&#x27;t even return it (flammable material).  This was a birthday present from my mom...I had smelled it in the store and told her this is what I wanted.  But this particular bottle has gone bad.  Now that it&#x27;s been about 45 minutes, the alcohol smell is going away, but in order to even get a whiff of the perfume I have to stick my nose on my arm.  :(</li>
            <li> I use this perfume for date nights and special occasions.  My boyfriend absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best fragrance  i just got to have it</li>
            <li> Great Service and item</li>
            <li> Great scent. Women always ask me what Im wearing. This scent is a guy magnet. Buying more now!</li>
            <li> Smells great! The bottle is true to size. It came with the box. Service was very quick.</li>
            <li> Nice fruity, floral fragrance. Really good everyday scent. Worth the price. The fragrance lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.... I have always love this perfume...</li>
            <li> I used my friend&#x27;s perfume and loved it enough to buy it for myself... but somehow now don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume I always order it always love it</li>
            <li> Huge bottle for a great price, 3 times bigger bottle and I love it!</li>
            <li> I started using this perfume in May of 2013, and I just recently ran out. I ordered another bottle earlier this week, and it shipped today! The smell is perfect; it&#x27;s sensual, flirty, fruity-- everything you&#x27;d want in a perfume. When I got my package today, however, it came in a big shoe box-sized box with the Reb&#x27;L Fleur logo all over it. To my surprise, encased was the perfume, a smaller bottle of the perfume, which I assume is for when you&#x27;re out and about and need to refresh your scent, a body lotion, and a shower gel. And I paid less for this than I did for the one in May! 10/10, definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> this is a great size and price for this cologne. I always get compliments on it and gals ask what&#x27;s that I&#x27;m wearing that smells so good.</li>
            <li> I have no words to describe how amazing this perfume is. Every single place I go to, people ask me which perfume I have on. Not just me, but people around me simply love this wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> This perfume by far is my favorite signature scent. It stays on all day long and I get  tons of compliments every time I wear it. The price was also an added bonus.</li>
            <li> ITS A HUGE BOTTLE, NICE PACKAGE; I LOVE THE SMELL;IM GLAD I GAVE THIS COLOGNE A CHANCE; ID DO IT AGAIN</li>
            <li> I can never get enough of this scent... I just keep buying again and again</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> item arrived as a gift box and not just a 3.4 it also came with lotion body wash and a small spray!</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely divine! Came quickly in 2 days. In complete and original packaging. And the smell.... so sweet with hints tropical fruit and  musk. Goes on a little strong but once it has a minute to air out and blend with your skin, the scent is intoxicating!!!! I love Rhianna Nude. But I think I just feel in lust with this one! Worth every penny :) Take a chance!</li>
            <li> Rihanna has done it right with his Fragrences I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light and it&#x27;s last it makes you wanna have sex with yourself it smells so good.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I usually buy high end perfumes. It is more on the soft powdery side.</li>
            <li> Smelled this perfume at the mall. Didn&#x27;t want to make that kind of investment at the time. Found a great deal on Amazon and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Ok, I smelled this at Macy&#x27;s and knew I could beat their price on Amazon, and you know I did! The only issue I noticed, is that, I&#x27;ve had it only a few days and spritzing it on here and there, looks like 1/2 is gone already! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of the shape of the bottle, but 3.4 ounces should last a while. Of course I have plenty other options, but ladies, you know how it is when you receive something new...you want to flaunt it for a minute. Oh well, overall, it smells lovely but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase it again...on to the next one!</li>
            <li> The smell of this perfume is fantastic. Almost as good as the Rihanna perfume that comes in the red bottle {Forgetting the name}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did arrive a day late, but it was shipped in a good sturdy package. No chance for it breaking while it was in the process of getting to my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money spent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this scent and this was actually my 3rd bottle purchased. It is so girly and yet has a nice woodsy scent to it that I LOVE.</li>
            <li> I really love this scent and it lasts all day for me! I can actually imagine Rihanna smelling like this because it&#x27;s sweet yet spicy at the same time if that makes sense. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Omg Go Riri......smells so sexy. damn i love it. I plan to buy the nude next. Really nice fragrance :)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a year but I think this works well as a &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; scent. Seems too strong for a summer/spring feel.</li>
            <li> I like it, and I have to say the scent lasts for days. Most perfumes wear off, this one goes and goes and goes until I actually want to wash it off. No joke. If you love this, it will last forever. If it&#x27;s not for you - watch out. It will drive you crazy.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best smelling perfume I&#x27;ve ever gotten! It has a unique scent that lasts for hours and you can use about three sprays and smell it all day. The scent is gentle, warm with a vanilla-y fragrance, and not over powering or too strong. Plus it&#x27;s cheaper here than in any retail store :D Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend, she loves it.  Also, I just got back from a trip in the Caribbean, where things such as alcohol and perfumes are usually cheaper and tax free, and when I saw this product in the stores it was still much more expensive than what I payed on Amazon!  Extremely satisfied!</li>
            <li> I love trying new perfumes and thought this sounded like a great scent... No it&#x27;s not :( sprayed on wrist and it&#x27;s so strong and bitter I got a headache! :( washed off and it still lingered.. Not pretty scent and not attractive.. The bottle is the only neat thing and it was packaged great..</li>
            <li> Smells great Love this perfume</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume! Just hate I had to drive to the actual delivery place to pick it up because it required a signature and that was not communicated when purchasing.</li>
            <li> Deliciosa fragancia...</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t stay on you as long as it would if you purchased it from the mall or retail store..</li>
            <li> Is original but smell so sweet and go faster</li>
            <li> I tried this perfume originally as a sample. Hubby ordered it for me and I have to say, it&#x27;s my favorite perfume to wear.</li>
            <li> A friend got this perfume as a gift for a &#x27;secret santa&#x27;, and I smelled it- and immediately loved it. I eventually ordered it, based simply on my memory. I have become addicted to it, and have gotten SO many compliments on it since I began wearing it! This scent has a perfect balance what smells like sandalwood, with just a hint of floral and fruit. It reminds me a bit of Todd Oldham&#x27;s scent from the late 90&#x27;s, but far more versatile, and I&#x27;d say it can be worn day or night and would be appropriate for either.&lt;br /&gt;And as for the seller- they shipped SUPER fast! It came in three days. :-)</li>
            <li> I have a few perfumes I wear this being one of them. The others are expensive name brands, however, this perfume is the one perfume I get the most compliments on!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell and it stays with you all day!</li>
            <li> I receive compliments each and every time I wear this perfume.  My boyfriend selected it for me and I must say, other men always ask what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister. It was too strong for my liking but she liked it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a knock off perfume ....I would recommend it as a gift for special occasions... Smells so light and spceical.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Lasts all day. I love this scent.</li>
            <li> love this second time buying clean and light but last</li>
            <li> It smells pretty but was a little to musky for me</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It&#x27;s fresh, bright, makes you feel young, radiant, special. I really recommend it, it is a very rich fragrance for those who like sweet but not cloying fragrance. This is one of the few fragrances that have fallen in love from the first time I met her. It is very good for both day and night. I recommend it! The seller was very satisfied, met all my expectations!</li>
            <li> Very lovely scent. I love the bottle&#x27;s design. I think the fragrance reflects a true tropical Caribbean flavour. Will recommend it definitely.</li>
            <li> Muy buen producto y llego en perfecto estado. Muchas gracias. Suerte y que sigan vendiendo mucho mas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saludos desde Venezuela</li>
            <li> I bought Reb&#x27;L Fleur for my sister in law and she loved this perfume. She mentioned that the scent is gentle, warm with a sweet fragrance, and not over powering. Plus it&#x27;s cheaper here than in any retail store :D I love the bottle&#x27;s design. I am thinking of buying one for myself.</li>
            <li> Shipping time was great, great price for product. Very pleased</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing! thanks 😊</li>
            <li> I bought this after getting to smell the body mist version in Walmart. I love the smell! It has a really nice vanilla smell to it.</li>
