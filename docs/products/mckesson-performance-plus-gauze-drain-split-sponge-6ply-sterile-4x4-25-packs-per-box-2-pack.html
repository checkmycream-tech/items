    <ol>
            <li>It is non-adherent, rayon-polyester material ideal for wound care.  </li>
            <li>great for dialysis patients</li>
            <li>We are very satisfied with these drain sponges.  </li>
            <li>We are both very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Its an okay product but was taken by surprise by its split opening design.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re softer, more absorbent plus they didn&#x27;t shed or fray.</li>
            <li>Wish you could get the Hi-absorbancy version again, it&#x27;s a much better product.</li>
            <li>I use in association with my trach and need to use 2 sponges (1 packet) instead of the one sponge I was able to use with the Kendall brand.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth to wear and comfortable without showing through clothing.  </li>
            <li>I like these better than the cheap drug store one.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and take care of drainage as needed.</li>
            <li>These worked fine and were cheaper than some brands.</li>
            <li>The McKesson Gauze square for thicker than most, much softer than all the rest and because of this are more comfortable and reliable.</li>
            <li>Got package early..and product was exact!</li>
            <li>Another bonus is that they are cheaper than the drug store and they get shipped right to your door.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to use if you have a stomach tube.  </li>
            <li>This product is very helpful to my mon thank you</li>
            <li>this is an excellent product because of its design, this product allows the user to change dressing quickly and without disturbing wound area by having the splint down the middle ....</li>
            <li>The price is right and about half of what CVS has priced theirs and about twice as much of the quantity than CVS.</li>
            <li>The texture of the gauze is soft and organic.  </li>

            <li> but they are a very thin 6 ply.  </li>

            <li> Its an okay product but was taken by surprise by its split opening design.  It is non-adherent, rayon-polyester material ideal for wound care.  If it weren&#x27;t for the split design, it would have rivaled the CVS brand bandage with the same material.  Unfortunately, I did not see the same size bandage without the split.  Otherwise, I would have purchased this bandage to replace the CVS Brand gauze pad.  The price is right and about half of what CVS has priced theirs and about twice as much of the quantity than CVS.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use if you have a stomach tube.  The texture of the gauze is soft and organic.  Some other gauze I have used has a artificial, polyester feel. There are 2 in the pack, one can use one at a time, saving the cost.</li>
            <li> These sponges are absorbent without irritating the skin.  Very smooth to wear and comfortable without showing through clothing.  A big hit all around.</li>

            <li> I like these better than the cheap drug store one. They&#x27;re softer, more absorbent plus they didn&#x27;t shed or fray. Plus they didn&#x27;t irritate my son&#x27;s skin or interfere with his feeding tube button. I have been telling people about them. Another bonus is that they are cheaper than the drug store and they get shipped right to your door.</li>
            <li> just what i needed as i am apcking a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;g.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just what I needed as i&#x27;m packing a G.I. tube and the area around the tube sometimes emits slight  traces of  blood and or bile.</li>

            <li> just what i was looking for!</li>
            <li> They may be 6 ply but they are a very thin 6 ply.  I use in association with my trach and need to use 2 sponges (1 packet) instead of the one sponge I was able to use with the Kendall brand.  But... I  guess its a break even, these were half he price.</li>
            <li> This product is very helpful to my mon thank you</li>
            <li> asked for split and didn&#x27;t get split</li>

            <li> My son has a trach and uses these on a daily basis. We are both very pleased with them. I will be buying them forever.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Worked well for me when you have an abdominal tube entry wound to protect.</li>
