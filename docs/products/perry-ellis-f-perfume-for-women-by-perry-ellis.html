            <li> All excelent venezuela</li>
            <li> I smelled this fragrance on a lady at the grocery store and had to find out what the name of the perfume was.  Now that I bought it, I do not remember it smelling like this as it was on the lady.  I do love it!  It smells elegant, clean and fresh. And I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I love this parfum. The product was sent on time. Very affordable price. I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my mom as a gift and it smells like &#x27;a version&#x27; of the real thing. Also, she never got the gift note that I requested. I went to a perfume store and they told me this perfume is no longer being made. Seems like this is NOT THE REAL THING!Sadly I missed the return window but I will not be shopping here again.</li>
            <li> I smelled it on someone else and loved it but didn&#x27;t like it on me.</li>

            <li> I love this fragrance.  It&#x27;s strong, but sweet...It&#x27;s a powerful smell, but not overbearing.  My wife and I stumbled upon this parfum years ago in a fragrance store and it was my favorite out of probably 30 choices that we tried that day.  Since then, it has continued to be the #1 perfume for me that my wife wears.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe it very well, but it&#x27;s not flowery or powdery.  To me, it is maybe a little musty, but when I smell it, I am passionate for her.  It is rich, full and dreamy!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is by far my FAVORITE. I have been searching all over for this particular fragrance and found it here on Amazon. I get compliments all of the time from both males and females. I purchased what I thought was only a 3.4 oz bottle of fragrance. When my package came it was a 4-piece set. It included bath gel, body lotion and a travel size fragrance. I am very pleased with my purchase. The shipment arrived in only 3 business days! If you are looking for a long lasting, flirty fragrance buy this.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, now just deciding if I like it on me lol</li>
            <li> The order not only included the perfume, well packaged and delivered quickly, but was included in a &#x27;gift pack&#x27;. So I also received lotion, and a travel sized perfume. A very nice surprise! Thanks!</li>
