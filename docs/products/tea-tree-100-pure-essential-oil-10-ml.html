            <li>:) the smell is kind a strong but you will get use to it.  </li>

            <li>and I was glad they had it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>so I think I will just be sure to use it a pimple that&#x27;s forming or to heal one.</li>
            <li>I will probably find more uses for this</li>
            <li>and I will update. :]</li>

            <li>and I love the smell.</li>

            <li>Tea tree oil is good because its antiseptic properties are good for the hair and scalp, and there isn&#x27;t a buildup later.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to dab on a pimple as it will help clear it.</li>
            <li>Is anti-bacterial, anti-fungal--makes great natural antibacterial spray and hand gel   </li>
            <li>This was a great natural way to rid my son of the lumps and bumps on his arms.</li>

            <li>Really strong stuff.</li>

            <li>I recommend this to others if you can tolerate strong smells.</li>
            <li>Smells strong and works well for healing.</li>
            <li>This product in particular seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>first off--the smell is very strong.</li>
            <li>It does sting a little bit to the point where my eyes start to tear so its best to mix it with a bit of water.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that this magical product worked like pure magic.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;d heard so many positive things about tea tree oil</li>

            <li>It made more sense to get the real deal - which is this stuff.</li>
            <li>Shipping was cool too.</li>

            <li>Very beneful for many aliments</li>
            <li>Sweet</li>
            <li>Nice small bottle which is good because you won&#x27;t need a lot of it.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty strong, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
            <li>I find the scent to be very clean, but very pine-y smelling.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it, and our skin feels so soft and smooth and healthy that I cam still using both products.</li>
            <li>read the reviews and quickly purchased a bottle.</li>
            <li>I received my purchase quickly.</li>
            <li>CUTS AND SCRAPS DO NOT HEAL AS QUICKLY AND THE TEA TREE OIL DEFINATELY PROMOTES HEALING.  </li>
            <li>It was pricey, had a very strong smell and after many bottles, never really got rid of anything.  </li>
            <li>I was happy in the beginning, but after a month and a half this product losses its charm.</li>
            <li>I guess is true what they say natural things are better.</li>
            <li>It works very well and you will see results quickly!</li>
            <li>Thanks for sending so quick!</li>
            <li>have only been using this Tee Tree oil for a couple of days now, but it is doing something amazing.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast (had it within three days), and a free gift was included.</li>
            <li>I have to recommend seller also, because they sent me 2 free samples with this only article I bought :)</li>
            <li>If you have a zit or feel one coming up just apply more tea tree directly to the area.</li>
            <li>Weekly lid scrub with 50% TTO and daily lid scrub with tea tree shampoo is effective in eradicating ocular Demodex.</li>
            <li>The sent is pungent but it was worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Im transitioning to natural products, and this i have to say i love.</li>
            <li>At this price, it was well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>If you have warts like I did, you have to keep rubbing it on there with a cotton swab and then put a bandaid on it, so it can be absorbed on the wart.</li>
            <li>Needs useful product usage.</li>
            <li>but this is worth my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny twice over.</li>
            <li>I love this oil, and my routine would not be complete with out.</li>
            <li>Soooo stinky, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much Plantlife for making this!!!</li>
            <li>and it got rid of it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Came quick and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The smell of tea tree is pretty powerful but like the smell of Vinegar</li>
            <li>Leave it there until the tingling sensation goes away (not painful, but can get very tingly depending on your situation).</li>
            <li>works well to stop the zit right at the first sign of acne if applied right away.</li>
            <li>Tea tree essential oil is STRONG!</li>
            <li>great for acne a little drying, don&#x27;t use too much may cause  irritation</li>
            <li>Okay first off, within the first day of using this on my nails they were shiny and stronger, now after about a week and a half they are better than ever...</li>
            <li>It does have a strong natural smell though.</li>
            <li>This product is very cheap, especially because it&#x27;s 100% tea tree oil!</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really was affective in clearing up our scabies and even my dandruff!</li>
            <li>but it had too many extra ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love essential oils!!!</li>
            <li>Incredibly fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>It irritated my skin a lot at first when I was using it without diluting it.</li>
            <li>I first discovered tea tree oil when I got my belly button pierced.</li>
            <li>The first day I applied the oil</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time overnight...</li>
            <li>The smell grows on you though, and it does seem to work on one&#x27;s skin pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is a a really good price for the product; half of what one would pay in the store and that includes shipping!  </li>
            <li>It glides right over skin and really helped with my breakouts.</li>
            <li>I was willing to take the risk and apply it to my skin in pure form without mixing it.  </li>
            <li>but im positive</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and came with a free sample of other products!</li>
            <li>At first you feel very tinglely</li>
            <li>i rarely use any other over the counter medication any more for my acne.</li>
            <li>But boy, my first day of use really cleared my skin within a week</li>
            <li>I will be able to make this oil go a long way.</li>
            <li>I personally dont have a problem with the scent although it&#x27;s quite strong.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong but I actually like it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pure tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>i guess i was dumb lol.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt take much because its pure.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference the next day.</li>
            <li>it goes away fast...</li>
            <li>really gets all the oil and dirt out.</li>
            <li>And I think they gave me a free sample of lemongrass lotion - because I definitely don&#x27;t remember ordering that.</li>
            <li>Very earthy and takes some getting used too.</li>
            <li>I applied it twice every day to the inflamed areas and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on my acne which was very dissapointing because it did nothing.</li>
            <li>, I always have, it makes me lightheaded if i use too much at once.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li>I also really like the company</li>
            <li>I find this product to be very soothing and works well as advertised.</li>
            <li>but I needed fast results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast and the product arrived as promised.  </li>
            <li>and IT REALLY DID WORK.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping for improvements.</li>
            <li>I like putting Tea Tree Oil on my problem areas when my face decides it wants to break out.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t got to use it much</li>
            <li>Arrived wayyyyy earlier than expected...really great product..just a Tadd bit smaller than I expected but definitely worth the buy👍</li>
            <li>I have to tell you that this product has worked very well, on some skin abrasions that my husband had sustained.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s other uses for it</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older, I really don&#x27;t have acne anymore, but I still get blemishes from time to time, even cysts once in a while (those are a blast).</li>
            <li>For me, B.P. takes about 3 days to help open any clog pores so that I clean it and then let it heal, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for acne cyst.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells strong but the smell goes away once its dry.   </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie about the fact that the scent is quite strong, but if I have to smell a little like Pine Sol to get rid of these things, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It was such a cool feeling.</li>
            <li>You have to let the oil dry, which it does pretty quick and then just put the bandaid on.   </li>
            <li>So much better than all those typical acne products.  </li>
            <li>Most times the pimple gets smaller the next day.</li>
            <li>(though it was better straight, I just don&#x27;t want to waste it).  </li>
            <li>very small bottle but very potent.  </li>
            <li>I would totally recommend this product to anyone interested!</li>
            <li>What I really is that is is natural.</li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much all OTC stuff (Salyctic Acid and Benzoyl Peroxide), Murad, Proactive (the last two</li>
            <li>It pretty much looked like a red swollen bump on the side of my toe where my ingrown toe nail was.</li>
            <li>But I think there&#x27;s a lot more simple things you can do, that won&#x27;t dry up your face like</li>
            <li>Only con is that it is strong smelling and smell last awhile.  </li>
            <li>and I put it right on the bump for several nights and</li>
            <li>The fungus did not clear up as quickly as the acne, but its getting there.</li>
            <li>Fast, professional, and complete.  </li>
            <li>not sure if the tea tree oil has helped get rid of the scabies, but it helps soothe your skin which is so important while you are experiecing the post scabies itch!</li>
            <li>Gave the first one away, the 2nd one I bought for my daughter....</li>
            <li>Once fully healed, I carefully dabbed on just the targets, but again awoke to full rash.  </li>
            <li>(neutrogena pink grapefruit body wash, skin detox tea, tanning sessions, 2 liters or more of water per day, vitamin A supplements...) and improvements to my skin were just minor.  </li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, and a few drops mix well with water, setting lotion, or gel.</li>
            <li>I applied it directly to the skin by putting drops on my fingers and rubbing the first night, then today I mixed it with water and sprayed it through parts and onto my scalp and effected ear.  </li>
            <li>I also try to use it minimally because my skin will get use to the product and it becomes less effective (just like all products).</li>
            <li>It came with a free little bottle of massage oil.</li>
            <li>Not exactly a silver bullet, but I feel it has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>My face is now clear.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with Johnson&#x27;s Baby Lotion for easier application, and it has helped clear up the scrapes from the scabies.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>Using to clear up a hive out break on my face, it is helping</li>
            <li>It has really helped clear up my facial acne.  </li>
            <li>I almost saw results immediately when I started to use the tea tree old.</li>
            <li>and I had read that Tea Tree Oil was used to combat against it as a natural method.</li>
            <li>My skin completely cleared up after a week.</li>
            <li>I woke up today, and they were completely gone.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give a reveiw this early...</li>
            <li>Talk about an improvement in overall dental health, and it makes your whole mouth just feel fresher.</li>
            <li>I personally like the smell, very woodsy, earthy, ect.</li>
            <li>and i have to say wow....</li>
            <li>I applied a drop on a cotton swab directly to the pimples.</li>
            <li>, I put a drop of the TTO onto a q-tip and dab it directly on the spot before going to bed...</li>
            <li>as far as the healing goes..</li>
            <li>but I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Besides organic, natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil is a natural deodorant, insect repellant.</li>
            <li>About the product, I got it for acne, but have yet to see complete resolution of it.</li>
            <li>I have extremly sensitive skin as well as ezcema on my elbows, hands, legs, and I used to have it on my face.  </li>
            <li>But as far as quality</li>
            <li>So far I have found two uses for this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries the area a lot and caused me to have more white heads on the surrounding skin, but after I mixed it with a few drops of water, i doesn&#x27;t bother my skin too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and its been working well so far.  </li>
            <li>my 8 year old is grossed out by it, but i&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li>i have applied it directly.</li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>He has been applying the oil directly to the area.</li>
            <li>Product was packaged properly for safe delivery; along with instructions, a coupon, and a small bonus item...I will buy this product again..</li>
            <li>Although my face get oily through the day, it&#x27;s very dry when I first wash it</li>
            <li>so I put this on it, massaged my knee and leg and it feels back to normal now.     </li>
            <li>I had three new blemishes coming through before I went to bed last night...</li>
            <li>Obviously I caused myself a new sensitivity or allergic reaction to this oil.  </li>
            <li>The untouched bites were very itchy, and still present when I woke up the next day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil but be careful if your skin is very sensitive -</li>
            <li>First the shipping was extremely fast!I got mine in 2</li>
            <li>At first i was apprehensive about putting oil on my skin since i have extremely oily/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Too strong of a smell and in such small bottle.</li>
            <li>I got this because I&#x27;ve been breaking out badly around my chin and mouth, and I&#x27;ve heard great things about tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>Generally though I like it.</li>
            <li>I am in my 30&#x27;s and have occasional break-outs but otherwise have clear skin.</li>
            <li>I found that apparently they don&#x27;t like the smell of Tea Tree Oil</li>
            <li>even when mixed in baby shampoo, this was my sister&#x27;s idea of a natural cure.</li>
            <li>it has not done anything for my acne so far, and i have been religiously applying it to my chin pimples.</li>
            <li>I barely dabbed the oil with a cotton swab over my scars and woke up to a nightmare.</li>
            <li>i would recommend this product to anyone who uses essential oils frequently.</li>
            <li>The product seems to be efficient so far, I use it on my face, mixed with my night and day cream.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is definitely working on a few different medical issues (nothing serious)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m down to half a bottle of Tea Tree oil now and will be buying more later.</li>
            <li>My only issue with it pertaining to my particular experience is if I put it on a white head, it likely turns it into a blackhead.</li>
            <li>I used it every day for the first week and now I am using it every other day or 3 times per week - even my left over scars are starting to decrease in size.  </li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted, i used it for a mask and added a few drops to the clay powder and filtered water.</li>
            <li>This review is for the tea tree oil itself and it was delivered earlier than expected and was exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>nothing bad has happened, but nothing good.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This Tea Tree oil is amazing</li>
            <li> This is amazing for getting rid of keloids, it just takes a while.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing</li>
            <li> This Tee Tree oil is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This stuff is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> would make a nice accompaniment in the bath, or with aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> Thanks, excellent product.</li>
            <li> When using on the skin, it is best to use with a carrier oil..sweet almond oil works very well.     </li>
            <li> It did the job nicely.  </li>
            <li> after reading about so many good uses for tea tree oil, and how it&#x27;s supposed to help acne, i thought i would order this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and gives the scalp a cool soothing feeling.  </li>
            <li> You can use it for so many things and this is 100% pure, cannot do better than this!!!</li>
            <li> Has a very strong odor</li>
            <li> days!!The smell is very strong but smells sooooooooo</li>
            <li> smell is VERY strong.</li>
            <li> However, I would recommend diluting it with water, it&#x27;s very strong and concentrated if used by itself.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is not one you buy for the pleasant smell, but it is very useful.</li>
            <li> the quality is good and it even came with a free gift and a pamplet.</li>
            <li> 100% tea tree oil is the BEST product ever for those with sensitive skin that are prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> Best of all it&#x27;s a natural product.</li>
            <li> I have used this tea tree oil for many diffent things and it should be called amazing.</li>
            <li> , the smell is strong, I will advise to apply it outdoors!</li>
            <li> the oil came quickly through the mail, and a beautifully scented bar of soap was an added free bonus.  </li>
            <li> :) the smell is kind a strong but you will get use to it.  </li>
            <li> I should have known better.</li>

            <li> This was a great natural way to rid my son of the lumps and bumps on his arms.</li>

            <li> Really strong stuff.</li>

            <li> Smells strong and works well for healing.</li>
            <li> This product in particular seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> first off--the smell is very strong.</li>
            <li> It does sting a little bit to the point where my eyes start to tear so its best to mix it with a bit of water.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that this magical product worked like pure magic.</li>
            <li> the tea tree oil came a free gift that included a sample Vanilla Orange body wash and a coconut lime herbal soap.</li>

            <li> you note and a free bar of lemon grass soap.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is useful in more ways that I even thought.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to say that my experience has been the same.</li>
            <li> This brand is great and much better than other brands I purchased.</li>
            <li> I feel very fresh</li>
            <li> However, this is a very useful oil.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to find out that this stuff works exceptionally well in reducing the swelling of mosquito bites.</li>
            <li> p.s shipping was very fast and they sent me lavender oil and an almond soap as a gift :)</li>
            <li> Great seller and quick delivery too, I will purchase from him in the future.</li>
            <li> It is very strong, so you should dilute it a little bit, but the effect is amazing!</li>
            <li> Originally I could not believe the price because it was so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil is good for PPP (gentlemen from age of 20 to 30 generally may suffer from PPP).</li>
            <li> this company is vegan friendly YAY!&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly and it&#x27;s exactly what I needed and excpected!  </li>
            <li> It effectivly keeps the cut or abrasion clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brands but this is by far the best quality.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product, works like magic when treating acne.</li>
            <li> This product is all natural essential oil, smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard so many positive things about tea tree oil</li>
            <li> A natural product with many uses!</li>
            <li> My advice is to stick to the natural products so that your skin can recover naturally and beautifully.</li>
            <li> It made more sense to get the real deal - which is this stuff.</li>
            <li> Shipping was cool too.</li>
            <li> 100 % true tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Very beneful for many aliments</li>
            <li> Sweet</li>
            <li> Nice small bottle which is good because you won&#x27;t need a lot of it.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty strong, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
            <li> I find the scent to be very clean, but very pine-y smelling.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it, and our skin feels so soft and smooth and healthy that I cam still using both products.</li>
            <li> read the reviews and quickly purchased a bottle.</li>
            <li> I received my purchase quickly.</li>
            <li> CUTS AND SCRAPS DO NOT HEAL AS QUICKLY AND THE TEA TREE OIL DEFINATELY PROMOTES HEALING.  </li>
            <li> It was pricey, had a very strong smell and after many bottles, never really got rid of anything.  </li>
            <li> I was happy in the beginning, but after a month and a half this product losses its charm.</li>
            <li> I guess is true what they say natural things are better.</li>
            <li> It works very well and you will see results quickly!</li>
            <li> Thanks for sending so quick!</li>
            <li> have only been using this Tee Tree oil for a couple of days now, but it is doing something amazing.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast (had it within three days), and a free gift was included.</li>
            <li> I have to recommend seller also, because they sent me 2 free samples with this only article I bought :)</li>
            <li> If you have a zit or feel one coming up just apply more tea tree directly to the area.</li>
            <li> Weekly lid scrub with 50% TTO and daily lid scrub with tea tree shampoo is effective in eradicating ocular Demodex.</li>
            <li> The sent is pungent but it was worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Im transitioning to natural products, and this i have to say i love.</li>
            <li> At this price, it was well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> If you have warts like I did, you have to keep rubbing it on there with a cotton swab and then put a bandaid on it, so it can be absorbed on the wart.</li>
            <li> Needs useful product usage.</li>
            <li> but this is worth my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny twice over.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, and my routine would not be complete with out.</li>
            <li> Soooo stinky, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much Plantlife for making this!!!</li>
            <li> and it got rid of it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Came quick and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The smell of tea tree is pretty powerful but like the smell of Vinegar</li>
            <li> Leave it there until the tingling sensation goes away (not painful, but can get very tingly depending on your situation).</li>
            <li> works well to stop the zit right at the first sign of acne if applied right away.</li>
            <li> Tea tree essential oil is STRONG!</li>
            <li> great for acne a little drying, don&#x27;t use too much may cause  irritation</li>
            <li> Okay first off, within the first day of using this on my nails they were shiny and stronger, now after about a week and a half they are better than ever...</li>
            <li> It does have a strong natural smell though.</li>
            <li> This product is very cheap, especially because it&#x27;s 100% tea tree oil!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really was affective in clearing up our scabies and even my dandruff!</li>
            <li> but it had too many extra ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils!!!</li>
            <li> Incredibly fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> It irritated my skin a lot at first when I was using it without diluting it.</li>
            <li> I first discovered tea tree oil when I got my belly button pierced.</li>
            <li> The first day I applied the oil</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time overnight...</li>
            <li> The smell grows on you though, and it does seem to work on one&#x27;s skin pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is a a really good price for the product; half of what one would pay in the store and that includes shipping!  </li>
            <li> It glides right over skin and really helped with my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I was willing to take the risk and apply it to my skin in pure form without mixing it.  </li>
            <li> but im positive</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly and came with a free sample of other products!</li>
            <li> At first you feel very tinglely</li>
            <li> i rarely use any other over the counter medication any more for my acne.</li>
            <li> But boy, my first day of use really cleared my skin within a week</li>
            <li> I will be able to make this oil go a long way.</li>
            <li> I personally dont have a problem with the scent although it&#x27;s quite strong.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong but I actually like it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pure tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> i guess i was dumb lol.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt take much because its pure.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference the next day.</li>
            <li> it goes away fast...</li>
            <li> really gets all the oil and dirt out.</li>
            <li> And I think they gave me a free sample of lemongrass lotion - because I definitely don&#x27;t remember ordering that.</li>
            <li> Very earthy and takes some getting used too.</li>
            <li> I applied it twice every day to the inflamed areas and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my acne which was very dissapointing because it did nothing.</li>
            <li> , I always have, it makes me lightheaded if i use too much at once.  </li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li> I also really like the company</li>
            <li> I find this product to be very soothing and works well as advertised.</li>
            <li> but I needed fast results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast and the product arrived as promised.  </li>
            <li> and IT REALLY DID WORK.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping for improvements.</li>
            <li> I like putting Tea Tree Oil on my problem areas when my face decides it wants to break out.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t got to use it much</li>
            <li> Arrived wayyyyy earlier than expected...really great product..just a Tadd bit smaller than I expected but definitely worth the buy👍</li>
            <li> I have to tell you that this product has worked very well, on some skin abrasions that my husband had sustained.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s other uses for it</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m older, I really don&#x27;t have acne anymore, but I still get blemishes from time to time, even cysts once in a while (those are a blast).</li>
            <li> For me, B.P. takes about 3 days to help open any clog pores so that I clean it and then let it heal, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for acne cyst.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells strong but the smell goes away once its dry.   </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie about the fact that the scent is quite strong, but if I have to smell a little like Pine Sol to get rid of these things, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It was such a cool feeling.</li>
            <li> You have to let the oil dry, which it does pretty quick and then just put the bandaid on.   </li>
            <li> So much better than all those typical acne products.  </li>
            <li> Most times the pimple gets smaller the next day.</li>
            <li> (though it was better straight, I just don&#x27;t want to waste it).  </li>
            <li> very small bottle but very potent.  </li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this product to anyone interested!</li>
            <li> What I really is that is is natural.</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much all OTC stuff (Salyctic Acid and Benzoyl Peroxide), Murad, Proactive (the last two</li>
            <li> It pretty much looked like a red swollen bump on the side of my toe where my ingrown toe nail was.</li>
            <li> But I think there&#x27;s a lot more simple things you can do, that won&#x27;t dry up your face like</li>
            <li> Only con is that it is strong smelling and smell last awhile.  </li>
            <li> and I put it right on the bump for several nights and</li>
            <li> The fungus did not clear up as quickly as the acne, but its getting there.</li>
            <li> Fast, professional, and complete.  </li>
            <li> not sure if the tea tree oil has helped get rid of the scabies, but it helps soothe your skin which is so important while you are experiecing the post scabies itch!</li>
            <li> Gave the first one away, the 2nd one I bought for my daughter....</li>
            <li> Once fully healed, I carefully dabbed on just the targets, but again awoke to full rash.  </li>
            <li> (neutrogena pink grapefruit body wash, skin detox tea, tanning sessions, 2 liters or more of water per day, vitamin A supplements...) and improvements to my skin were just minor.  </li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, and a few drops mix well with water, setting lotion, or gel.</li>
            <li> I applied it directly to the skin by putting drops on my fingers and rubbing the first night, then today I mixed it with water and sprayed it through parts and onto my scalp and effected ear.  </li>
            <li> I also try to use it minimally because my skin will get use to the product and it becomes less effective (just like all products).</li>
            <li> It came with a free little bottle of massage oil.</li>
            <li> Not exactly a silver bullet, but I feel it has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> My face is now clear.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with Johnson&#x27;s Baby Lotion for easier application, and it has helped clear up the scrapes from the scabies.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> Using to clear up a hive out break on my face, it is helping</li>
            <li> It has really helped clear up my facial acne.  </li>
            <li> I almost saw results immediately when I started to use the tea tree old.</li>
            <li> and I had read that Tea Tree Oil was used to combat against it as a natural method.</li>
            <li> My skin completely cleared up after a week.</li>
            <li> I woke up today, and they were completely gone.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give a reveiw this early...</li>
            <li> Talk about an improvement in overall dental health, and it makes your whole mouth just feel fresher.</li>
            <li> I personally like the smell, very woodsy, earthy, ect.</li>
            <li> and i have to say wow....</li>
            <li> I applied a drop on a cotton swab directly to the pimples.</li>
            <li> , I put a drop of the TTO onto a q-tip and dab it directly on the spot before going to bed...</li>
            <li> as far as the healing goes..</li>
            <li> but I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Besides organic, natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is a natural deodorant, insect repellant.</li>
            <li> About the product, I got it for acne, but have yet to see complete resolution of it.</li>
            <li> I have extremly sensitive skin as well as ezcema on my elbows, hands, legs, and I used to have it on my face.  </li>
            <li> But as far as quality</li>
            <li> So far I have found two uses for this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries the area a lot and caused me to have more white heads on the surrounding skin, but after I mixed it with a few drops of water, i doesn&#x27;t bother my skin too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and its been working well so far.  </li>
            <li> my 8 year old is grossed out by it, but i&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> i have applied it directly.</li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> He has been applying the oil directly to the area.</li>
            <li> Product was packaged properly for safe delivery; along with instructions, a coupon, and a small bonus item...I will buy this product again..</li>
            <li> Although my face get oily through the day, it&#x27;s very dry when I first wash it</li>
            <li> so I put this on it, massaged my knee and leg and it feels back to normal now.     </li>
            <li> I had three new blemishes coming through before I went to bed last night...</li>
            <li> Obviously I caused myself a new sensitivity or allergic reaction to this oil.  </li>
            <li> The untouched bites were very itchy, and still present when I woke up the next day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil but be careful if your skin is very sensitive -</li>
            <li> First the shipping was extremely fast!I got mine in 2</li>
            <li> At first i was apprehensive about putting oil on my skin since i have extremely oily/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Too strong of a smell and in such small bottle.</li>
            <li> I got this because I&#x27;ve been breaking out badly around my chin and mouth, and I&#x27;ve heard great things about tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Generally though I like it.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and have occasional break-outs but otherwise have clear skin.</li>
            <li> I found that apparently they don&#x27;t like the smell of Tea Tree Oil</li>
            <li> even when mixed in baby shampoo, this was my sister&#x27;s idea of a natural cure.</li>
            <li> it has not done anything for my acne so far, and i have been religiously applying it to my chin pimples.</li>
            <li> I barely dabbed the oil with a cotton swab over my scars and woke up to a nightmare.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product to anyone who uses essential oils frequently.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be efficient so far, I use it on my face, mixed with my night and day cream.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is definitely working on a few different medical issues (nothing serious)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to half a bottle of Tea Tree oil now and will be buying more later.</li>
            <li> My only issue with it pertaining to my particular experience is if I put it on a white head, it likely turns it into a blackhead.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for the first week and now I am using it every other day or 3 times per week - even my left over scars are starting to decrease in size.  </li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted, i used it for a mask and added a few drops to the clay powder and filtered water.</li>
            <li> This review is for the tea tree oil itself and it was delivered earlier than expected and was exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> nothing bad has happened, but nothing good.</li>
            <li> This stuff comes in a little bottle and if you don&#x27;t waste it, it will last you a long time and is very cheap compared to some other stuff you have to try for warts and acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not try other benefits of tea tree oil so far.</li>
            <li> It was packaged up brand new with some extra little massage oils.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t take much, just a small amount will get the job done.</li>
            <li> worked well for my scalp just didn&amp;#34;t last long</li>
            <li> I then sprayed down my doors and windows and so far no centipedes.</li>
            <li> Tea tree, just plain old fashion product that work!!</li>
            <li> I have a few pimples on my cheeks that hurt so much that sometimes i had to wake up in the middle of the night due to the pain i felt when i turned my face on the pillow.</li>
            <li> It also last a very long time.</li>
            <li> My scalp gets really dry from the winter to the spring with the temperature change, and it&#x27;s gross ..</li>
            <li> next day the pinple was dry..</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that there is no expiration date on the bottle which I have found on other bottles sold by other sellers and this stuff does not seem to be as effective if it is used past its expired time.</li>
            <li> Although I rotate the tea tree with other essential oils, this is definitely one that I will keep on the shelf.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take too long.</li>
            <li> this arrived in the mail four days after ordering which was earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I have spent countless $$$ on creams, lotions, specified products to help with zits</li>
            <li> The bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use tea tree oil mixed with other hair products that I use every week.  </li>
            <li> The other additives in my water solution were soap and white vinegar.</li>
            <li> Nothing else worked to heal my dry, burning scalp and face.  </li>
            <li> The tea tree oil helps to dry out the acne and helps it heal faster.</li>
            <li> I would apply a bit of the tea tree oil, let it dry and put on a strip of that bandaid, which stuck on through out the day on the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> There are no new ones forming either, because I dabbed the oil all over, not just on blemishes.</li>
            <li> The smell is very very strong but I rather smell the odor than deal with ugly acne and bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to use it for other purposes, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t do anything for the acne, which is the primary reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> what it did for for...was to remove a small skin tag on the side of my neck, near my shoulder.</li>
            <li> but if used daily on the zit, it minimizes the zit from becoming too cystic and painful.</li>
            <li> But only in small amounts since larger can cause severe allergic reactions, or burns.</li>
            <li> I can buy a larger amount for less money minus shipping and wait.</li>
            <li> I was a little weary after reading some reviews of chemical burns on face after usage of tea tree oil, but this product works as described, no burns as a 100 percent natural, has a little smell</li>
            <li> I use it so often that I bought a bigger cheaper bottle at wallmart for a little over two bucks</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle was a little bigger</li>
            <li> I researched other less toxic alternatives and came up with tea tree oil as a possible</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I ran out too quickly so next time</li>
            <li> The only preventive is an everyday inspection.</li>
            <li> Smells stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I dab a few drops on the areas where pimples are starting to form and it will gradually shrink the pimples away.</li>
            <li> Cleared any trouble spots I put it on, even if just a red mark.</li>
            <li> I then just used drops of it in my laundry, but not much else.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as i expected</li>
            <li> I applied this stuff to a large, painful pimple and by morning it had decreased in size by more than half.</li>
            <li> This product arrived tightly bubble wrapped inside of a sealed envelope however that was not enough to prevent over half of it from spilling out.</li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t need a lot of this stuff, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way    </li>
            <li> a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it is very small amount where I live</li>
            <li> TRIED OTHER PRODUCTS INCLUDING PRESCRIPTION MEDS</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> I suggest checking walmart walgreens and other places like that to get tea tree oil</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small enough to carry in my purse for emergencies-</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I was hoping it would help to reduce blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other shampoos specifically for my scalp which did nothing.</li>
            <li> Be careful with that!</li>
            <li> and I applied the tea tree oil to 2 of them, while leaving the other two untouched.</li>
            <li> The other day I had a rash on my arms and applied this</li>
            <li> and I can wear any sorta dark shirt I want w/o having a winter wonderland on my shoulders.</li>
            <li> it helps any bumps that appears on face fade away without any irritation and dark marks.</li>
            <li> When I wake up - any pimples I had are either gone or down in size.</li>
            <li> It did make it go down a bit</li>
            <li> The swelling was down already within just 2 hours and the itching had gone away on the ones I applied the oil to.</li>
            <li> I use it on pimples and ocational brackeouts and it comes it down.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight smell, but my sinuses have never been clearer.</li>
            <li> That why I gave it one less star.  </li>
            <li> I am a black woman with acne prone combination skin.</li>
            <li> Others, that I have tried, have an odd rancid tire rubber smell.</li>
            <li> I have had about 2 small pimples in the past 2 months which were totally unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> As you apply the oil it does tingle your skin slightly.  </li>
            <li> I used it two times and is already works: I have less hair loss today.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is its lack of dropper, I&#x27;m not sure if I received a defected one</li>
            <li> Ive tried everything out there..and after reading these reviews I thought I had found my little miracle worker.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s little miracles), but I purchased it in hopes it would help out</li>
            <li> I keep this little jar with me at home and when I travel.</li>
            <li> , I bought a few types at the drugstore and it was almost working but not at 100%, I found this product online</li>
            <li> I add a few drops (10-20) to my shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> so I ordered this and just put a few drops in my laundry detergent and a spray bottle of water to spray on surfaces which could not be washed.</li>
            <li> (I prefer Thayers non-alcoholic one which can be found here on amazon) on a cotton ball then put a few drops of tea tree on there and apply all over the face</li>
            <li> made my skin worse, and I was on them for months), various forms of Tetracycline from my dermatologist, and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> The downside is the aroma for a few days.</li>
            <li> Now i use it a few times a week at night time i add 5 drops to my moisturizer mix it with my hands and apply it all over.</li>
            <li> when i bathe i add a few drops into the tub.</li>
            <li> so I mix a few drops with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> house started to get a lot of centipedes - I would see one almost everyday..</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> You have to keep at it, applying it everyday and cover it.</li>
            <li> For acne I just put a drop of this on the palm of my hand and about 5-10 drops of almond oil that I had and applied it to my face everyday before sleeping.</li>
            <li> but you get used to it after a few uses.</li>
            <li> i applied a drop on a q-tip a few times a day.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks, I use it for dandruff, put  few drops in a 4 ounce bottle, on my wounds, on my toes:</li>
            <li> only if you use it in small amounts, thin layers.  </li>
            <li> It wont help rid you of acne blemish or scars, but it does prevent new or recurring acnes from coming back, including this one annoying cyst on my chin that lasted for months.</li>
            <li> I understand that some people may not have insurance but to tell you the truth the medicines they prescribe are not too expensive (less than $25) and will last for months.</li>
            <li> Every week I would use a nail filer to rub down the dead skin on the wart and it worked like a charm!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very prone to bad scars and keloid bumps.</li>
            <li> Bottle was soo small for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> its a small container</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the stink to use this product longer than a couple days.  </li>
            <li> One being small cuts.</li>
            <li> I put some of this on a cotton ball and dabbed it on the problem areas for the past week, but I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
            <li> I also used a small amount of this on my toothbrush to help with bleeding gums and it worked wonders.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a small bottle of this to try out to see what all the hype was about</li>
            <li> so was hard to use just a small amount.</li>
            <li> First I must admit that I HATE the smell of tea tree</li>
            <li> It slowly healed within a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Bought this after researching for something for hard thick nails.  </li>
            <li> The labs they took kept showing up negative.</li>
            <li> I used it for mold caused by a slow water pipe leak in the basement.</li>
            <li> I WILL NOT BUY FROM ANYONE OTHER THAN THIS SELLER!!!!</li>
            <li> Even a very small amount burned the cat&#x27;s sore places,</li>
            <li> It smells awful, but it really does work!!</li>
            <li> None of the OTC stuff worked such as anything with benzoyl in it, and my breakouts were bad.</li>
            <li> I have always had some acne, but the meds made it worse.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Alpha Hydrox line of skin care products, and while they have made a dramatic difference in my skin, it still didn&#x27;t solve my problems 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, and this one is terrible.</li>
            <li> I mean it!!</li>
            <li> but I would rate this 4 stars since it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get the oil out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It smells bad, and it also  seemed to make her condition much worse.</li>
            <li> Well, very wrong, it actually made my acne worst.</li>
            <li> She was very disappointed and it was quite a bit of money down the drain</li>
            <li> I was desperate and I decided to give this oil a try.  </li>
            <li> Tag Away were really bad, so</li>
            <li> I had a really bad rash that all medicine the doctor prescribed wouldn&#x27;t take care of.</li>
            <li> but I dont think it&#x27;s that bad, and its gone once the oil dries.  </li>
            <li> but it won&#x27;t work for me! :(</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> I use it for a base oil to mix with another product.</li>
            <li> Im very disappointed.</li>
            <li> lolI hate fleasssss!!)   </li>
            <li> I know disgusting.</li>
            <li> The product works, but it smells awful, but I needed it, for the treatment of my hair loss.</li>
            <li> My face looks horrible...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Snake Oil products. I should have known better. Everyone told me not to order it. Wish I could return this item for credit.</li>
            <li> Very very potent, it does help just like it was suppose to, some people may not like the smell. Just remember that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called aromatherapy. You also don&#x27;t need a lot of this stuff, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This Tea Tree oil is amazing - I use it for itchy skin and irritation.  It works very well and you will see results quickly!</li>
            <li> Still using it and not every day. Has a very strong odor but I will continue to use it and see how it works on the skin</li>
            <li> TRIED OTHER PRODUCTS INCLUDING PRESCRIPTION MEDS AND THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT IT WORKING. THE TOE NAIL IS HEALING.  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing, I&#x27;m talking about A-Maz-ing!!!! My scalp gets really dry from the winter to the spring with the temperature change, and it&#x27;s gross ..like flakes... everywhere, i tried shampoos and all that jazz which helped  but it wouldn&#x27;t actually make the flakes like.. leave  ya know forever... instead it was just mini vacations they took in between  shampoos. So i did some research and read that tea tree oil works, I bought a few types at the drugstore and it was almost working but not at 100%, I found this product online and it was a BLESSING, after just three days of dripping this in my scalp and rubbing it with my finger the itch is gone and the flakes hit the road and haven&#x27;t returned, yay! I drip some in now once a week and I can wear any sorta dark shirt I want w/o having a winter wonderland on my shoulders. Thanks so much Plantlife for making this!!!</li>
            <li> I was just what I was looking for and I was glad they had it. Thanks for sending so quick!</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil is amazing! Not only for price, also for quality. I add a few drops (10-20) to my shampoo and conditioner and I forget of dandruff every day. I&#x27;m not try other benefits of tea tree oil so far. I have to recommend seller also, because they sent me 2 free samples with this only article I bought :)</li>
            <li> very small bottle but very potent.  Didn&#x27;t have a dripper spout or dropper so was hard to use just a small amount.</li>
            <li> This is a a really good price for the product; half of what one would pay in the store and that includes shipping!  Also, received the product 2 days after ordering... pretty impressive from AZ to South Florida!</li>
            <li> I love this product. First the shipping was extremely fast!I got mine in 2 days!!The smell is very strong but smells sooooooooo good!With the tea tree oil came a free gift that included a sample Vanilla Orange body wash and a coconut lime herbal soap. They also smell really good. I bought this for my keliods post surgery so hopefully it will work to prevent more from forming. After I applied it to both of my ears soon after there was a tingly feeling which felt awsome! I would totally recommend this product to anyone interested!</li>
            <li> Been dealing with acne since I was 14 (now 24). Ive tried everything out there..and after reading these reviews I thought I had found my little miracle worker. I&#x27;ve tried it twice a day and I&#x27;ve tried it in my lotion...but it won&#x27;t work for me! :(</li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly and it&#x27;s exactly what I needed and excpected!  I will absolutely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading other reviews. I was diagnosed with leukemia and started oral chemo. My face started to break out with pimples like I was a girl just reaching puberty. I have always had some acne, but the meds made it worse. None of the OTC stuff worked such as anything with benzoyl in it, and my breakouts were bad. I almost saw results immediately when I started to use the tea tree old. I used tea tree oil for two months. I may get ONE pimple every now and then, but my face is pimple free. The trick I have found is as follows: nighttime-clean my skin with witch hazel using cotton balls, put on some tea tree oil and then I put Vaseline on. For day time I wash my face with cuticura bar soap, apply the  tea tree oil, and then a lite moisturizer. My face is now clear. It does have a slight smell, but my sinuses have never been clearer. The smell does not last and it is tolerable. I&#x27;d rather take the smell rather than the million pimples.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have found. Originally I could not believe the price because it was so inexpensive. Not only is it a great product. Shipping was almost immediate (with tracking number) and the service was phenomonal..Product was packaged properly for safe delivery; along with instructions, a coupon, and a small bonus item...I will buy this product again..I WILL NOT BUY FROM ANYONE OTHER THAN THIS SELLER!!!!</li>
            <li> My sons and I had been diagnosed with Scabies and I had read that Tea Tree Oil was used to combat against it as a natural method. We had tried the body cream from the doctor...nothing...so I ordered this and just put a few drops in my laundry detergent and a spray bottle of water to spray on surfaces which could not be washed. It was a miracle! Combined with California Baby&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil &amp; Lavender wash it got rid of our scabies for good! I couldn&#x27;t believe it, and our skin feels so soft and smooth and healthy that I cam still using both products. The smell of tea tree is pretty powerful but like the smell of Vinegar it goes away fast...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree Oil is a anti-fungal anti-bacterial substance that repels lice and it&#x27;s sister counterparts such as body lice, aka scabies, crabs...&lt;br /&gt;It really was affective in clearing up our scabies and even my dandruff! GREAT PRODUCT!!! It&#x27;s also great to dab on a pimple as it will help clear it.</li>
            <li> Works well for treating acne. Just apply it over the pimple and its surrounding area with Q-tip. One time I see the result within a couple of hours. Most times the pimple gets smaller the next day. It does have a strong natural smell though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It works beautifully, though the scent isn&#x27;t the greatest- it does what it says it does. Great for baths, its almost like it puts a new coat of skin on me. Seller was great, very fast shipping and great price. It was packaged up brand new with some extra little massage oils. Would buy from this seller again. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle  from skin to feet problem it just got the job done. If you can pass the smell.... That make it the number one product for us to have at the house..Tea tree, just plain old fashion product that work!!</li>
            <li> I had never used Tea Tree Oil for acne before I bought this product, and I was not dissapointed. It is very strong, so you should dilute it a little bit, but the effect is amazing! My skin completely cleared up after a week. Also, it didn&#x27;t leave any stain on my skin, and I have very fair skin. I also used the oil for a toenail fungus I have been fighting for years. The fungus did not clear up as quickly as the acne, but its getting there. My only complaint is that I ran out too quickly so next time Im getting a bigger bottle!!</li>
            <li> This product is very cheap, especially because it&#x27;s 100% tea tree oil! It arrived very quickly and came with a free sample of other products!</li>
            <li> Really good tea tree oil it works great if you put some witch hazel (I prefer Thayers non-alcoholic one which can be found here on amazon) on a cotton ball then put a few drops of tea tree on there and apply all over the face really gets all the oil and dirt out. If you have a zit or feel one coming up just apply more tea tree directly to the area. My only complaint would be that it is very small amount where I live I can buy a larger amount for less money minus shipping and wait. I suggest checking walmart walgreens and other places like that to get tea tree oil rather then going through the amazon process but it is a great product!</li>
            <li> I love everything about this! It smells great and it helps my acne. I put this on at night before bed in my problem areas. When I wake up - any pimples I had are either gone or down in size. Good stuff! I was going to try Body Shops Tea Tree Oil but it had too many extra ingredients. It made more sense to get the real deal - which is this stuff. It&#x27;s also a great massaging oil. My knee was hurting after running so I put this on it, massaged my knee and leg and it feels back to normal now.     Shipping was cool too. It didn&#x27;t take too long. And I think they gave me a free sample of lemongrass lotion - because I definitely don&#x27;t remember ordering that.</li>
            <li> This seems to be an oil that can be used for many things (you have to love nature for it&#x27;s little miracles), but I purchased it in hopes it would help out my oily/acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 25, and have been dealing with breakouts since my teens. I have tried pretty much all OTC stuff (Salyctic Acid and Benzoyl Peroxide), Murad, Proactive (the last two made my skin worse, and I was on them for months), various forms of Tetracycline from my dermatologist, and nothing worked. Now that I&#x27;m older, I really don&#x27;t have acne anymore, but I still get blemishes from time to time, even cysts once in a while (those are a blast). I have been using the Alpha Hydrox line of skin care products, and while they have made a dramatic difference in my skin, it still didn&#x27;t solve my problems 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this Tee Tree oil for a couple of days now, but it is doing something amazing. I had three new blemishes coming through before I went to bed last night...I woke up today, and they were completely gone. Gone! It was such a cool feeling. There are no new ones forming either, because I dabbed the oil all over, not just on blemishes. If this keeps up, my skin will finally look great again. I now use a basic face wash, followed by the Alpha Hydrox line up of astringent, spot lightener, and 12% Souffle. I have now added the Tea Tree oil as my last step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome company too. Shipping was really fast (had it within three days), and a free gift was included. This stuff also smells great...would make a nice accompaniment in the bath, or with aromatherapy. Great product!</li>
            <li> this arrived in the mail four days after ordering which was earlier than expected. the quality is good and it even came with a free gift and a pamplet. i will definately buy from this seller again. :-)</li>
            <li> i like it. i use it for my acne. it could be bigger i thought it would be i guess i was dumb lol.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give a reveiw this early...but I bought the oil and hope it works.  I;m supposed to write 20 words, but I don&#x27;t have any more to add.</li>
            <li> what i said in the title- it&#x27;s small enough to carry in my purse for emergencies- I use a few drops on a cotton swab to treat occasional zits and it works very well-</li>
            <li> I love this. I used it on a keloid I had. It did make it go down a bit but I ended up getting surgery to remove it.</li>
            <li> This product is great! There are no pimples on my face and it&#x27;s healing my skin. The only problem is the smell. Very earthy and takes some getting used too.</li>
            <li> Weekly lid scrub with 50% TTO and daily lid scrub with tea tree shampoo is effective in eradicating ocular Demodex. Demodex mites, causes ocular surface inflammation, meibomian gland dysfunction, and lash abnormalities. Also helps to alergy people in rosacea treatment.  Thanks, excellent product.</li>
            <li> The product is outstanding!!!! After hearing about it from watching the Dr. Oz show, he said it would cure dandruff and fungal infection under the nails.  I went to amazon read the reviews and quickly purchased a bottle. Nothing else worked to heal my dry, burning scalp and face.  After one week of use my dandruff was gone my face cleared up and my infected nail is starting to heal.  Great seller and quick delivery too, I will purchase from him in the future. The sent is pungent but it was worth it to me.</li>
            <li> the oil came quickly through the mail, and a beautifully scented bar of soap was an added free bonus.  I would definately buy products from these folks again.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil should be in everyone&#x27;s medicine chest!  In it ESSENTIAL OIL form:   It takes away the itch of bug bites   Takes care of blemishes   Is anti-bacterial, anti-fungal--makes great natural antibacterial spray and hand gel   And lots more.     When using on the skin, it is best to use with a carrier oil..sweet almond oil works very well.     Tea tree essential oil is STRONG! A little goes a long way    I find the scent to be very clean, but very pine-y smelling.</li>
            <li> I was happy in the beginning, but after a month and a half this product losses its charm. The best thing I can recommend is go to a dermatologist. The medicine they prescribe are great and will heal acne in time. I understand that some people may not have insurance but to tell you the truth the medicines they prescribe are not too expensive (less than $25) and will last for months. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I tried this Tea Tree oil for my acne.  After reading some of the other reviews, I was hoping it would help to reduce blemishes.  I applied it twice every day to the inflamed areas and it did absolutely nothing. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I like to use (diluted) essential oils on my dreadlocks.  Tea tree oil is good because its antiseptic properties are good for the hair and scalp, and there isn&#x27;t a buildup later.  This product is easy to use, and a few drops mix well with water, setting lotion, or gel. Although I rotate the tea tree with other essential oils, this is definitely one that I will keep on the shelf.</li>
            <li> I used it for mold caused by a slow water pipe leak in the basement. It did the job nicely.  The downside is the aroma for a few days. What I really is that is is natural.</li>
            <li> I use this tea tree oil for my pimples and acne prob. this is 3rd day of using tea tree oil for my pimples and they are going away.!!! Thank you for a great product!!  and I also have flea prob. these days and I made flea spray water mixed with Tea tree oil,lemongrass oil,peppermint oil,and spearment oil for my carpet and bed(since they jump into my bed and bite me..lolI hate fleasssss!!)   and I even put fleas in the water its mixed with 5drops of tea tree oil today and they died with in 6-8seconds&#x3D;D  I love essential oils!!!</li>
            <li> I was using benzoyl peroxide for a while to help get rid of acne. For me, B.P. takes about 3 days to help open any clog pores so that I clean it and then let it heal, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for acne cyst. The tea tree oil helps to dry out the acne and helps it heal faster. It has a strong medicine smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. It wont help rid you of acne blemish or scars, but it does prevent new or recurring acnes from coming back, including this one annoying cyst on my chin that lasted for months. I&#x27;m so happy it&#x27;s gone for good. I&#x27;m down to half a bottle of Tea Tree oil now and will be buying more later.</li>
            <li> I like to rub this on my floss before I floss. Talk about an improvement in overall dental health, and it makes your whole mouth just feel fresher.</li>
            <li> I am so hapy with this purchase! It was affordable, it came by by THE VERY NEXT DAY on standard shipping. Very fast delivery. It came with a free little bottle of massage oil. Way cool! It glides right over skin and really helped with my breakouts. I personally like the smell, very woodsy, earthy, ect. Very awesome deal. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> This review is for the tea tree oil itself and it was delivered earlier than expected and was exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my acne which was very dissapointing because it did nothing. Tried it for my scalp since it is itchy, flaky, and have dandruff. What a pleasant surprise to find out that this helped my scalp! I have tried other shampoos specifically for my scalp which did nothing. The way I use it is to put some shampoo on the palm of my hand and put 1 to 2 drops of tea tree oil. This is now a staple for hair care.</li>
            <li> The item and the seller were just as hoped.  Fast, professional, and complete.  A pleasure to do business with and look forward to doing so without hesitation.</li>
            <li> At first i was apprehensive about putting oil on my skin since i have extremely oily/acne prone skin. I have a few pimples on my cheeks that hurt so much that sometimes i had to wake up in the middle of the night due to the pain i felt when i turned my face on the pillow. So i decided to give it a try and i order this and i have to say wow.... I applied a drop on a cotton swab directly to the pimples. At first you feel very tinglely but then i notice that my pimple didn&#x27;t hurt. next day the pinple was dry.. nothing has worked for me like this and i have tried everything. I guess is true what they say natural things are better. Now i use it a few times a week at night time i add 5 drops to my moisturizer mix it with my hands and apply it all over. I feel very fresh and i see how it has cleared my skin :) the smell is kind a strong but you will get use to it.  p.s shipping was very fast and they sent me lavender oil and an almond soap as a gift :)</li>
            <li> I used this product to treat my acne because of its antibacterial properties. I am very happy with how it reduces zits without redness.</li>
            <li> 100% tea tree oil is the BEST product ever for those with sensitive skin that are prone to breakouts. I am in my 30&#x27;s and have occasional break-outs but otherwise have clear skin. To prevent breakouts I mix 2 drops of the oil into my nighttime moisturizer and spread it on my face about 3 times a week. If it&#x27;s that time of month or I&#x27;ve changed make-up and can feel a pimple starting to form, I put a drop of the TTO onto a q-tip and dab it directly on the spot before going to bed... 99% of the time all traces of the pimple are gone in the morning. I have spent countless $$$ on creams, lotions, specified products to help with zits but this is the only thing that works for me.</li>
            <li> Bottle was soo small for the price I paid. I probably got 3 uses out of it. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy from you guys again.</li>
            <li> The product was as described.  I was very happy with and would buy from this dealer again.</li>
            <li> I had a breakout recently on my back and i have a lot of scarring. Im transitioning to natural products, and this i have to say i love. i use it for my scalp my skin... when i bathe i add a few drops into the tub. i just love it. as far as the healing goes.. IT WORKS . of course the changes wont happen overnight if you&#x27;re using it for scars, but it works. will i buy from this again? YES</li>
            <li> This product is great! I make my own Laundry soap and fabric softener and the tea tree oil works great in these!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I read it helps with scabies; which my family contracted from our dog! Be careful with that! Our vet kept diagnosing him with allergies, which allowed more time for us to hug him and have the mite attack us! Well, the doctor prescribed 5% Perm. which gave us the chills- it was so strong. I researched other less toxic alternatives and came up with tea tree oil as a possible cure.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the tea tree oil has helped get rid of the scabies, but it helps soothe your skin which is so important while you are experiecing the post scabies itch! It is so incredibly soothing. I mixed it with Johnson&#x27;s Baby Lotion for easier application, and it has helped clear up the scrapes from the scabies.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was incredibly fast. The bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and put in all of my shampoo and leave in conditioner for my daughter. She still got it at school. The only preventive is an everyday inspection.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;m very prone to bad scars and keloid bumps. As I just got a keloid where a piercing was, I started using this and it got rid of it pretty quickly. I&#x27;m using it on another scar and hopefully it works for that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is the smell. I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, and this one is terrible. It works though so I will continue to use it despite the fact that the smell makes me cringe.</li>
            <li> I love the tea tree oil from the moment it arrived in the mail. will reorder as i need it</li>
            <li> I use tea tree oil mixed with other hair products that I use every week.  This is a great product and gives the scalp a cool soothing feeling.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is GREAT Tea Tree Oil!  You can use it for so many things and this is 100% pure, cannot do better than this!!!</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil 100% (Essential Oil)  This product has gotten rid of my dandruff! Use it once a day, 50 drops on your head, forcefully massage scalp with flesh of the tip of your fingers (the part with your finger prints) and that&#x27;s it! Leave it there until the tingling sensation goes away (not painful, but can get very tingly depending on your situation). Will take 2 weeks max for you to see the difference (for me it was three days!).  Tea Tree Oil is good for PPP (gentlemen from age of 20 to 30 generally may suffer from PPP). For PPP treatment, use three times a day by applying oil on cotton swab (2-3 drops), then on affected area. Will take around a month but no side effects!  This also works for ACNE!! Stop buying unnatural products or drug prescriptions! Use on affected areas with cotton swab every day and you&#x27;ll see!! Give it 2 weeks to a month depending on your situation. Buy 100% Tea Tree Oil NOW!!!  Nature works miracles!!!</li>
            <li> product works as specified for the treatment of skin tags. I would recommend this product to anyone that has skin tags.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hair and have had it for over 2 years. Really strong stuff. I was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to treat/remove skintags from my underarms.  I would dab a bit on each tag and it took weeks of daily dabs to see a result.  One night I decided to just smear all over my underarms.  The next day I found a severe red rash/burn, which took a month to heal after burning, peeling, itching.  Once fully healed, I carefully dabbed on just the targets, but again awoke to full rash.  Obviously I caused myself a new sensitivity or allergic reaction to this oil.  Just beware.</li>
            <li> I love getting pierced but I have really sensitive skin. This is amazing for getting rid of keloids, it just takes a while.</li>
            <li> Using to clear up a hive out break on my face, it is helping</li>
            <li> I would buy it again...I had fungus from a salon and it&#x27;s getting rid of it. It&#x27;s a process but working.</li>
            <li> 100 % true tea tree oil. this company is vegan friendly YAY!&lt;br /&gt;the smell is VERY strong. I plan on putting 4 drops in my shampoo. which is the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method. shampoo is 1 Cup of filtered water, 1 tbs of baking soda. then for conditioner 1 cup filtered water and i tbs apple cider vinegar. the trick to the method is you have to DROP EVERYTHING YOU USE ON YOUR HAIR. Besides organic, natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason i got the tea tree oil is because it helps with itchy, flaky scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I rubbed some on my palm, then washed my hands about 10 minutes and my palm still has the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will be purchasing this in the future. its a small container but im positive its going to last me months.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  This is the 3rd bottle I have purchased.  Gave the first one away, the 2nd one I bought for my daughter....this one is for me.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> awesome product &amp; quick arrival</li>
            <li> Love the smell, a bit pricey but very good.  Bought it for my daughter to help treat dandruff.  It helped a bit but did not make it go away. Used this with dandruff shampoo, now it&#x27;s getting better.</li>
            <li> i rarely use any other over the counter medication any more for my acne. this bottle is really good. it helps any bumps that appears on face fade away without any irritation and dark marks. love it!</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is amazing. I initially bought this because I noticed my nail had a fungus. Took care of it with two a day applications.</li>
            <li> My daughter did not care for this.  It smells bad, and it also  seemed to make her condition much worse.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is a natural deodorant, insect repellant. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s other uses for it I have yet to learn. The smell is a bit strong but after a while you get used to it. Best of all it&#x27;s a natural product. I keep this little jar with me at home and when I travel.</li>
            <li> Incredibly fast shipping!  Also, thank you for the goodies!  About the product, I got it for acne, but have yet to see complete resolution of it.</li>
            <li> I have these bump on the back of my neck the are like lil cists and my doctor told me that the might have to pop them a drain them i did not have too. i rub this tea tree oil on them and they were gone. I have used this tea tree oil for many diffent things and it should be called amazing.</li>
            <li> First I must admit that I HATE the smell of tea tree, I always have, it makes me lightheaded if i use too much at once.  That why I gave it one less star.  However, this is a very useful oil.  I find it works well on cuts, and scrapes.  I have extremly sensitive skin as well as ezcema on my elbows, hands, legs, and I used to have it on my face.  I can&#x27;t use body lotions or products like benzoyl peroxide for pimples, I can&#x27;t even use antibiotic ointments or antibacterial hand soups.  But i CAN use tea tree.  It effectivly keeps the cut or abrasion clean, I don&#x27;t break out in a rash afterwards, and it doesn&#x27;t upset the ezcema.     I am very happy with the quality of this brand.  it works great for me.</li>
            <li> This product arrived tightly bubble wrapped inside of a sealed envelope however that was not enough to prevent over half of it from spilling out. :-( I will not order from this seller again for obvious reasons.</li>
            <li> worked well for my scalp just didn&amp;#34;t last long</li>
            <li> I initially bought this tea tree oil to treat the acne  on my skin. I can&#x27;t remember where, but I read that tea tree oil was great for that. Well, very wrong, it actually made my acne worst. But then I read that it helps with infections, so maybe that&#x27;s why someone thought that it would help my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an infected ingrown toe nail for a number of years. I kept going to the doctor to get it pull, they would have me take pills to fight the infection. It pretty much looked like a red swollen bump on the side of my toe where my ingrown toe nail was. At times it would bleed. I was suffering from this for over 7 years! I finally decided to add tea tree oil to the infected part and I have to say that this magical product worked like pure magic. within a week I could see the difference and its been about 3-4 years since I&#x27;ve suffered from ingrown toe nails!!! I&#x27;m not kidding, I didn&#x27;t even had to go to the doctor, the nail just pushed out of the infected area and I haven&#x27;t had issues with this at all ever since.</li>
            <li> I bought this to spot treat acne after reading reviews. I am a black woman with acne prone combination skin. It works well to stop a forming pimple. Although my face get oily through the day, it&#x27;s very dry when I first wash it so I mix a few drops with my moisturizer. My only issue with it pertaining to my particular experience is if I put it on a white head, it likely turns it into a blackhead. I have never dealt with blackheads so I don&#x27;t know how to get rid of them so I think I will just be sure to use it a pimple that&#x27;s forming or to heal one.</li>
            <li> It came ontime, in the condition it should come in. It smells great and is definitely working on a few different medical issues (nothing serious) my family had!</li>
            <li> Packaging and delivery was great, and as far as I can tell the product itself is also great! Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li> Hubby and I both look forward to this oil in bed at night time it helps us to Sleep and relaxes our mind from the hustle of the day.</li>
            <li> Smells stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li> excellent product. exactly what i wanted, i used it for a mask and added a few drops to the clay powder and filtered water. great for acne a little drying, don&#x27;t use too much may cause  irritation</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Nice small bottle which is good because you won&#x27;t need a lot of it. I use it for a base oil to mix with another product.</li>
            <li> Perfect Tea Tree. Cleared up an infection on my daughter&#x27;s scalp in 3 days!</li>
            <li> Good Value ! Tea Tree Oil is 100% and it came with 100% potency. Product as described and I received my purchase quickly.</li>
            <li> A lot of people use this for acne, It works pretty good. But I think there&#x27;s a lot more simple things you can do, that won&#x27;t dry up your face like this does. But as far as quality it&#x27;s very good I also really like the company, they sent me a hand written thank you note and a free bar of lemon grass soap. I was really impressed with the note.</li>
            <li> So far I have found two uses for this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Centipede Repellent&lt;br /&gt;My house started to get a lot of centipedes - I would see one almost everyday.. I know disgusting. I found that apparently they don&#x27;t like the smell of Tea Tree Oil so what I did was mix about 10 drops of this with water and put it in a spray. I then sprayed down my doors and windows and so far no centipedes. I do the spraying once every week or two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Red Bumps on Face&lt;br /&gt;I had red bumps on the side of my nose that would NOT go away. So I put some drops on a bandaid and I put it right on the bump for several nights and one day I just noticed it was gone. I think it took 1 week. Try this if you have tried everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it! It smells pretty strong, but it&#x27;s not a bad smell and I actually like the smell now. I will probably find more uses for this and I will update. :]</li>
            <li> I use a couple drops with witch hazel as a toner. Love this oil! I&#x27;ve tried different brands but this is by far the best quality. Others, that I have tried, have an odd rancid tire rubber smell. This is the only brand I will buy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I was having hormonal acne issues and read somewhere that tea tree oil can help. At this price, it was well worth the purchase. It truly helped my skin and I love the smell. It also last a very long time.</li>
            <li> works well to stop the zit right at the first sign of acne if applied right away. However, I would recommend diluting it with water, it&#x27;s very strong and concentrated if used by itself. It irritated my skin a lot at first when I was using it without diluting it. It dries the area a lot and caused me to have more white heads on the surrounding skin, but after I mixed it with a few drops of water, i doesn&#x27;t bother my skin too much. it still dries the area a lot but if used daily on the zit, it minimizes the zit from becoming too cystic and painful.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the stink to use this product longer than a couple days.  Waste of money.  My sister bought the stuff advertised on TV and had the same experience.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for many things. One being small cuts. For that it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;About the smell, my cat runs whenever I open the bottle. I kinda like the&lt;br /&gt;smell to it but not Bibble the cat.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is the best thing that has happened to my acne prone skin. I dab a few drops on the areas where pimples are starting to form and it will gradually shrink the pimples away. It does sting a little bit to the point where my eyes start to tear so its best to mix it with a bit of water. I also try to use it minimally because my skin will get use to the product and it becomes less effective (just like all products). But boy, my first day of use really cleared my skin within a week and I was amazed. My advice is to stick to the natural products so that your skin can recover naturally and beautifully.</li>
            <li> I got this because I&#x27;ve been breaking out badly around my chin and mouth, and I&#x27;ve heard great things about tea tree oil. I put some of this on a cotton ball and dabbed it on the problem areas for the past week, but I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. In fact, it looks like its taking longer for acne to heal. I&#x27;m going to try to use it for other purposes, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t do anything for the acne, which is the primary reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING product. Works for warts and acne for me! If you have warts like I did, you have to keep rubbing it on there with a cotton swab and then put a bandaid on it, so it can be absorbed on the wart. I cut the sides of the bandaid off and cut that into 3 more pieces so I had about 6 strips of bandaid tape from one bandaid and didn&#x27;t use the middle cotton part. I would apply a bit of the tea tree oil, let it dry and put on a strip of that bandaid, which stuck on through out the day on the palm of my hand. You have to let the oil dry, which it does pretty quick and then just put the bandaid on.   I would soak my hands in water twice a day, apply the oil, rub it with the cotton swab and apply a bandaid. Every week I would use a nail filer to rub down the dead skin on the wart and it worked like a charm!! You have to keep at it, applying it everyday and cover it. I had 4 warts, now I have none. This stuff smells strong but the smell goes away once its dry.   For acne I just put a drop of this on the palm of my hand and about 5-10 drops of almond oil that I had and applied it to my face everyday before sleeping. You have to use oil that us permeable through your skin, so you can&#x27;t use baby oil or vaseline, etc. I have had about 2 small pimples in the past 2 months which were totally unnoticeable. This stuff comes in a little bottle and if you don&#x27;t waste it, it will last you a long time and is very cheap compared to some other stuff you have to try for warts and acne. Thank You Tea tree oil and Australia (where its from). Just make sure to keep it away from pets or kids, because a 5ml dose is enough to kill small pets and induce vomiting or even kill small pets/kids. GOOD LUCK. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> this product is as exactly as advertised, it arrived on time and in good condition, i would recommend this seller</li>
            <li> It removed skin tags (moles) by shrinking them painlessly.  I bought a second bottle  to send to my granddaughter&#x27;s mother.</li>
            <li> This tea tree oil is great.  May not smell as good as some but does&lt;br /&gt;what it is meant to do.  Very beneful for many aliments</li>
            <li> I carry this stuff around with me for camping trips. I was surprised to find out that this stuff works exceptionally well in reducing the swelling of mosquito bites. I got bitten by 4 mosquitos and I applied the tea tree oil to 2 of them, while leaving the other two untouched. The swelling was down already within just 2 hours and the itching had gone away on the ones I applied the oil to. The untouched bites were very itchy, and still present when I woke up the next day.</li>
            <li> I heard about tea tree oil removing skin tags on the Internet, and the more I read the more I thought I should try it.  The reviews for the TV advertised Tag Away were really bad, so I knew I wanted to go with tea tree oil.  I decided to try it on only one tag to start, and after 3 weeks, it fell off and is now gone.  I am very pleased and will be buying another bottle.  I won&#x27;t lie about the fact that the scent is quite strong, but if I have to smell a little like Pine Sol to get rid of these things, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Bought this after researching for something for hard thick nails.  Worked well just have to keep it up longer.  Only con is that it is strong smelling and smell last awhile.  I would recommend putting it on at night.</li>
            <li> I first discovered tea tree oil when I got my belly button pierced. A bump grew on the piercing and when I went to the guy who did it he suggested I try tea tree oil. The first day I applied the oil I noticed a huge difference the next day. The bump and shrunk almost double in size. I keep using it and my belly button ring hole healed up within a week or two. This stuff is truly amazing I have used it on acne and it works too. The smell is very very strong but I rather smell the odor than deal with ugly acne and bumps. This product really works!</li>
            <li> I find this product to be very soothing and works well as advertised. Good smell too, very herbal, a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> This brand is great and much better than other brands I purchased. Multi purpose. Need larger size. Defiitely buying again.</li>
            <li> I had a really bad rash that all medicine the doctor prescribed wouldn&#x27;t take care of. The doctor didn&#x27;t know what was causing it. The labs they took kept showing up negative. I decided to take the holistic route and try tea tree oil because I read it has anti-bacterial/viral/fungal properties. It slowly healed within a few weeks! Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> It does what it says! No complains at all, the smell is strong, I will advise to apply it outdoors! for sure!</li>
            <li> Needs useful product usage.</li>
            <li> Very good, the service is very good also</li>
            <li> Perfect for protection from mold</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed.....</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as in cleaning my vinyl fence. A source told me it would prevent/remove mold and mildew. It worked perfectly. I took the precaution of wearing protective glove. The other additives in my water solution were soap and white vinegar. All are biodegradable--another desirable feature.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product, works like magic when treating acne. I personally dont have a problem with the scent although it&#x27;s quite strong. My only complaint is its lack of dropper, I&#x27;m not sure if I received a defected one but I would rate this 4 stars since it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get the oil out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It smells awful, but it really does work!! I recommend this to others if you can tolerate strong smells.</li>
            <li> Did not get desired effect from using oil to remove moles,saw no difference in size or appearance of moles after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Too strong of a smell and in such small bottle.</li>
            <li> Bought this to mix with shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I read some things online that states that Tea Tree oil is good for pimples.... I thought, well let me give it a try. I applied this stuff to a large, painful pimple and by morning it had decreased in size by more than half. It did not get rid of it... but when I say the thing was the size of my chin.... and by morning all redness and swelling was gone - I mean it!!</li>
            <li> I tried everything that I could for back acne (neutrogena pink grapefruit body wash, skin detox tea, tanning sessions, 2 liters or more of water per day, vitamin A supplements...) and improvements to my skin were just minor.  I was desperate and I decided to give this oil a try.  I know that I am supposed to dilute with water or mix with some cream but I needed fast results.  I saturated a qtip with oil and I started to apply to all areas that required attention on my back.  The scent is strong but I actually like it.  I obtained great results in one week!  I am very pleased and I will continue to purchase this product.  As you apply the oil it does tingle your skin slightly.  I used it every day for the first week and now I am using it every other day or 3 times per week - even my left over scars are starting to decrease in size.  I do not write reviews but this is worth my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and the product arrived as promised.  I highly recommend this oil but be careful if your skin is very sensitive - I was willing to take the risk and apply it to my skin in pure form without mixing it.  Thank you amazon, thank you to the company distributing this product and thank you NATURE!</li>
            <li> This was a great natural way to rid my son of the lumps and bumps on his arms. And my son loved the smell. The smell reminds me of moss.</li>
            <li> There are so many products like this out there. This one did not make any difference in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> This s*** stank.  It does not repel bugs away.  if anything it attracts them.  it does work on bumps and insect bites.  even pimples.  only if you use it in small amounts, thin layers.  It has really helped clear up my facial acne.  And lighted up my face</li>
            <li> It is great. I use it on my cuts and it doesn&#x27;t burn nor sting like alcohol or peroxide.</li>
            <li> Even a very small amount burned the cat&#x27;s sore places, even when mixed in baby shampoo, this was my sister&#x27;s idea of a natural cure. Threw it away.</li>
            <li> Great tea tree oil. Smells strong and works well for healing. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> The product works, but it smells awful, but I needed it, for the treatment of my hair loss. I used it two times and is already works: I have less hair loss today.</li>
            <li> I am a chronic problem with athlete&#x27;s foot.  This is helping me manage the itch well. I am also using a powder spray.</li>
            <li> I was a little weary after reading some reviews of chemical burns on face after usage of tea tree oil, but this product works as described, no burns as a 100 percent natural, has a little smell but you get used to it after a few uses. Cleared any trouble spots I put it on, even if just a red mark. When bottle is finished I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> There are so many uses for this product, do the research and see for yourself! The price is great for this product as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help control acne.  I just mixed it with some water and apply it to my face nightly.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and its been working well so far.  People commented on the smell but I dont think it&#x27;s that bad, and its gone once the oil dries.  So much better than all those typical acne products.  It&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I received a bottle that looks different from the one shown in the picture.. Though it smells like tea tree..I feel like its dodgy..</li>
            <li> I wish that I had known about this years ago.  It is wonderful for anything that has to do with your skin.  I even used it to remove a skin tag and IT REALLY DID WORK.  That is not what it is for but it worked for me.</li>
            <li> after reading about so many good uses for tea tree oil, and how it&#x27;s supposed to help acne, i thought i would order this. first off--the smell is very strong. eucalyptic in nature. my 8 year old is grossed out by it, but i&#x27;m not. it has not done anything for my acne so far, and i have been religiously applying it to my chin pimples. nothing bad has happened, but nothing good. i have applied it directly. a little goes a LONG way. what it did for for...was to remove a small skin tag on the side of my neck, near my shoulder. i applied a drop on a q-tip a few times a day. in about a week or so, the booger fell off. that was nice, but i&#x27;m more interested in it helping my acne.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is useful in more ways that I even thought.  Works great for cleaning infected areas.  I also used a small amount of this on my toothbrush to help with bleeding gums and it worked wonders.  A natural product with many uses!</li>
            <li> This product is all natural essential oil, smells great! I use it for massages, and for pedicure, (great for pimples), and the best thing is it&#x27;s great smell and relaxing sensation.</li>
            <li> Before i bought the product, i read reviews from different websites. I was very confident with time my scars would heal. I diluted the oil because thats what most reviews recommended. I used it for the first time overnight... I woke up with acne all over my face. I barely dabbed the oil with a cotton swab over my scars and woke up to a nightmare. My face looks horrible... Im very disappointed. I was really hoping for improvements.</li>
            <li> I bought this last July for a condition but by the time I received it I couldn&#x27;t find notes on what I&#x27;d planned to use it for.  I then just used drops of it in my laundry, but not much else.  Until a couple of days ago for a rash I believe I got from hair dye.  My oh my does it SOOTHE.  It&#x27;s only the second day but seems like it&#x27;s healing the rash (which tea tree oil can do). :-D  When I put it on and was therefore also inhaling it, I got the added bonus of my chest clearing up so that I could breathe (I had an asthma episode just before applying it to the rash).  I applied it directly to the skin by putting drops on my fingers and rubbing the first night, then today I mixed it with water and sprayed it through parts and onto my scalp and effected ear.  Sweet (though it was better straight, I just don&#x27;t want to waste it).  I&#x27;d forgotten the various things it&#x27;s good for, including inhalation (I bought a VapoSteam Inhaler this year so I plan to use the oil in it next time), acne  (as another reviewer wrote), etc.  The oil is great, authentic, and I&#x27;ve had no adverse side effects.  I will buy again (in fact, I logged on now just to reorder while I still have some, so that I won&#x27;t run out).</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of dandruff shampoos. From Neutrogena to Selsum Blue to Medical Grade by prescription only stuff. This Tee Tree oil is AMAZING. Two days of applying it and my scalp looks amazing and dandruff free. This product is worth every penny twice over. All natural. Perfect. Buy it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is simply amazing. It works in so many ways. It&#x27;s an antiseptic, an antibacterial and an anti-fungal. I&#x27;ve also been using it as a spot treatment for acne blemishes and I swear in one day the inflammation is noticeably lesser! I&#x27;d heard so many positive things about tea tree oil and I&#x27;m happy to say that my experience has been the same. I won&#x27;t be without it now.</li>
            <li> Love this product !! It works great, although the aroma is very strong. But it doesn&#x27;t take much, just a small amount will get the job done.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product to anyone who uses essential oils frequently. i am in massage therapy school and have been playing with E oils in my baths, carrier oils and more. Really good for the price!</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks, I use it for dandruff, put  few drops in a 4 ounce bottle, on my wounds, on my toes: I run 7 miles 4-5 times a week and often have toe problems so this stuff clears my toes up and my bruises on my feet. I love teatree.</li>
            <li> Okay first off, within the first day of using this on my nails they were shiny and stronger, now after about a week and a half they are better than ever... even hair skin  and nails supplements haven&#x27;t given me close to the results this stuff has! I massage this on my scalp to stimulate the hair follicles. I put it on my eyebrows to promote hair growth there as well. The other day I had a rash on my arms and applied this and it put a stop to itching. Its also great to use to reduce keloid scarring on peircings! I use it so often that I bought a bigger cheaper bottle at wallmart for a little over two bucks and it works just as well! It serves so many purposes, probably way more than what I&#x27;ve mentioned here :) I&#x27;ve told a bunch of people about it and everyone loves it, all have had amazing results just like me!!</li>
            <li> I like putting Tea Tree Oil on my problem areas when my face decides it wants to break out. It keeps the redness gone and any kind of bump smooth. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing it more and more for me and my family they all love it and we will get a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well for dandreff.</li>
            <li> This oil comes in a great dispence bottle and is very aromatic. I will be able to make this oil go a long way.</li>
            <li> Came quick and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> would buy again if needed</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t got to use it much but I hear its great for toenail fungus.  Sure hope so.  It smells like melalueca products tho lol.  Eww.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small bottle of this to try out to see what all the hype was about it was the perfect trial size</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pure tea tree oil. Good for cleaning a wound or for an acne pimple. Lots of uses. The prices is great and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> i use it in the spa and sower/steam room. I love all of the aroma oils and these are not exeption. I use it on pimples and ocational brackeouts and it comes it down. I love this oil, and my routine would not be complete with out. I also use it to sanitize staff.</li>
            <li> Helped me get rid of my hypergranulation tissue on my belly piercing! While it does not have the most appealing smell, it does wonders to treat the body.</li>
            <li> Arrived wayyyyy earlier than expected...really great product..just a Tadd bit smaller than I expected but definitely worth the buy👍</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I believe it will be an antibiotic I will keep around the house from now on.</li>
            <li> I brought to help out with skin ailments. I get &#x27;sun rashes&#x27; and wanted something to help heal the rash and ease the itch. Not exactly a silver bullet, but I feel it has helped tremendously. Soooo stinky, but worth it.</li>
            <li> This is great to add into your home made  haircare products. I wish the bottle was a little bigger but it doesnt take much because its pure. Would definately reorder.</li>
            <li> I kept buying this product for my wife after her pregnancy because she wanted to get rid of her stretch marks.  It was pricey, had a very strong smell and after many bottles, never really got rid of anything.  She was very disappointed and it was quite a bit of money down the drain</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and well packaged. The product seems to be efficient so far, I use it on my face, mixed with my night and day cream.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil is not one you buy for the pleasant smell, but it is very useful. I remember learning at our family reunions every summer that my cousins used it for their blemishes. Our grandmother had some in her bathroom cupboard, so out of curiosity, I took out her tea tree oil to smell it. I still remember the intensity of the initial whiff.  The smell grows on you though, and it does seem to work on one&#x27;s skin pretty well. This product in particular seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> I HAD LYMPH NODES REMOVED DURING A CANCER ISSUE.  CUTS AND SCRAPS DO NOT HEAL AS QUICKLY AND THE TEA TREE OIL DEFINATELY PROMOTES HEALING.  WOULD NOT BE WITHOUT IT.</li>
            <li> bought it but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as i expected</li>
            <li> I have to tell you that this product has worked very well, on some skin abrasions that my husband had sustained. He has been applying the oil directly to the area. But only in small amounts since larger can cause severe allergic reactions, or burns. The Tea Tree Oil, has actually sped up the healing process, We are both amazed at how the wound has been healing. This is a must that should be in everyone&#x27;s medicine cabinet. This oil should not be used however if you have a deep wound, that should be attended to by a Doctor. But it does a great job on bites, acne or fungal infections. As well as being a antibacterial agent.I have nothing but praise for this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for oily skin. Just make sure and dilute it with water to avoid burning your skin.</li>
            <li> Purchased it for a specific reason.. Didn&#x27;t fulfill my expectations but not necessarily the fault of the product. Generally though I like it.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that there is no expiration date on the bottle which I have found on other bottles sold by other sellers and this stuff does not seem to be as effective if it is used past its expired time.</li>
    </ol>
