            <li>There are better lip stains out there</li>

            <li>I had more diffculties with the packaging more then anything else.</li>
            <li>AND they&#x27;re cheap!</li>
            <li>The tint doesnt adhere well to teeth and won&#x27;t stain them like most lipstick does.</li>
            <li>I really love this color and am thinking about buying the orange one now.</li>

            <li>I love this product, it has great pigmentation and is very moisturizing.</li>

            <li>The color is great and the price even with the shipping is terrific.  </li>

            <li>Not bad, but not a selling point.</li>
            <li>Beautiful pink color, smells like grape medicine (but fades very fast so dont worry) and lasts AGES.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to obtain a beautiful classic red lip look so</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a fun one time purchase.</li>
            <li>but this as a fun</li>
            <li>but this as a fun</li>
            <li>I got this mainly because I love the tiny kitty top</li>
            <li>In bright light and pictures it appears as more of a dark pink tint.</li>
            <li>I have worn a lot of different stains through out the years and this is the best for the price hands down!</li>
            <li>: This adorable lip stain came in two weeks earlier than the estimated delivery!</li>
            <li>Packaging is simple and cute, but plastic.</li>
            <li>It gives off a pretty reddish-pinkish color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely purchase other colors as they&#x27;re nice</li>
            <li>Which is okay, but the new one has a cute cat design on the black part of the applicator?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply it and let it dry and then put over a layer of lip gloss or balm, or a very light lipstick</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used one that&#x27;s stayed on this long before I love it</li>
            <li>I have both Cherry Pink and Red and both of them are just amazing!</li>
            <li>When it finishes, I will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely color, I got Cherry Pink.</li>
            <li>This stain really stays on without drying your lips.  </li>
            <li>It took a total of three weeks to get here but the waiting was worth it!</li>
            <li>My lips gets really dry and chapped easily</li>
            <li>While cute this stuff is not fun to use sometimes.</li>
            <li>Wow, I really like it!</li>
            <li>I find the stain to be particularly runny and accidentally getting a taste of this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this particular TonyMoly product again.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, this might not work for you as it has a very chemically aroma.</li>
            <li>It left a very nice and subtle but noticeable stain.</li>
            <li>and I have tried other tonymoly products , I love all their products I&#x27;ve purchased so far, this lip stain has stayed on all day, its a vibrant red pink, I put it on this morning and its still on now after eating and drinking and applying chapstick on top throughout the day ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>and it last whole day better than other lipsticks.</li>
            <li>The tint is also very pigmented for my lips too, it&#x27;s such a nice color that I practically wear it everyday!</li>
            <li>The color payoff was great along with the staying power, but be warned it does dry out your lips really bad so make sure to exfoliate your lips the day before.</li>
            <li>at first I&#x27;m curious about the looks,color and how it will moisture my lips,but I&#x27;m amazed about hot</li>
            <li>Received this item at a cute little box!</li>
            <li>I love red lips and this stain does not let down in that department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons.</li>
            <li>The color is very concentrated and applies easily, just a few dabs is enough.</li>
            <li>I always put a clear lip gloss over, or your lips will look dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>only problem is the stains a bit much for my lips.</li>
            <li>This is highly recommended if you want the same effect!</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful; the only problem is for application : not easy because the applicator is too big and the tint is so strong that if you mess with it, it&#x27;s impossible to clean.</li>
            <li>It really does stay all day long!</li>
            <li>picture is different then the packaging, they show you the old packaging.</li>
            <li>although the word pink is in its name this tint is much closer to a shade of red when viewed in real life and average lighting.</li>
            <li>I feel in love with the packaging of this lip stain and read several reviews on different make up blogs before committing to this purchase as I am a bit of a stinge when it comes to buying unnecessary make up</li>
            <li>At first it was a bit hard because I didn&#x27;t know that you have to leave it almost dry to put it on, but after that I really like it. ^_^</li>
            <li>color is rich and subtle.</li>
            <li>but i had a weird almost sticky feeling, but then that feeling disappeared quickly, and it dries fast on your lip.</li>

            <li> I suggest exfoliating your lips before because it accentuates dry flakes apparently, but it&#x27;s a stain, of course it&#x27;s going to do that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely is long lasting.</li>
            <li> The color is relatively long lasting, it stays on even when you touch/lick your lips and doesn&#x27;t smear once it dries.</li>
            <li> and I bet it will last a very long time as u dont have to apply it but one time a day !</li>
            <li> dry the lips a bit.</li>
            <li> As in \\&quot;why are my lips so dry and chapped</li>
            <li> It does clings to the dry patches on my lips</li>
            <li> Maybe this is just a odd coincidence but seeing as the lip stain is the only change to my routine</li>
            <li> tint itself is very runny and thin.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when eating or drinking though because it will rub off and look patchy so it&#x27;ll need to be reapplied or removed altogether.</li>
            <li> and i just cant tolerate the bitter taste of it.</li>
            <li> When I say considerably I mean considerably.</li>
            <li> tony tint #3 Orange Chacha* which i ordered from other seller-- which has a bitter taste/smell</li>
            <li> I adore this and will buy it again soon once I run out, and I will probably buy the other tints as well.</li>
            <li> I also have my concerns about carrying it in my purse or clutch due to its consistency.</li>
            <li> is not fun.</li>
            <li> I use a little applicator instead.&lt;br /&gt;May</li>
            <li> I choose to dab a little on my lips or do the Korean Gradient style with this  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that sometimes it does get in my mouth and it leaves such an awful bitter taste, but it&#x27;s to be expected so be careful when applying it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has dried my lips out considerably with three days of moderate use even with using a moisturizing lip balm as a base before applying.</li>
            <li> But a small amount goes along way.</li>
            <li> I applied a small amount, spread it over my lips and waited a bit and blotted off the excess.</li>
            <li> it DOESN&#x27;T dried out my lips!</li>

            <li> Beautiful pink color, smells like grape medicine (but fades very fast so dont worry) and lasts AGES. im still wearing it and I applied it yesterday with no touch ups.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful; the only problem is for application : not easy because the applicator is too big and the tint is so strong that if you mess with it, it&#x27;s impossible to clean. I use a little applicator instead.&lt;br /&gt;May dry the lips a bit.</li>
            <li> The container is so cute! The tint is also very pigmented for my lips too, it&#x27;s such a nice color that I practically wear it everyday! My lips look so cute and it lasts all day!

            <li> I feel in love with the packaging of this lip stain and read several reviews on different make up blogs before committing to this purchase as I am a bit of a stinge when it comes to buying unnecessary make up items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros: This adorable lip stain came in two weeks earlier than the estimated delivery! It also came with some wonderful samples of other TonyMoly products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely is long lasting. I was so excited to have this lip stain that I tried it out before going to bed and woke up with the color holding well. I wore it out and only had to reapply once after eating and having coffee. The color holds and won&#x27;t bleed onto cups from my experience so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is rich and subtle. I love red lips and this stain does not let down in that department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons. While cute this stuff is not fun to use sometimes. I find the stain to be particularly runny and accidentally getting a taste of this is not fun. I also have my concerns about carrying it in my purse or clutch due to its consistency. The packaging has integrity as it shipped all the way from South Korea with out dripping a drop but I still have my concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has dried my lips out considerably with three days of moderate use even with using a moisturizing lip balm as a base before applying. When I say considerably I mean considerably. As in \\&quot;why are my lips so dry and chapped it is mother flipping summer and I apply lip balm religiously\\&quot; I had to use a moisturizing lip scrub remedy I found on Pintrest in order to return my lips to a semi repaired state. Maybe this is just a odd coincidence but seeing as the lip stain is the only change to my routine it seems to be the obvious culprit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a fun one time purchase. It doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to obtain a beautiful classic red lip look so the chances of me running out anytime soon are slim. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this particular TonyMoly product again. There are better lip stains out there but this as a fun one time treat is something I don&#x27;t regret.lip stains out there but this as a fun one time treat is something I don&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> I bought this only about a week ago? Somewhere close and they said I wouldn&#x27;t get it until AFTER Christmas, and it came in a couple days ago, which make me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture is different then the packaging, they show you the old packaging. Which is okay, but the new one has a cute cat design on the black part of the applicator?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tint itself is very runny and thin. But a small amount goes along way. The color is beautiful. If you want a &amp;#34;Ulzzang&amp;#34; lip gradient. It&#x27;s perfect. It takes a couple times to get down, but it works perfectly. Or just an over all lip stain/tint look it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only concern i have is, for me, on my lips it felt, i don&#x27;t want to say sticky, but i had a weird almost sticky feeling, but then that feeling disappeared quickly, and it dries fast on your lip. I always put a clear lip gloss over, or your lips will look dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But over all , this is my favorite lip tint &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I got this mainly because I love the tiny kitty top and I have tried other tonymoly products , I love all their products I&#x27;ve purchased so far, this lip stain has stayed on all day, its a vibrant red pink, I put it on this morning and its still on now after eating and drinking and applying chapstick on top throughout the day ðŸ˜Š I&#x27;ve never used one that&#x27;s stayed on this long before I love it and I bet it will last a very long time as u dont have to apply it but one time a day !</li>
            <li> The seller was great, I had no complications and the shipping was very fast it only took around 4~5 days. The product it self was alright. I had more diffculties with the packaging more then anything else. The product started to leak out of the container and the product isn&#x27;t something one should carry around in their purse because of the packaging. The color payoff was great along with the staying power, but be warned it does dry out your lips really bad so make sure to exfoliate your lips the day before.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot as I like lip color, but not the heaviness of lipstick. The ONLY thing I would change about it is the smell. If you&#x27;re sensitive to smells, this might not work for you as it has a very chemically aroma. It&#x27;s a lovely color, I got Cherry Pink. I applied a small amount, spread it over my lips and waited a bit and blotted off the excess. It left a very nice and subtle but noticeable stain. I suggest exfoliating your lips before because it accentuates dry flakes apparently, but it&#x27;s a stain, of course it&#x27;s going to do that. Packaging is simple and cute, but plastic. Not bad, but not a selling point. I&#x27;ll most likely purchase other colors as they&#x27;re nice AND they&#x27;re cheap!</li>
            <li> This stain really stays on without drying your lips.  The color is great and the price even with the shipping is terrific.  I have worn a lot of different stains through out the years and this is the best for the price hands down!</li>
            <li> good product! quick delivery, and cute packaging! only problem is the stains a bit much for my lips. but it would be great for a friend..</li>
            <li> Wow, I really like it! It took a total of three weeks to get here but the waiting was worth it! It gives off a pretty reddish-pinkish color. I choose to dab a little on my lips or do the Korean Gradient style with this  The below photo is how it looks on me</li>
            <li> although the word pink is in its name this tint is much closer to a shade of red when viewed in real life and average lighting. In bright light and pictures it appears as more of a dark pink tint. The color is very concentrated and applies easily, just a few dabs is enough. The tint doesnt adhere well to teeth and won&#x27;t stain them like most lipstick does. The color is relatively long lasting, it stays on even when you touch/lick your lips and doesn&#x27;t smear once it dries. Just be careful when eating or drinking though because it will rub off and look patchy so it&#x27;ll need to be reapplied or removed altogether. It smells and tastes great too.</li>
            <li> I found this tint after seeing some posts on Instagram and was drawn to the cute packaging! But after reading that the formulation was changed and that it contains jojoba oil, I had to try it. I really love this color and am thinking about buying the orange one now. The tint lasts, the applicator is a great design (more wider and flat vs U.S. style applicator tips) and the color is awesome. I&#x27;m Asian but it would go well on a variety of skin tones.</li>
            <li> I love Tony Moly tony tint. I have both Cherry Pink and Red and both of them are just amazing! Just one dip and glide and I&#x27;m good to go! It really does stay all day long! I apply it and let it dry and then put over a layer of lip gloss or balm, or a very light lipstick and that&#x27;s it. I love how I can reapply the lipstick or gloss over and over without having to reapply the tint. It just stays there!!! This is highly recommended if you want the same effect!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the best lip tint of my life!!!! When it finishes, I will certainly buy again. I loved all colors!</li>
            <li> Received this item at a cute little box! I&#x27;m so happy as i receive it and tried it on my lips! at first I&#x27;m curious about the looks,color and how it will moisture my lips,but I&#x27;m amazed about hot it DOESN&#x27;T dried out my lips! It has also a cute,yummy smell! (yes! it is!) I can fully compare it to my purchased TONYMOLY Catchu Wink tony tint #3 Orange Chacha* which i ordered from other seller-- which has a bitter taste/smell and it DRIES OUT my lips,but it has a nice orange tint!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning to order again to this seller coz she has a nice service,which she include some 2 Skinfood sachet samples on my order. I&#x27;m writing this review because I just want to help you guys on what will you expect on this liptint and just want you to know that I&#x27;m not paid to do a review or i didnt receive any bribe to write this review! Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> My lips gets really dry and chapped easily that&#x27;s probably why this one didn&#x27;t work for me.It does clings to the dry patches on my lips and i just cant tolerate the bitter taste of it.I have to throw mine out coz i dont see myself using it anymore.</li>
            <li> It smells like cherries!! I love this product, it has great pigmentation and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> At first it was a bit hard because I didn&#x27;t know that you have to leave it almost dry to put it on, but after that I really like it. ^_^</li>
