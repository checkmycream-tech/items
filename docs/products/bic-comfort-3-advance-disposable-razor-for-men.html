    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Buy from BIC, since they are the best!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>One of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Closest and smoothest shave ever-&lt;br</li>
            <li>These razors are an excellent choice for removing facehair.</li>
            <li>My husband loves these, very good razor.</li>
            <li>Great razors, best disposable ever.</li>
            <li>lol.    </li>
            <li>so I was happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>Great razors that you can&#x27;t find in any store anymore.  </li>
            <li>great razor, great price</li>
            <li>legs love this razor, thank you!!</li>
            <li>Good shave, great handle, recommended.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands but feel that this company&#x27;s quality is excellent and I&#x27;ve used this brand all my life.  </li>
            <li>Product came as delivered-quality strong-I am thrilled and plan on buying again!</li>
            <li>The shave you get is really smooth, perfect if you like to shave your legs.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>i love these razors they did a great job on my head</li>
            <li>The seller was amazing.</li>
            <li>These work great, and give me a nice clean shave with no problems.</li>
            <li>Great product and price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Good deal and easy to order through Amazon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better, to be honest.</li>
            <li>These are very cheap, and they don&#x27;t shave that well</li>
            <li>but they are disposable razors what more can I say</li>
            <li>Cuts my face more than my beard.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li>Love this razor, just wish they sold the blades alone, since the heads are removable/replaceable.  </li>
            <li>Shave much better than the blades that bounce all over the place</li>
            <li>My husband has tested out many electronic and hand razors.</li>
            <li>He loves this razor and has asked for more.</li>
            <li>Still, I wish I had paid more for slightly better razors.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try this product, which was a bit more affordable.  </li>
            <li>LOVE them.  </li>
            <li>(Men&#x27;s razors always work better than women&#x27;s I have found).  </li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>These were ok.</li>
            <li>A Mach 3 would have been much better.</li>
            <li>hardly fitting my needs inasmuch as one of those lasts about 4 days for me.</li>
            <li>As good as many higher priced razors.  </li>
            <li>These razors are pretty good for the money.</li>
            <li>Considering I am shaving my entire head and face it ends up being a very good bargin.</li>
            <li>The thing that undercuts this razor for me is how easily the hair get stuck into the blades.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t cut/bleed easily they would probably be fine for you.</li>
            <li>I get a nice, consistent, close shave from them every time.</li>
            <li>This works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>I have a light beard</li>
            <li>They are great quality for a low price.</li>
            <li>They work great for me and my husband - they are basically our standard order razor.</li>
            <li>I am done with these cheap razors.</li>
            <li>I liked the old rubberized handles better though...</li>
            <li>cheap good razors, blade spacing is enough that cleaning is easy</li>
            <li>Aside from that, these are good shavers, the price though plus shipping is really too much.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>The price was right!</li>
            <li>I keep a drawer full of a year&#x27;s supply in case the Flex 3 gets redesigned too.</li>
            <li>This is a brand that you can always depend on and their pricing is also really cost-effective, what more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li>And for the price, not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>they also came in quick time</li>
            <li>But I think I might opt to pay more or find a better value disposable razor in the future.</li>
            <li>They ware out quickly.</li>
            <li>Cheap single blades are better than these.</li>
            <li>You may as well buy the cheap Bic single blades because these don&#x27;t shave any better.</li>
            <li>and they work great and last several shaves.</li>
            <li>Bought these to shave my head and they are very good for the specific reason, cannot attest for it&#x27;s other purposes though.</li>
            <li>Still on my first one.</li>
            <li>I guess everyone thinks that the women will always pay more for the same thing</li>
            <li>Can not think of much more I could possibly text about a razor.  </li>
            <li>There are probably better products out there, but they will most certainly be more expensive.</li>
            <li>I rather pay more for ones that last longer.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted---good value</li>
            <li>I would look for a better deal from somewhere else next time.  .</li>
            <li>The handle is well contoured and heavy for good control.  </li>
            <li>They have changed the handle on the razor but the blades and top are still the same as the older version</li>
            <li>Good thing is that they last for weeks and weeks as long as you rinse them well.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a pretty decent value.  </li>
            <li>If you are interested balding/shaving your head, then I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Must use with caution especially in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>They do the job very well.  </li>
            <li>The razors work well for a more reasonable price than other brands.  </li>
            <li>Finally found them on here and ordered them, extremely excited to have found them again</li>
            <li>so this razor works just fine for me and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting, effective and no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>Mostly on par or slightly lower than store prices, and the bonus is that I don&#x27;t have to go anywhere to get it.</li>
            <li>Women know that these simply work better than the female versions of these products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very smooth, with little to no nicks/cuts.</li>
            <li>precisely what I ordered and expected.</li>
            <li>These Bic razors on first use leave your skin with cuts and irritation -- comparable to the Gillete after several uses.</li>
            <li>Razors cut clean and close, last acceptably long time.</li>
            <li>If you agree, switch to the Bic Flex 3, they still have the old rubber grip.  </li>
            <li>The razors in the picture have the soft rubber grips.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Will stick with the Bic 4 bladed razors, much better for the few extra cents.</li>
            <li>Though I really don;t see much difference between these triple bladed razors and the BIC regular cheapie yellow handled sensitive skin ones, I couldn&#x27;t buy the cheaper ones as the Main Seller Middleman here insists on only selling them in packs of 15 packages which means 150 razors or so-</li>
            <li>My son--whose 15 and facial hair is still pretty sparse--says the same thing.</li>
            <li>traditionally used Gillette, but the prices of their razors have been steadily increasing over the years.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s normal, but other razors they will come out after a few smacks and running water.  </li>
            <li>Youch, these things cut like no other razor I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I like the new style of handle and the blades seem to last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying to find alternatives to the major brand blades like Gillette Fusion and Schick Hydro...</li>
            <li>My local Kroger has some generics I usually buy for cheap that work well.</li>
            <li>Normally a razor is supposed to cut your hair and not really affect your skin.</li>
            <li>These razors are super dull, and they cut my face.</li>
            <li>I bought these because they&#x27;re one of the few disposable razors available with Amazon Prime shipping that don&#x27;t look sketchy and aren&#x27;t super expensive.</li>

            <li> These razors bite me more often and worse than any other brand.</li>
            <li> Just go for the more expensive brands, it works out in the long run.</li>
            <li> I like the Bic line of razors as long as they are only three blades and have a pivot head, which is probably the case in any razor company.</li>
            <li> I find they are unsuitable to shave anything but a flat surface.</li>
            <li> I know they&#x27;re cheap disposable, but they&#x27;re completely useless--</li>
            <li> I would buy again as long as they are under five bucks for the 4 count.</li>
            <li> Complete waste, and environmentally irresponsible on the part of Bic.  </li>
            <li> Dull blades cut my skin very easily--even when I shave careful as hell</li>
            <li> I have little facial hair</li>
            <li> these razors left me little cuts all over my legs idk why.</li>
            <li> I like a close military shave and demand a smooth close cutting razor.</li>
            <li> Work as expected.  </li>
            <li> Package arrived crushed</li>
            <li> Each time I buy a few packs, I remove the heads to use on my existing handle and throw out all the extra handles.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if they are old, old stock or just poorly manufactured.</li>
            <li> However BIC has changed the product to ones with hard plastic handles which don&#x27;t have the same feel in the shower.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re average.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with this brand, their razors last so long, that it takes a really long time to have to throw them out because the quality is there.  </li>
            <li> These razors are one step down in quality from the Bic Flex 3</li>
            <li> actually less here than the store, will order again</li>
            <li> Inconsistent in quality but does the job if you don&#x27;t mind tossing a few after one use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on them</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but I would buy it if the Mark 3&lt;br /&gt;was not available.</li>
            <li> I have slow growing, sparse facial hair that is by no means thick</li>
            <li> He has difficult facial hair and his face has uneven features.</li>
            <li> Dull blades.  </li>
            <li> and you end up with a crummy shave no matter how hard you try.</li>
            <li> worked like disposable razors should I bought them for my husband and he hasn&#x27;t complained yet</li>
            <li> He complained they hurt his face</li>
            <li> I have a fairly thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend a 4 blade disposable razor for the comfort/ease of knowing you won&#x27;t accidentally cut yourself, whereas with these you can cut yourself if you even slightly move the wrong way.  </li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> Worst Bic Razor straight out of the package.</li>
            <li> I have gotten tired of buying a re-usable razor and then getting the wrong blades.  </li>
            <li> The worst razors I have ever used, dull and rough.</li>
            <li> ; WRONG.</li>
            <li> I hate paying for the crazy price.</li>
            <li> also gave me terrible razor burn.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> These are awful.</li>
            <li> Yes, they&#x27;re just disposable razors, but they were awful.  </li>

            <li> Save yourself the money.. break a beer bottle and shave with the shards.</li>
            <li> Bought these to shave my head and they are very good for the specific reason, cannot attest for it&#x27;s other purposes though. If you are interested balding/shaving your head, then I would highly recommend this. Very smooth, with little to no nicks/cuts.</li>
            <li> I used to use these until they switched to that cheapo plastic grip from the rubber grip they used to have.  If you agree, switch to the Bic Flex 3, they still have the old rubber grip.  I keep a drawer full of a year&#x27;s supply in case the Flex 3 gets redesigned too. When they run out I will no longer be a Bic customer.</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the price for the quality!</li>
            <li> I have little facial hair so i cant comment on the endurance of these razors. But they are sturdy, and just what i was looking for. Still on my first one.</li>
            <li> Just like I bought from Walmart</li>
            <li> Inconsistent in quality but does the job if you don&#x27;t mind tossing a few after one use.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these.</li>
            <li> Good shave, great handle, recommended.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands but feel that this company&#x27;s quality is excellent and I&#x27;ve used this brand all my life.  I prefer to always buy the men&#x27;s razor&#x27;s, since after comparison I believe that the there is no difference except for the price.  I guess everyone thinks that the women will always pay more for the same thing and but that is not always the case!  lol.    You can never go wrong with this brand, their razors last so long, that it takes a really long time to have to throw them out because the quality is there.  The shave you get is really smooth, perfect if you like to shave your legs.  This is a brand that you can always depend on and their pricing is also really cost-effective, what more could you ask for?  Buy from BIC, since they are the best!</li>
            <li> worked like disposable razors should I bought them for my husband and he hasn&#x27;t complained yet they also came in quick time so I was happy with my purchase but they are disposable razors what more can I say</li>
            <li> Dull blades.  Cheap single blades are better than these. Cuts my face more than my beard. Don&#x27;t bother with theses.</li>
            <li> works for me, get 20 shaves per blade...</li>
            <li> Work as expected.  Always on time</li>
            <li> I like the Bic line of razors as long as they are only three blades and have a pivot head, which is probably the case in any razor company. These work great, and give me a nice clean shave with no problems. I would buy again as long as they are under five bucks for the 4 count. Would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> actually less here than the store, will order again</li>
            <li> I like a close military shave and demand a smooth close cutting razor. Never had any luck with a disposable as until these.</li>
            <li> These razors are one step down in quality from the Bic Flex 3 I have always used, but the Comfort 3 are sufficient.  The handle is well contoured and heavy for good control.  I get a nice, consistent, close shave from them every time. Considering I am shaving my entire head and face it ends up being a very good bargin.</li>
            <li> The razors in the picture have the soft rubber grips.  However BIC has changed the product to ones with hard plastic handles which don&#x27;t have the same feel in the shower.</li>
            <li> work like they should</li>
            <li> cheap good razors, blade spacing is enough that cleaning is easy</li>
            <li> Came to my address just as described.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband to travel with.  He complained they hurt his face so I tried one out and it even hurt on my legs.  Wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> these razors left me little cuts all over my legs idk why. also gave me terrible razor burn. never buying these again.</li>
            <li> They get the job done.</li>
            <li> The worst razors I have ever used, dull and rough. Each one felt like that had been already used numerous times... I ended up throwing them in the trash... Don&#x27;t waste your money on them</li>
            <li> I figured I would try these because they were part of the Amazon Add-on program. That was a big mistake. These razors are super dull, and they cut my face.</li>
            <li> I know they&#x27;re cheap disposable, but they&#x27;re completely useless--I have slow growing, sparse facial hair that is by no means thick and I had &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; as soon as I was done shaving. Just go for the more expensive brands, it works out in the long run.</li>
            <li> Great razors that you can&#x27;t find in any store anymore.  These are the only razors I have used that doesn&#x27;t cause my fact and neck to have red rash marks from being irritated by the blades.</li>
            <li> Terrible. I&#x27;m always trying to find alternatives to the major brand blades like Gillette Fusion and Schick Hydro...I hate paying for the crazy price. My local Kroger has some generics I usually buy for cheap that work well. I saw these Bic&#x27;s and thought--&amp;#34;name brand, probably works better.&amp;#34; WRONG. These are awful. You may as well buy the cheap Bic single blades because these don&#x27;t shave any better. Dull blades cut my skin very easily--even when I shave careful as hell I still end up with nicks and cuts. My son--whose 15 and facial hair is still pretty sparse--says the same thing. Even he thinks they&#x27;re junk. I&#x27;ve used one blade twice and and I&#x27;m tossing it. The rest I&#x27;m putting in my wife&#x27;s side of the vanity and she can use them--I won&#x27;t touch &#x27;em. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have a light beard so this razor works just fine for me and lasts a long time.  I have gotten tired of buying a re-usable razor and then getting the wrong blades.  This works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re average. Not the best (or worst) I&#x27;ve ever used.  If you don&#x27;t cut/bleed easily they would probably be fine for you.</li>
            <li> Package arrived crushed</li>
            <li> i love these razors they did a great job on my head n face</li>
            <li> When you buy razors. You get what you pay for. SO, these shave, and when you do, you lose whiskers.</li>
            <li> Love this razor, just wish they sold the blades alone, since the heads are removable/replaceable.  Each time I buy a few packs, I remove the heads to use on my existing handle and throw out all the extra handles.  Complete waste, and environmentally irresponsible on the part of Bic.  Why make the head removable, then not take advantage of that?  Nonsense.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these, very good razor.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, effective and no nicks or cuts. Can not think of much more I could possibly text about a razor.  The price was right!</li>
            <li> One of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Closest and smoothest shave ever-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs love this razor, thank you!!</li>
            <li> The thing that undercuts this razor for me is how easily the hair get stuck into the blades.  Sure, it&#x27;s normal, but other razors they will come out after a few smacks and running water.  These doesn&#x27;t seem to do that.  Thus I&#x27;ll have to use them shorter or use something to get it out. For the price, it&#x27;s a pretty decent value.  But I think I might opt to pay more or find a better value disposable razor in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product and price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> They are great quality for a low price.</li>
            <li> cuts my husbands face almost every time</li>
            <li> Great razors, best disposable ever.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these.</li>
            <li> I actually got these for my legs. I have sensitive skin and they work great and last several shaves. I feel like these are cheaper than buying regular woman&#x27;s 3 blade razors.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat them. Shave much better than the blades that bounce all over the place and you end up with a crummy shave no matter how hard you try.</li>
            <li> It is in the same league as the Gillette Mark 3.&lt;br /&gt;It was a gift to me but I would buy it if the Mark 3&lt;br /&gt;was not available.</li>
            <li> I got three shaves out of one razor.  I will buy this product again.  BIC has been around for years.</li>
            <li> Product came as delivered-quality strong-I am thrilled and plan on buying again!</li>
            <li> My husband has tested out many electronic and hand razors. He has difficult facial hair and his face has uneven features. He loves this razor and has asked for more. Mostly on par or slightly lower than store prices, and the bonus is that I don&#x27;t have to go anywhere to get it.</li>
            <li> They work great for me and my husband - they are basically our standard order razor.</li>
            <li> Razors do the job, but cause lots of razor burn and cuts.  Must use with caution especially in sensitive areas.  Would recommend a 4 blade disposable razor for the comfort/ease of knowing you won&#x27;t accidentally cut yourself, whereas with these you can cut yourself if you even slightly move the wrong way.  Good thing is that they last for weeks and weeks as long as you rinse them well.  Still, I wish I had paid more for slightly better razors.</li>
            <li> If you are a man looking to see how this product will work on your face, this review is not for you.  I am a woman who has used men&#x27;s razors to shave my legs for years.  Women know that these simply work better than the female versions of these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I traditionally used Gillette, but the prices of their razors have been steadily increasing over the years.  So I decided to try this product, which was a bit more affordable.  I can say that, as a woman who is using this to shave my legs, I have no complaints.  The razors work well for a more reasonable price than other brands.  It removes the hair while not nicking my skin.  There are probably better products out there, but they will most certainly be more expensive.</li>
            <li> Youch, these things cut like no other razor I&#x27;ve ever used! Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. These are very cheap, and they don&#x27;t shave that well and you have to discard them after one or two uses. In the end you would save money by going to Harrys.com  and buying their $15 starter set. It&#x27;s much better, to be honest. I am done with these cheap razors.</li>
            <li> Ok. Not great. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> They ware out quickly. I rather pay more for ones that last longer.</li>
            <li> These razors are an excellent choice for removing facehair.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted---good value</li>
            <li> These razors are pretty good for the money. No they don&#x27;t compare with the Mach 3, but they work well enough and don&#x27;t cause razor nicks. And for the price, not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they&#x27;re one of the few disposable razors available with Amazon Prime shipping that don&#x27;t look sketchy and aren&#x27;t super expensive. They do the trick... they shave hair. I haven&#x27;t cut myself with these razors and I&#x27;d say you can use one 20 times or so no problem. (Note - I&#x27;m not shaving a giant beard or anything.)</li>
            <li> This razor is unfit for its intended use. Normally a razor is supposed to cut your hair and not really affect your skin. I had been using a Gillete 3-blade disposable razor but Amazon stopped carrying it in subscribe &amp; save. While this product appears to be similar to Gillete on paper, in actual use it is not. These Bic razors on first use leave your skin with cuts and irritation -- comparable to the Gillete after several uses.</li>
            <li> The seller was amazing. The razors suck</li>
            <li> I have been using these razors for years.  LOVE them.  Then I couldn&#x27;t find them in stores anymore... Finally found them on here and ordered them, extremely excited to have found them again (Men&#x27;s razors always work better than women&#x27;s I have found).  They have changed the handle on the razor but the blades and top are still the same as the older version so that&#x27;s good.  I liked the old rubberized handles better though...</li>
            <li> great razor, great price</li>
            <li> Yes, they&#x27;re just disposable razors, but they were awful.  Will stick with the Bic 4 bladed razors, much better for the few extra cents.</li>
            <li> Worst Bic Razor straight out of the package. Provided instant razor burn and scrapes. Tossed in trash after two shaves. Not sure if they are old, old stock or just poorly manufactured. Save your money.</li>
            <li> They do the job very well.  I like the new style of handle and the blades seem to last. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all sorts of disposals, cartridge razors and double edge safety razors. These razors bite me more often and worse than any other brand. I find they are unsuitable to shave anything but a flat surface.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly thick hair.  These were ok. Nothing special.  A Mach 3 would have been much better.</li>
            <li> Though I really don;t see much difference between these triple bladed razors and the BIC regular cheapie yellow handled sensitive skin ones, I couldn&#x27;t buy the cheaper ones as the Main Seller Middleman here insists on only selling them in packs of 15 packages which means 150 razors or so- hardly fitting my needs inasmuch as one of those lasts about 4 days for me. Aside from that, these are good shavers, the price though plus shipping is really too much. I would look for a better deal from somewhere else next time.  .</li>
            <li> Husband loves there shave</li>
            <li> Razors cut clean and close, last acceptably long time. I have purchased these before and should continue to do so.</li>
            <li> precisely what I ordered and expected.</li>
            <li> As good as many higher priced razors.  Good deal and easy to order through Amazon</li>
