            <li>but I have enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the PTR products that I have purchased and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite exfoliator.</li>
            <li>This smells soooooooo good -- so fresh, not perfumy or flowery, and very clean but still feminine.</li>
            <li>Great product to help exfoliate and clean the skin, liked it a lot and would suggest it for any age/skin condition except sensitive</li>
            <li>It is lightly scented which it</li>
            <li>I use it two to three times a week and my 68 year-old face shines bright and clear.</li>

            <li>Exfoliates and leaves the skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It didnt smell like the original</li>
            <li>This is the best anti aging wash for your hard earned buck.</li>
            <li>and it was soo full</li>
            <li>all the peter thomas roth products have been excellent, leave your face smooth and silky, and skin definitely looks younger.  </li>
            <li>and this seems to be a good daily wash</li>
            <li>I use it for my face, but it is a full body scrub.</li>
            <li>and I thought it might be a bit better for some gentle exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and it was much cheaper than in a store like Sephora.</li>
            <li>I started using this product because I tan and felt that I needed a mild exfoliant to refresh my skin.</li>
            <li>but this product has helped tremendously and boosted my self esteem.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Nothing great though, not worth the price.</li>
            <li>and, the price is right.</li>
            <li>It gets your skin clean without irritation, and it really seems to soften it, too.</li>
            <li>Another reason I know this product is not the original is it does absolutely nothing to my skin, the original makes my skin very soft each time I use it</li>
            <li>This product shows results right from the first usage.</li>
            <li>The buffing beads are actually very gentle and not a bit abrasive on your skin.</li>
            <li>and this does absolutely NOTHING!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and my pores are smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>will never have pretty skin</li>
            <li>Good for everyday use for oily skin.</li>
            <li>i used this product before and it works, the bottle last forever because you just use a little, great product</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I have combination type skin, particularly very oily on my nose and chin.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This product is gently scrubs without drying out.</li>
            <li>thankS..</li>
            <li>And goes a long way if you can be easy on the squeeze.</li>
            <li>The beads are soft and gentle on your skin while still cleansing it pretty thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Not only does it clean and tighten my skin</li>
            <li>It goes a long way and makes your skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>I have found this product to be very good at removing the dead skin without being harsh or abrasive.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine how quickly I would go through it for use on my entire body.  </li>
            <li>Gentle scrub leaves my skin feeling soft and youthful.</li>
            <li>removes the dead top layer of skin and stimulates collagen.  </li>
            <li>use it daily at night and in conjunction with Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System for extra exfoliating and with Peter Thomas Roth cucumber masque afterwards for re-hydration.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week on my face, and everyday on body, which is perfect for my thin, European-descent, and middle-aged skin.</li>
            <li>It is the real product and in general, this product does amazzzziinnngggg things to your skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 1 week now and definitely see some positive changes: my face is no longer oily and flaky (I have combination skin).</li>
            <li>I am 41 yrs old and have had acne all my life&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is professional stuff.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and when I am out really miss it.</li>
            <li>n soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for me to use every morning in the shower with no issues.</li>
            <li>Really thought I was going to like this but actually underwhelmed.  </li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t say they really scrub or exfoliate away the dry/dead skin cells like a traditional scrub.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to add a daily exfoliant to their regiment.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to someone with similar skin texture.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it once, then I felt face is really itchy, and my face turned to red next morning.</li>
            <li>I have only used this for a week, but let it be clear that this wash does NOT foam.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t spent much time sniffing this product, but I did not find the smell to be putrid or &amp;#34;like dirt&amp;#34; as some people have described.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin, so I have tried a lot of different scrubs and brands.</li>
            <li>Too strong to wash face with daily though, at least for me.</li>
            <li>I expected to notice a different in my skin and to see that glow, but it&#x27;s so gentle</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m still getting my occasional break outs but that might just be due to my diet.</li>
            <li> It may work wonders in other ways, but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, you might want to stay away from anything with the buffing beads.</li>
            <li> My skin is really dry and flaky and this product has helped in removing the dry skin flakes.  </li>
            <li> how I like my wash, to much scent is not good for your skin</li>
            <li> A litte bit does go a long way, so you won&#x27;t be purchasing often !!</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It may seem a little pricey, but it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> However, it does not create any foam at all, which is a let down.  </li>
            <li> I had read a previous review that someone was using it with their clarisonic, which I am also doing.  </li>
            <li> Im a little careless.</li>
            <li> I think its sad that someone will lie to make a $.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered the wrong item</li>
            <li> Or did I get a fake?  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an o.k. body wash. Nothing great though, not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon and this was NOT the true PTR product!! It didnt smell like the original and it was soo full it overflowed when I opened it so I could tell it had been filled with something else! I have used this many times and loved it but whatever they added to this has caused my face to break out in a allergic reaction type rash . I think its sad that someone will lie to make a $. Another reason I know this product is not the original is it does absolutely nothing to my skin, the original makes my skin very soft each time I use it and this does absolutely NOTHING!</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit off putting and the beads are soft so they don&#x27;t feel like they are exfoliating as much as I expected.</li>
            <li> As always this product meets and exceeds all expectations. My wife absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> the exfoliation power of this stuff is perfect - it&#x27;s not harsh and you can, if you want, use it every day. It gets your skin clean without irritation, and it really seems to soften it, too. I try a lot of cleansers and this one is my fave. I&#x27;m definitely ordering again.</li>
            <li> I have combination type skin, particularly very oily on my nose and chin. I started using this product because I tan and felt that I needed a mild exfoliant to refresh my skin. I have found this product to be very good at removing the dead skin without being harsh or abrasive. A litte bit does go a long way, so you won&#x27;t be purchasing often !! I haven&#x27;t spent much time sniffing this product, but I did not find the smell to be putrid or &amp;#34;like dirt&amp;#34; as some people have described. However, I was not purchasing this product for its smell but for the quality. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to add a daily exfoliant to their regiment.</li>
            <li> Beauty Comes from the Inside! And the buffing beads polish up the outside. I really like this stuff and I use it on all of my skin, not just my face.</li>
            <li> The beads are soft and gentle on your skin while still cleansing it pretty thoroughly. Has a bit of a funky smell to it though. I&#x27;m still getting my occasional break outs but that might just be due to my diet. All in all, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d spend $30 on it again.</li>
            <li> great, gentle exfoliator.  use it with my clarisonic mia 2.  a little bit goes a long way.  all the peter thomas roth products have been excellent, leave your face smooth and silky, and skin definitely looks younger.  great for 50+ skin.</li>
            <li> Try to buy this face wash locally, Ouch! This is the best anti aging wash for your hard earned buck.</li>
            <li> Love this Peter Thomas Roth face wash! Good for everyday use for oily skin. If you have dry skin, you might want to stay away from anything with the buffing beads. Costs way more at Sephora. Con, the smell of the product is OK (the PTR acne buffing bead face wash smells better.)</li>
            <li> I am 41 yrs old and have had acne all my life&lt;br /&gt;I have ice pick scars and hyperpigmentation&lt;br /&gt;This product is the best I ever used&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any breakouts since using. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and my pores are smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I will never have pretty skin but this product has helped tremendously and boosted my self esteem.&lt;br /&gt;Its expensive, but the bottle is huge and will last a long time as you only need to use a little at a time&lt;br /&gt;I use with peter Thomas roth acne products</li>
            <li> I have been using this now almost three weeks and it is great at washing off makeup and gently exfoliating. I would recommend this to anyone and let me also mention I am 42 and this seems to be a good daily wash and I haven&#x27;t had to exfoliate in addition too. It is lightly scented which it how I like my wash, to much scent is not good for your skin and I have a nice glow after washing.</li>
            <li> In my store its around  $45-$50 so this is a cray cray bargain. It is the real product and in general, this product does amazzzziinnngggg things to your skin. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great Product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This is professional stuff. And goes a long way if you can be easy on the squeeze. Im a little careless. but this is the best.</li>
            <li> have used this product for years.  love it.  removes the dead top layer of skin and stimulates collagen.  ingredients are safe and topnotch.  best price on the internet for this product at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it for my face, but it is a full body scrub. It is a great exfoliate! Since I found this I&#x27;ve also bought the cleanser. It may seem a little pricey, but it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I was initially shopping for the PTR Anti-Aging Gel Cleanser, but the buffing beads caught my eye and I thought it might be a bit better for some gentle exfoliation.  I like this product, but actually prefer the feeling and results from the gel cleanser.</li>
            <li> Great product to help exfoliate and clean the skin, liked it a lot and would suggest it for any age/skin condition except sensitive</li>
            <li> I tried to use it once, then I felt face is really itchy, and my face turned to red next morning. I use Peter Thomas for many years, this never happened before.</li>
            <li> Just perfect! 8.5 oz bottle is great for the price. Smells great and does the job well. Exfoliates and leaves the skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> This is a really good exfoliater! It goes a long way and makes your skin feel so smooth. It definitely is a plus in my morning and night cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it daily and when I am out really miss it.</li>
            <li> I use it two to three times a week and my 68 year-old face shines bright and clear.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered the wrong item but I have enjoyed the product. Leaves my skin really nice n soft. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My skin is really dry and flaky and this product has helped in removing the dry skin flakes.  It&#x27;s gentle enough for me to use every morning in the shower with no issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for sometime. I received a sample with something I purchased and have been using it since.</li>
            <li> I love all of the PTR products that I have purchased and this is no exception. The buffing beads are actually very gentle and not a bit abrasive on your skin.</li>
            <li> Really thought I was going to like this but actually underwhelmed.  The product smells like dirt?  Or did I get a fake?  The beads are beads of moisture and I wouldn&#x27;t say they really scrub or exfoliate away the dry/dead skin cells like a traditional scrub.  This level of exfoliation would be good for someone with reactive skin that couldn&#x27;t handle the intensity of a salt/sugar scrub.  For me, at this size of bottle and price I only use it on my face and neck.  Can&#x27;t imagine how quickly I would go through it for use on my entire body.  I expected to notice a different in my skin and to see that glow, but it&#x27;s so gentle I didn&#x27;t notice a thing.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years. Gentle scrub leaves my skin feeling soft and youthful. I do not have sensitive skin, so I have tried a lot of different scrubs and brands. This product is gently scrubs without drying out.</li>
            <li> This product shows results right from the first usage. Not only does it clean and tighten my skin but it also leaves my skin look so smooth and polished. &amp;#34;Buffing beads&amp;#34; indeed!&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily at night and in conjunction with Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System for extra exfoliating and with Peter Thomas Roth cucumber masque afterwards for re-hydration. I have been using this product for 1 week now and definitely see some positive changes: my face is no longer oily and flaky (I have combination skin). Highly recommend this to someone with similar skin texture.</li>
            <li> i used this product before and it works, the bottle last forever because you just use a little, great product</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a week, but let it be clear that this wash does NOT foam.  I had read a previous review that someone was using it with their clarisonic, which I am also doing.  However, it does not create any foam at all, which is a let down.  It may work wonders in other ways, but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> This smells soooooooo good -- so fresh, not perfumy or flowery, and very clean but still feminine. And it does exfoliate both with the chemical ingredients and the beads. As such it does make your skin look younger. It&#x27;s my favorite exfoliator. Too strong to wash face with daily though, at least for me. I use it twice a week on my face, and everyday on body, which is perfect for my thin, European-descent, and middle-aged skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it was much cheaper than in a store like Sephora.</li>
            <li> this face wash is the bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!! and, the price is right. thankS..I WILL BE BACK 4 MORE,WHEN IT RUNS OUT.</li>
