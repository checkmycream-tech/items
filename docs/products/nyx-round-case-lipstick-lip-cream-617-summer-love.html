            <li>The color is very nice</li>
            <li>this is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>The lipstick is good</li>
            <li>and I have never had a lipstick smell this good.</li>
            <li>It was a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a matte but glossy and it smells amazing, my husband said your lips smell good</li>
            <li>I absolutely love ALL NYX products!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color!</li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>then this will look amazing on you.</li>
            <li>, it is your perfect nude/purple shade and is very pigmented but with tons of moisture.</li>
            <li>kind of pinker nude version of NYX \\&quot;Circe\\</li>
            <li>Not only is it a great price, but it has a great, creamy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price that I got the lipstick for in my opinion it doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.  </li>
            <li>After looking for a a perfect nude shade, I have finally found one!</li>
            <li>looks more like a gloss without the stickyness.</li>
            <li>it isnt my favorite lipstick</li>
            <li>I am planning purchase more on this color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s called summer love</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I promise if anyone of you love a nude lip and your complexion compliments purple like mine</li>
            <li>Although, I was looking for more of a lipstick that would make my looks lip nude.</li>
            <li>but you need to apply many layers.</li>
            <li>Still it&#x27;s my favorite from nyx lipsticks .</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with a peachy/pink undertone, and light brown hair and light eyes.  </li>
            <li>, it goes on so lightly, it doesn&#x27;t feel caked on your lips.</li>
            <li>, it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Its a bit too light for me but with the gloss and lip liner I bought</li>
            <li>This lipstick is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>it goes on very smooth but it doesnt have the best coverage and isnt very thick</li>
            <li>Happy Holiday to all!i will enjoy it!NYX Round Case Lipstick Lip Cream 617 Summer Love</li>
            <li>This stick is rich, creamy and seems to be a slighty pinker version of Circe.</li>
            <li>Only suggestion make sure your lips are nice and moisturized because then any lipstick will look cakey.</li>
            <li>This color SUMMER LOVE is a very nice  light pink color and it certainly is creamy.  </li>
            <li>I am a TRUE NYX fan.  </li>
            <li>I love the color and very moisture cream lipstick.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s a good purchase</li>
            <li>Since they&#x27;re a cruelty free company, it makes it ten times better!</li>
            <li>QUICKLY ALSO, YES WOULD DO AGAIN.Thank again.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if the true color is picture but fairly close</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li>Its been really hot in NY</li>
            <li>I love the price, the way it goes on and will definitely be looking into purchasing more products in the future!</li>
            <li>so you are able to see the actual color.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It came early,the tube it&#x27;s in is really pretty.</li>
            <li>This is a pale color but it looks really good on.</li>
            <li>cause it is such a beautiful everyday look.</li>
            <li>NYX you have a new fan!!</li>
            <li>Lovely lighter nude shade with no real noticeable scent or taste.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping...of course.</li>
            <li>I really like the lipstick.</li>
            <li>what I DO mind is the frosty look this lipstick has, unlike \\&quot;Circe \\&quot; which is very matte.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually very flattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is just right...not too pale, nice neutral tone.</li>
            <li>The color is actually a nude brown not so much pink, but still love it!</li>
            <li>My new summer color!</li>
            <li>it looks great on and its not as hard as regular lipstick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>so it doesnt look as natural as i wish it did.</li>
            <li>but it isnt my least favorite either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, for any ladies that are like me that have been searching high and low for a nude lipstick that wasn&#x27;t too brown, or gray, this is it.</li>
            <li>i have tan skin not dark</li>
            <li>I a soft pink not too much.  </li>

            <li> i have tan skin not dark</li>
            <li> I a soft pink not too much.  </li>
            <li> so it can be difficult to find a nude lipstick that is light enough and not orange looking.  </li>
            <li> it doesnt stay on very long either, but if you want a affordable nude lipstick and you dont have a darker skin tone it works.  </li>
            <li> but when this particular tube arrived it was broken.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind pale color, that other reviewers ate complaining about, actually I was looking for pale,</li>
            <li> I bought this with the NYX lipliner in Pale Pink</li>
            <li> I would like it to stay on a little longer</li>
            <li> :/ .</li>
            <li> but then I have find the lipstick that stays on usually dries your lips, and isn&#x27;t creamy, so there you are.</li>
            <li> Usually nude lipsticks wash me out, and make me look sick or dead.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this item....</li>
            <li> Something about this color makes my husband go crazy.  </li>

            <li> I wanted a nude color and they sent me and brownish gold color. I would not recommend ordering this product.</li>

            <li> this is gorgeous. it&#x27;s so soft, it goes on so lightly, it doesn&#x27;t feel caked on your lips. it&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li> The color is very nice its like a shimmery nude. it looks great on and its not as hard as regular lipstick. looks more like a gloss without the stickyness. My new summer color!</li>
            <li> i have tan skin not dark but i am italian so i have darker skin and this lipstick is just a tad to nude for my complextion so it doesnt look as natural as i wish it did. it goes on very smooth but it doesnt have the best coverage and isnt very thick so you have apply various coats to your lips. it doesnt stay on very long either, but if you want a affordable nude lipstick and you dont have a darker skin tone it works.  it isnt my favorite lipstick but it isnt my least favorite either.</li>
            <li> The lipstick is good but when this particular tube arrived it was broken. I should have just gone to Utla.</li>
            <li> I love the color and very moisture cream lipstick. I would buy this color again. I am planning purchase more on this color</li>
            <li> This lipstick is waaayy darker than the picture.. And it gets everywhere because of how creamy it is :/ .</li>
            <li> This is a pale color but it looks really good on. Only suggestion make sure your lips are nice and moisturized because then any lipstick will look cakey. My mom tried taking it as soon as I got it . It&#x27;s called summer love, it goes on smooth. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of staying power but come on your paying 5$ or so for it. Overall I think it&#x27;s a good purchase</li>
            <li> Fast shipping...of course. However, when I received it, it had melted!!!! Its been really hot in NY so I&#x27;m assuming it was because of the heat. Its a bit too light for me but with the gloss and lip liner I bought, it worked out okay. But I&#x27;m still looking for another shade of nude for me.</li>
            <li> NYX you have a new fan!! I love the price, the way it goes on and will definitely be looking into purchasing more products in the future!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the true color is picture but fairly close all I know is that it&#x27;s so beautiful on, it is your perfect nude/purple shade and is very pigmented but with tons of moisture. It&#x27;s like a matte but glossy and it smells amazing, my husband said your lips smell good and i realized it was the lipstick and I have never had a lipstick smell this good.I bought this with the NYX lipliner in Pale Pink and they go great together.. I promise if anyone of you love a nude lip and your complexion compliments purple like mine then this will look amazing on you. I already bought backups when I run out cause it is such a beautiful everyday look.</li>
            <li> I really like the lipstick. Although, I was looking for more of a lipstick that would make my looks lip nude. With this product, it does that but you need to apply many layers. The quality of the lipstick is very good though. It was a good buy for the price. It is also sold it stores. I suggest going to the store and purchasing it so you are able to see the actual color. The color matched the photo and description though.</li>
            <li> IT WAS AS PROMISE AND DELIVERY QUICKLY ALSO, YES WOULD DO AGAIN.Thank again.Happy Holiday to all!i will enjoy it!NYX Round Case Lipstick Lip Cream 617 Summer Love</li>
