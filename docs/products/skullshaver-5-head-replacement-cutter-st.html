    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>This product as worked perfectly for my fiance.  </li>
            <li>It gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>The attachments for the skull shaver are shockingly good quality.  </li>
            <li>It is a great shaver I love using it every day keep your head shaved if you don&#x27;t like using a razor and shaving cream every day</li>
            <li>really liked the skullshaver and would have recommended this product to anyone, but now that I have bought this replacement head.</li>
            <li>so I guess I like it kind of sort of.</li>
            <li>The flip up heads were nice but</li>
            <li>I gave the skullshaver unit and original shaving head a great rating.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used yet, looking forward to when I have to change blades, I believe that the shaver could be a better product.</li>
            <li>I like the X1 replacement heads better.</li>
            <li>It will probably be a while before you need to replace the original blades on this amazing product....</li>
            <li>cuts very good only drawback blades</li>
            <li>Easy to used.</li>
            <li>Easy put in and take it out</li>
            <li>ie those that ship with the original unit - 5 stars) available here on Amazon for $16 are considerably better than this $13 replacement head.</li>
            <li>was trying to avoid a razor and shaving cream, this razor does not give the smooth cut that I was hoping for</li>
            <li>If I knew that this was all that was available as a replacement iI would never have bought the cutter.</li>
            <li>the replacement head has not been used, as yet, as the original head is still working fine.</li>
            <li>It is nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>i nothing compared to the original.</li>
            <li>I no have time to clean it often.</li>
            <li>I needed a continous  roll-over  to get almost a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made they should charge more and make them professional grade....</li>
            <li>clips brake blades wear quickly...</li>
            <li>I can say it does fit on the skullshaver unit and thats all i can say positive about this replacement piece.  </li>
            <li>This item is ok, I guess I expected more.</li>
            <li>this razor shaves really close and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can get a much better shave with just a regular electric face shaving unit.</li>
            <li>I further need too run my standby shaver over my head just to be sure.</li>
            <li>He loves the skull shaver and I wanted to be sure he had an extra head for when the first one wears out.</li>
            <li>I am a black man, I believed this product would be perfect for me and hair type, however, I find that no matter how long I run the blades over my scalp, I still have the new lawn look, hair spots still remain.</li>
            <li>The design is completely different and a huge step backward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ready to use this accessory when needed.</li>
            <li>Much closer shave than the ST blades.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected!!!</li>
            <li>The previous two cutters performed fine.</li>
            <li>It charges when it wants to and it&#x27; cuts almost close enough</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that the blades are dull, it&#x27;s that my beards hairs barely fit through the holes.</li>

            <li> I can only assume that these blades work as poorly as the ones included with the original shaver.</li>

            <li> When you are finally finished shaving your head it still feels rough.  </li>
            <li> ars time consuming to take apart to clean,other than that they cut very close,still have not figured out how to get the middle  blade out,as always the chinese instructions are very useless on explaining how to maintain there products</li>
            <li> I even begun to shave my head every other day to maybe minumise the hair spots, not.</li>
            <li> So sorry I bought this several months in advance of having to replace my old heads</li>
            <li> It is far less expensive than constantly buying shaving cream and razors every month.</li>
            <li> I cannot waste my time with this product or support it</li>
            <li> This cutter is terrible, I have to go back and forth over the same area so much that my skin is getting abrasions.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my experience with the actual Shaver and its inability to hold any electrical charge made me return it and all attachments.</li>
            <li> It hardly cuts my beard.</li>
            <li> Wrong blades for skull shaver get the xl also on skull shaver owner says there will be one coming that takes one hour to charge and shaves for 90 minutes check after 7/26/14</li>
            <li> It sounds like it&#x27;s gonna fall apart and feels like it&#x27;s pulling hair out rather than cutting it.</li>
            <li> l felt frustrated using it.</li>

            <li> It will probably be a while before you need to replace the original blades on this amazing product.... But, when it&#x27;s time to do so, this replacement set totally works!</li>
            <li> I gave the skullshaver unit and original shaving head a great rating. I bought this as a replacement.  It is nothing like the original. I can say it does fit on the skullshaver unit and thats all i can say positive about this replacement piece.  It does not cut well.  When you are finally finished shaving your head it still feels rough.  The design is completely different and a huge step backward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the skullshaver and would have recommended this product to anyone, but now that I have bought this replacement head. I am done with skullshaver I cannot waste my time with this product or support it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get a much better shave with just a regular electric face shaving unit. Too bad I liked the Skullshaver line.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. It is far less expensive than constantly buying shaving cream and razors every month. It gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> was trying to avoid a razor and shaving cream, this razor does not give the smooth cut that I was hoping for</li>
            <li> It charges when it wants to and it&#x27; cuts almost close enough but there isn&#x27;t anything else out there for bald men so I guess I like it kind of sort of.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made they should charge more and make them professional grade....clips brake blades wear quickly...INSTRUCTIONS SAY REPLACE YEARLY???CHEAPER USEING RAZOR BLADE....</li>
            <li> Works better than expected!!! I would recommend it to anyone who does not like to use a razor to shave their head.</li>
            <li> The replacement head i nothing compared to the original. It sounds like it&#x27;s gonna fall apart and feels like it&#x27;s pulling hair out rather than cutting it. I will not buy another replacement cutter. If I knew that this was all that was available as a replacement iI would never have bought the cutter.</li>
            <li> Ready to use this accessory when needed. Easy to used. Excellent product. I bought and extra one just in case I no have time to clean it often. Easy put in and take it out</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet, looking forward to when I have to change blades, I believe that the shaver could be a better product.</li>
            <li> This item is ok, I guess I expected more. I needed a continous  roll-over  to get almost a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give this a zero. It hardly cuts my beard. It&#x27;s not that the blades are dull, it&#x27;s that my beards hairs barely fit through the holes. And it&#x27;s not like my beard hairs are extra coarse. The previous two cutters performed fine. This cutter is terrible, I have to go back and forth over the same area so much that my skin is getting abrasions. So sorry I bought this several months in advance of having to replace my old heads, it&#x27;s outside of the return time.</li>
            <li> Wrong blades for skull shaver get the xl also on skull shaver owner says there will be one coming that takes one hour to charge and shaves for 90 minutes check after 7/26/14</li>
            <li> I will never use a regular razor again. this razor shaves really close and clean. I have no nicks or cuts</li>
            <li> While using it, l noticed it was not as sharpened as the original.&lt;br /&gt;Why is it so? l felt frustrated using it.</li>
            <li> The attachments for the skull shaver are shockingly good quality.  Unfortunately my experience with the actual Shaver and its inability to hold any electrical charge made me return it and all attachments.</li>
            <li> See the review of the shaver and the remarks of the replacement head therein. the replacement head has not been used, as yet, as the original head is still working fine.</li>
            <li> I like the X1 replacement heads better. Much closer shave than the ST blades. The flip up heads were nice but shave was not as close.</li>
            <li> Bought this with the Skull shaver. The Skull Shaver did not perform well at all. I did not use it enough to have to replace the blades. I can only assume that these blades work as poorly as the ones included with the original shaver.</li>
            <li> It is a great shaver I love using it every day keep your head shaved if you don&#x27;t like using a razor and shaving cream every day</li>
            <li> The Skullshaver Replacement Blades Xl (ie those that ship with the original unit - 5 stars) available here on Amazon for $16 are considerably better than this $13 replacement head. The Replacement Blades Xl cut longer hair closer - these $13 heads do neither well and consequently I&#x27;m no longer using these.</li>
            <li> cuts very good only drawback blades ars time consuming to take apart to clean,other than that they cut very close,still have not figured out how to get the middle  blade out,as always the chinese instructions are very useless on explaining how to maintain there products</li>
            <li> I am a black man, I believed this product would be perfect for me and hair type, however, I find that no matter how long I run the blades over my scalp, I still have the new lawn look, hair spots still remain. I further need too run my standby shaver over my head just to be sure. I even begun to shave my head every other day to maybe minumise the hair spots, not.I still use the product but it&#x27;s not the cure all.</li>
            <li> This product as worked perfectly for my fiance.  He loves the skull shaver and I wanted to be sure he had an extra head for when the first one wears out.</li>
