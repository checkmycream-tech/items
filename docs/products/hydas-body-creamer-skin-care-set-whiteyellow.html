            <li>The sponge head is nice and big.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two other brands and this one is superior.</li>
            <li>Normally it holds just fine.</li>
            <li>I have used these back lotion applicators for years, but the ones I had been getting were really getting to be cheaply made and broke easily.  </li>
            <li>Great for applying lotion to those hard to reach places.  </li>

            <li>The rollers glide easily over my back and the lotion comes out through them, and comes out evenly.</li>
            <li>the item, and my chronically dry skin likes it even better.  </li>
            <li>Passing it back and forth 4 or 5 times would be fine</li>
            <li>The Hydas Body Creamer Skin Care set seems to be very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Hi, I really  using the Hydas Body Creamer Set.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to rinse it out much, and it can travel in a suitcase without worry.</li>
            <li>It is very durable.</li>
            <li>Very durable as well.</li>
            <li>Really well made and this style of handle is a lot easier to use.  </li>
            <li>It is well made, very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I found this one for a few dollars more and it is really worth the additional amount.  </li>
            <li>This is mega better than the other (cheaper) ones.  </li>
            <li>Much better quality than the other one I had.</li>
            <li>I decided to bite the bullet and pay almost double for this one, but was it ever worth it!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and hangs to dry.</li>
            <li>The exfoliator has not fallen off yet and does not show signs off yet and its been about 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reach and feel of use is not bad... reaches the parts of my back that I need it to</li>
            <li>For those of us who love taking hot showers for which we pay with an itchy dry back, this miracle set is the answer.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job getting lotion on those hard to reach parts of your back.  </li>
            <li>Would not recommend for older people.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this version of the roller lotion applicator.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I originally saw this exact same brand in a high end catalog for twice the price, I essentially got 2 for 1!!!!</li>
            <li>This brand is well worth the extra money!</li>
            <li>The roller balls are smooth all over - no rough parts to scratch your back.</li>
            <li>The other attachments are fine but that is not what I bought the product for.</li>
            <li>I live in Alaska</li>
            <li>This really gets the whole back and seems to be a well-built article.  </li>
            <li>It can be filled and used several times, so it will have to be a lotion you use regularly</li>
            <li>I have not had the product for a long time, but is appears to be well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and the lotion does not dry up.  </li>
            <li>Be sure you put the back, holding the cream, on tight.  </li>
            <li>I have no doubt in my mind that the head was on firmly and securely.</li>
            <li>Works well with the two attachments I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>Really have only tried the sponge so can&#x27;t comment on others.  </li>
            <li>I really like the design of this back brush.  </li>
            <li>This is a much easier way of putting lotion on my back than any thing i have ever tried, The unit is sturdily conctructed and works the way it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased a cheaper applicator which kept loosing the little balls.  </li>
            <li>It works as designed with no mess.  </li>
            <li>Not sure what the other head is for, but even with the two, it is an outstanding product and worth the extra costs.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to use on ones back.</li>
            <li>Hard to reach spots are now easy to reach.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that eventually the loofah and sponge will wear out and I don&#x27;t see any evidence that you can order new heads.  </li>
            <li>I saw the favorable reviews for the Hydas and decided to take a chance on it since I really needed something to reach my back with itchy, dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>the round balls in the head (5) came out, making more of a mess.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this particular set of skin care utensils, I read a lot of descriptions and comments on a variety of other skin care sets sold on Amazon.  </li>

            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I originally saw this exact same brand in a high end catalog for twice the price, I essentially got 2 for 1!!!!</li>
            <li> This brand is well worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> The roller balls are smooth all over - no rough parts to scratch your back.</li>
            <li> The other attachments are fine but that is not what I bought the product for.</li>
            <li> I live in Alaska</li>
            <li> This really gets the whole back and seems to be a well-built article.  </li>
            <li> It can be filled and used several times, so it will have to be a lotion you use regularly</li>
            <li> I have not had the product for a long time, but is appears to be well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and the lotion does not dry up.  </li>
            <li> Be sure you put the back, holding the cream, on tight.  </li>
            <li> I have no doubt in my mind that the head was on firmly and securely.</li>
            <li> Works well with the two attachments I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Really have only tried the sponge so can&#x27;t comment on others.  </li>
            <li> I really like the design of this back brush.  </li>
            <li> This is a much easier way of putting lotion on my back than any thing i have ever tried, The unit is sturdily conctructed and works the way it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased a cheaper applicator which kept loosing the little balls.  </li>
            <li> It works as designed with no mess.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what the other head is for, but even with the two, it is an outstanding product and worth the extra costs.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to use on ones back.</li>
            <li> Hard to reach spots are now easy to reach.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that eventually the loofah and sponge will wear out and I don&#x27;t see any evidence that you can order new heads.  </li>
            <li> I saw the favorable reviews for the Hydas and decided to take a chance on it since I really needed something to reach my back with itchy, dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> the round balls in the head (5) came out, making more of a mess.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this particular set of skin care utensils, I read a lot of descriptions and comments on a variety of other skin care sets sold on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> High quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes difficult to find really useful products.</li>
            <li> another&#x27;s dry back or--best of all--to dispense lotion to one another&#x27;s back.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate it in the winter when my skin gets dry and itchey at spots I cannot reach with my hands.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m just too rough with it, but the yellow sponge ripped off after the second week.</li>
            <li> Handle is long and sturdy.</li>
            <li> This body creamer is much better quality than the less expensive competitors.</li>
            <li> so I have problems with dry skin all winter long.</li>
            <li> I have bought other body creamers that didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The lotion would dry up in the container.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; stays attached and isn&#x27;t loose.</li>
            <li> It could have just a little larger resivoir for the product but not a real problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any trouble with mine, and use it daily.</li>
            <li> No more dry, itchy back!!!  </li>
            <li> I like the other attachments also.</li>
            <li> apply liquid soap and the handle [unlike others on the market] is both sturdy and extremely well designed.</li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars except that when I tried the other thing use to scrub the back when you shower, it&#x27;s hard to take it out again.</li>
            <li> The box does not contain a user&#x27;s guide; just use common sense when attaching and removing the three different heads.</li>
            <li> Average quality for this type of brush.</li>
            <li> I do not know if my lotion is too thick or if the applicator is not working properly.</li>
            <li> I am in the elderly category with less strength in the hands.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I put stuff that was too thick in it the first time but have gotten a thinner lotion</li>
            <li> it does not come with directions so it took a little bit to figure out.</li>
            <li> Although the detachable brush, sponge, and lotion dispenser heads are a bit tight to slide in and out of the handle, I got the knack to do this without cracking the heavy duty handle.</li>
            <li> The cheaper options are a thinner plastic that crack within a few months.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> so I bought this item so that I could put lotion on my back but found out that the foam and the rollers both made my skin break out and itch worse.</li>
            <li> This one is quality construction and the balls have stayed in it during the few weeks I have used it.</li>
            <li> I was wanting an applicator that would help me apply lotion to places I can not easily reach.</li>
            <li> Bad shoulders, so this really helps.  </li>
            <li> I was careless once and the back fell off.</li>
            <li> AWKWARD CAPS DO NOT SCREW ON PROPERLY</li>
            <li> a thinner lotion, aveeno is too thick.</li>
            <li> I was convinced the rollers would gum up, that no lotion would actually be applied, and that any number of other things would go wrong and leave me frustrated.  </li>
            <li> I have bad shoulders and a back that itches and won&#x27;t quit</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased a less expensive type and, you guessed it, was horribly disappointed as the roller balls started to fall out</li>
            <li> The quality seems to have gotten worse as time goes on.</li>
            <li> It was my fault, I got careless.</li>
            <li> and it became useless.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product because the removal of attachments is difficult.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of the &amp;#34;rolling ball&amp;#34; method of applying lotion.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is so great when your back is dry and itchy. Hard to reach spots are now easy to reach. The lotion spreads evenly and perfect amount. Easy to fill with lotion</li>
            <li> I was wanting an applicator that would help me apply lotion to places I can not easily reach. I do not know if my lotion is too thick or if the applicator is not working properly. I have to go over an area several times to get any of the lotion to dispense. The rolling balls are nice but I would like more lotion to be applied to the skin. I do not have the time to spend going over an area several times. Passing it back and forth 4 or 5 times would be fine but I find myself going over an area a dozen times or more before I feel any lotion on the site. The other attachments are fine but that is not what I bought the product for.</li>
            <li> This product is well designed and well constructed. Comes with lotion applicator, regular sponge and loofah sponge. Handy and versatile.</li>
            <li> I have had several lotion applying items, but they always fell apart.  The lotion would dry up in the container.  This one is 100% better!  It is very sturdy and the lotion does not dry up.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The Hydas Body Creamer Skin Care set seems to be very sturdy. I loaded it with the lotion, tightened the head, started to use the product, and the head came off, falling to the floor, lotion over everything, the round balls in the head (5) came out, making more of a mess. I have no doubt in my mind that the head was on firmly and securely. The product works well, if the head will stay on.</li>
            <li> THIS WELL MADE PRODUCT ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY, AND WAS PUT TO USE AFTER EVERY SHOWER.  IT GETS TO PLACES ON YOUR BACK, THAT YOU  CANNOT DO YOURSELF.  I&#x27;M USING A MEN&#x27;S SKIN MOISTURE LOTION, AND I FIND IT MOST PLEASANT ROLLING IT OVER MY BACK.</li>
            <li> Hi, I really  using the Hydas Body Creamer Set.  I get my body cream on evenly and I can now relieve my winter skin.  Thanks for this great product.&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth A Stratton~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003J9R50W/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
            <li> I did some research on different items like this one and found most people like this item. So I bought it not knowing what to expect, I am glad I did. Very strong (as I am a man) and distrubutes the lotion evenly. I would recommend this item to anyone who has problems reaching the back area to apply lotion.</li>
            <li> Works well with the two attachments I&#x27;ve used so far. Will have to wait for warmer weather to assess the others. The mfg SHOULD sell individual tools to the consumer..</li>
            <li> This body creamer is much better quality than the less expensive competitors. The cheaper options are a thinner plastic that crack within a few months. This brand is well worth the extra money!</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 weeks and the plastic handle broke.  I duct taped it back together but the handle broke again in a different place 2 days later..&lt;br /&gt;The product is mostly a good product except for the cheaply made handle. If it had a sturdy handle, it would be great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to apply lotion on my back.  This does the job perfectly without having to bother my husband!</li>
            <li> AWKWARD CAPS DO NOT SCREW ON PROPERLY</li>
            <li> This is mega better than the other (cheaper) ones.  I know, I&#x27;ve had a bunch and this one feels so much more substantial.  I&#x27;m sure it will last for many years, but when it comes time to replace I&#x27;ll order another one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother in law, and she loves it. It&#x27;s very nicely made, and perfect for applying lotion to hard-to-reach areas.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!  Before purchasing this particular set of skin care utensils, I read a lot of descriptions and comments on a variety of other skin care sets sold on Amazon.  Hydas looked sturdy.  It is!  Although the detachable brush, sponge, and lotion dispenser heads are a bit tight to slide in and out of the handle, I got the knack to do this without cracking the heavy duty handle. Neither my husband nor I are always conveniently available to one another to scratch one another&#x27;s dry back or--best of all--to dispense lotion to one another&#x27;s back.  This product solves our problem effectively.  We are very satisfied with this product.  The box does not contain a user&#x27;s guide; just use common sense when attaching and removing the three different heads.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these.  One to use the sponge and loofah applicators in the shower, and another one to use the sponge and rolling balls to apply toner and lotion.  I originally saw this exact same brand in a high end catalog for twice the price, I essentially got 2 for 1!!!!</li>
            <li> more pieces than neccesary(which i may never use), but otherwise i love it. sturdy design( my last one broke) and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product because the removal of attachments is difficult. I am in the elderly category with less strength in the hands. Would not recommend for older people. Really have only tried the sponge so can&#x27;t comment on others.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had used this after my showers; however after awhile being plastic (and I dropped it twice), it cracked and soon just fell apart. I would not buy another.</li>
            <li> I really like the design of this back brush.  It meets all my needs and the feature of being able to change heads makes it very useful and a good value for the money.  The only downside is that eventually the loofah and sponge will wear out and I don&#x27;t see any evidence that you can order new heads.  But I imagine it will be quite a while before that happens.</li>
            <li> Bad shoulders, so this really helps.  Well made and easy to change heads.  Haven&#x27;t used the cream applicator yet.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m just too rough with it, but the yellow sponge ripped off after the second week. Now I use the sponge as a regular loofa, and use the exfoliating head for my back instead. The exfoliator has not fallen off yet and does not show signs off yet and its been about 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reach and feel of use is not bad... reaches the parts of my back that I need it to (I don&#x27;t have a lot of flexibility when it comes to touching my back) without too much effort.</li>
            <li> Ordered me one, then one daughter, then six more to give as gifts and all had rave reviews--especially for the live-alones for reaching that middle back area.</li>
            <li> This is the best back cleaning and lotion adding device I have ever used.  It is easy to use and hangs to dry. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and easy to use.  Does a great job getting lotion on those hard to reach parts of your back.  I used this all last summer and never had any problems, now that it&#x27;s warming up I got it out again and I&#x27;m still using it.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the sponge or exfoliating pad, but they seem well constructed.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for a family member with mobility issues.  I chose this product because it had the best reviews.  It was a good choice.  The handle is sturdy and the rollers seems to work well on the lotion applicator. I have not had the product for a long time, but is appears to be well worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the item especially the roller system. Definitely would recommend this item and am planning on purchasing a couple more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have owned three of the \\&quot;as seen on tv\\&quot; models of the lotion roller. They all had problems with the lotion not rolling through the balls, the balls falling out, or the lotion shifting in the head and not coming out evenly (when it did come out). I saw the favorable reviews for the Hydas and decided to take a chance on it since I really needed something to reach my back with itchy, dry winter skin. I was pleasantly surprised! It is sturdy and well made. The rollers glide easily over my back and the lotion comes out through them, and comes out evenly. At this point I am very impressed with the Hydas and agree that it is worth the extra money over the \\&quot;as seen on tv\\&quot; brand.</li>
            <li> This is a much easier way of putting lotion on my back than any thing i have ever tried, The unit is sturdily conctructed and works the way it is supposed to. It could have just a little larger resivoir for the product but not a real problem.</li>
            <li> This seems pretty nice, but we haven&#x27;t really used it much, so the 5 stars is in anticipation. I feels sturdy, but a bit big for traveling. I love the fact that the lotion dispenser has a lid so you don&#x27;t have to rinse it out much, and it can travel in a suitcase without worry.</li>
            <li> I only use the rollers for applying lotion. This is the best product that I&#x27;ve found on the market. Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Much better quality than the other one I had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only using the lotion applicator. It works as designed with no mess.  I&#x27;ve not had any trouble with mine, and use it daily. I&#x27;ve had two other brands and this one is superior.</li>
            <li> Well made and so easy to use.  I hope to get another set for a spare. For those of us who love taking hot showers for which we pay with an itchy dry back, this miracle set is the answer.  Great, well made product.</li>
            <li> I purchased only for the &amp;#34;scrubber&amp;#34; function. Handle is long and sturdy. No complaints here. The &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; stays attached and isn&#x27;t loose.</li>
            <li> I have bad shoulders and a back that itches and won&#x27;t quit so I bought this item so that I could put lotion on my back but found out that the foam and the rollers both made my skin break out and itch worse. I ended up throwing it away. For people that don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I would imagine this product would be good and it did get to places that one cannot get to themselves.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had surgery and was not allowed to bend fuly. It worked great. I love it, and it works just as it states. I have only one caution.  Be sure you put the back, holding the cream, on tight.  I was careless once and the back fell off. It was my fault, I got careless. Normally it holds just fine.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I live in Alaska so I have problems with dry skin all winter long. Loved it so much I ordered another for my mother. It is very durable.</li>
            <li> I have owned many version of the roller lotion applicator. The quality seems to have gotten worse as time goes on. I took a chance on this one based on a review. Wow! I can&#x27;t get over the difference in quality. The roller balls are smooth all over - no rough parts to scratch your back. The handle is better too. I highly recommend this version of the roller lotion applicator.</li>
            <li> Average quality for this type of brush.</li>
            <li> This really gets the whole back and seems to be a well-built article.  So far so good!  I like it!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of the &amp;#34;rolling ball&amp;#34; method of applying lotion.  I was convinced the rollers would gum up, that no lotion would actually be applied, and that any number of other things would go wrong and leave me frustrated.  I could not have been more wrong.  I LOVE this product.  Wish I would have bought it decades ago.  I especially love the clear cover which keeps dust, lint, hair, etc. from getting into the rolling balls when not in use.  This product is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Very good quality compared to the &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; version of this. I would have given this 5 stars except that when I tried the other thing use to scrub the back when you shower, it&#x27;s hard to take it out again.So i am only using the one that dispense lotion on my back.</li>
            <li> Love this! I had previously purchased a less expensive type and, you guessed it, was horribly disappointed as the roller balls started to fall out and it became useless. I especially appreciate it in the winter when my skin gets dry and itchey at spots I cannot reach with my hands.  I liked it so much I gave them as gifts to friends.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting something that would help me apply lotion to my bag. This works great for that. I like the other attachments also.</li>
            <li> Great for applying lotion to those hard to reach places.  Very durable as well.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased a cheaper applicator which kept loosing the little balls.  I found this one for a few dollars more and it is really worth the additional amount.  This one is quality construction and the balls have stayed in it during the few weeks I have used it.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before I purchased this one.  It was more expensive that the others but it was worth it.  The handle is molded durable plastic and easy to grip even when soapy.  It has three heads which are interchangeable.  The pull out and insert heads are easy to change and they hold in place, this is an excellent design that works.  The lotion dispenser head easily screws on and off.  It has a cap to keep it from drying out between uses.  The loofah head is great, better than I have found in loofahs I have owned.  Not sure what the other head is for, but even with the two, it is an outstanding product and worth the extra costs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this item. In fact it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the yellow sponge to reach each part of my back in the shower......apply liquid soap and the handle [unlike others on the market] is both sturdy and extremely well designed.</li>
            <li> I have a rash on my back and no one to lotion it so it seemed like the perfect thing.  Unfortunately I put stuff that was too thick in it the first time but have gotten a thinner lotion and it works much better.  It definitely solved my problem.</li>
            <li> This thing is exactly what I wanted!  I&#x27;m ordering another so that I can keep one in the shower. I don&#x27;t like having to switch the head after showering. I&#x27;ve recommended this to friends. No more dry, itchy back!!!  One warning--do not put oil in the applicator because it will leak.</li>
            <li> I have used these back lotion applicators for years, but the ones I had been getting were really getting to be cheaply made and broke easily.  I decided to bite the bullet and pay almost double for this one, but was it ever worth it!  I love it so much more than any I have every owned.  Really well made and this style of handle is a lot easier to use.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have bought other body creamers that didn&#x27;t last very long. This one is more substantial and I expect it will last longer.</li>
            <li> I love this combination of brushes.  I can give different treatments to my back and finish off with moisture before I towel off.  They only thing it does not come with directions so it took a little bit to figure out.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Highly recommend to use on ones back. Well worth the money.  High quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes difficult to find really useful products.</li>
            <li> I have waited until I used this for a while.  It works better than I had hoped.  I only use it to apply lotion and it does that vey well.  It is well made, very sturdy.  The rollers are removable so if they clog up or need to be cleaned, it will be easy.  In all, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things I have found, not problems but tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a thinner lotion, aveeno is too thick. I have a folded wash cloth on the counter where I use it.  A couple of light taps on the roller side, before taking the cover off for use, keeps the lotion against the rollers and gives a nice even coating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the item, and my chronically dry skin likes it even better.  Originally only used it on my back but now use it on my arms, legs and front.  It leaves an even film, feels nicer than applying by hand.</li>
            <li> This came with 3 applicator heads, which is great. I&#x27;ve only used the loofa type scrubber, it works great to exfoliate. The sponge head is nice and big. The roller applicator will be great for applying sunblock to your back, but we aren&#x27;t in that season yet. It can be filled and used several times, so it will have to be a lotion you use regularly, that&#x27;s why I think it will be great for sunblock. All the heads snap on and off easily</li>
