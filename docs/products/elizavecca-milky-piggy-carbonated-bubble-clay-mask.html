            <li>This mask is awesome.</li>
            <li>However the quality is awesome.</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite beauty products!!!!</li>

            <li>I love this mask!!!</li>
            <li>I washed it off after 5 minutes with warm water and my skin looked great!</li>

            <li>which is surprising.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fair price.</li>
            <li>I was able to leave it on for 5mins and it so itchy!</li>

            <li>Just used this mask for the 1st time and I love the way it bubbles and pops!</li>
            <li>Love this mask!</li>
            <li>but my skin is so smooth after!!</li>
            <li>I love the results!</li>
            <li>but I am still kind of worried.</li>
            <li>then i wash it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I have oily/sensitive skin so after drying off my face i put some toner and my face feels warm, reddish and its still itchy.</li>
            <li>and it really did make my face look flawless.</li>
            <li>Also, be warned that it feels a bit warm.</li>
            <li>(so it&#x27;s very handy for those who like it clean)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from that, I would say my skin felt very smooth and cleaned.</li>
            <li>Make sure use some cream after washing your face.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this clay mask.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a cute packaging with a plastic spoon to scoop the products out</li>
            <li>followed the instructions and began to feel the carbonation working its magic perhaps 1-1/2 minutes in as it warmed up my face.</li>
            <li>but I plan to use this more to see the long-term effects.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>After rinsing it off my face was soooooo smooth!</li>
            <li>Novelty product - more cool than effective.</li>
            <li>really cool!</li>
            <li>Love this product so much fun</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling so smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>it takes a while for it to completley wash off but its definetly worth it !</li>
            <li>Other than that, the seller and everything is good!</li>
            <li>Just tried this product for the first time and I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>I then apply my regular moisturizer and my face looked so good.</li>
            <li>This is really cool.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun and totally worth the results!</li>
            <li>You have to spread it on somewhat quick otherwise</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve never used this kind of facial mask before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun mask to do with people and it helped cleaned my sister&#x27;s blackheads out a bit.</li>
            <li>This product left my skin feeling so fresh, smooth and clean!</li>
            <li>it felt kind of hot and was a bit red.</li>
            <li>So anyone who has sensitive/dry skin like me, think about it first before getting this product and just do some research.</li>
            <li>I left it on for 20 minutes per most reviews and while it didn&#x27;t make my skin feel itchy</li>
            <li>The bubbling feels funny and can itch a bit.</li>
            <li>Apparently this product works for all skin types, which I thought it should fine with my skin.</li>
            <li>kinda has a cooling affect on my face and made my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>So fun and makes your skin soft as can be!!</li>
            <li>After a while it kind of cooled down a bit</li>
            <li>Just make sure to put on some moisturizer because your skin will be a bit dry.</li>
            <li>but it lets you know it&#x27;s REALLY working.  </li>
            <li>Massaging it after 5 minutes and rinsing it off took longer than I expected--perhaps I put too much product on?</li>
            <li>but hopefully they like it just as much as I do.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the mask is very goopy and you have to work fast to get it distributed across your face, otherwise it starts bubbling up.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this product due to my sensitive skin, but glad that I took a chance at this product.</li>
            <li>Left my face feeling super soft!</li>
            <li>If your face starts getting itchy while the mask is bubbling up, it&#x27;s totally normal.</li>
            <li>My mom on the other hand was fine, since she has also have sensitive/dry skin.</li>
            <li>Came early, a plus!</li>
            <li>I ordered this on August 11, 2015 and received it on August 15; I was really surprised by how fast I got it since it was a last minute</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I guess I am that sensitive.</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft, pores are smaller, and the majority of my black heads are gone.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use warm water and not lukewarm or cold water since this mask is so hard to remove.</li>
            <li>It made my face so soft and not red</li>
            <li>It arrived earlier than i expected it to which is an absolute plus for me.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry skin so after washing it off my face</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It eliminates some of my black heads and leaves my face baby soft.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to apply to dry, uncleansed face and leave on for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;ll only last for a few minutes anyways.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so different from any other mask, the bubbling tickles!</li>
            <li> sisters and I have been eyeing this product for a while now due to the rave we hear on Youtube and other Korean beauty sites.</li>
            <li> waste of money!</li>
            <li> For me, it made the pores on my nose look really small.  </li>
            <li> The bubble-pop foaming effect did feel weird on the skin, but I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this.</li>
            <li> The bubbles weren&#x27;t as bad as I expected but you can def feel them working.  </li>
            <li> So basically after leaving this baby on your face for about 5 minutes and it&#x27;s already bubbled up like crazy just massage it to your face for a few seconds</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use it</li>

            <li> really cool! kinda has a cooling affect on my face and made my skin super soft! it takes a while for it to completley wash off but its definetly worth it !</li>
            <li> This mask is awesome. It itches when its bubbly but thats about it. It made my face so soft and not red which is surprising.</li>
            <li> $10 for a bottle of Bubble clay facial mask. It&#x27;s a fair price. However the quality is awesome. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve never used this kind of facial mask before. It cleaned my face thoroughly. Make sure use some cream after washing your face.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  waste of money!</li>
            <li> Left my face feeling super soft! The bubbles leave a tingling feeling when activated and I feel it cleans my face amazingly!</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this clay mask. It arrived earlier than i expected it to which is an absolute plus for me. I only use this once a week just to remove all the gunk and left over make up from my pores. It eliminates some of my black heads and leaves my face baby soft. I even made my mom use it and she absolutely love it. The only thing i didn&#x27;t like is that there are no instructions in english so i had to read it from a website. So basically after leaving this baby on your face for about 5 minutes and it&#x27;s already bubbled up like crazy just massage it to your face for a few seconds then i wash it off with warm water. Make sure to use warm water and not lukewarm or cold water since this mask is so hard to remove. If your face starts getting itchy while the mask is bubbling up, it&#x27;s totally normal. And it&#x27;ll only last for a few minutes anyways. I then apply my regular moisturizer and my face looked so good.</li>
            <li> Just tried this product for the first time and I&#x27;m in love.  I was afraid to use it bc I have sensitive skin but i don&#x27;t have any redness or irritation.  My skin is super soft, pores are smaller, and the majority of my black heads are gone.  The bubbles weren&#x27;t as bad as I expected but you can def feel them working.  Id def buy this product again</li>
            <li> Mine came today, so at night i tried it. From a youtube video they said you should use it with unwashed face so i did. I was able to leave it on for 5mins and it so itchy! But i can feel the bubble popping at after a while i massages the bubble for 2 mins and rinse it off. I have oily/sensitive skin so after drying off my face i put some toner and my face feels warm, reddish and its still itchy. I guess I am that sensitive. I dont know how I should feel about this product, it seemed to be working but ghe itchness and redness is a no-no for me. I guess i can try it again and see what happens if my face will react the same way after second use. Question. How often can you use this product?</li>
            <li> The bubbles, the bubbles, my bubbles!</li>
            <li> Great! I love how it makes my skin/face look and feel afterwards!</li>
            <li> Love this product so much fun and it really did make my face look flawless. I&#x27;ve been struggling with outbreaks here and there from stress and this product worked wonders. Will deffinently buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this mask!!! It tickles when it starts to foam up but it lets you know it&#x27;s REALLY working.  I heard of this from meme box and wanted to try it but didn&#x27;t want anything in the box since I&#x27;ve never tried anything like this before but now I want the box.  It leaves your face feeling so smooth and clean.  One of my favorite beauty products!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on August 11, 2015 and received it on August 15; I was really surprised by how fast I got it since it was a last minute purchase.&lt;br /&gt;My sisters and I have been eyeing this product for a while now due to the rave we hear on Youtube and other Korean beauty sites. We all have different skin types: my baby sister is normal-dry, my oldest sister is oily, and my younger sister and I have combination-oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a cute packaging with a plastic spoon to scoop the products out (so it&#x27;s very handy for those who like it clean) but I personally prefer using my hands. You have to spread it on somewhat quick otherwise the product will sit on the face and start its process of carbonating.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and began to feel the carbonation working its magic perhaps 1-1/2 minutes in as it warmed up my face. Massaging it after 5 minutes and rinsing it off took longer than I expected--perhaps I put too much product on? But it was quite messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, I would say my skin felt very smooth and cleaned. I don&#x27;t know if my face brightened at all but I plan to use this more to see the long-term effects. My sisters haven&#x27;t used it yet but hopefully they like it just as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face mask! So fun and makes your skin soft as can be!!</li>
            <li> I love this bubble mask! I&#x27;ve already purchased a backup. It&#x27;s so different from any other mask, the bubbling tickles! Besides the novelty of it, it cleans well too!</li>
            <li> I love this it&#x27;s an awesome mask and it bubbles a lot which is really awesome but it&#x27;s a pretty hard mask to wash off though but I do recommend it</li>
            <li> Just used this mask for the 1st time and I love the way it bubbles and pops! I googled YouTube tutorials and blog posts to get the directions in English. I left it on for 20 minutes per most reviews and while it didn&#x27;t make my skin feel itchy there was some tightness as the bubbles formed and popped. My skin feels softer and has a glow after use.</li>
            <li> This product left my skin feeling so fresh, smooth and clean! The instructions say to apply to dry, uncleansed face and leave on for 5 minutes. The mask immediately starts to foam and bubble, which gives a tingling sensation to your face. I washed it off after 5 minutes with warm water and my skin looked great!</li>
            <li> Love this mask! When it bubbles its itchy but my skin is so smooth after!!</li>
            <li> This is really cool.  It definitely bubbles up and foams on your face (almost instantly), and after about 30 seconds you start feeling it bubble and pop on your skin.  The mask worked well, and cleared out my daughter&#x27;s blackheads on her nose.  For me, it made the pores on my nose look really small.  The bubble-pop foaming effect did feel weird on the skin, but I&#x27;ll definitely keep using this.</li>
            <li> Novelty product - more cool than effective.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this product due to my sensitive skin, but glad that I took a chance at this product. I love the results! For those thinking about buying, know that the instructions and info are in Korean. However, you can find this information online, so fear not. The consistency of the mask is very goopy and you have to work fast to get it distributed across your face, otherwise it starts bubbling up. The bubbling feels funny and can itch a bit. Also, be warned that it feels a bit warm. I initially thought it was burning my face, but it&#x27;s just residual heat from where the oxygen is creating a chemical reaction- thus the bubbling. After rinsing it off my face was soooooo smooth! Just make sure to put on some moisturizer because your skin will be a bit dry. In all, if you are on the fence about buying this product, give it a try! It&#x27;s fun and totally worth the results!</li>
