    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product to replace the wonderful but discontinued Matrix Quality Control, and hoped this was it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used bumble and bumble&#x27;s Styling Creme for eight years, and it was the best product ever.</li>
            <li>THE BEST PRODUCT OUT THERE FOR HAIR!  </li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s best that they changed it -</li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve used for styling my hair and giving it body.  </li>
            <li>Is this the best styling product out there?  </li>
            <li>However, it still rates 5 stars as it is the best styling product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and this is the perfect product.  </li>
            <li>No driving around looking for the product, wondering if I got the best price!</li>
            <li>On my days off, I just run my hands through my hair with a bit of Styling Creme and maybe a bit of stronger gel, and the look is perfect - no need to fuss.  </li>
            <li>It is the best I have ever used</li>
            <li>My fav for a superb hold!</li>
            <li>Best styling creme out there!</li>
            <li>Best out there!</li>
            <li>good stuff!  </li>
            <li>A great styling cream...</li>
            <li>creme works great, never feels like there is any product on your hair.</li>
            <li>The product is great, the shipping and pricing were great....</li>
            <li>You can always rely on B&amp;B for great products.</li>
            <li>When I saw it on Amazon I ordered it knowing I would get another bottle of a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great as a styling creme and moisturizer for hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for your hair, great for holding styles.</li>
            <li>It still works great for me.</li>
            <li>So, I ordered some from Amazon, and now I have happy hair.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>It smells nice too!</li>
            <li>The scent is neutral and pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s product in my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks good and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>Loved the way my hair looked and felt after that product.</li>
            <li>Does not leave sticky residue but has good hold.  </li>
            <li>so I assumed that it was a good product.</li>
            <li>all in all a good ordering experience.</li>
            <li>He loved it.</li>
            <li>I would rate the hold factor as fair.  </li>
            <li>I LOVED the styling creme, and could have cried when I packed in in my carry-on (not my checked suitcase) by mistake, and it went in the garbage at security.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for styling your hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is so great for adding volume and texture to my very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It was great to be able to order the styling creme through Amazone.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hair product!</li>
            <li>I was impressed that the product kept my hair exactly as she had styled it, but without being sticky or \\&quot;hard-hat\\&quot; like.  </li>
            <li>ok!</li>
            <li>I love Bumble and Bumble Styling Creme!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I will purchase more when I run out!</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, it works great.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Before brushing my hair it has a fair bit of crunch to it for sure.</li>
            <li>This is the best price I&#x27;ve found on these products (thanks Amazon!)&lt;br /&gt;Styling</li>
            <li>B&amp;B Styling Creme is absolutely the greatest hair product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I loved being able to order this product on line and have it shipped in two days.  </li>
            <li>Always liked this product at the salon.</li>
            <li>this is great--goes on well, brings out the curl, makes hair shine and lift nicely.</li>
            <li>To me it&#x27;s just as good as the original!</li>
            <li>This was the best styling creme ever until one day I found my new bottle didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>I love this because it is light and yet styles the hair great.  </li>
            <li>great product and much cheaper that the salon where i get my hair cut!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still playing around with it, but so far it hasn&#x27;t impressed me.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine locks</li>
            <li>I have a ton of very fine hair that is wavy/curly</li>
            <li>Now, some reviewers state they used to love the product, but B&amp;b changed it, not so.</li>
            <li>It works, but the formula is different-thinner and more watery than the salon purchased one.</li>
            <li>Magic :).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this many times before, but purchased it in a store.  </li>
            <li>Like the Bumble and Bumble Styling Lotion better.</li>
            <li>why adding alcohol to anything would make it better to the consumer.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years since it is the best styling creme I have found.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve chucked many a product because of the perfumey smell.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thinner and easier for me to distribute in my hair - it also seems to give me a bit more lift.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, as I&#x27;ve been going through the process of \\&quot;greening\\&quot; all my toiletries, I&#x27;m glad to see that they changed it to be more environmentally-friendly.  </li>
            <li>Please be assured that your comments have been noted and will be circulated to the appropriate executives within our organization.    </li>
            <li>gives me more fullness and manageability than I&#x27;ve had with most mousses and gels.  </li>
            <li>Clarifying Shampoo (so cheap, but works so well!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I discovered the product, and I&#x27;ve been recommending it to friends as well as my hair dresser.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>No complaints :)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair styling product.  </li>
            <li>and I planned on purchasing many more items.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair product.  </li>
            <li>Many months ago I bought a bottle of Bumble and Bumble styling creme from my hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>and my hair tends look better the longer</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used many.  </li>
            <li>It gives it lots of body that lasts all day, plus it makes it more maleable.</li>
            <li>I tried again and used more.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product more than 2 years now</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair look more polished without putting in more effort.  </li>
            <li>I think you need a lot more than the suggested amount to get results.  </li>
            <li>I do love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love your products.</li>
            <li>Pricing is so much better than buying it from the Salon.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and find it adds the body that I need for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this styling creme for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product from Bumble &amp; Bumble.  </li>
            <li>The best part about the old product was that it provided excellent styling control and was not crunchy when dried.</li>
            <li>This is *the* best product for my fine, short hair.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with Silk Therapy (which makes my hair disperse the B&amp;B styling creme more easily and makes my hair easier to style).</li>
            <li>Maybe this is better for fine hair?  </li>
            <li>It does nothing for my hair other than creating incredible static cling.</li>
            <li>This product is the best way to get salon pretty hair - I only used a blow dryer for my roots, while holding a kid, so it was not anything fancy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all been fine and the product that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own to be too sticky, but mixing a drop with the Style Creme makes it more like the old formulation.</li>
            <li>this is illogical to me, and after using their product for a while and thinking my search for a great volumizer was finally over, I have to start all over again.  </li>
            <li>We hope you will continue to enjoy and have confidence in our quality  products.     </li>
            <li>But a dime-size drop rubbed primarily through the roots</li>
            <li>Gives me just enough volume and keeps my hair looking great.</li>
            <li>This creme is light weight and holds my hair without turning it into a haystack.</li>
            <li>I loved everything else so far</li>
            <li>It used to have wonderful hold without feeling at all stiff</li>
            <li>I was aware that Bumble and Bumble made excellent products, but had never really tried them.</li>
            <li>and I love the scent very much.</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;ve never written an online review before, but I depend on Amazon reviews for many purchases.</li>
            <li>This is thinner than the original version.  </li>
            <li>It seems the formula change was a result of restrictions being placed on some of the chemicals that were in the original product.</li>
            <li>can STILL buy the original formula version of this at salons and high-end beauty/hair supply stores.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never stiff, and the more creme I use, the more hold there is.</li>
            <li>Anyway I find the new formula really nice</li>
            <li>I still think they should have put some kind of new labeling in place to note the change.</li>
            <li>The old formula was light but still super effective and took a whopping 2 seconds to force my hair into submission.</li>
            <li>good the 2nd day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mostly used it on a curly/messy look but it also works on straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I Used this product for the first time and I am pleasantly surprised at how good my hair looked.</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair and this product is awesome!</li>
            <li>Decent product, I&#x27;ll have to play around with it more.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t using the older version, so I don&#x27;t have a basis for comparison to the formula that might (or might not) have been so much better.  </li>
            <li>I am a product junkie and have used many high end styling cremes and mousses and find that this makes my hair look the healthiest.</li>
            <li>My stylist used this along with a couple of drops of the b &amp; b defrizz and my hair has great sheen to it and not weighed down at all.  </li>
            <li>I noticed many reviewers complaining about the new formula.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that I have less fly aways when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I can brush my hair after using this and have both hold/memory and volume without flakes, BUT even though my hair still looks natural, it feels like it&#x27;s coated with something synthetic and very lightly sticky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times (shower, apply as directed, sleep), and my hair looks great when I wake up.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available on line.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Also, I find that it is best to use it only every other time I wash my hair or it seems to build up on the hair.</li>
            <li>JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF HOLD.</li>
            <li>I received this, unscrewed the cap and something wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally weightless going on, which means you better have some pretty fine hair to really make it feel manageable.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but provides a good medium for styling and also minimizes frizz.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I used the old formula for years &amp; it was amazing...</li>
            <li>It has the texture of a runny gel and only gives moderate hold (but the hold has great memory).</li>
            <li>and I also don&#x27;t have to use very much to achieve the results I want.    </li>
            <li>My hair is fine but naturally wavy.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I noticed a difference in the product</li>
            <li>and it was also the first time I bought it from a non authorized dealer.</li>
            <li>I bought this after watching the videos on Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s website, and I do not think that it is worth so much money.</li>
            <li>The product maintains its  performance, fragrance and texture and our stylists say they like it better than before (if that&#x27;s possible).  </li>
            <li>Sincerely,     Patricia Anderson  Global Consumer Communications</li>
            <li>You can alternate it with your favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty convinced this is a counterfeit product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavily scented and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>First I used chat</li>
            <li>this was my first time buying B and B products from anywhere but B and B</li>
            <li>The concentration of the creme is much lesser and it does not do any magic to my hair.</li>
            <li>and  this is the first time I ordered from amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on  my hair this summer while it was a very humid one!</li>
            <li>i look so pretty now.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>Having had a drip-dry hairdo all my life, I started using curly mousse as my brown hair became more and more mixed with white, and my hair texture changed.</li>
            <li>but the few good reviews led me to give it a try.</li>
            <li>KEEP THE HAIR FEELING CLEAN AND SOFT TO THE TOUCH!</li>
            <li>I brought it to my new hair stylist, and he was surprised &amp; extremely pleased at how well it works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for giving my blow dryer a rest - I can just comb my hair into place and let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li>This is more than I normally pay for a hair product and was expecting a little more performance from it.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for my baby-fine, very straight hair.</li>
            <li>it works ok to hold the curl in my hair which is why I gave it 2 stars, but not as well or for as long as the bottle of styling creme</li>
            <li>I am going to go ahead and get the original one from my stylist even though they are few dollars more.</li>
            <li>I also loved the previous formula - the new styling creme just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair has always been a bit thin, and with this product not only do I have more volume, but the illusion that my hair has more body, more lift,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inspiring me to sell empty bottles to people and tell them it&#x27;s a new super lightweight formula called \\&quot;Nuthing\\</li>
            <li>This lotion is great when I want to blow dry straight or let air dry curly.</li>
            <li>and they mess with the product or create their own version.</li>
            <li>Styles my short hair quickly and with the right amount of hold.  </li>
            <li>The real styling creme gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li>The list of ingredients is also much shorter.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for anything that will control the FUZZ and this really does the trick.</li>
            <li>They added alcohol to the thickening spray (now called thickening hairspray) making it sticky and very drying for your hair.  </li>
            <li>I never feel like there is too much product in my hair</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;crispiness\\&quot; is definitely gone and I still have light hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for stocking it.</li>
            <li>I generally really like Bumble and Bumble product.</li>
            <li>And you&#x27;re not saving that much money buying here through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It dries without much of an odor, but it smells like melting plastic when you rub it on your hands and hair.  </li>
            <li>The consistency of the product was different, and it also felt very different on my hair - not at all even remotely similar to what I&#x27;ve experienced when buying it from either my hair stylist or from Target.</li>
            <li>--I could go buy cheap mousse at the drugstore and get the same results.</li>
            <li>and I really liked,it.</li>
            <li>They really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have used this for years thanks to my hair designer Diane</li>
            <li>I want to wear my hair straight</li>
            <li>it holds the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I would much rather use a drug store styling cream brand.</li>
            <li>But from my very unscientific sampling of many different products, this is the clear winner for me.</li>
            <li>It is certainly not the intention of Bumble and bumble to disappoint any of our consumers by changing their favorite product.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t mean that in a good way.  </li>
            <li>in other words I couldn&#x27;t find a magical product.</li>
            <li>Seems to be different than original formula</li>
            <li>Though that would explain why I like using it again, after I&#x27;d stopped for a little while - I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine &amp; doesn&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
            <li>The new(ish) formula is so light that I&#x27;m convinced, much like the emperor&#x27;s new clothes, it only works if you believe in it.</li>
            <li>The old formula was great, but this one is not nearly as good.  </li>
            <li>It allows for a smooth straight look or if I want I can go curly and this product holds the shape and body all day long.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that otherwise looks like &#x27;little girl&#x27; hair without this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worth it to me to use products that I love if they contain harmful ingredients of any sort.</li>
            <li>Hands down my most fav hair product ever.</li>
            <li>, pixie hair cut any way I want (spiky, mohawk, flat and clean, etc.).</li>
            <li>I used to love Paul Mitchell Styling Foam for body, but this product gives body with a softer, less crinkly feel to the hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never used this product before, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it \\&quot;used to be,\\&quot; but it seems like a decent hair cream.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use much hair product because my laziness far outweighs my desire to look presentable.</li>
            <li>I emailed them back one more time politely, and told them I am planning on mailing the item back to the company myself</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a hybrid of all those products, but very subtle for a natural hold that makes it look like you have great hair.</li>
            <li>In early 2007 they changed the formulation, and now it does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>In my mind, you don&#x27;t change something that already works great and make it become mediocre.</li>
            <li>but now it doesn&#x27;t give my hair nearly as much body as the old creme did.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I just received my refund today, so at least they&#x27;re honest.</li>
            <li>Normally if I were rating this product, it gets 5 stars without hesitation.</li>
            <li>I can pretty much style my short</li>
            <li>Most products are too heavy.</li>
            <li>I use it on my natural African American hair and it makes my curls fluffy and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I do think the price of Bumble and Bumble products is high, but these products aren&#x27;t filled with water, alcohol, endless silicones, and revolting scents.  </li>
            <li>i have very thick hair and this product is the only one that i found that works great all day and night with one application</li>
            <li>Also consider their new styling gel.</li>
            <li>The new formula just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li>This new formula has no styling hold whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I have continued to use this product, but now I mix it with the new B&amp;B Texture product.</li>
            <li>I live an hour away from any beauty salon that might carry this creme.</li>
            <li>I contacted Bumble and Bumble reqarding their new formula.  </li>
            <li>or if they just gave me this answer because I live in CA.  </li>
            <li>the new stuff works</li>
            <li>I use it to tame my little fly aways without looking like</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s rotten that they sell the product in the same exact bottle without any notation that it&#x27;s a new formula.</li>
            <li>This was a much better price than the salon where I usually purchase.</li>
            <li>I can use this styling creme at my roots for all day volume or in the rest of my hair for soft all day volume!</li>
            <li>that will do the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>It was the first time I&#x27;d had such a product that worked so well.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I used about a tablespoon total - and noticed NO difference at all.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff but can&#x27;t usually justify the hit to the wallet</li>
            <li>This product is light and does not weigh down your hair or make it \\&quot;crunchy.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>compared the new bottle with the old, and the ingredients are dramatically changed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the old formula for years and now the new one for a month now.</li>
            <li>To keep up with the  environmentally conscious times Styling Crème has been reformulated to  comply with new regulations enacted by the Air Resource Board (CARB), a  division of the California Environmental Protection Agency.  </li>
            <li>it is almost exactly the same as the old Bumble &amp; Bumble formula.</li>
            <li>Check B&amp;b&#x27;s website to find a place near you that sells it.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder-length layered wavy hair and like to have soft hold</li>
            <li>You cannot buy the old product anyplace though.</li>
            <li>So go support your local salon and buy the real thing somewhere else.</li>
            <li>I discovered this after receiving lots of compliments on days too busy to do anything else, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li>Just a fyi to the busy.</li>
            <li>My hair always feels soft and natural, like I have no product in at all.</li>
            <li>The quality, the consistency and the formula is completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>For work or home, I like a natural look without any noticeable scent, and that&#x27;s what this routine gives me.    </li>
            <li>really think I should be reimbursed for this styling creme and would think that the company that made this would want it back (hopefully at their expense).  </li>
            <li>I bought directly from B and B...</li>
            <li>I am throwing this out and ordering directly from B&amp;B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>: I received a bottle directly from B&amp;B and compared the two.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that this bottle was the real thing.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling &#x27;crisp&#x27; rather than soft even when I blow dry.</li>
            <li>I could see this being handy only for certain looks, but not for everyday - ergo, not worth the money in my case.</li>
            <li>I have stick straight, flat hair.  </li>
            <li>The creme is not smooth (as it was in my original bottle).  </li>
            <li>We regret to learn that you are not pleased with the results and we apologize that the old formula is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>I bought a new bottle and it definitely seems like the old formula.  </li>
            <li>The creme itself has a different texture as well, hard to describe except to say when you I look at the cremes side by side it has a look and feel of conditioner rather than the B and B direct styling creme which is slightly more tacky and gelatinous....</li>
            <li>I have very short, fine hair, that has a little bit of curl to it.</li>
            <li>if it air dries and straight if I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>It was getting to the point of a major haircut.</li>
            <li>No other product I have tried works as well.</li>
            <li>Both ways I find that it gives my hair just enough hold not to frizz up too much but absolutely does not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>Because I bought another bottle directly from B&amp;b at their website and not only is the product exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed to be, there&#x27;s about five to ten extra ingredients on the back</li>
            <li>This with a small drop of Bumble &amp; Bumble Brilliantine makes my hair full, thick and easy to style.</li>
            <li>Gives my fine thick hair the body it needs.  </li>
            <li>Little pricey, but worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I bought the old formula from Big Lots for $6.  </li>
            <li>I wish the company would bring back the old product</li>
            <li>As this was a &amp;#34;asked for&amp;#34; present - it was well received by my 27 year old nephew.  </li>
            <li>I only recently started using this product, and I suppose that means I have the new formula.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve bought new bottles of B&amp;B Styling Creme since I made this purchase from Amazon (from several different stores/hairstylists including Sephora)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used B&amp;B Styling Creme, so I&#x27;m not a disgruntled user of the previous formula.</li>
            <li>I also wrote to Bumble about their formula change and got the exact same response as the other reviewer.</li>
            <li>Yesterday morning I used this product, and today I still have great volume (almost impossible with my thin hair) and smooth cuticle.</li>
            <li>The following is their reply---obviously they aren&#x27;t going to bring back the old formula</li>
            <li>The only recommendation I would give is to be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li>In this case, it&#x27;s worth it to spend a few extra bucks to know you&#x27;re getting the legitimate product.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my hair either.</li>
            <li>The mousse was okay, but made my hair a little stiff.</li>
            <li>It feels like the original product when your hair is wet, but once it&#x27;s dried, it feels like you have nothing on your hair...</li>
            <li>I have really thick hair and most products just make it less manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have very very fine and very thin hair .</li>
            <li>It adds just enough control without seeming to weigh down my hair, or turning it into some greasy, silicone mess like so many other styling cremes do.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and thin, and my plan was to create some volume and manageability with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every product out there for my thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried for year to go through new products that come out, to tame frizz while looking and feeling natural.  </li>
            <li>I used to use just a little bit of the styling creme, because it made my hair too \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; if I didn&#x27;t heat style after applying, or used too much.  </li>
            <li>I have fine; limp hair that gets really dried out from highlighting, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and it&#x27;s the only styling product that works on my fine, thin hair to give it body.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of coarse hair that either looks really good or really bad.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product to replace the wonderful but discontinued Matrix Quality Control, and hoped this was it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used bumble and bumble&#x27;s Styling Creme for eight years, and it was the best product ever.</li>
            <li> THE BEST PRODUCT OUT THERE FOR HAIR!  </li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s best that they changed it -</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used for styling my hair and giving it body.  </li>
            <li> Is this the best styling product out there?  </li>
            <li> However, it still rates 5 stars as it is the best styling product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> and this is the perfect product.  </li>
            <li> No driving around looking for the product, wondering if I got the best price!</li>
            <li> On my days off, I just run my hands through my hair with a bit of Styling Creme and maybe a bit of stronger gel, and the look is perfect - no need to fuss.  </li>
            <li> It is the best I have ever used</li>
            <li> My fav for a superb hold!</li>
            <li> Best styling creme out there!</li>
            <li> Best out there!</li>
            <li> good stuff!  </li>
            <li> A great styling cream...</li>
            <li> creme works great, never feels like there is any product on your hair.</li>
            <li> The product is great, the shipping and pricing were great....</li>
            <li> You can always rely on B&amp;B for great products.</li>
            <li> When I saw it on Amazon I ordered it knowing I would get another bottle of a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great as a styling creme and moisturizer for hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for your hair, great for holding styles.</li>
            <li> It still works great for me.</li>
            <li> So, I ordered some from Amazon, and now I have happy hair.</li>
            <li> Great</li>
            <li> It smells nice too!</li>
            <li> The scent is neutral and pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s product in my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks good and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> Loved the way my hair looked and felt after that product.</li>
            <li> Does not leave sticky residue but has good hold.  </li>
            <li> so I assumed that it was a good product.</li>
            <li> all in all a good ordering experience.</li>
            <li> He loved it.</li>
            <li> I would rate the hold factor as fair.  </li>
            <li> I LOVED the styling creme, and could have cried when I packed in in my carry-on (not my checked suitcase) by mistake, and it went in the garbage at security.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for styling your hair.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is so great for adding volume and texture to my very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It was great to be able to order the styling creme through Amazone.  </li>
            <li> My favorite hair product!</li>
            <li> I was impressed that the product kept my hair exactly as she had styled it, but without being sticky or \\&quot;hard-hat\\&quot; like.  </li>
            <li> ok!</li>
            <li> I love Bumble and Bumble Styling Creme!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I will purchase more when I run out!</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, it works great.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Before brushing my hair it has a fair bit of crunch to it for sure.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I&#x27;ve found on these products (thanks Amazon!)&lt;br /&gt;Styling</li>
            <li> B&amp;B Styling Creme is absolutely the greatest hair product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I loved being able to order this product on line and have it shipped in two days.  </li>
            <li> Always liked this product at the salon.</li>
            <li> this is great--goes on well, brings out the curl, makes hair shine and lift nicely.</li>
            <li> To me it&#x27;s just as good as the original!</li>
            <li> This was the best styling creme ever until one day I found my new bottle didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> I love this because it is light and yet styles the hair great.  </li>
            <li> great product and much cheaper that the salon where i get my hair cut!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still playing around with it, but so far it hasn&#x27;t impressed me.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine locks</li>
            <li> I have a ton of very fine hair that is wavy/curly</li>
            <li> Now, some reviewers state they used to love the product, but B&amp;b changed it, not so.</li>
            <li> It works, but the formula is different-thinner and more watery than the salon purchased one.</li>
            <li> Magic :).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this many times before, but purchased it in a store.  </li>
            <li> Like the Bumble and Bumble Styling Lotion better.</li>
            <li> why adding alcohol to anything would make it better to the consumer.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years since it is the best styling creme I have found.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve chucked many a product because of the perfumey smell.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thinner and easier for me to distribute in my hair - it also seems to give me a bit more lift.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, as I&#x27;ve been going through the process of \\&quot;greening\\&quot; all my toiletries, I&#x27;m glad to see that they changed it to be more environmentally-friendly.  </li>
            <li> Please be assured that your comments have been noted and will be circulated to the appropriate executives within our organization.    </li>
            <li> gives me more fullness and manageability than I&#x27;ve had with most mousses and gels.  </li>
            <li> Clarifying Shampoo (so cheap, but works so well!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I discovered the product, and I&#x27;ve been recommending it to friends as well as my hair dresser.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> No complaints :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair styling product.  </li>
            <li> and I planned on purchasing many more items.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair product.  </li>
            <li> Many months ago I bought a bottle of Bumble and Bumble styling creme from my hair stylist.  </li>
            <li> and my hair tends look better the longer</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used many.  </li>
            <li> It gives it lots of body that lasts all day, plus it makes it more maleable.</li>
            <li> I tried again and used more.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product more than 2 years now</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair look more polished without putting in more effort.  </li>
            <li> I think you need a lot more than the suggested amount to get results.  </li>
            <li> I do love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love your products.</li>
            <li> Pricing is so much better than buying it from the Salon.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and find it adds the body that I need for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this styling creme for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product from Bumble &amp; Bumble.  </li>
            <li> The best part about the old product was that it provided excellent styling control and was not crunchy when dried.</li>
            <li> This is *the* best product for my fine, short hair.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with Silk Therapy (which makes my hair disperse the B&amp;B styling creme more easily and makes my hair easier to style).</li>
            <li> Maybe this is better for fine hair?  </li>
            <li> It does nothing for my hair other than creating incredible static cling.</li>
            <li> This product is the best way to get salon pretty hair - I only used a blow dryer for my roots, while holding a kid, so it was not anything fancy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all been fine and the product that I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own to be too sticky, but mixing a drop with the Style Creme makes it more like the old formulation.</li>
            <li> this is illogical to me, and after using their product for a while and thinking my search for a great volumizer was finally over, I have to start all over again.  </li>
            <li> We hope you will continue to enjoy and have confidence in our quality  products.     </li>
            <li> But a dime-size drop rubbed primarily through the roots</li>
            <li> Gives me just enough volume and keeps my hair looking great.</li>
            <li> This creme is light weight and holds my hair without turning it into a haystack.</li>
            <li> I loved everything else so far</li>
            <li> It used to have wonderful hold without feeling at all stiff</li>
            <li> I was aware that Bumble and Bumble made excellent products, but had never really tried them.</li>
            <li> and I love the scent very much.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve never written an online review before, but I depend on Amazon reviews for many purchases.</li>
            <li> This is thinner than the original version.  </li>
            <li> It seems the formula change was a result of restrictions being placed on some of the chemicals that were in the original product.</li>
            <li> can STILL buy the original formula version of this at salons and high-end beauty/hair supply stores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never stiff, and the more creme I use, the more hold there is.</li>
            <li> Anyway I find the new formula really nice</li>
            <li> I still think they should have put some kind of new labeling in place to note the change.</li>
            <li> The old formula was light but still super effective and took a whopping 2 seconds to force my hair into submission.</li>
            <li> good the 2nd day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mostly used it on a curly/messy look but it also works on straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I Used this product for the first time and I am pleasantly surprised at how good my hair looked.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and this product is awesome!</li>
            <li> Decent product, I&#x27;ll have to play around with it more.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t using the older version, so I don&#x27;t have a basis for comparison to the formula that might (or might not) have been so much better.  </li>
            <li> I am a product junkie and have used many high end styling cremes and mousses and find that this makes my hair look the healthiest.</li>
            <li> My stylist used this along with a couple of drops of the b &amp; b defrizz and my hair has great sheen to it and not weighed down at all.  </li>
            <li> I noticed many reviewers complaining about the new formula.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that I have less fly aways when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I can brush my hair after using this and have both hold/memory and volume without flakes, BUT even though my hair still looks natural, it feels like it&#x27;s coated with something synthetic and very lightly sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times (shower, apply as directed, sleep), and my hair looks great when I wake up.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making it available on line.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Also, I find that it is best to use it only every other time I wash my hair or it seems to build up on the hair.</li>
            <li> JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF HOLD.</li>
            <li> I received this, unscrewed the cap and something wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally weightless going on, which means you better have some pretty fine hair to really make it feel manageable.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but provides a good medium for styling and also minimizes frizz.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I used the old formula for years &amp; it was amazing...</li>
            <li> It has the texture of a runny gel and only gives moderate hold (but the hold has great memory).</li>
            <li> and I also don&#x27;t have to use very much to achieve the results I want.    </li>
            <li> My hair is fine but naturally wavy.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time I noticed a difference in the product</li>
            <li> and it was also the first time I bought it from a non authorized dealer.</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching the videos on Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s website, and I do not think that it is worth so much money.</li>
            <li> The product maintains its  performance, fragrance and texture and our stylists say they like it better than before (if that&#x27;s possible).  </li>
            <li> Sincerely,     Patricia Anderson  Global Consumer Communications</li>
            <li> You can alternate it with your favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty convinced this is a counterfeit product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavily scented and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> First I used chat</li>
            <li> this was my first time buying B and B products from anywhere but B and B</li>
            <li> The concentration of the creme is much lesser and it does not do any magic to my hair.</li>
            <li> and  this is the first time I ordered from amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on  my hair this summer while it was a very humid one!</li>
            <li> i look so pretty now.</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> Having had a drip-dry hairdo all my life, I started using curly mousse as my brown hair became more and more mixed with white, and my hair texture changed.</li>
            <li> but the few good reviews led me to give it a try.</li>
            <li> KEEP THE HAIR FEELING CLEAN AND SOFT TO THE TOUCH!</li>
            <li> I brought it to my new hair stylist, and he was surprised &amp; extremely pleased at how well it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good for giving my blow dryer a rest - I can just comb my hair into place and let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> This is more than I normally pay for a hair product and was expecting a little more performance from it.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for my baby-fine, very straight hair.</li>
            <li> it works ok to hold the curl in my hair which is why I gave it 2 stars, but not as well or for as long as the bottle of styling creme</li>
            <li> I am going to go ahead and get the original one from my stylist even though they are few dollars more.</li>
            <li> I also loved the previous formula - the new styling creme just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> My hair has always been a bit thin, and with this product not only do I have more volume, but the illusion that my hair has more body, more lift,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inspiring me to sell empty bottles to people and tell them it&#x27;s a new super lightweight formula called \\&quot;Nuthing\\</li>
            <li> This lotion is great when I want to blow dry straight or let air dry curly.</li>
            <li> and they mess with the product or create their own version.</li>
            <li> Styles my short hair quickly and with the right amount of hold.  </li>
            <li> The real styling creme gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients is also much shorter.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for anything that will control the FUZZ and this really does the trick.</li>
            <li> They added alcohol to the thickening spray (now called thickening hairspray) making it sticky and very drying for your hair.  </li>
            <li> I never feel like there is too much product in my hair</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;crispiness\\&quot; is definitely gone and I still have light hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for stocking it.</li>
            <li> I generally really like Bumble and Bumble product.</li>
            <li> And you&#x27;re not saving that much money buying here through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It dries without much of an odor, but it smells like melting plastic when you rub it on your hands and hair.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of the product was different, and it also felt very different on my hair - not at all even remotely similar to what I&#x27;ve experienced when buying it from either my hair stylist or from Target.</li>
            <li> --I could go buy cheap mousse at the drugstore and get the same results.</li>
            <li> and I really liked,it.</li>
            <li> They really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I have used this for years thanks to my hair designer Diane</li>
            <li> I want to wear my hair straight</li>
            <li> it holds the whole day.  </li>
            <li> I would much rather use a drug store styling cream brand.</li>
            <li> But from my very unscientific sampling of many different products, this is the clear winner for me.</li>
            <li> It is certainly not the intention of Bumble and bumble to disappoint any of our consumers by changing their favorite product.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mean that in a good way.  </li>
            <li> in other words I couldn&#x27;t find a magical product.</li>
            <li> Seems to be different than original formula</li>
            <li> Though that would explain why I like using it again, after I&#x27;d stopped for a little while - I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine &amp; doesn&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
            <li> The new(ish) formula is so light that I&#x27;m convinced, much like the emperor&#x27;s new clothes, it only works if you believe in it.</li>
            <li> The old formula was great, but this one is not nearly as good.  </li>
            <li> It allows for a smooth straight look or if I want I can go curly and this product holds the shape and body all day long.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that otherwise looks like &#x27;little girl&#x27; hair without this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it to me to use products that I love if they contain harmful ingredients of any sort.</li>
            <li> Hands down my most fav hair product ever.</li>
            <li> , pixie hair cut any way I want (spiky, mohawk, flat and clean, etc.).</li>
            <li> I used to love Paul Mitchell Styling Foam for body, but this product gives body with a softer, less crinkly feel to the hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used this product before, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it \\&quot;used to be,\\&quot; but it seems like a decent hair cream.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use much hair product because my laziness far outweighs my desire to look presentable.</li>
            <li> I emailed them back one more time politely, and told them I am planning on mailing the item back to the company myself</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hybrid of all those products, but very subtle for a natural hold that makes it look like you have great hair.</li>
            <li> In early 2007 they changed the formulation, and now it does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> In my mind, you don&#x27;t change something that already works great and make it become mediocre.</li>
            <li> but now it doesn&#x27;t give my hair nearly as much body as the old creme did.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I just received my refund today, so at least they&#x27;re honest.</li>
            <li> Normally if I were rating this product, it gets 5 stars without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I can pretty much style my short</li>
            <li> Most products are too heavy.</li>
            <li> I use it on my natural African American hair and it makes my curls fluffy and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I do think the price of Bumble and Bumble products is high, but these products aren&#x27;t filled with water, alcohol, endless silicones, and revolting scents.  </li>
            <li> i have very thick hair and this product is the only one that i found that works great all day and night with one application</li>
            <li> Also consider their new styling gel.</li>
            <li> The new formula just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li> This new formula has no styling hold whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I have continued to use this product, but now I mix it with the new B&amp;B Texture product.</li>
            <li> I live an hour away from any beauty salon that might carry this creme.</li>
            <li> I contacted Bumble and Bumble reqarding their new formula.  </li>
            <li> or if they just gave me this answer because I live in CA.  </li>
            <li> the new stuff works</li>
            <li> I use it to tame my little fly aways without looking like</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s rotten that they sell the product in the same exact bottle without any notation that it&#x27;s a new formula.</li>
            <li> This was a much better price than the salon where I usually purchase.</li>
            <li> I can use this styling creme at my roots for all day volume or in the rest of my hair for soft all day volume!</li>
            <li> that will do the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> It was the first time I&#x27;d had such a product that worked so well.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I used about a tablespoon total - and noticed NO difference at all.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff but can&#x27;t usually justify the hit to the wallet</li>
            <li> This product is light and does not weigh down your hair or make it \\&quot;crunchy.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> compared the new bottle with the old, and the ingredients are dramatically changed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the old formula for years and now the new one for a month now.</li>
            <li> To keep up with the  environmentally conscious times Styling Crème has been reformulated to  comply with new regulations enacted by the Air Resource Board (CARB), a  division of the California Environmental Protection Agency.  </li>
            <li> it is almost exactly the same as the old Bumble &amp; Bumble formula.</li>
            <li> Check B&amp;b&#x27;s website to find a place near you that sells it.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length layered wavy hair and like to have soft hold</li>
            <li> You cannot buy the old product anyplace though.</li>
            <li> So go support your local salon and buy the real thing somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I discovered this after receiving lots of compliments on days too busy to do anything else, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> Just a fyi to the busy.</li>
            <li> My hair always feels soft and natural, like I have no product in at all.</li>
            <li> The quality, the consistency and the formula is completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> For work or home, I like a natural look without any noticeable scent, and that&#x27;s what this routine gives me.    </li>
            <li> really think I should be reimbursed for this styling creme and would think that the company that made this would want it back (hopefully at their expense).  </li>
            <li> I bought directly from B and B...</li>
            <li> I am throwing this out and ordering directly from B&amp;B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> : I received a bottle directly from B&amp;B and compared the two.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that this bottle was the real thing.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling &#x27;crisp&#x27; rather than soft even when I blow dry.</li>
            <li> I could see this being handy only for certain looks, but not for everyday - ergo, not worth the money in my case.</li>
            <li> I have stick straight, flat hair.  </li>
            <li> The creme is not smooth (as it was in my original bottle).  </li>
            <li> We regret to learn that you are not pleased with the results and we apologize that the old formula is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> I bought a new bottle and it definitely seems like the old formula.  </li>
            <li> The creme itself has a different texture as well, hard to describe except to say when you I look at the cremes side by side it has a look and feel of conditioner rather than the B and B direct styling creme which is slightly more tacky and gelatinous....</li>
            <li> I have very short, fine hair, that has a little bit of curl to it.</li>
            <li> if it air dries and straight if I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> It was getting to the point of a major haircut.</li>
            <li> No other product I have tried works as well.</li>
            <li> Both ways I find that it gives my hair just enough hold not to frizz up too much but absolutely does not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> Because I bought another bottle directly from B&amp;b at their website and not only is the product exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed to be, there&#x27;s about five to ten extra ingredients on the back</li>
            <li> This with a small drop of Bumble &amp; Bumble Brilliantine makes my hair full, thick and easy to style.</li>
            <li> Gives my fine thick hair the body it needs.  </li>
            <li> Little pricey, but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I bought the old formula from Big Lots for $6.  </li>
            <li> I wish the company would bring back the old product</li>
            <li> As this was a &amp;#34;asked for&amp;#34; present - it was well received by my 27 year old nephew.  </li>
            <li> I only recently started using this product, and I suppose that means I have the new formula.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve bought new bottles of B&amp;B Styling Creme since I made this purchase from Amazon (from several different stores/hairstylists including Sephora)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used B&amp;B Styling Creme, so I&#x27;m not a disgruntled user of the previous formula.</li>
            <li> I also wrote to Bumble about their formula change and got the exact same response as the other reviewer.</li>
            <li> Yesterday morning I used this product, and today I still have great volume (almost impossible with my thin hair) and smooth cuticle.</li>
            <li> The following is their reply---obviously they aren&#x27;t going to bring back the old formula</li>
            <li> The only recommendation I would give is to be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li> In this case, it&#x27;s worth it to spend a few extra bucks to know you&#x27;re getting the legitimate product.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my hair either.</li>
            <li> The mousse was okay, but made my hair a little stiff.</li>
            <li> It feels like the original product when your hair is wet, but once it&#x27;s dried, it feels like you have nothing on your hair...</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and most products just make it less manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have very very fine and very thin hair .</li>
            <li> It adds just enough control without seeming to weigh down my hair, or turning it into some greasy, silicone mess like so many other styling cremes do.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin, and my plan was to create some volume and manageability with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product out there for my thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried for year to go through new products that come out, to tame frizz while looking and feeling natural.  </li>
            <li> I used to use just a little bit of the styling creme, because it made my hair too \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; if I didn&#x27;t heat style after applying, or used too much.  </li>
            <li> I have fine; limp hair that gets really dried out from highlighting, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and it&#x27;s the only styling product that works on my fine, thin hair to give it body.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of coarse hair that either looks really good or really bad.  </li>
            <li> What I ended up with was sticky hair which was almost impossible to comb through, felt stiff and looked dried-out, yet at the same time was FULL of unmanageable static.</li>
            <li> I had already purchased other items directly from B&amp;B.  </li>
            <li> If I let it dry naturally, my hair will literally dry in a tent shape on my head without curving around my face!  </li>
            <li> Now this does nothing for me, I get flat lifeless hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair flat, not shiny and no hold.</li>
            <li> For some reason, what I got thru Amazon was clearly not the same stuff, even though the packaging was identical.</li>
            <li> While also a creme, this one is stickier and actually holds up less on my short, textured (male) hair.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers - this is not not the same styling creme that I previously ordered direct from B&amp;B.</li>
            <li> You need to be very careful not to apply too much or the hair becomes like stiff bristles.</li>
            <li> But I hope enough people tell them how their product sucks so they go back to the old formulation.</li>
            <li> It was so strange, then I read online and found they changed their formula.  </li>
            <li> Just put it in, style it up, and no need to worry about it all day long.  </li>
            <li> The first day I used this, I blow dried my hair with a round brush.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it gives me body so I can style it so much easier.</li>
            <li> After reviewing mixed reviews about this specific product, I was a little scared ordering.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Groupon along with several other B&amp;B products.  </li>
            <li> To those people who say that the new formula is bad, or that it feels like there&#x27;s nothing in your hair, I say use a little more product and you&#x27;ll get the results you want.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe that the offending ingredient in a dime size amount of this product used by a small fraction of the world&#x27;s women was truely going to change the world&#x27;s air quality -- but maybe.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I now use it when I blow dry my hair and when I let it air dry</li>
            <li> Day one is the wash, cream and dry.  </li>
            <li> , I blow dry with a paddle brush.  </li>
            <li> It also looked and felt dry, like straw.  </li>
            <li> but still it looks and feels sooooooo dry.  </li>
            <li> However, do not put it on and let it dry and expect to brush it.</li>
            <li> A few months later she said they changed it back after getting slammed with complaints.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was an old bottle or what,</li>
            <li> I had heard about Bumble and Bumble products for years, and finally decided to try some at half price, from a discount website.</li>
            <li> Made my medium-thick wavy hair very dry and almost crunchy.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be the grooming creme with a little extra hold--it is NOT.</li>
            <li> You only need a little</li>
            <li> : I spent a lot of time searching for a replacement, but didn&#x27;t have luck finding anything equivalent.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair like mine, this really gives you the thicker feeling.</li>
            <li> They waited a few days to contact me back.  </li>
            <li> B&amp;B is expensive and worth the $$$ BUT&lt;</li>
            <li> When it dries it provides a minimal amount of control, but firm hold it definitely isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The new formula doesn&#x27;t give my fine hair the shine &amp; body of the old one, and worse, it causes awful static electricity in cold weather.</li>
            <li> Takes very little of the product to manage my short hair.  </li>
            <li> I have had the same bottle of Bumble and Bumble styling creme for 4 years, from way back when I styled my hair, and it had been at least year since I&#x27;d done anything to my hair other than a ponytail or messy bun.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used this product in the past, you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s completely different now and pretty useless.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t care about experimenting with other products because this one gives body without being sticky.</li>
            <li> Other products I&#x27;ve used gave me shine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews where users were complaining that the formula was changed and the product did not work like it did in the past.</li>
            <li> I am also a long time styling creme user that is extremely disappointed in the new formula and am now on the hunt for a new product.  </li>
            <li> Holy cow.</li>
            <li> I apply is to towel dried hair and blow dry with a roller brush.  </li>
            <li> On days I want body and waves, I blow dry with a round brush and days</li>
            <li> Not gooey or stiff when dry.  </li>
            <li> My stylist told me about the formulation change after I complained that it seemed different.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair styling products---both expensive and cheap and this product has to be one of the WORST products I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> Usually I hate when a product I love changes, reformulates whatever...</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and coarse and it does</li>
            <li> It gives my hair volume and hold without looking greasy or weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> It does not weigh it down at all nor does it look greasy.</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you have flat hair that has a tendency to look dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it or a few other cheaper products over this one.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that this is a one time mess up as I would like to continue to buy \\&quot;unspoiled\\&quot; B&amp;B styling creme from you.  .</li>
            <li> This product gave me volume but it also made my hair a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li> It is mainly flat but has a very small curl to it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product, I was a little wary given the negative review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other B&amp;B products in the past</li>
            <li> but it is really disappointing and not nearly as good as the original</li>
            <li> This is expensive styling crème--the old formula was worth it, but the new one is awful</li>
            <li> This replicated the 2 days without washing it look and kept my bangs from doing that crazy curl and stick straight out thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even close to being the same product, it&#x27;s thin and lifeless and provides no hold or texture.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago after reading about it in a few magazines as a wonder product.</li>
            <li> Also, did not help with frizz- actually made it worse.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t expect body from a creme, seems too heavy.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, I use this on blow-dry days for work, after Coco shampoo and conditioner, and a few spritzes of Prep.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Frizzy dried hair----that&#x27;s what I get when I use this</li>
            <li> Feels gloppy out of the bottle and stiff on the hair.</li>
            <li> does not make hair to stiff or sticky</li>
            <li> The styling creme makes the hair quite stiff when it dries.</li>
            <li> It helps tame their curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on long thin color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> And my thick hair just weighs is down?</li>
            <li> It was awfully expensive for such a little bottle.  </li>
            <li> It does turn the hair a bit stiff but does so without the white, dried out residue some products leave behind that makes it look like you have a serious case of dandruff.</li>
            <li> think I received a bottle of Bumble and Bumble that had to be very old/spoiled, bad batch...  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re local beauty supply place has it, it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
            <li> (I usually go to salons to pick it up, but found it cheaper here)</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used for the past 3 years or so.)  </li>
            <li> I got a small (2 oz.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what motivated the change</li>
            <li> And, it formed small balls of goo in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid to order a new bottle, based on the bad reviews here on the new formula...</li>
            <li> I have a hard time understanding</li>
            <li> it will be hard and will fuzz up.</li>
            <li> It was so bad I had to wash it out of my hair and start over with some of the last little bit of Quality Control I have.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Such a disappointment...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with the longest hair I&#x27;ve ever had and it curls and does all kinds of crazy stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, 4c and loves creamy stylers.  </li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder-length hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have lots of thick hair, so it lasts.  </li>
            <li> it grows slowly and breaks off if rubbed.</li>
            <li> I mean CREME.</li>
            <li> Rather I feel the hair do looks very ordinary after applying this creme.</li>
            <li> we have enough bad chemicals in every day life.</li>
            <li> It smells like tall grass and plastic (not pleasant in my opinion).</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time, but not sure what when wrong with this bottle.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and difficult to control, but the Styling Creme makes styling my hair a breeze.  </li>
            <li> but dont know how it would work on oily or thin hair.</li>
            <li> New formula is terrible.</li>
            <li> Too bad I wasted $20 on it.</li>
            <li> Got a bottle myself and this stuff is really useless.</li>
            <li> only* problem is that I think that it smells horrible when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding a product that can control the curl, add body, reduce frizz, and hold my style in place all day...</li>
            <li> This product was expensive and useless.</li>
            <li> THe expensive salon I go to sells Bumble and Bumble</li>
            <li> It does seem silly</li>
            <li> No fragrance, wrong texture, and the bottle looked used.</li>
            <li> Hate it, wish I could get my money back :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened here, maybe it was stored at a weird temperature and it made the contents go bad, or it was a bogus batch...</li>
            <li> The bad reviews might be because people don&#x27;t understand the product.</li>
            <li> Bad combination.</li>
            <li> Bad decision.</li>
            <li> I go for that bad head sorta look</li>
            <li> I too, am disappointed by the changes of some B&amp;b products.  </li>
            <li> To me this B&amp;B is worthless.</li>
            <li> I hate having fried looking hair</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be replacing all my bumble products because I&#x27;m so disgusted.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s insane.</li>
            <li> All I know is that it was terrible and did nothing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite hair product!</li>
            <li> The real styling creme gets 5 stars. I&#x27;ve been using B&amp;b styling creme for years, but I&#x27;ve always bought it from my barber. I was out of state for a while and was running out, so I bought this version from Amazon. It&#x27;s not even close to being the same product, it&#x27;s thin and lifeless and provides no hold or texture. Now, some reviewers state they used to love the product, but B&amp;b changed it, not so. This was the first time I noticed a difference in the product and it was also the first time I bought it from a non authorized dealer. It&#x27;s not that B&amp;b changed the product, and it&#x27;s not because the product changed it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not from an authorized dealer and they mess with the product or create their own version. How do I know this? Because I bought another bottle directly from B&amp;b at their website and not only is the product exactly the way it&#x27;s supposed to be, there&#x27;s about five to ten extra ingredients on the back that&#x27;s NOT in the AMAZON version. I contacted the manufacturer, and the ONLY store B&amp;b authorize to sell styling creme that&#x27;s not a salon is SEPHORA. That&#x27;s it. If you&#x27;re local beauty supply place has it, it&#x27;s a fake. Same with online stores. Check B&amp;b&#x27;s website to find a place near you that sells it. I&#x27;ll upload a picture of the difference in ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used B&amp;B Styling Creme, so I&#x27;m not a disgruntled user of the previous formula. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product to replace the wonderful but discontinued Matrix Quality Control, and hoped this was it. My hair is fine and thin, and my plan was to create some volume and manageability with this product. What I ended up with was sticky hair which was almost impossible to comb through, felt stiff and looked dried-out, yet at the same time was FULL of unmanageable static. It was so bad I had to wash it out of my hair and start over with some of the last little bit of Quality Control I have. I won&#x27;t give up my search, but this one is definitely not going to work for me.</li>
            <li> This was a much better price than the salon where I usually purchase. It works, but the formula is different-thinner and more watery than the salon purchased one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used this product before, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it \\&quot;used to be,\\&quot; but it seems like a decent hair cream.  I have wavy/curly hair, and was looking for something to keep fly-aways at bay.  This was recommended by my hair stylist.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times (shower, apply as directed, sleep), and my hair looks great when I wake up. I feel like my hair is greasy by the end of the day however when I use this product.  I haven&#x27;t yet used it for actual \\&quot;styling\\&quot; yet. Decent product, I&#x27;ll have to play around with it more.</li>
            <li> My stylist told me about the formulation change after I complained that it seemed different. A few months later she said they changed it back after getting slammed with complaints.  I bought a new bottle and it definitely seems like the old formula.  Also consider their new styling gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used bumble and bumble&#x27;s Styling Creme for eight years, and it was the best product ever. In early 2007 they changed the formulation, and now it does absolutely nothing. No hold, no added texture. It feels like the original product when your hair is wet, but once it&#x27;s dried, it feels like you have nothing on your hair...and I don&#x27;t mean that in a good way.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve compared the new bottle with the old, and the ingredients are dramatically changed. The list of ingredients is also much shorter.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I requested a refund, and bumble and bumble sent me a prepaid envelope to send the product back. In fact, I just received my refund today, so at least they&#x27;re honest. But I hope enough people tell them how their product sucks so they go back to the old formulation.</li>
            <li> New formula is terrible. I know it sounds like an ad, but search for Hickox Styling Creme....it is almost exactly the same as the old Bumble &amp; Bumble formula.</li>
            <li> I have fine; limp hair that gets really dried out from highlighting, etc.  My stylist used this along with a couple of drops of the b &amp; b defrizz and my hair has great sheen to it and not weighed down at all.  I am a product junkie and have used many high end styling cremes and mousses and find that this makes my hair look the healthiest.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product religiously until mysteriously the formula changed about a year ago.  For some reason, it doesn&#x27;t have the hold that it used to.  The package didn&#x27;t change at all, but it seems so different now.  I have shoulder-length layered wavy hair and like to have soft hold that&#x27;s not crunchy and that can stay all day.  This won&#x27;t do that anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching the videos on Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s website, and I do not think that it is worth so much money. It has the texture of a runny gel and only gives moderate hold (but the hold has great memory). It smells like tall grass and plastic (not pleasant in my opinion). I can brush my hair after using this and have both hold/memory and volume without flakes, BUT even though my hair still looks natural, it feels like it&#x27;s coated with something synthetic and very lightly sticky. Before brushing my hair it has a fair bit of crunch to it for sure. I could see this being handy only for certain looks, but not for everyday - ergo, not worth the money in my case. Should have bought the 2oz version (or just something else).</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve never written an online review before, but I depend on Amazon reviews for many purchases. The reviews on here for this product are nothing like my experience. I have had the same bottle of Bumble and Bumble styling creme for 4 years, from way back when I styled my hair, and it had been at least year since I&#x27;d done anything to my hair other than a ponytail or messy bun. It was getting to the point of a major haircut. Yesterday morning I used this product, and today I still have great volume (almost impossible with my thin hair) and smooth cuticle. This product is the best way to get salon pretty hair - I only used a blow dryer for my roots, while holding a kid, so it was not anything fancy. The bad reviews might be because people don&#x27;t understand the product. It&#x27;s not a gel, a hairspray, or a mousse. It&#x27;s a hybrid of all those products, but very subtle for a natural hold that makes it look like you have great hair. Magic :).</li>
            <li> This lotion is great when I want to blow dry straight or let air dry curly. My hair looks good and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have fuzzy hair - I&#x27;ve come to terms with that. So, I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for anything that will control the FUZZ and this really does the trick. It does turn the hair a bit stiff but does so without the white, dried out residue some products leave behind that makes it look like you have a serious case of dandruff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this many times before, but purchased it in a store.  This is thinner than the original version.  I don&#x27;t have an explanation for the change.</li>
            <li> A great styling cream...it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but provides a good medium for styling and also minimizes frizz.</li>
            <li> This used to be a miracle worker. I don&#x27;t really use much hair product because my laziness far outweighs my desire to look presentable. The old formula was light but still super effective and took a whopping 2 seconds to force my hair into submission. The new(ish) formula is so light that I&#x27;m convinced, much like the emperor&#x27;s new clothes, it only works if you believe in it. It&#x27;s inspiring me to sell empty bottles to people and tell them it&#x27;s a new super lightweight formula called \\&quot;Nuthing\\&quot; (you have to spell it that way otherwise no one will believe you). I won&#x27;t be reordering this styling cream...I mean CREME.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 1998, but have stopped.  The new formula just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  I have very fine hair and this doesn&#x27;t provide anything like the hold it used to.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of coarse hair that either looks really good or really bad.  It can be too heavy to have much bounce but Bumble and Bumble Styling Creme is the only product that can hold a style.  It even keeps the style for a couple of days so I&#x27;m not washing it every day.</li>
            <li> THE BEST PRODUCT OUT THERE FOR HAIR!  JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF HOLD. KEEP THE HAIR FEELING CLEAN AND SOFT TO THE TOUCH!</li>
            <li> great product and much cheaper that the salon where i get my hair cut!! I have used this product for the past 4 years and really like it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago after reading about it in a few magazines as a wonder product. The marketing buzz was the wonder, not the product. It leaves my hair feeling &#x27;crisp&#x27; rather than soft even when I blow dry. My stylist recently recommended Moroccan Oil and used it before a blow-out. Loved the way my hair looked and felt after that product. I&#x27;d recommend it or a few other cheaper products over this one. Feels gloppy out of the bottle and stiff on the hair. Too bad I wasted $20 on it.</li>
            <li> I could kill them. They changed the ingredients and didn&#x27;t change the packaging, so now I&#x27;m stuck making a trip to UPS to return what I bought. If you&#x27;ve used this product in the past, you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s completely different now and pretty useless. Isn&#x27;t there a law against changing your product but not telling the consumer on the bottle that it&#x27;s \\&quot;new\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> Like the Bumble and Bumble Styling Lotion better.</li>
            <li> I too, am disappointed by the changes of some B&amp;b products.  They added alcohol to the thickening spray (now called thickening hairspray) making it sticky and very drying for your hair.  I have a hard time understanding why adding alcohol to anything would make it better to the consumer.  this is illogical to me, and after using their product for a while and thinking my search for a great volumizer was finally over, I have to start all over again.  Big disappointment.  In my mind, you don&#x27;t change something that already works great and make it become mediocre.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years since it is the best styling creme I have found.  Does not leave sticky residue but has good hold.  The only thing I recommend is using moisterizer with it to prevent dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the old formula for years and now the new one for a month now. I have very fine hair that otherwise looks like &#x27;little girl&#x27; hair without this product. It looks like I have nothing in my hair but it gives my hair guts and some lift - it looks esp. good the 2nd day. It&#x27;s also good for giving my blow dryer a rest - I can just comb my hair into place and let it dry naturally. I also like that there is not lasting fragrance - I&#x27;ve chucked many a product because of the perfumey smell. Anyway I find the new formula really nice it&#x27;s thinner and easier for me to distribute in my hair - it also seems to give me a bit more lift. Usually I hate when a product I love changes, reformulates whatever... but this one works for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this sytling creme for several years but did not know where to buy it locally,  after moving.  This product works very well for my baby-fine, very straight hair.</li>
            <li> I am also a long time styling creme user that is extremely disappointed in the new formula and am now on the hunt for a new product.  I think it&#x27;s rotten that they sell the product in the same exact bottle without any notation that it&#x27;s a new formula. I&#x27;ll probably be replacing all my bumble products because I&#x27;m so disgusted.  The best part about the old product was that it provided excellent styling control and was not crunchy when dried. This new formula has no styling hold whatsoever.  I also wrote to Bumble about their formula change and got the exact same response as the other reviewer. Must be a canned response.  Update - 12-2011: I spent a lot of time searching for a replacement, but didn&#x27;t have luck finding anything equivalent. It seems the formula change was a result of restrictions being placed on some of the chemicals that were in the original product. I suppose it&#x27;s best that they changed it - we have enough bad chemicals in every day life. I still think they should have put some kind of new labeling in place to note the change. I have continued to use this product, but now I mix it with the new B&amp;B Texture product. I found Texture on it&#x27;s own to be too sticky, but mixing a drop with the Style Creme makes it more like the old formulation.</li>
            <li> I only recently started using this product, and I suppose that means I have the new formula. I went to the bumble and bumble salon and they used their products as part of my styling.  I now use it when I blow dry my hair and when I let it air dry ( I have medium thickness hair with some wave). Both ways I find that it gives my hair just enough hold not to frizz up too much but absolutely does not weigh it down.  I never feel like there is too much product in my hair and I also don&#x27;t have to use very much to achieve the results I want.    All in all, I think it works quite well and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I noticed many reviewers complaining about the new formula.  Had I not happened to have looked at the reviews &amp; ordered on Amazon (I usually go to salons to pick it up, but found it cheaper here), I wouldn&#x27;t have known they changed the formula. (I&#x27;ve used for the past 3 years or so.)  Though that would explain why I like using it again, after I&#x27;d stopped for a little while - I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine &amp; doesn&#x27;t hold very well.  I used to use just a little bit of the styling creme, because it made my hair too \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; if I didn&#x27;t heat style after applying, or used too much.  The \\&quot;crispiness\\&quot; is definitely gone and I still have light hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, as I&#x27;ve been going through the process of \\&quot;greening\\&quot; all my toiletries, I&#x27;m glad to see that they changed it to be more environmentally-friendly.  Otherwise, this is one of the products I would have gotten rid of and replaced within the year.  It&#x27;s not worth it to me to use products that I love if they contain harmful ingredients of any sort.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been a bit thin, and with this product not only do I have more volume, but the illusion that my hair has more body, more lift, \\&quot;je ne sais quoi.\\&quot; All this without being sticky like some mousses or sprays. Thanks to Amazon for stocking it. I live an hour away from any beauty salon that might carry this creme.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and it&#x27;s the only styling product that works on my fine, thin hair to give it body.</li>
            <li> I contacted Bumble and Bumble reqarding their new formula.  I also had used this product for 8+ years.  The following is their reply---obviously they aren&#x27;t going to bring back the old formula so I guess we search for something else.  They are owned by Estee Lauder.  I don&#x27;t know if they changed their product world-wide because of a a division of a CA Envir. Protection Agency or if they just gave me this answer because I live in CA.  You cannot buy the old product anyplace though. I find it hard to believe that the offending ingredient in a dime size amount of this product used by a small fraction of the world&#x27;s women was truely going to change the world&#x27;s air quality -- but maybe.  I&#x27;m all for the environment buy this seems like a stretch.  The label information listed on this site is from the \\&quot;old\\&quot; label and the ingredients have changed on the one currently being sold.    \\&quot;Thank you for taking the time to contact Bumble and bumble.      It is certainly not the intention of Bumble and bumble to disappoint any of our consumers by changing their favorite product.  To keep up with the  environmentally conscious times Styling Crème has been reformulated to  comply with new regulations enacted by the Air Resource Board (CARB), a  division of the California Environmental Protection Agency.  This  organization ensures that we do our part to maintain a healthier planet.   This product has undergone tests within our salons, among our clients and  is Bumble and bumble stylist-approved.  The product maintains its  performance, fragrance and texture and our stylists say they like it better than before (if that&#x27;s possible).  We regret to learn that you are not pleased with the results and we apologize that the old formula is no longer available.  Please be assured that your comments have been noted and will be circulated to the appropriate executives within our organization.    Once again, thank you for this opportunity to respond to your concerns.  We hope you will continue to enjoy and have confidence in our quality  products.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bumble and Bumble Styling Creme for about 10 years -- don&#x27;t care about experimenting with other products because this one gives body without being sticky.</li>
            <li> Made my medium-thick wavy hair very dry and almost crunchy. Also, did not help with frizz- actually made it worse. Very disappointed. Definitely won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I&#x27;ve found on these products (thanks Amazon!)&lt;br /&gt;Styling creme works great, never feels like there is any product on your hair. Helps it curl and stay in place.</li>
            <li> I generally really like Bumble and Bumble product. I thought this would be the grooming creme with a little extra hold--it is NOT. While also a creme, this one is stickier and actually holds up less on my short, textured (male) hair. I do not like/recommend this product. In fact, I just saw it at a retail store for $6 (YES, SIX) and passed on it.</li>
            <li> Great....shipped in a timely matter</li>
            <li> Holy cow. It hurt me last year to pay $27 for this.  Now $38? That&#x27;s insane. I&#x27;ll go back and find something else...</li>
            <li> I have stick straight, flat hair.  If I let it dry naturally, my hair will literally dry in a tent shape on my head without curving around my face!  I have tried everything from mousse, gel, spray gel, hair tonic, pomade, you name it.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve used for styling my hair and giving it body.  Yes, body!  You wouldn&#x27;t expect body from a creme, seems too heavy.  But a dime-size drop rubbed primarily through the roots gives me more fullness and manageability than I&#x27;ve had with most mousses and gels.  I used to love Paul Mitchell Styling Foam for body, but this product gives body with a softer, less crinkly feel to the hair.  I can also put a wave in my straight hair using a round brush that lasts until the next shampoo!  Is this the best styling product out there?  Of course, it&#x27;s subjective, depending on your hair, cut, styling ability, etc.  But from my very unscientific sampling of many different products, this is the clear winner for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One caveat: if your scalp is oily, you&#x27;ll want to wash this out every day as it seems to lose some effectiveness the second day without a shampoo.  And you also want to use a shampoo that washes out all hair products without stripping your hair.  You can alternate it with your favorite shampoo.  I like Paul Mitchell Shampoo 2 or White Rain Daily Clarifying Shampoo (so cheap, but works so well!)</li>
            <li> Got a bottle myself and this stuff is really useless. It&#x27;s totally weightless going on, which means you better have some pretty fine hair to really make it feel manageable. When it dries it provides a minimal amount of control, but firm hold it definitely isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty convinced this is a counterfeit product.  I bought a bottle from the salon and the color, texture, and list of ingredients were all completely different.  And you&#x27;re not saving that much money buying here through Amazon.  So go support your local salon and buy the real thing somewhere else.</li>
            <li> B&amp;B Styling Creme is absolutely the greatest hair product I have ever used.  Thanks for making it available on line.</li>
            <li> Why Bumble &amp; Bumble, why?  This was the best styling creme ever until one day I found my new bottle didn&#x27;t work for me.  It was so strange, then I read online and found they changed their formula.  My hair dresser since told me they changed all their products.  Now this does nothing for me, I get flat lifeless hair.  I switched to Pureology after several trial and errors.</li>
            <li> What I was searching for.</li>
            <li> My stylist used this product on my  (wavy, unruly and cow-licky) hair the last time I was in for a cut.  I was impressed that the product kept my hair exactly as she had styled it, but without being sticky or \\&quot;hard-hat\\&quot; like.  I went back to the salon the next day to buy some for myself. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The *only* problem is that I think that it smells horrible when you put it on.  It dries without much of an odor, but it smells like melting plastic when you rub it on your hands and hair.  One of the ingredients is vinyl so I guess that is what you get. However, it still rates 5 stars as it is the best styling product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Normally if I were rating this product, it gets 5 stars without hesitation. For some reason, what I got thru Amazon was clearly not the same stuff, even though the packaging was identical. The consistency of the product was different, and it also felt very different on my hair - not at all even remotely similar to what I&#x27;ve experienced when buying it from either my hair stylist or from Target. I can&#x27;t even say it under-performed, rather, it didn&#x27;t perform at all. I don&#x27;t know what happened here, maybe it was stored at a weird temperature and it made the contents go bad, or it was a bogus batch... all I know is, I won&#x27;t be ordering it thru Amazon again... In this case, it&#x27;s worth it to spend a few extra bucks to know you&#x27;re getting the legitimate product.</li>
            <li> I have very short, fine hair, that has a little bit of curl to it. I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding a product that can control the curl, add body, reduce frizz, and hold my style in place all day...in other words I couldn&#x27;t find a magical product. I was aware that Bumble and Bumble made excellent products, but had never really tried them. I got a small (2 oz.) bottle of the styling creme at Target to give the stuff a try. It LITERALLY does wonders for my hair. I can pretty much style my short, pixie hair cut any way I want (spiky, mohawk, flat and clean, etc.). It&#x27;s a flexible hold without feeling all gunky, or looking shiny. To those people who say that the new formula is bad, or that it feels like there&#x27;s nothing in your hair, I say use a little more product and you&#x27;ll get the results you want. This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought the old formula from Big Lots for $6.  I&#x27;m still playing around with it, but so far it hasn&#x27;t impressed me.  My hair is thick, 4c and loves creamy stylers.  This isn&#x27;t doing it for me.</li>
            <li> I log&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love,love,love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now, I wish they hadn&#x27;t changed the fomula but the new stuff works ok! It works well for giving your hair body and helps hold the style well.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and this product is awesome! I can use this styling creme at my roots for all day volume or in the rest of my hair for soft all day volume! Hands down my most fav hair product ever.</li>
            <li> This product was expensive and useless. Bad combination. THe expensive salon I go to sells Bumble and Bumble so I assumed that it was a good product. It makes my hair flat, not shiny and no hold.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I\\&quot;m going to do. Why did they change it? I&#x27;ve been using it for years and years, there&#x27;s nothing else like it, and now it doesn&#x27;t do what it used to. I emailed the company and asked why they changed it. It doesn&#x27;t do anything at all for me now. I end up mixing it with some gel from the drugstore - just isn&#x27;t the same. Bleh.</li>
            <li> I have very fine locks and this is the perfect product.  It gives my hair volume and hold without looking greasy or weighing it down.  Holds styles all day (I work looonng hours) but hair is still touchable.  It smells nice too!</li>
            <li> I also loved the previous formula - the new styling creme just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  It used to have wonderful hold without feeling at all stiff but now it doesn&#x27;t give my hair nearly as much body as the old creme did.  I wish the company would bring back the old product but I&#x27;ve given up hoping.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I used the old formula for years &amp; it was amazing...I was afraid to order a new bottle, based on the bad reviews here on the new formula...but the few good reviews led me to give it a try. Bad decision. This is expensive styling crème--the old formula was worth it, but the new one is awful--I could go buy cheap mousse at the drugstore and get the same results. The new formula doesn&#x27;t give my fine hair the shine &amp; body of the old one, and worse, it causes awful static electricity in cold weather. Hate it, wish I could get my money back :(</li>
            <li> And this is all I use.&lt;br /&gt;I have a short, spiky haircut. This does not require blow drying but you can.</li>
            <li> I tried different creams and sprays, after paying big bucks for a style cut.  I&#x27;ve decided this B&amp;B Styling Cream works to keep body, emphasizing the cut, throughout the week.  Day one is the wash, cream and dry.  Days after, all I have to do is get up, push my hair up, toss it around, and run out the door.  I discovered this after receiving lots of compliments on days too busy to do anything else, if that makes sense.  Just a fyi to the busy.</li>
            <li> I love Bumble and Bumble Styling Creme!  My hair is thick and difficult to control, but the Styling Creme makes styling my hair a breeze.  I&#x27;m so glad that I discovered the product, and I&#x27;ve been recommending it to friends as well as my hair dresser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product out there for my thin, fine hair.  This with a small drop of Bumble &amp; Bumble Brilliantine makes my hair full, thick and easy to style.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair like mine, this really gives you the thicker feeling. No other product I have tried works as well. A friend bought it for me at her salon and I really liked,it. Found it,on Amazon and have been ordering it since!</li>
            <li> The old formula was great, but this one is not nearly as good.  I&#x27;m not sure what motivated the change but it is really disappointing and not nearly as good as the original</li>
            <li> i have very thick hair and this product is the only one that i found that works great all day and night with one application</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product, I was a little wary given the negative review but... it has done wonders for my hair. I have a ton of very fine hair that is wavy/curly if it air dries and straight if I blow dry it. This stuff is a miracle. It gives my hair body and shine. It does not weigh it down at all nor does it look greasy. It allows for a smooth straight look or if I want I can go curly and this product holds the shape and body all day long. My hair always feels soft and natural, like I have no product in at all. It does not dry out my hair either. I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> I loved being able to order this product on line and have it shipped in two days.  No driving around looking for the product, wondering if I got the best price!</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time, but not sure what when wrong with this bottle. Not sure if it was an old bottle or what, but this was so chunky that I couldn&#x27;t even blend it. I would literally get white chunks of product in my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavily scented and goes on smooth.  A little bit goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve noticed that I have less fly aways when I use it.  I&#x27;ve mostly used it on a curly/messy look but it also works on straight hair.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase again simply because I know I can get products for cheaper that will do the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER THIS. The quality, the consistency and the formula is completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can STILL buy the original formula version of this at salons and high-end beauty/hair supply stores.  You just need to find a \\&quot;Bumble and Bumble network salon\\&quot; which you can do here: [...]</li>
            <li> It was awfully expensive for such a little bottle.  I used to get it a lot cheaper...But it works okay.</li>
            <li> After reviewing mixed reviews about this specific product, I was a little scared ordering. I was even paranoid when it arrived BUT it does its job and appears to be the product that B&amp;B creates. No complaints :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair styling product.  I use it on long thin color treated hair.  Gives body.  I apply is to towel dried hair and blow dry with a roller brush.  My husband also uses it on his short hair which is thinning.</li>
            <li> The product is great, the shipping and pricing were great....all in all a good ordering experience.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Groupon along with several other B&amp;B products.  It was ordered from Groupon and then directed to the B&amp;B website.  I had a problem with the product leaving white flakes on my hair.  My husband and kids noticed and kept picking them off.  I tried it several times with the same results.  I contacted the company politely.  First I used chat and they stated the product should not do that and to email customer service.  I sent all product # details and information.  I asked if just adding water or something would help?  They waited a few days to contact me back.  Then they asked where I purchased?  When I said Groupon, they stated that Groupon was NOT a licensed dealer and they could not account for what what in there??  I was polite back and told them I was saddened that they could not help me at all.  I do not believe for on minute Groupon did or even handled this product since Groupon says to contact the company.  I emailed them back one more time politely, and told them I am planning on mailing the item back to the company myself so maybe they can figure out what happened and no one else has to have the same problems. I told them that being a Christian whether it cost me extra money or not, this is what I am compelled to do. I had already purchased other items directly from B&amp;B.  I loved everything else so far and I planned on purchasing many more items.  I probably will not be doing that now. They promised to pass my email further up to corporate?</li>
            <li> One of my favorites!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> You can always rely on B&amp;B for great products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried for year to go through new products that come out, to tame frizz while looking and feeling natural.  This is the closest I&#x27;ve ever come.  The scent is neutral and pleasant, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s product in my hair.  I get compliments on my curls all the time now.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product.  If you have fine hair, it works great.  Only alittle dab with do the trick.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a product I buy for one of our kids. They really like it. It helps tame their curly hair. They have been using it for years. It&#x27;s one of their favorites.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t using the older version, so I don&#x27;t have a basis for comparison to the formula that might (or might not) have been so much better.  It does seem silly that California...    At any rate, I use this on blow-dry days for work, after Coco shampoo and conditioner, and a few spritzes of Prep.  It adds just enough control without seeming to weigh down my hair, or turning it into some greasy, silicone mess like so many other styling cremes do.  Fourteen hour days don&#x27;t even phase my Bumble and Bumble style. I can refresh my style with a spritz of water and some finger waves.  On my days off, I just run my hands through my hair with a bit of Styling Creme and maybe a bit of stronger gel, and the look is perfect - no need to fuss.  For work or home, I like a natural look without any noticeable scent, and that&#x27;s what this routine gives me.    I do think the price of Bumble and Bumble products is high, but these products aren&#x27;t filled with water, alcohol, endless silicones, and revolting scents.  A dab of each does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Many months ago I bought a bottle of Bumble and Bumble styling creme from my hair stylist.  It was the first time I&#x27;d had such a product that worked so well.  When I saw it on Amazon I ordered it knowing I would get another bottle of a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT SO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I received a bottle of Bumble and Bumble that had to be very old/spoiled, bad batch...  I can&#x27;t figure it out.  The creme is not smooth (as it was in my original bottle).  It comes out in globs.  And, it formed small balls of goo in my hair.  To me this B&amp;B is worthless. Such a disappointment...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think I should be reimbursed for this styling creme and would think that the company that made this would want it back (hopefully at their expense).  Amazon, please see if you can help me with this.  Let me know who I should write to iff you can&#x27;t do it for me.  I am hoping that this is a one time mess up as I would like to continue to buy \\&quot;unspoiled\\&quot; B&amp;B styling creme from you.  . PLEASE GET BACK WITH ME.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with the longest hair I&#x27;ve ever had and it curls and does all kinds of crazy stuff. I Used this product for the first time and I am pleasantly surprised at how good my hair looked. I go for that bad head sorta look and my hair tends look better the longer I go without washing it. This replicated the 2 days without washing it look and kept my bangs from doing that crazy curl and stick straight out thing. I will purchase more when I run out!</li>
            <li> Works great as a styling creme and moisturizer for hair.  My hair is thick and coarse and it does&lt;br /&gt;great but dont know how it would work on oily or thin hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of staying products but this one takes the cake. Talk about set it and forget it!</li>
            <li> I use it daily and I love it.  Gives my fine thick hair the body it needs.  It is the best I have ever used and I&#x27;ve used many.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This is *the* best product for my fine, short hair. It gives it lots of body that lasts all day, plus it makes it more maleable. I use it in combination with Silk Therapy (which makes my hair disperse the B&amp;B styling creme more easily and makes my hair easier to style). I brought it to my new hair stylist, and he was surprised &amp; extremely pleased at how well it works. He even went out and bought it to use with his clients.</li>
            <li> good stuff!  gives body and hold</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder-length hair.  The first time I used this product I used about a tablespoon total - and noticed NO difference at all.  I tried again and used more.  Still no difference.  Maybe this is better for fine hair?  And my thick hair just weighs is down?</li>
            <li> As this was a &amp;#34;asked for&amp;#34; present - it was well received by my 27 year old nephew.  He loved it.</li>
            <li> I like this product because my hair seems easier to manage when blowdrying.&lt;br /&gt;The stylist used it at the salon and I thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so great for adding volume and texture to my very fine hair.  The only recommendation I would give is to be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li> this was my first time buying B and B products from anywhere but B and B and I won&#x27;t do it again....it works ok to hold the curl in my hair which is why I gave it 2 stars, but not as well or for as long as the bottle of styling creme I bought directly from B and B... The creme itself has a different texture as well, hard to describe except to say when you I look at the cremes side by side it has a look and feel of conditioner rather than the B and B direct styling creme which is slightly more tacky and gelatinous....the bottles themselves are different too (both in text and design).</li>
            <li> does not make hair to stiff or sticky</li>
            <li> Always liked this product at the salon.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers - this is not not the same styling creme that I previously ordered direct from B&amp;B. It does nothing for my hair other than creating incredible static cling. I am throwing this out and ordering directly from B&amp;B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I received a bottle directly from B&amp;B and compared the two. There is definately a difference in color (the B&amp;B is not as white), texture (the B&amp;B is thicker)  and performance (it works like its supposed to!).  Someone may be filling B&amp;B bottles with counterfeit cream. Beware!</li>
            <li> This product does not get stickey in the heat of the day.. I have used this for years thanks to my hair designer Diane</li>
            <li> This arrived and is definitely not the B&amp;B Styling Creme I&#x27;ve been buying for years. I know everyone else is saying that it was B&amp;B that changed their formula but I&#x27;ve bought new bottles of B&amp;B Styling Creme since I made this purchase from Amazon (from several different stores/hairstylists including Sephora) and it&#x27;s all been fine and the product that I&#x27;m used to. So I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that this bottle was the real thing. Who knows. All I know is that it was terrible and did nothing. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> My fav for a superb hold!</li>
            <li> I got this product recently for my wife from amazon and here is her review of the product- \\&quot; This product from amazon is entirely different from the ones I get from my salon. The concentration of the creme is much lesser and it does not do any magic to my hair. Rather I feel the hair do looks very ordinary after applying this creme. I have been using this product more than 2 years now and  this is the first time I ordered from amazon and I regret it now. I am going to go ahead and get the original one from my stylist even though they are few dollars more. I recommend this product, but not from amazon. Buy it from our local salon.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair styling products---both expensive and cheap and this product has to be one of the WORST products I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;Frizzy dried hair----that&#x27;s what I get when I use this &#x27;creme&#x27;...and my hair is healthy...and this product still manages to make it look like I stuck my finger in a socket!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  You only need a little and I have lots of thick hair, so it lasts.  It makes my hair look more polished without putting in more effort.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on  my hair this summer while it was a very humid one!</li>
            <li> Gives me just enough volume and keeps my hair looking great. I recommend this if you have flat hair that has a tendency to look dull.</li>
            <li> i look so pretty now.</li>
            <li> I bought several for my wife. She&#x27;s used the product for years. She used to get it at a local salon but they stopped carrying the B&amp;B line.</li>
            <li> Seems to be different than original formula</li>
            <li> Best styling creme out there! Really works!</li>
            <li> Styles my short hair quickly and with the right amount of hold.  I just rub in a dollop and go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just easier to order online than have to go to my salon to buy it.  Great for your hair, great for holding styles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other B&amp;B products in the past so I decided to give this one a shot despite the $30 price tag.  My hair is fine but naturally wavy.  On days I want body and waves, I blow dry with a round brush and days I want to wear my hair straight, I blow dry with a paddle brush.  The first day I used this, I blow dried my hair with a round brush.  This product gave me volume but it also made my hair a tangled mess.  Any time I turned my head, I would get tangles.  It also looked and felt dry, like straw.  Other products I&#x27;ve used gave me shine.  This had zero shine.  I decided to give it another try today and blow dried it straight.  Again, I got volume and it blow dried very well, doesn&#x27;t seem as tangled but still it looks and feels sooooooo dry.  I hate having fried looking hair so I will not be using this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I must be out of it...I&#x27;ve used the styling creme for 7 years religiously every day and I didn&#x27;t notice the formulation change that everyone is talking about. It still works great for me.</li>
            <li> This product is light and does not weigh down your hair or make it \\&quot;crunchy.\\&quot;  I would rate the hold factor as fair.  This is more than I normally pay for a hair product and was expecting a little more performance from it. I think you need a lot more than the suggested amount to get results.  I do love the smell.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years; adds body to hair and helps it to hold its shape without adding stiffness</li>
            <li> The styling creme makes the hair quite stiff when it dries. You need to be very careful not to apply too much or the hair becomes like stiff bristles. Also, I find that it is best to use it only every other time I wash my hair or it seems to build up on the hair.</li>
            <li> Having had a drip-dry hairdo all my life, I started using curly mousse as my brown hair became more and more mixed with white, and my hair texture changed. The mousse was okay, but made my hair a little stiff.I had heard about Bumble and Bumble products for years, and finally decided to try some at half price, from a discount website. I LOVED the styling creme, and could have cried when I packed in in my carry-on (not my checked suitcase) by mistake, and it went in the garbage at security. So, I ordered some from Amazon, and now I have happy hair. It&#x27;s never stiff, and the more creme I use, the more hold there is. It doesn&#x27;t look as if I have used a hair product at all, and that I&#x27;m just a grey-haired grandma with lots of curls.</li>
            <li> I love this because it is light and yet styles the hair great.  it holds the whole day.  No flaking as some products leave.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about 5 yys. It is the only styling creme that works for me . I have thick hair and it gives me body so I can style it so much easier. Love your products.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money. It is conditioning, but does not make your hair greasy in any way - it provides volume without drying.</li>
            <li> love this stuff but can&#x27;t usually justify the hit to the wallet</li>
            <li> I received this, unscrewed the cap and something wasn&#x27;t right. No fragrance, wrong texture, and the bottle looked used. I even had another bottle, purchased at a salon, to compare the contents, and this was an obvious scam.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> It was great to be able to order the styling creme through Amazone.  Pricing is so much better than buying it from the Salon.  It is a good product for styling your hair.  This is my second bottle.  Will continue to buy.  No issues receiving the product.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it isn&#x27;t in a pressurized bottle.  Takes very little of the product to manage my short hair.  Not gooey or stiff when dry.  Little pricey, but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and most products just make it less manageable.  This creme is light weight and holds my hair without turning it into a haystack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews where users were complaining that the formula was changed and the product did not work like it did in the past. I&#x27;ve been using the product for years and I have no complaints. To me it&#x27;s just as good as the original!</li>
            <li> I have very very fine and very thin hair . it grows slowly and breaks off if rubbed. I have to keep it short. It is mainly flat but has a very small curl to it. I am sensitive to smells. I am in a hurry. Most products are too heavy. this is great--goes on well, brings out the curl, makes hair shine and lift nicely. However, do not put it on and let it dry and expect to brush it. it will be hard and will fuzz up. Just put it in, style it up, and no need to worry about it all day long.  Also, the product is $26 for an 8 ounce container on the bumble and bumble website so I think that is cheaper!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! I use it on my natural African American hair and it makes my curls fluffy and beautiful. Best out there!</li>
            <li> Great but it&#x27;s $26 on bumble and bumble.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and find it adds the body that I need for my hair.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I always cream my hair before blow drying it. I lovr Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner but I was deeply dissatisfied with the styling cream. I would much rather use a drug store styling cream brand. I have very long hair and I only need to use a dime of this styling cream because it is so greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used this styling creme for years.  The consistency has changed with  different sellers.  I still like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this styling creme for years and love it.  But the product in this bottle is not the same color or texture as it should be. B&amp;B is expensive and worth the $$$ BUT&lt;br /&gt;this is definitely not what is in this bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product from Bumble &amp; Bumble.  I use it to tame my little fly aways without looking like I have a ton of hair gel and I love the scent very much.</li>
