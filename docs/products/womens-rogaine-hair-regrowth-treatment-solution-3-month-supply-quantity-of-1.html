            <li> does what it says it does</li>
            <li> Great price, great product.... it really works... its been a month and I am already seeing lots of new hair growth....</li>
            <li> I use this product for fifteen years. Cannot say that my hair drastically improved, but if I would not use it, I would not have any and it would be a disaster.</li>
            <li> I have been using Rogaine  since October 2013 and I have  a lot more  hair  growth now. I saw  new growth within two months  and  needlesd to say I was  very  happy.  The instructions  say to  put it  on twice a day morning and evening  three times a week  which I have  faithfully doing and I&#x27;m soooooo  happy with the results. I never had any problems with the Rogaine so anyone  wanting to promote new hair  growth please  give  Rogaine a  try. And  do  use it twice a day  three times a week.</li>
            <li> WOMEN ROGAIN LIVES UP TO IT&#x27;S NAME. A VERY FINE PRODUCT. I WOULD TELL ALL MY FRIENDS THAT HAVE THINNING HAIR TO TRY THIS PRODUCT. THANKS FOR THE HELP</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and can already see new growth. The only problem is that I have had to re-order already.  Each container is supposed to last about a month, but using the suggested amounts twice a day, I only got about a week from each container. instead of having to purchase this product every three months, it looks like I will actually be buying it once a month.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while and have not seen any significant improvement yet.  I&#x27;ll stay with it a little longer.</li>
            <li> Still on the fence. Only two months  2 month  of usage.</li>
            <li> My mom is on her 2nd bottled and our hopes are high :-) Also, I know its a popular product and we have all faith in this product :-)</li>
            <li> Got it as promised without any issue.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for someone who needed to have her hair grow back.  It was doctor ordered, but it wasn&#x27;t covered on Insurance.  The pharmacy charged way to much money for just one box!  It was like over $9.00 extra for one box, then Amazon&#x27;s price.  Now if you get the 3 pack you can save even so much more, so that&#x27;s what we did, and her hair with also medicated shampoo, has grown in nicely.  It has taken 8 months, but she had her hair ripped out of her head, and had a bald spot about 6 inches in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased all of her Rogaine through Amazon, except for the first order, as the doctor put it through the pharmacy, but since it was an O.T.C., He wrote out that we could order it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The product truly works, but it depends on what the situation is for.  she needed regrowth of her roots being pulled out, so it was great.  I&#x27;, not sure on other issues, but if your hair lose is something but balding, this will do the job, then check about getting medicated shampoo to go along with it!  Her hair looks so nice.  Be patient, it takes time.  We saw growth in about 3 months, and the  it really started growing!  It all depends on your situation!  But, get it from Amazon, not a phjarmacy...to much $$$!</li>
            <li> It works good but you have to wait around 4 months to start seen the hair growing. ï»¿the only bad thing is that it makes your hair dry and it gives you a little mustache.</li>
            <li> The packaging was good. I am still new to this product, and it may take a bit more time to see how well it works.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because she very thin hair on the top of her head. Well she used it for about two weeks and she said that it was starting to help except now she is growing hair on the side of her face. I asked if she got some on there and she said &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; that she was only putting it on the thinning area on top of her head. She has now stop using it. I bought a 6 month supply for her - money down the drain.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to hear a review to know that Rogaine works- it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a real testimonial: I live in the South, where the weather in the summer regularly clears 100 degrees with 80% humidity (try breathing in a wet towel and you&#x27;ll get an accurate feeling of what it&#x27;s like to live here for two months). I&#x27;m in my late 20s and from the North and my body is still not used to the heat and humidity. That includes my hair (or, more accurately, scalp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair falls out in huge clumps from late June to early September. To combat that, I bought Rogaine for Women. My friends, family and hair dresser all laughed at me but within a month my hair was thicker. Even my hair dresser has to admit it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use this product 6 months out of the year (or basically every other month) because it does cause severe dryness to my scalp.</li>
            <li> I am using this for a A month they say you have to wait two months to see an improvement so I&#x27;m waiting</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> It took about 3 months to finally see a difference, but it is there!  My hair is starting to feel like my hair again -- thick and healthy, and the bald spots are getting smaller and smaller.  I have tried lots of different shampoos and other treatments, but this is the first thing that has worked.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 yrs now and i definetly see a lot of new baby hairs growin all over my head &#x27; only thing u have to keep using it for like a year ti really get a big diffrence &#x27; in hair growth its worth it &#x27;</li>
