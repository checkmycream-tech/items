            <li>So most are repeated.</li>
            <li>My niece is learning to do our nails and she will love these.  </li>
            <li>They are so cute.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for that!&lt;br /&gt;About the canes: they are so tiny but the perfect size for nails!</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re cute.</li>
            <li>These are ok.  </li>
            <li>Would work much better if you are adding them to acrylic while your forming the nail.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can cut these yourself.  </li>
            <li>but that is more along my fault.</li>
            <li>They also sent me an absolutely adorable tool to go with ot</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get very many super cutesy ones like bows and hello kitties, animals, etc.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!!</li>
            <li>They are super cute!</li>
            <li>They are super cute though!  </li>
            <li>this stuff is nice and cool.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend These are my first and the best nail art canes</li>
            <li>, a present, a frog, two awesome detailed butterflies, a striped fish, a parrot, and a flag.  </li>
            <li>They are super cute and easy to work with!</li>
            <li>I use them with gel nails and they stay on for the full 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>But all the other canes where perfect!</li>
            <li>flexible rods easy to cut.</li>
            <li>also they are really easy to cut.</li>
            <li>They arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy when you use a one sided razor blade.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely a lot of flowers which is just fine &#x27;cause</li>
            <li>Super cute dog&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>the delivery was great came very quickly and all canes are different.</li>
            <li>They are all different, in great condition and all super cute.</li>
            <li>They are all different, in great condition and all super cute.</li>
            <li>Would have been better if there was a tool included to cut them to the right thickness.</li>
            <li>but, it will be very fun with these pens.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to begin using the fimo nail art.</li>
            <li>However, they look really cute and funny.  </li>
            <li>I have orderd 2 times with this person and I am happy , they do take really long to get here almost 2 months</li>
            <li>I liked them :) they were all different</li>
            <li>Its a fun addition and easy to use and remove from my nails.</li>
            <li>Dont know if I would buy again, even at this super cheap price</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the doubles because I can include them in swaps and even if I had nothing to do with my duplicate canes, there&#x27;s really no loss as these are a great price compared to pre sliced fimo.</li>
            <li>All the canes where full lengths with no deformed ones.</li>
            <li>If you are applying them to the top of your nail they stick up way to much.  </li>
            <li>in all not bad for the price</li>
            <li>My order made it home in less than a week, the fimo are very cheap but DO NOT look cheap on your nails, I love it!</li>
            <li>I received these quickly, even after having a problem and inquiring about my order.</li>
            <li>Came first day it was expected to come, in great condition.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy shipment.</li>
            <li>And also, if you guys wanted the square ones with animal prints, they are so pretty!</li>
            <li>some buyers are giving 5cm length canes at pretty cool price with sam e quantity.</li>
            <li>They are fun to use.</li>
            <li>There worth the price</li>
            <li>i got it pretty quick because it was coming from Japan, i got it in three weeks</li>
            <li>Product is as described If you love to put different designs on your nails then you will love these, just cut, place and brush over, simple and easy...</li>
            <li>I am not confident that i will be creating a great design.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and will be back for more myself!</li>
            <li>There are so many different canes/designs to choose from, I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t even be able to use half!</li>
            <li>my daughter and I simply love all the different designs</li>
            <li>Some of them I only got one of but most of them I got X2 X3 X4 X5 X6 X7.</li>
            <li>I have seen many reviews from various sellers for these canes</li>
            <li>But mine had exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d order more, not because I&#x27;d run out, but because I&#x27;d like to get different designs.</li>
            <li>(and pretty) flowers&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Hello Kitty, no Angry Birds, the CC logo i a joke</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like, mostly out of personal preference.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried these things.  </li>
            <li>, I just should have ordered a smaller bundle to try them before getting one hundred of them :)  </li>
            <li>but most of them are different</li>
            <li>they look really pretty on my nails</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for title says it all</li>
            <li>Looks like you will not get what is in this exact picture.</li>
            <li>I only got this because I was hoping to get the Hello Kitty Fimo and the cute cupcakes which I got neither of them.</li>
            <li>So cute, I got several designs and no duplicates!</li>
            <li>You are getting more than you pay for because of the bigger canes.</li>
            <li>These are great for anyone who wants to be ambitious with their nails, yet still wants the tiny details often difficult to do on one&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I really like my purchase.</li>
            <li>the price&#x27;s are to die for (very affordable)</li>
            <li>light blue butterflies</li>
            <li>I really thought they will be atleast 5 cms in length.</li>
            <li>The flag isn&#x27;t a perfect American one, but it&#x27;s red, white and blue with a star.  </li>
            <li>dark limes too many limes</li>
            <li>Definitely will be back for more ^__^</li>
            <li>Definitely something fun to play with.   </li>
            <li>There were a few I wasn&#x27;t sure about when I saw them though.</li>
            <li>A bit disappointed, cause the picture shows a lot more variety, such as hearts, bunnies, leaves, hello kitty friends and more, but nevertheless cute.</li>
            <li>Kinda hard to cut yourself, but get and exacto knife and its pretty easy.</li>
            <li>but I got 104 the first time and 101 the 2nd time</li>
            <li>I got 3 duplicates in my first set and 1 duplicate in my second set.</li>
            <li>wow!)</li>
            <li>These are great to make an otherwise boring at-home manicure special and fun.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use them like I wanted to they were to hard.  </li>
            <li>All of the designs are extremely cute they are a bit hard to cut</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of adding a little something extra to my nails and these were fun for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Customer service is great (from Crazy Cart).</li>
            <li>I think the most common pattern was butterfly or flower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy that I got 2 hello kitties, 2 my melodies, 2 hello kitty bows, 1 rilakkuma cane, and 4 angry birds!</li>
            <li>They are smaller than I expected, but if you have small nail beds this is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Cool little designs.</li>
            <li>Hot pink rose&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>The little ones are more detailed and easier to cut, however - though they are also a bit odd for a few of the canes.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping comes with a cutter only thing is i didnt get 100 different shapes</li>
            <li>Cute Chibi face ( green, black,</li>
            <li>I will note, that the clear fimo clay areas might appear clear when embedded into acrylic nails, but does not come out fully clear on nail polish - they will be white, or yellow, or pink, etc., instead of clear or translucent.</li>
            <li>The greatest difficulty is cutting the rods to the proper amount of thickness, for if you make them too thick, the sticker will fall off.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that the canes are SUPER short.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Definitely a lot of flowers which is just fine &#x27;cause</li>
            <li> Super cute dog&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> the delivery was great came very quickly and all canes are different.</li>
            <li> They are all different, in great condition and all super cute.</li>
            <li> They are all different, in great condition and all super cute.</li>
            <li> Would have been better if there was a tool included to cut them to the right thickness.</li>
            <li> but, it will be very fun with these pens.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to begin using the fimo nail art.</li>
            <li> However, they look really cute and funny.  </li>
            <li> I have orderd 2 times with this person and I am happy , they do take really long to get here almost 2 months</li>
            <li> I liked them :) they were all different</li>
            <li> Its a fun addition and easy to use and remove from my nails.</li>
            <li> Dont know if I would buy again, even at this super cheap price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the doubles because I can include them in swaps and even if I had nothing to do with my duplicate canes, there&#x27;s really no loss as these are a great price compared to pre sliced fimo.</li>
            <li> All the canes where full lengths with no deformed ones.</li>
            <li> If you are applying them to the top of your nail they stick up way to much.  </li>
            <li> in all not bad for the price</li>
            <li> My order made it home in less than a week, the fimo are very cheap but DO NOT look cheap on your nails, I love it!</li>
            <li> I received these quickly, even after having a problem and inquiring about my order.</li>
            <li> Came first day it was expected to come, in great condition.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy shipment.</li>
            <li> And also, if you guys wanted the square ones with animal prints, they are so pretty!</li>
            <li> some buyers are giving 5cm length canes at pretty cool price with sam e quantity.</li>
            <li> They are fun to use.</li>
            <li> There worth the price</li>
            <li> i got it pretty quick because it was coming from Japan, i got it in three weeks</li>
            <li> Product is as described If you love to put different designs on your nails then you will love these, just cut, place and brush over, simple and easy...</li>
            <li> I am not confident that i will be creating a great design.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and will be back for more myself!</li>
            <li> There are so many different canes/designs to choose from, I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t even be able to use half!</li>
            <li> my daughter and I simply love all the different designs</li>
            <li> Some of them I only got one of but most of them I got X2 X3 X4 X5 X6 X7.</li>
            <li> I have seen many reviews from various sellers for these canes</li>
            <li> But mine had exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d order more, not because I&#x27;d run out, but because I&#x27;d like to get different designs.</li>
            <li> (and pretty) flowers&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Hello Kitty, no Angry Birds, the CC logo i a joke</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like, mostly out of personal preference.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried these things.  </li>
            <li> , I just should have ordered a smaller bundle to try them before getting one hundred of them :)  </li>
            <li> but most of them are different</li>
            <li> they look really pretty on my nails</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for title says it all</li>
            <li> Looks like you will not get what is in this exact picture.</li>
            <li> I only got this because I was hoping to get the Hello Kitty Fimo and the cute cupcakes which I got neither of them.</li>
            <li> So cute, I got several designs and no duplicates!</li>
            <li> You are getting more than you pay for because of the bigger canes.</li>
            <li> These are great for anyone who wants to be ambitious with their nails, yet still wants the tiny details often difficult to do on one&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I really like my purchase.</li>
            <li> the price&#x27;s are to die for (very affordable)</li>
            <li> light blue butterflies</li>
            <li> I really thought they will be atleast 5 cms in length.</li>
            <li> The flag isn&#x27;t a perfect American one, but it&#x27;s red, white and blue with a star.  </li>
            <li> dark limes too many limes</li>
            <li> Definitely will be back for more ^__^</li>
            <li> Definitely something fun to play with.   </li>
            <li> There were a few I wasn&#x27;t sure about when I saw them though.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed, cause the picture shows a lot more variety, such as hearts, bunnies, leaves, hello kitty friends and more, but nevertheless cute.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to cut yourself, but get and exacto knife and its pretty easy.</li>
            <li> but I got 104 the first time and 101 the 2nd time</li>
            <li> I got 3 duplicates in my first set and 1 duplicate in my second set.</li>
            <li> wow!)</li>
            <li> These are great to make an otherwise boring at-home manicure special and fun.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use them like I wanted to they were to hard.  </li>
            <li> All of the designs are extremely cute they are a bit hard to cut</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of adding a little something extra to my nails and these were fun for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Customer service is great (from Crazy Cart).</li>
            <li> I think the most common pattern was butterfly or flower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy that I got 2 hello kitties, 2 my melodies, 2 hello kitty bows, 1 rilakkuma cane, and 4 angry birds!</li>
            <li> They are smaller than I expected, but if you have small nail beds this is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Cool little designs.</li>
            <li> Hot pink rose&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> The little ones are more detailed and easier to cut, however - though they are also a bit odd for a few of the canes.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping comes with a cutter only thing is i didnt get 100 different shapes</li>
            <li> Cute Chibi face ( green, black,</li>
            <li> I will note, that the clear fimo clay areas might appear clear when embedded into acrylic nails, but does not come out fully clear on nail polish - they will be white, or yellow, or pink, etc., instead of clear or translucent.</li>
            <li> The greatest difficulty is cutting the rods to the proper amount of thickness, for if you make them too thick, the sticker will fall off.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the canes are SUPER short.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised about this, considering the expected arrival date was Monday the 16th till thursday the 19th!</li>
            <li> Should last a really long time.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the packaging wasn&#x27;t very well</li>
            <li> That was a bit of a disappointment, but I did get all of these for a very cheap price of course.</li>
            <li> pink and white skulls&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> Pink and white dotted melon slices</li>
            <li> White, tan, pink, black)&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Red pink roses</li>
            <li> And some fimos are really not clear and not understable..</li>
            <li> With (I&#x27;m assuming) Chinese words&lt;br /&gt;2 Black and White yin</li>
            <li> The other issue that I have is that there was about to of the same chines character that I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> dark blue butterfly&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> brown yellow green blue and pink corn kernel shaped thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they are all loose in a zip-loc type baggie so some may arrive a bit bent.</li>
            <li> The rest are easily identifiable, and contain such characters as the red Angry Birds birdy, and (blue) Hello Kitty.</li>
            <li> Black and White Checker print (Square)&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Brown white and black checker print (</li>
            <li> Black and white flowers</li>
            <li> Black and white Puppy</li>
            <li> Only two or three were odd patterns</li>
            <li> pink monarch butterfly halves</li>
            <li> pink flower</li>
            <li> Some are harder to slice than others but you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Pink flowers</li>
            <li> Brown green and yellow bean shaped thing&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> , I guess for the low price, even a few pieces that you use would offset the price.</li>
            <li> and I looked through them carefully.</li>
            <li> green, yellow, pink, white&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A big assortment of types and not many repeats.</li>
            <li> and i just placed and other order</li>
            <li> an angry bird cane ;D</li>
            <li> it is okay, just have to practice cutting it thin enough.  </li>
            <li> Got a package of fruit nothing but fruit, the other nothing but flower.</li>
            <li> The lengths are all approx the same, give or take no more than 2mm.</li>
            <li> However you need a really sharp tool to work with.</li>
            <li> Other than that, there are a few fruit pieces I would use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that some people got doubles or just fruits, but mine actually came with different designs.</li>
            <li> Weird Black and white and blue stripped fruit.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> Orange and black stripe square&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> But for less than 2 bucks including shipping,,,kinda get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The canes are very small in size about half the size of a pencil eraser and around a inch long.</li>
            <li> The varieties are terrible and I received many duplicates!  </li>
            <li> little</li>
            <li> but you could not roll them out even a little.</li>
            <li> I can see one cane that looks a little defective, but the majority of the cane is still useable.  </li>
            <li> you get a lot of fimo canes and also 2 little</li>
            <li> This item is not a good buy, I purchased these a year or so ago and like the amount of product that I received as when the canes arrived they were about 2 inches long ( the order was a 50 pieces) whe</li>
            <li> lime green leaf&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> green flowers</li>
            <li> green star&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> diffrent green flowers</li>
            <li> green citrus fruit</li>
            <li> They are small, like the size of half of a crayon and a little thinner.</li>
            <li> the only thing i dislike just a little is that i have to cut them really thin almost as thin as paper.</li>
            <li> It came in a small baggy with a razorblade.</li>
            <li> Weird white square thing</li>
            <li> I waited so anxiously for this item to come in the mail and</li>
            <li> I decided to buy some b/c Im still not very good at making them .</li>
            <li> I had at least 30 flowers alone about 25 butterflies...</li>
            <li> if I could give a negative amount of stars</li>
            <li> Weird Swirly pink berry&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Yes, they are small!</li>
            <li> (angry ying-yang bull, half of a butterfly, unrecognizable fruit).</li>
            <li> They were also very small and thin</li>
            <li> Very hard to use.</li>
            <li> Some canes were broken.</li>
            <li> I was not happy.</li>
            <li> , however 2 canes were 1/3 in length to the other canes which was kinda weird and some of the canes were twisted and lumpy, so after cutting them the design was distorted to the point where it couldn&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li> waw.... got angry birds in this too.</li>
            <li> There was 2 hello kitty, 1 angry birds and 2 despicable me characters.</li>
            <li> what they show in the picture is absolutely wrong</li>
            <li> Angry Birds</li>
            <li> Weird glasses, or headphones, or something.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Angry Ying Yang guy (Blue)&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Got these strictly for the the Hello Kitty and Angry Birds.</li>
            <li> I got a pear, a goldfish, Angry Birds, a purse, an Easter egg, a duck, a Ace of Spades card, a Breast Cancer Research ribbon (</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product itself</li>
            <li> You have to slice them very thinly in order for them to stay on your nail.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 100 nail art canes from Crazy Cart.</li>
            <li> There was 93 canes and a cutting blade.</li>
            <li> and I see a lot of unhappy people with lots of duplicates.</li>
            <li> Just a heads up, Crazy Cart ships them is a plastic-like envelope (not a bubble mailer or box)</li>
            <li> I ordered the 100 nail art canes from Crazy Cart.</li>
            <li> maybe a cutting tool can be included in the package.</li>
            <li> There was even a angry bird one!</li>
            <li> it might be a ugly bird</li>
            <li> when it did I was a bit disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> :(  ..I don&#x27;t have the time to return it.</li>
            <li> Some of the designs they sent were really stupid</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great little fimo canes, perfect for embedding in acrylic or gel nails. A big assortment of types and not many repeats.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that some people got doubles or just fruits, but mine actually came with different designs. From peace sign, yin and yang, hello kitty, bear, smiley faces etc. I really like my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love these! I give it a 4 star because I would have liked to have had doubles of the more practical ones like the fruit or flowers.... Not the play boy bunnies... Also the canes are short! It would be nice if they were longer. Those were the only negatives about this. Otherwise I love them. I would order again.</li>
            <li> Loved the mix of canes I received. I ended up with-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feathers-&lt;br /&gt;rainbow, red/black/white, white/blue, pink/white, green&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;smiley faces-&lt;br /&gt;red,two shades of purple (about 7 of these), blue, green&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;flowers-&lt;br /&gt;purple/pink. green, yellow, pink, white&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kawaii-&lt;br /&gt;Hello Kitty,My Melody,Cupcake,Blue Elephant,Bear,there were a couple others too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fruit-&lt;br /&gt;lemon, lime, pomegranate, star fruit, strawberry and others I do not recognize&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pumpkin, bat, Christmas tree, snowman, hearts, lips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were more designs and a nice variety of bright colors. These were 2 inch canes, as described and were simple to cut too.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to begin using the fimo nail art. the delivery was great came very quickly and all canes are different. i am very satisfied by my purchase. and im sure anyone who orders this will be</li>
            <li> waw.... got angry birds in this too. flexible rods easy to cut. beautiful designs and what i saw was what i got plus more :-) Fast and easy shipment.</li>
            <li> I had at least 30 flowers alone about 25 butterflies... I wouldve liked more variety. Some canes were broken. One was disformed but I had 107 canes so the defects evened out.</li>
            <li> Would have been better if there was a tool included to cut them to the right thickness.</li>
            <li> I love the canes, they are really good ❤ also they are really easy to cut. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤&lt;br /&gt;This are the best nail Art canes I have bougth</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to fact that I have to cut them individually.   However, they look really cute and funny.  Definitely something fun to play with.   I am not confident that i will be creating a great design. but, it will be very fun with these pens.</li>
            <li> I am so happy about my order,it came in so fast! the price&#x27;s are to die for (very affordable) the packaging is excellent, I am a happy costumer and i just placed and other order :) thank you crazycart</li>
            <li> My order made it home in less than a week, the fimo are very cheap but DO NOT look cheap on your nails, I love it!</li>
            <li> They were very good I liked them :) they were all different I even got an angry bird cane ;D I would order some more</li>
            <li> I seen these at sally&#x27;s for so much more. They cut 10 pieces and put them in a container and sell them for 6 bucks. I paid like 3 bucks for like a hundred sticks. I will never run out. They are super cute! I like to pre cute them for use. I use them with gel nails and they stay on for the full 2 weeks! Great product and price.</li>
            <li> It actually came with 120 but they were only 1 inch in length</li>
            <li> I ordered the 100 nail art canes from Crazy Cart. They arrived very quickly. The price was great. They are all different, in great condition and all super cute. I highly recommend and will be back for more myself! These are the best nail art canes I have ever bought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+ Seller</li>
            <li> I Received the product in 3 weeks. There was 93 canes and a cutting blade. There was only 4 duplicates. All the canes where full lengths with no deformed ones. There was 2 hello kitty, 1 angry birds and 2 despicable me characters. My only complaint is the packaging wasn&#x27;t very well the canes and blade was in a ziplock bag. So they could have gotten damage also not very net. The canes are very small in size about half the size of a pencil eraser and around a inch long.</li>
            <li> Product is as described If you love to put different designs on your nails then you will love these, just cut, place and brush over, simple and easy...my daughter and I simply love all the different designs :) will def recommend to anyone who loves to do their nails up!</li>
            <li> Ok so I thought I was going to get 100 diffrent designs. Not in this case, I got 40 difrent stix. Some of them I only got one of but most of them I got X2 X3 X4 X5 X6 X7. I got way too many fruits (limes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I recived&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 sunflowers&lt;br /&gt;1 cantalope I think&lt;br /&gt;2 lady bugs&lt;br /&gt;1 red heart&lt;br /&gt;4 red leaves&lt;br /&gt;1 lime green leaf&lt;br /&gt;1 blue leaf&lt;br /&gt;1 orange leaf&lt;br /&gt;4 light blue butterflies&lt;br /&gt;3 pink monarch butterfly halves&lt;br /&gt;1 blue monarch butterfly half&lt;br /&gt;4 pink and white skulls&lt;br /&gt;4 orange halves&lt;br /&gt;6 grapefruit I think&lt;br /&gt;6 gray feathers&lt;br /&gt;3 cucumber slices&lt;br /&gt;3 green flowers&lt;br /&gt;1 lemon half&lt;br /&gt;4 bananna slices&lt;br /&gt;1 green star&lt;br /&gt;1 pink flower&lt;br /&gt;1 blue star shaped flower&lt;br /&gt;1 pear half&lt;br /&gt;1 apple half&lt;br /&gt;1 dark blue butterfly&lt;br /&gt;3 strawberry halves&lt;br /&gt;3 white butterflies&lt;br /&gt;2 white flowers&lt;br /&gt;1 blue and white flower&lt;br /&gt;2 orange cats&lt;br /&gt;3 tomato halves&lt;br /&gt;1 teady bear head&lt;br /&gt;2 kiwi halves&lt;br /&gt;4 cherries&lt;br /&gt;4 bright limes&lt;br /&gt;6 dark limes too many limes&lt;br /&gt;2 diffrent green flowers&lt;br /&gt;1 diffrent blue flower&lt;br /&gt;7 orange dragonflies&lt;br /&gt;1 unidentified stick it might be a ugly bird</li>
            <li> I have orderd 2 times with this person and I am happy , they do take really long to get here almost 2 months but I got 104 the first time and 101 the 2nd time and they come with a razor to cut it works best if you heat up the razor then cut it.  LOOK AT THE PHOTOS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS !</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of adding a little something extra to my nails and these were fun for a few weeks. I think the type of shapes are for a younger group, like tweens or teens. Its a fun addition and easy to use and remove from my nails.</li>
            <li> Sooooo happy! I have seen many reviews from various sellers for these canes and I see a lot of unhappy people with lots of duplicates. But mine had exactly what I wanted. I got a majority of flowers, then fruits, then character faces, and the rest are a mixture of cupcakes, hearts, holiday-themed, and butterflies/dragonflies. Plus, I got a channel one!!! It came in a small baggy with a razorblade. Thank you so much!!!! Xiexie!</li>
            <li> The picture is misleading.  We order the canes with blade but it did not come.  When I contacted the seller, they told me it was sold without a blade.  The varieties are terrible and I received many duplicates!  It looks nothing like the picture.  Some canes also came shorter than the others.  I would not recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use them like I wanted to they were to hard.  I was able to use them if I put then onto polymer clay.  They are&lt;br /&gt;cute little but you could not roll them out even a little.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use. You have to slice them very thinly in order for them to stay on your nail. I plan on purchasing the ones that are already pre sliced to see if that helps.</li>
            <li> if I could give a negative amount of stars I sure would. what they show in the picture is absolutely wrong I literally only got butterflies and fruit and one dragonfly. Erica</li>
            <li> This item is not a good buy, I purchased these a year or so ago and like the amount of product that I received as when the canes arrived they were about 2 inches long ( the order was a 50 pieces) whe I ordered 100 pieces I received 100 1 inch canes and felt ripped off. I was not happy. The other issue that I have is that there was about to of the same chines character that I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations. Came first day it was expected to come, in great condition.</li>
            <li> I like the variety and detail in this set. I got 3 duplicates in my first set and 1 duplicate in my second set. I don&#x27;t mind the doubles because I can include them in swaps and even if I had nothing to do with my duplicate canes, there&#x27;s really no loss as these are a great price compared to pre sliced fimo. I use an X-acto crafting knife to slice these and haven&#x27;t had any problem. Some are harder to slice than others but you get the hang of it. I get 100+ slices per cane!!! These are gonna last forever. I&#x27;d order more, not because I&#x27;d run out, but because I&#x27;d like to get different designs. Just a heads up, Crazy Cart ships them is a plastic-like envelope (not a bubble mailer or box) and they are all loose in a zip-loc type baggie so some may arrive a bit bent. However, that doesn&#x27;t affect the outcome of how they look once they are sliced.</li>
            <li> These are great for anyone who wants to be ambitious with their nails, yet still wants the tiny details often difficult to do on one&#x27;s own. I get so many compliments with these on my nails. The greatest difficulty is cutting the rods to the proper amount of thickness, for if you make them too thick, the sticker will fall off. But compared to the price of nail salons, and the originality of the product, it is a great buy!</li>
            <li> I ordered the 100 nail art canes from Crazy Cart. The price is great. They are all different, in great condition and all super cute. I highly recommend These are my first and the best nail art canes I have bought!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+ Seller</li>
            <li> So I got it in the mail about 13 days before it was supposed to come which is a bonus! They&#x27;re the perfect size for nails, obviously! I got I think about 103 instead of just 100, which is totally fine with me! None were like ruined or anything. There were a few I wasn&#x27;t sure about when I saw them though. I didn&#x27;t get very many super cutesy ones like bows and hello kitties, animals, etc. That was a bit of a disappointment, but I did get all of these for a very cheap price of course. Here is the list of what I got:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 Angry Birds Assorted.&lt;br /&gt;2 Black and White Checker print (Square)&lt;br /&gt;3 Brown white and black checker print (square)&lt;br /&gt;4 Santa&#x27;s in assorted colors&lt;br /&gt;4 Weird Black and white and blue stripped fruit.&lt;br /&gt;2 Smilies, one Blue, one Green&lt;br /&gt;3 With (I&#x27;m assuming) Chinese words&lt;br /&gt;2 Black and White yin yang&lt;br /&gt;1 Red and white yin yang&lt;br /&gt;1 Weird glasses, or headphones, or something.&lt;br /&gt;1 Chanel&lt;br /&gt;2 Pink and white dotted melon slices&lt;br /&gt;2 Square italian flags&lt;br /&gt;2 Circle italian flags&lt;br /&gt;2 Blue flowers&lt;br /&gt;2 Pink flowers&lt;br /&gt;3 Black and white flowers&lt;br /&gt;1 Black and white Puppy paw&lt;br /&gt;15 Assorted (and pretty) flowers&lt;br /&gt;3 Cute Chibi faces (White, tan, pink, black)&lt;br /&gt;1 Cute Chibi face ( green, black, pink)&lt;br /&gt;1 Angry Ying Yang guy (Blue)&lt;br /&gt;1 Super cute dog&lt;br /&gt;1 Straw berry slice&lt;br /&gt;1 Water Melon slice&lt;br /&gt;3 Yellow fruit or bannana&lt;br /&gt;4 Kiwi&lt;br /&gt;4 Purple Roses&lt;br /&gt;5 Red pink roses&lt;br /&gt;1 Hot pink rose&lt;br /&gt;1 Lime&lt;br /&gt;1 Weird Swirly pink berry&lt;br /&gt;1 China flag heart&lt;br /&gt;1 Purple and White Heart&lt;br /&gt;1 Orange and white heart&lt;br /&gt;1 Dragon fly&lt;br /&gt;1 blue butterfly with white background&lt;br /&gt;2 Blue and white butterflies&lt;br /&gt;1 Red bow&lt;br /&gt;2 green citrus fruit&lt;br /&gt;1 Weird white square thing&lt;br /&gt;1 Orange and black stripe square&lt;br /&gt;1 Brown green and yellow bean shaped thing&lt;br /&gt;1 brown yellow green blue and pink corn kernel shaped thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a lot of flowers which is just fine &#x27;cause I love flowers (: But again, I just wish there were more cutesy bows and kitties and hello kitty and etc.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came with a razor blade, but that&#x27;s okay! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Cool little designs. Kinda hard to cut yourself, but get and exacto knife and its pretty easy. Some of the designs they sent were really stupid but oh well it&#x27;s a china product.</li>
            <li> I really thought they will be atleast 5 cms in length. But they are just 2.5 cms and they just divided one 5 cm in to two 2.5 cms to make it two. So most are repeated. And some fimos are really not clear and not understable.. some buyers are giving 5cm length canes at pretty cool price with sam e quantity. I will never buy it again</li>
            <li> I just recently got into making polymer clay charms and fimo canes. I decided to buy some b/c Im still not very good at making them . These are great! They are super cute and easy to work with! Definitely will be back for more ^__^</li>
            <li> I waited so anxiously for this item to come in the mail and when it did I was a bit disappointed in the quality. I do appreciate that I paid around $6.50 for this product and the postage was $3.00 (written on the envelope), however 2 canes were 1/3 in length to the other canes which was kinda weird and some of the canes were twisted and lumpy, so after cutting them the design was distorted to the point where it couldn&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li> Got these strictly for the the Hello Kitty and Angry Birds. There where no pieces of either! No Hello Kitty, no Angry Birds, the CC logo i a joke and I would be embarrased to wear it. Other than that, there are a few fruit pieces I would use, I guess for the low price, even a few pieces that you use would offset the price. Took a while to get here, like 2 weeks. But for less than 2 bucks including shipping,,,kinda get what you pay for. They are small, like the size of half of a crayon and a little thinner. Yes, they are small! Comparable to like 3/4 of a lollipop stick. Dont know if I would buy again, even at this super cheap price</li>
            <li> They send me what they want ...no what I need...:(  ..I don&#x27;t have the time to return it. I like the ones in the pictures</li>
            <li> These are great.  My niece is learning to do our nails and she will love these.  They are so cute.  Should last a really long time.</li>
            <li> Just got these today and I am already working on my technique for slicing.  It takes some practice and some patience, but I am getting it.  I got a great variety in my package and wanted to point out some of the ones I hadn&#x27;t seen before.  I got a pear, a goldfish, Angry Birds, a purse, an Easter egg, a duck, a Ace of Spades card, a Breast Cancer Research ribbon (Righteous! wow!), a present, a frog, two awesome detailed butterflies, a striped fish, a parrot, and a flag.  The flag isn&#x27;t a perfect American one, but it&#x27;s red, white and blue with a star.  In addition to these I got an assortment of fruits, flowers, leaves, smiley faces and the like.  I am so stoked!  I can see one cane that looks a little defective, but the majority of the cane is still useable.  They are smaller than I expected, but if you have small nail beds this is a good thing.  I will be using them as soon as possible.  Hope this is helpful for you guys!</li>
            <li> I ordered this package of canes from you, as well as the larger square ones and the 50 pack of flower ones and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I ordered them on the 10th, and they already came in today; 3 days later! I was so surprised about this, considering the expected arrival date was Monday the 16th till thursday the 19th! Thank you for that!&lt;br /&gt;About the canes: they are so tiny but the perfect size for nails! They are soo detailed! I&#x27;m really happy that I got 2 hello kitties, 2 my melodies, 2 hello kitty bows, 1 rilakkuma cane, and 4 angry birds! That was awesome! All of the canes are so intricate! And also, if you guys wanted the square ones with animal prints, they are so pretty! I definitely recommend buying from this seller! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> it is okay, just have to practice cutting it thin enough.  maybe a cutting tool can be included in the package.</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail today and I looked through them carefully. There is only ONE duplicate, and I was very impressed with that. There are so many different canes/designs to choose from, I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t even be able to use half! Only complaint is that the canes are SUPER short.</li>
            <li> I received these quickly, even after having a problem and inquiring about my order. The canes came placed in a ziplock bag. I found the designs to be very cute and sweet looking - many would be perfect for a child. Out of the entire set there were only about 15 I didn&#x27;t like, mostly out of personal preference. Only two or three were odd patterns (angry ying-yang bull, half of a butterfly, unrecognizable fruit). I think the most common pattern was butterfly or flower. There were also multiple assorted colored dragon flies, hearts, fruits, stars, and smilies. My favorites included two bows, two Hello Kitty, and three \\&quot;Chanel\\&quot; logo canes. These are great to make an otherwise boring at-home manicure special and fun.</li>
            <li> I got a great variety!! I was very very happy with them and they work well!! They are fun to use. Easy when you use a one sided razor blade. I just don&#x27;t let kids use them and cut a bunch at a time so I have them.</li>
            <li> I have placed my order the 5th April and today it is 29th May i have yet to receive my package. I was looking forward to using the designs to create nail art.&lt;br /&gt;I URGE YOU NOT TO BUY, YOU WILL NEVER GET YOUR PACKAGE AND NO REFUND</li>
            <li> I would buy again from here! There worth the price and they came in great quality, altough one cane had air bubbles in it. But all the other canes where perfect! There was even a angry bird one!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried these things.  They&#x27;re kind of cute, and interesting to try.  Nothing wrong with the product itself, I just should have ordered a smaller bundle to try them before getting one hundred of them :)  But there&#x27;s a great assortment of designs in the package -- overall, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping comes with a cutter only thing is i didnt get 100 different shapes but most of them are different so thats okay they look really pretty on my nails i love them</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for title says it all they are CUTE, I would recommend this product without a doubt!</li>
            <li> Good product.. glad it comes with a lot. Easy to use. Can be a butt to cut though. But I do like the product.</li>
            <li> Looks like you will not get what is in this exact picture. I only got this because I was hoping to get the Hello Kitty Fimo and the cute cupcakes which I got neither of them. They were also very small and thin but I got what I paid for :)</li>
            <li> i got it pretty quick because it was coming from Japan, i got it in three weeks and now i use them on my nails i love them!! the only thing i dislike just a little is that i have to cut them really thin almost as thin as paper. but over all i really like them :-D</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cute. Got a package of fruit nothing but fruit, the other nothing but flower. A bit disappointed, cause the picture shows a lot more variety, such as hearts, bunnies, leaves, hello kitty friends and more, but nevertheless cute.</li>
            <li> However i got alot of lemon canes... not enough stars or poison sign...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all not bad for the price</li>
            <li> So cute, I got several designs and no duplicates! I have them in an organizer tray (like for beads) sorted by type (flowers, animals, fruit, etc). Everyone loves them!</li>
            <li> There are 2 sizes, the 0.5cm and 0.6cm ones. The lengths are all approx the same, give or take no more than 2mm. You are getting more than you pay for because of the bigger canes. The little ones are more detailed and easier to cut, however - though they are also a bit odd for a few of the canes. I have 2 mystery canes (both red, could be fruits or faces or something). The rest are easily identifiable, and contain such characters as the red Angry Birds birdy, and (blue) Hello Kitty. Customer service is great (from Crazy Cart). I will note, that the clear fimo clay areas might appear clear when embedded into acrylic nails, but does not come out fully clear on nail polish - they will be white, or yellow, or pink, etc., instead of clear or translucent.</li>
            <li> These are ok.  If you are applying them to the top of your nail they stick up way to much.  Would work much better if you are adding them to acrylic while your forming the nail.  They are super cute though!  I love the fact that you can cut these yourself.  However you need a really sharp tool to work with.</li>
            <li> All of the designs are extremely cute they are a bit hard to cut but that is more along my fault. They also sent me an absolutely adorable tool to go with ot</li>
            <li> this stuff is nice and cool. you get a lot of fimo canes and also 2 little &#x27;knifes&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;the designs are also very cute and lovely.&lt;br /&gt;i love it !!</li>
