            <li>It would have been easy if it comes in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Hair is smooth and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>this is wonderful to use right aftet the shower when your hair is damp but a bit frizzy, I have kinda wavy straight hair and it keeps my hair straighter and shiny and extremely soft!</li>
            <li>This product is realy fantastic.</li>
            <li>Happy to finally find this one.</li>
            <li>Went from Lion King frizzy to smooth in under 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>my daughter enjoy it</li>
            <li>This is so great I cant possibly tell you anymore</li>
            <li>I then press my hair and the product is just fantastic.</li>
            <li>Works great on flat ironing my hair</li>
            <li>It make my hair heavier and as a result more straight.</li>
            <li>For me it works very well as a heat protector and straightening serum,also makes my hair silky smooth shining and not greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be absorbed by my hair</li>
            <li>It literally works like magic for my natural hair when ironing.</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with it so far.</li>
            <li>I rarely use heat on my hair, but when I do, it is shiny.  </li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll see your hair stretch more than its natural state, that&#x27;s what this product does.</li>
            <li>Not a strong fragrance but very nice.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and makes my hair so soft :) a little goes a looooong way as well.</li>
            <li>I am 4B Natural, exactly like the cellist Esperanza Spalding, hair that is soft, cottony, perfect for afros and grows OUT not DOWN, and reverts if there is a drop of  moisture in the air, but I&#x27;m learning to live with it.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and it makes my hair feel silky smooth when I straighten it.</li>
            <li>hot  air brush .</li>
            <li>first time i received this product was when a friend gave it to me, she said it made her hair &#x27;greasy&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>(ala Oprah hands shaking wildly over my head, and giving everyone a free bottle in the audience).</li>
            <li>, it was soft, after the blow dry, i was surprised by how healthy it felt, but when I flat iron it, OMG my hair felt happy and looked and felt like I had a fresh relaxer.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give it much shine or help protect from the hot iron.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s fully stretched with the IC protector (using my hand and a brush), I apply some ampro bees wax to the section and stretch it some more with my hands and brush before braiding or twisting that section.</li>
            <li>you only need a little bit or else it will make your hair greasy, but this is a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my secret to great hair</li>
            <li>Works very well on my wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at the transformation - straight no frizz that lasts.</li>
            <li>but i think she just put to much in..</li>
            <li>its reasonable n</li>
            <li>She told me she really like this product</li>
            <li>This stuff really does protect your hair from heat, and I will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>My hair was shiny, silky straight and lasted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in transition from relax to natural ,and this product works perfect on my thick hair when I use my flat iron.</li>
            <li>I straighten it from time to time and it still never feels as flat and smooth as I want it to.</li>
            <li>I will definitely get this product again and the delivery is super fast..</li>
            <li>and you run the risk of looking greasy and weighed down instead of healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>If you section off your hair into 4 or more sections depending on the thickness of your hair; all you need is a dime size drop(or less).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it when using heat.</li>
            <li>Even my ends which tend to look rough are smooth.</li>
            <li>This is pretty much the only product I use besides shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>just the roller set alone left my hair pretty straight.</li>
            <li>Nice subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>WOW!  .I&#x27;ve  </li>
            <li>I used this after my hot oil treatment and deep conditions.</li>
            <li>so I apply a small drop and it will be good enough for the entire head.</li>
            <li>I use a pea sized amount right before I blow dry</li>
            <li>this product makes you hair so shiny and soft</li>
            <li>My hair feels really soft.</li>
            <li>I have 4a/b texturized hair and my hair is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>and my hair is shiny, healthy looking and plenty of volume as this serum does not weigh the hair down!!!  </li>
            <li>A little definitely goes a long way and this makes my hair nice and soft and shiny while not being greasy.</li>
            <li>And my friend who has super tight curls  </li>
            <li>and I towel dry every section very well from roots to ends, then apply this heat protector on a section, combing it and brushing it</li>
            <li>I used the spray first then the next shampoo and blow dry</li>
            <li>Before going to bed every night, make sure you re-braid the hair in sections and make the braids a little tight.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair, so i use it when i am flat ironing my hair, which is like once a year.</li>
            <li>I do a two strand twist and let it dry naturally with some serum.</li>
            <li>As someone with loose curly frizzy hair, this product offers hydration and heat protection for my hair.</li>
            <li>It is not meant for people with fine or thin hair.</li>
            <li>Very light on my hair (I don&#x27;t like heavy feeling products because I have really thick hair)</li>

            <li> Very light on my hair (I don&#x27;t like heavy feeling products because I have really thick hair)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t flat iron/use heat often.</li>
            <li> until I have about 8 fully stretched, big braids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to relax my hair only twice a year, my hair was dry, brittle and breaking.</li>
            <li> So this product is definitely gonna last me for a while, although I do use it in conjunction with other heat protectants.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the IC Fantasia Heat Protectant to help protect my hair when I blow dry or flat iron it.</li>
            <li> This reminds me of that dry baby oil.</li>
            <li> whenever I flat/blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Then, I can either slightly dry my braids using a blow dryer (that&#x27;s less heat damage compared to blow drying each section), just blowing heat throughout my head, or just let it air dry overnight.</li>
            <li> I use it just after a shower or just slightly wet my hair and apply.</li>
            <li> and i really do not have any complaints.</li>
            <li> However when you use the product you should be careful about the overdose of using.</li>
            <li> But BEWARE, a little goes a LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am filipino/white female and have very thick, coarse, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Used as heat protectant to flat iron my hair in small sections.</li>
            <li> Even for very dry hair you will not need any product for a few days.</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair</li>
            <li> Controls frizz and makes ironing my hair about 3 times less time consuming.</li>
            <li> I also had to use less heat to straighten after my roller set-</li>
            <li> I have very fluffy, curl (or wave) defined hair which I can let loose.</li>
            <li> A little on the heavy side.</li>
            <li> I have curly frizzy hair that took me two hours to straighten everyday.</li>
            <li> Before I blow dried my hair</li>
            <li> and I recommend it to people who have heavy hair damage using styling appliances.</li>
            <li> With this it took me less than 10 mins to do it!!</li>
            <li> At least for me.</li>
            <li> mean  a greasy  head.</li>
            <li> I did not give it a five because I&#x27;m a tough critic.</li>
            <li> A weird liquid gel type substance.</li>

            <li> This reminds me of that dry baby oil. I was hoping it would be absorbed by my hair but it just sits on top. Doesn&#x27;t give it much shine or help protect from the hot iron. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is realy fantastic. The best I&#x27;ve ever used in my life. Happy to finally find this one. Thank you.</li>
            <li> this product makes you hair so shiny and soft i just love it. im going to have to buy more and more because this product is a keeper. &amp;#60;3 it!!!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I can buy it on amazon! Works great on flat ironing my hair</li>
            <li> It literally works like magic for my natural hair when ironing. Makes everyone think I have a perm lol. It smells very nice too. Not a strong fragrance but very nice. Controls frizz and makes ironing my hair about 3 times less time consuming. Also doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair, it&#x27;s still moves and is bouncy. This is pretty much the only product I use besides shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s my secret to great hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a hair journey to grow my hair to BSL (bra strap length), and I have been watching different YouTube channels for tips and hair products to help protect my hair. I decided to try the IC Fantasia Heat Protectant to help protect my hair when I blow dry or flat iron it. I am really satisfied with it so far. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel fried and crunchy like it used to when I used heat before. But BEWARE, a little goes a LONG WAY. If you section off your hair into 4 or more sections depending on the thickness of your hair; all you need is a dime size drop(or less). Any more and you run the risk of looking greasy and weighed down instead of healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> This serum made my hair feel really good. I am filipino/white female and have very thick, coarse, wavy hair. I straighten it from time to time and it still never feels as flat and smooth as I want it to. Out of all of the products I have tried (garnier smoothing serum, dove leave in conditioner etc) this is the best for my hair type. My hair feels really soft.</li>
            <li> I love it. I have natural hair and it makes my hair feel silky smooth when I straighten it. Its everything and more.</li>
            <li> i  love  this  product  Smells  fruity  straightens ,  protects and  is  inexpensive. I  used  a  diffuser  to  cut  drying  time  and  straighten with  my  conair  2 in 1  hot  air brush . Results?  Silky,  shiny  bouncyhair like  a  child&#x27;s  hair.  WOW!  .I&#x27;ve  used  another  product  which  gave  mean  a greasy  head.</li>
            <li> I wish I found this sooner. It is loaded with silicone however if you are using heat- this is the best way to avoid damage. I have 4a/b texturized hair and my hair is soft and silky. Even my ends which tend to look rough are smooth. I use to use Chi but this is so much better. I also had to use less heat to straighten after my roller set- just the roller set alone left my hair pretty straight. I highly recommend it when using heat.</li>
            <li> It is not meant for people with fine or thin hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for great shine</li>
            <li> this is wonderful to use right aftet the shower when your hair is damp but a bit frizzy, I have kinda wavy straight hair and it keeps my hair straighter and shiny and extremely soft! idont always use a styleing tool but I have used this for years and it keeps my hair moisturized. and it smells good</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; didn&#x27;t have to use a lot! Used as heat protectant to flat iron my hair in small sections. Went from Lion King frizzy to smooth in under 30 minutes. Very light on my hair (I don&#x27;t like heavy feeling products because I have really thick hair) so that was a plus as well.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my wavy, frizzy hair. I was amazed at the transformation - straight no frizz that lasts. I use it just after a shower or just slightly wet my hair and apply. A little goes a long way. If you are in a rush use gloves. It takes forever to wash off your hands. A weird liquid gel type substance. Hair is smooth and easy to manage. Nice subtle fragrance. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and i really do not have any complaints. I have natural curly hair, so i use it when i am flat ironing my hair, which is like once a year. So this product is definitely gonna last me for a while, although I do use it in conjunction with other heat protectants.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t flat iron/use heat often. But when I do I need a great heat protectant and I think I finally found one. A little definitely goes a long way and this makes my hair nice and soft and shiny while not being greasy. A+++</li>
            <li> A little on the heavy side. Great protection! Best results are after unwrapping hair the nest day or two. Even for very dry hair you will not need any product for a few days.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm...I have curly frizzy hair that took me two hours to straighten everyday. With this it took me less than 10 mins to do it!! I will definitely get this product again and the delivery is super fast..</li>
            <li> It make my hair heavier and as a result more straight. However when you use the product you should be careful about the overdose of using. otherwise, the hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and this s*** is awesome. It got me gurlllls with this sexy shinning hair</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Fantasia IC Hair Polisher w/Olive Oil Moisturizing Shine Serum, especially immediately after washing my hair.  The two products together leave my hair feeling softer and easy to manage.  I rarely use heat on my hair, but when I do, it is shiny.  Additionally, what I like about the two products is it does not leave the hair so oily that every thing you touch gets oil on it.  These are the only two products that I use to moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> first time i received this product was when a friend gave it to me, she said it made her hair &#x27;greasy&#x27;. but i think she just put to much in.. you only need a little bit or else it will make your hair greasy, but this is a great product. so i bought it again from this seller.</li>
            <li> i love it becoz of money n quality  coz rapnungel headpiece price is more than this n its reasonable n very good quality my daughter enjoy it n like it lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to relax my hair only twice a year, my hair was dry, brittle and breaking. I used this after my hot oil treatment and deep conditions. Before I blow dried my hair I felt the difference, it was soft, after the blow dry, i was surprised by how healthy it felt, but when I flat iron it, OMG my hair felt happy and looked and felt like I had a fresh relaxer. I love love love this product, now I can more than stretch my relaxer.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter. She told me she really like this product</li>
            <li> ive been using fantiasia for years, and have always received great results.&lt;br /&gt;no residue, or burning of hair. would recommend to friends</li>
            <li> I bought this one at wallmart and I have been using it for a while whenever I flat/blow dry my hair. This serum helps in smoothing and protecting hairs well and it gives a serene smell too. Mine are very fine hairs so I apply a small drop and it will be good enough for the entire head. The only thing i dislike about this product is I cannot spray it, I need to take it in my hands and apply generously and then comb. It would have been easy if it comes in a spray bottle. Otherwise this is seriously good stuff and I recommend it to people who have heavy hair damage using styling appliances.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does protect your hair from heat, and I will continue to use it.  No greasy build up.  Just good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, it&#x27;s a great product to manage fly aways and give your hair a high gloss!</li>
            <li> As someone with loose curly frizzy hair, this product offers hydration and heat protection for my hair. And my friend who has super tight curls  and it helps her straighten her hair with ease. This is so great I cant possibly tell you anymore</li>
            <li> This product does wonders on my hair!  I use a pea sized amount right before I blow dry and my hair is shiny, healthy looking and plenty of volume as this serum does not weigh the hair down!!!  The price is also better than what I can find in the stores!</li>
            <li> This product is very good on my natural 4c hair. Here&#x27;s how I use it: I wash my hair with coconut milk Organix shampoo and conditioner. Then I section my hair off in about 8 parts and I towel dry every section very well from roots to ends, then apply this heat protector on a section, combing it and brushing it, you&#x27;ll see your hair stretch more than its natural state, that&#x27;s what this product does. Once it&#x27;s fully stretched with the IC protector (using my hand and a brush), I apply some ampro bees wax to the section and stretch it some more with my hands and brush before braiding or twisting that section. I continue with the rest of my hair until I have about 8 fully stretched, big braids. Then, I can either slightly dry my braids using a blow dryer (that&#x27;s less heat damage compared to blow drying each section), just blowing heat throughout my head, or just let it air dry overnight. The next morning, I undo the braids and voilà! I have very fluffy, curl (or wave) defined hair which I can let loose. Before going to bed every night, make sure you re-braid the hair in sections and make the braids a little tight. The bees wax helps keep humidity out of your hair and reduce shrinkage. It really works! At least for me. Hope this helped!</li>
            <li> One of the best serums out there. Smells so good and makes my hair so soft :) a little goes a looooong way as well.</li>
            <li> I am 4B Natural, exactly like the cellist Esperanza Spalding, hair that is soft, cottony, perfect for afros and grows OUT not DOWN, and reverts if there is a drop of  moisture in the air, but I&#x27;m learning to live with it. Everyone raves about how good the serum is ; and after paying $18.00 for 2 oz of Chi I was leary...So what I did, I bought the IC Serum and the IC spray (check out that review) I used the spray first then the next shampoo and blow dry I used the Serum and I LOVE IT! (ala Oprah hands shaking wildly over my head, and giving everyone a free bottle in the audience). My hair was shiny, silky straight and lasted. Smells nice too.You just need a drop I do a two strand twist and let it dry naturally with some serum. I then press my hair and the product is just fantastic. I did not give it a five because I&#x27;m a tough critic.</li>
