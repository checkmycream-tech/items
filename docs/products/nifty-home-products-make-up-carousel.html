            <li>It was a perfect fit for my small bathroom vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The second row was to close to the top row so adding height would make this carousel more useable for most makeup items.</li>
            <li>Perfect for small items like mascara, nail polish, tweezers, q-tips, you get my point.</li>
            <li>Is is sturdy, true to size and picture.</li>
            <li>I love it highly recommended all my cosmetics are organizing all.</li>
            <li>I gave this a 4 out of five because the quality is exceptional, however, most of my cosmetics will not fit.</li>
            <li>Holds lots of little things, spins smoothly, and good quality.</li>
            <li>I on the other hand loved it now</li>
            <li>I would have kept it other wise.</li>
            <li>Still worth it haha!</li>
            <li>I can have some much needed bar space!</li>
            <li>your fitting brushes in the middle..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about this stuff however the bathroom is now organized which puts a smile on my face.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed for my makeup table.</li>
            <li>It seems pretty well built as well.</li>
            <li>Would love a third tower!</li>
            <li>It is a good concept but way to small.</li>
            <li>I love my little organizer its big enough to hold everything but is not a space hog it fits nicely on my counter and helps keep everything i need at a easy to find / reach place i would buy it all over again</li>
            <li>Well, I chose this product because I have a large collection of makeup products.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who also has a large collection of makeup</li>
            <li>I am going off to college for my second year and really needed something to keep all of my makeup together and easy to find.</li>
            <li>Very spacious and well constructed.</li>
            <li>The color is so much prettier in person.  </li>
            <li>The  swivel works very well.  </li>

            <li>it really does help.</li>
            <li>my wife really like it , all things in one place no need to look around for any thing , thanks</li>
            <li>I bought this for my makeup products to speed up my getting ready process.</li>
            <li>This carousel seemed like just what I needed to organize my makeup as well as other products that always cluttered the vanity top, and it was made of metal, so it was bound to be sturdier than the plastic or acrylic ones.</li>
            <li>If I just put it back right the first time, I wouldn&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li>Its very small for what many buyers have in mind!</li>
            <li>I finally found something super easy to store all my little makeup items.</li>
            <li>It cant fit my larger palettes but it is a big help to me.</li>
            <li>Looks good but useless to me coz of the size.</li>

            <li> Wife hated it!!!!  I on the other hand loved it now I can have some much needed bar space! I bought her two for Xmas boy that sure cased a uproar! Still worth it haha!</li>
            <li> Holds everything! its great</li>
            <li> It was a perfect fit for my small bathroom vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of my infinite collection of makeup and tools, I could use another tier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who hates clutter and loves organization as I do.</li>
            <li> It holds all my makeup some bottles of lotion. It got a majority of clutter off my vanity top. What I dislike...it could be bigger</li>
            <li> Like the size and what it s used for.</li>
            <li> This is awesome. It helps with all the clutter and u can get ready faster with organization!!! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This carousel seemed like just what I needed to organize my makeup as well as other products that always cluttered the vanity top, and it was made of metal, so it was bound to be sturdier than the plastic or acrylic ones. I was disappointed to see, though, that the compartments were too small for some basic items, such as my powder case and the container I use for cotton balls; they wouldn&#x27;t fit. I returned it for another that was just what I needed. I&#x27;ll review that one soon.</li>
            <li> It is a good concept but way to small. The baskets should be at least two inches higher as none of my makeup would stand up plus the bottom of each basket was rounded not flat do again my items would not stand up. The second row was to close to the top row so adding height would make this carousel more useable for most makeup items. I would have kept it other wise. Loved the turning idea.</li>
            <li> Quality is good, cute color(better than the picture), and really useful! I put all my cosmetic in this organizer, good.</li>
            <li> This cosmetic carousel is indeed nifty. I used all compartments &amp; slots. It easily does the job. I am able to organize my brushes, foundations, eye shadows, etc. I especially love that it spins making it easy to access esp when doing makeup on the go. The fuscia color is nice &amp; the quality of the product is great. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> daughter loves this! Very spacious and well constructed. Makes a great gift!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought, but works beautifully.  I would post a before and after of how well this helped me organize my bathroom counter,  but the before was embarrassing. Now my fianc&amp;eacute; has room for his things.  Very happy I purchased,  and will buy another for teenage daughter. Four stars because the brushes do not fit as shown in pic.</li>
            <li> I love things that turn chaos into cleanup. This is a great tool for organizing makeup and the tools we women use to look pretty.</li>
            <li> Super helpful!  Well made and has a small footprint.</li>
            <li> Really expensive for what it is. Kinda small too.. No way your fitting brushes in the middle.. Maybe long eyeliner sticks?</li>
            <li> I love this! The color is so much prettier in person.  My daughter loved it too and that&#x27;s all that counts. Holds lots of little things, spins smoothly, and good quality.</li>
            <li> Works great! holds lots of different types of make up.  The  swivel works very well.  I love the interesting colors.</li>
            <li> Looks good but useless to me coz of the size. Its very small for what many buyers have in mind!</li>
            <li> Keeps my make up organized and handy...</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the organizer! Is is sturdy, true to size and picture. Great buy. Would buy it again and recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! No complaints. No problems.</li>
            <li> I was using this as a temporary nail polish caddy. I like that it spins but you can&#x27;t store a lot of polish and its hard to see what you have. I ordered a nail polish rack, so I will use this for make up.</li>
            <li> I love my little organizer its big enough to hold everything but is not a space hog it fits nicely on my counter and helps keep everything i need at a easy to find / reach place i would buy it all over again and it would be a cute gift also :)</li>
            <li> It holds a lot of cosmetics, which I do appreciate. But the center is NOT a good brush holder. It&#x27;s too tall for standard size brushes. They get stuck. So I like it enough, but think the design should get a reboot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about this stuff however the bathroom is now organized which puts a smile on my face.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants one now</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this organizer. Keep my beauty essentials in one place and I love the pink color that I got.</li>
            <li> Well, I chose this product because I have a large collection of makeup products. Singular things of shadows and various sizes of brushes and lipsticks. I am going off to college for my second year and really needed something to keep all of my makeup together and easy to find. This is a great help with all the smaller items. It cant fit my larger palettes but it is a big help to me. I recommend this product to anyone who also has a large collection of makeup it really does help. Plus it came within a week.</li>
            <li> I looooove this organizing carousel. This is exactly what I needed for my makeup table. I am going to get another one.</li>
            <li> I love it highly recommended all my cosmetics are organizing all.I don&#x27;t believe is very cute I love it.YES is super COSMETIC ORGANIZING CAROUSEL in ROSE IS PRETTY</li>
            <li> my wife really like it , all things in one place no need to look around for any thing , thanks</li>
            <li> I have more space on my counter in the bathroom and I love it.  The color is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife for xmas, to organize her make-up, she loves the purple color!  It seems pretty well built as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my makeup products to speed up my getting ready process. I used to have a tray to store makeup. This works so well and has sped up my routine!</li>
            <li> A great product if you want to organize your makeup</li>
            <li> I finally found something super easy to store all my little makeup items. I can fit all my foundation, primers, eyeshadows, liners, etc. in here. The best part is that is rotates. Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 out of five because the quality is exceptional, however, most of my cosmetics will not fit. Perfect for small items like mascara, nail polish, tweezers, q-tips, you get my point. Would love a third tower!</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth spin and lots of room to organize. I still get lazy and put stuff in the wrong place, but that&#x27;s my fault and I find myself going back every now and then and re doing. If I just put it back right the first time, I wouldn&#x27;t have this problem. I wish the tiny baskets were just a tad bigger, but i do like it.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter for easter bought a wall shelf fits nicely on it nice and sturdy does the trick  very nice</li>
