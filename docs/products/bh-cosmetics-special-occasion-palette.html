            <li> it is actually cheaper on the real BH website...</li>
            <li> The blushes can suit a wide range of complexions and the bronzers and the highlight are buildable and blendable.</li>
            <li> the blushes are really hard to get on the brushes.</li>
            <li> a few of the shimmers are a little sheer and muddy looking and everything smells like baby wipes which ist bad but rather weird</li>
            <li> I think this is fake...</li>
            <li> You would have to keep on applying the blush to even get a faint amount of color on your cheeks.</li>
