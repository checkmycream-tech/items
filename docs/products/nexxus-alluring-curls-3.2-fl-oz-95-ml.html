            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many products for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>I love this gel...</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>If you over use alluring curls they get crunchy so, take it easy.</li>
            <li>..I have fine hair..</li>
            <li>Fantastic for 3A curls - curls that are a bit looser, but NOT wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>If the price control was better, it would be definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this product is good at sealing in the moisture after I wash and apply conditioner.  </li>
            <li>When we first purchased this, it was a good value but each time we re-ordered, the price climbed up considerably to the point that it was cheaper to go to Walmart.</li>
            <li>It works great to keep my naturally kinky hair in place with soft curls.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair, either natural or permed, you will love it.</li>
            <li>It is a bit overpriced for such a small amount, but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>but, first I add the magic ingredients-Nexxus alluring curls mixed with Aveda Stay Curly.</li>
            <li>This is good for my natural long curly hair.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the texture was good if you&#x27;re looking for a stiff, sticky gel, so I gave it two stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but it does a nice job of controlling the friz.  </li>
            <li>I tried this gel several times; I have wavy, fine, medium-thick hair.</li>
            <li>it really does work</li>
            <li>I like my curly hair, I really do...</li>
            <li>One that helps it air dry naturally, keeps my curls soft, free of frizz, and full of body and well-defined spirals.</li>
            <li>This is a great product but a bit expensive.  </li>
            <li>Cremes all seem to not be strong enough to counteract the frizz or provide enough definition.</li>
            <li>Received it yesterday and WOW!</li>
            <li>I would beg Nexxus to bring it back, and I&#x27;m seriously considering paying the exorbitant prices for all remaining bottles of product here on Amazon, because it&#x27;s that GOOD.</li>
            <li>Since they changed their formulation to include more junk like avocado oil, which weighs my hair down like a net, I&#x27;ve been searching for years to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li>This is another like/love product -- leaves your hair feeling soft and silkly -- you cannot use a lot of the product unwise</li>
            <li>It helps with the humidity and controls soft curls.</li>
            <li>I ever have the luck of finding a product that is a suitable replacement, I will definitely be reviewing it, so other curly girls might benefit, so long as Amazon offers it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m tried of always having to blow dry &amp; hot iron.</li>
            <li>I received compliments and I was glad it doesn&#x27;t give you that wet look that other products do.</li>
            <li>This wins over everything else hands down.  </li>
            <li>The closest thing I&#x27;ve found is a mixture of about 3 different products, on different days, it&#x27;s just too too much.  </li>
            <li>My hair is left soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>I skimped the first few times and there were parts of my hair that still wanted to frizz a bit.  </li>
            <li>It felt very sticky and seemed to weigh my hair down.</li>

            <li> I use this gel everyday to help control the frizz in my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair that I usually blow dry straight.</li>
            <li> Oh, and one that works during all weather conditions and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you run your fingers through your hair when it is dry it eliminates the crunch and keeps the curls.</li>
            <li> I let it air dry</li>
            <li> This actually encourages the curl a slight bit, it doesn&#x27;t get crispy, and the smell won&#x27;t knock you over.  </li>
            <li> The downside is the small size, having long hair, I need a larger size.</li>
            <li> I like to apply it after applying jojoba oil to my wet hair.</li>
            <li> as recommended and hair was still a little wet (didn&#x27;t fully dry) when i got to work.</li>
            <li> those other products I buy</li>
            <li> I end up wanting to throw out nigh the same day, crying over my wasted money and lack of acceptable results.</li>
            <li> Oils weigh the curls down.</li>
            <li> Hair does take a while to dry  because this is some thick as heck gel though.  </li>
            <li> It does make your hair a little crunchy</li>
            <li> It stops my hair from being frizzy and does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Hair war still touchable and bouncy and held up after being at a windy baseball game later that day.</li>
            <li> It just made my hair have pointy, stiff spikes at the ends.</li>
            <li> you will have stiff hair.</li>
            <li> At least for curly girls.</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so expensive.</li>
            <li> so mad they cancled it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product! I like to apply it after applying jojoba oil to my wet hair. It gives it a nicer sheen and fullness :D</li>
            <li> Great, easy to use product.  It&#x27;s so good, I just bought 6 tubes to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  It stops my hair from being frizzy and does not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought i would try it out. I have wavy hair but I&#x27;m tried of always having to blow dry &amp; hot iron. Received it yesterday and WOW! it really does work, i had the beach look i wanted. I used the diffuser  as recommended and hair was still a little wet (didn&#x27;t fully dry) when i got to work. I received compliments and I was glad it doesn&#x27;t give you that wet look that other products do. Hair war still touchable and bouncy and held up after being at a windy baseball game later that day. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have curls and used to be a big fan of Nexxus&#x27; Versastyler.  Since they changed their formulation to include more junk like avocado oil, which weighs my hair down like a net, I&#x27;ve been searching for years to find a replacement.  The closest thing I&#x27;ve found is a mixture of about 3 different products, on different days, it&#x27;s just too too much.  This wins over everything else hands down.  Fantastic for 3A curls - curls that are a bit looser, but NOT wavy hair.  This actually encourages the curl a slight bit, it doesn&#x27;t get crispy, and the smell won&#x27;t knock you over.  Actually, there is no smell at all.  It is a bit overpriced for such a small amount, but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ll keep using it.  Hair does take a while to dry  because this is some thick as heck gel though.  But until Nexxus takes the oil and junk out of Versastyler, I am using this.</li>
            <li> When we first purchased this, it was a good value but each time we re-ordered, the price climbed up considerably to the point that it was cheaper to go to Walmart. If the price control was better, it would be definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but a bit expensive.  That&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. I have naturally curly hair and this product is good at sealing in the moisture after I wash and apply conditioner.  My hair is left soft and touchable. If you apply the right amount it leaves your hair feeling great.  I skimped the first few times and there were parts of my hair that still wanted to frizz a bit.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so expensive.</li>
            <li> see review above same item didn&#x27;t realize I was purchasing two of the same thing my fault I will use in time</li>
            <li> ...why do you not make this product anymore?!?!?! It was the best one EVER. It was the best product YOU ever made, too! At least for curly girls. Even on sweltering days, even with all the oppressing humidity, even when it rained!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many products for my curly hair. One that helps it air dry naturally, keeps my curls soft, free of frizz, and full of body and well-defined spirals. Oh, and one that works during all weather conditions and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All those other products I buy I end up wanting to throw out nigh the same day, crying over my wasted money and lack of acceptable results. There is NOTHING to replace this product. Mousse makes curls crunchy -- have never found one that doesn&#x27;t...yuck. Cremes all seem to not be strong enough to counteract the frizz or provide enough definition. Oils weigh the curls down. This ethereal gel is the best thing my curls have ever touched. I would beg Nexxus to bring it back, and I&#x27;m seriously considering paying the exorbitant prices for all remaining bottles of product here on Amazon, because it&#x27;s that GOOD. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s time to just straighten my locks. I don&#x27;t want to. I like my curly hair, I really do...but I can&#x27;t stand the thought of the way my curls will look without this perfect product, and I can&#x27;t find anything else anywhere that works so well :&#x27;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever have the luck of finding a product that is a suitable replacement, I will definitely be reviewing it, so other curly girls might benefit, so long as Amazon offers it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. If you have curly hair, either natural or permed, you will love it. Keeps the frizz away and gives you days of gorgeous curls. It does make your hair a little crunchy but if you run your fingers through your hair when it is dry it eliminates the crunch and keeps the curls. Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I have thick, naturally curly hair that I usually blow dry straight. When it&#x27;s humid and I don&#x27;t feel like spending time with the blow drier I let it air dry but, first I add the magic ingredients-Nexxus alluring curls mixed with Aveda Stay Curly. If you over use alluring curls they get crunchy so, take it easy. Can&#x27;t find this product in the drug stores any more so Amazon is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens and dozens of products for hair, and this one by far as the been the best! I have very fine hair and this helps draw out the curl and the volume!  Love it! I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> love it , this is the best product out ther for curly hair. so mad they cancled it.</li>
            <li> I tried this gel several times; I have wavy, fine, medium-thick hair. It just made my hair have pointy, stiff spikes at the ends. It didn&#x27;t enhance the curl at all. Otherwise, the texture was good if you&#x27;re looking for a stiff, sticky gel, so I gave it two stars.</li>
            <li> This is another like/love product -- leaves your hair feeling soft and silkly -- you cannot use a lot of the product unwise you will have stiff hair.</li>
            <li> I love this gel...it makes my hair so beauthiful, it gives to me the crunch thad I want,,not white residuos at all..I have fine hair..so gives me a nice volume..</li>
            <li> This is good for my natural long curly hair. It helps with the humidity and controls soft curls. The downside is the small size, having long hair, I need a larger size.</li>
            <li> I use this gel everyday to help control the frizz in my naturally curly hair.  It&#x27;s lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but it does a nice job of controlling the friz.  Good curl definition. I use it every day on my towel-dried hair.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product! It works great to keep my naturally kinky hair in place with soft curls. Love it</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to help my already wavy hair with curls.  It felt very sticky and seemed to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Really good product at a reduced price - this holds curls and smells good</li>
