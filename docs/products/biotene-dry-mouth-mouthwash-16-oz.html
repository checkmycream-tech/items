            <li>This is a really great product.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li>Seems to work great.  </li>
            <li>It is a great</li>
            <li>This mouthwash tastes great and you can tell it has moisturizing capabilities.</li>
            <li>Great product to use.</li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>Works great but tastes like peroxide</li>
            <li>Great product; good price.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>the taste is good too.</li>
            <li>sounds good to you, then try out biot&amp;egrave;ne.</li>
            <li>Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>It has a good taste and seems mild/healthier than some mouthwashes with alcohol.</li>
            <li>Always good after a good brush</li>
            <li>i purchased this for my mom and she is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>Bottle had some stain on it which just made it kind of sketchy</li>
            <li>AND IT DOES THE JOB EFFECTIVELY.</li>
            <li>It provided effective relief of mouth issues.</li>
            <li>This is the best mouthwash by far.</li>
            <li>I hope that I&#x27;m able to continue purchasing this product that is very important for my well-being.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Biotène is fresh, fresh-tasting, cheery, and has no alcohol, so it does not burn my mouth and tongue like Peridex does (which does have alcohol).</li>
            <li>Manufacturers claim (Biotene and TheraBreadth) was OK for us.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s better than that?</li>
            <li>Besides that, I love that it doesn&#x27;t bite.</li>
            <li>I have dental problems, notably gum disease.</li>
            <li>I guess its more for people that have it continuously during the day and can reapply?</li>
            <li>I am looking elsewhere for another, better product.  </li>
            <li>love this brand.  </li>
            <li>For a mouthwash it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>best product for dry mouth</li>
            <li>It does help with my dry mouth and is an excellent mouth wash.</li>
            <li>This is really good for reducing cotton mouth after using a certain smokeable medicinal plant that starts with &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; and ends with &amp;#34;ijuana&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I used to use this years ago and it was light, refreshing, and would keep my mouth moist for hours.  </li>
            <li>No burning, no bad taste, and it&#x27;s pretty good and refreshing my mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried brushing, other mouthwashes but Biotene works the best!</li>
            <li>Very good for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I think Biotene is very good if you have a dry mouth and don&#x27;t like using Listerine!</li>
            <li>vendor provided prompt delivery in secure packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Biotene--no alcohol, feels really good and refreshing in my mouth</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my auntie per the recommendation of her dental office - so far so good -</li>
            <li>It helped me right away, making my mouth feel better.</li>
            <li>Breath is fresh all the time!</li>
            <li>Upon examining the bottle I find that the original has xylitol but the newer bottle has both xylitol and sorbitol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been using product for a long time great freshness and mild alcohol free clean</li>
            <li>In fact my mouth is so clean now there have been a couple times when I was in a hurry, and didn&#x27;t brush or rinse my mouth the night before and</li>
            <li>Biotene has a great flavor, slightly minty and very mild.</li>
            <li>The TheraBreath Oral Ringe was able to clean bacteria (including sulfur bacteria in tonsils), but you know, bacteria grows fast.</li>
            <li>Good at keeping your mouth moisturized for a while, but it doesn&#x27;t last all night.</li>
            <li>Several years ago &amp; He must Be Right!!!!</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is very gentle on the gums and it does seems to freshen your breathe and soothe your gums!  </li>
            <li>Good now not so dry mouth</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 6 weeks and love it so far.  </li>
            <li>It was so much more convenient to buy this online and have it shipped directly to me.</li>
            <li>hard to find at a good price!</li>
            <li>My dentist advised that I use this mouthwash, and he was right.</li>
            <li>bought some Biotène at my local Target and tried it a few times, and it&#x27;s probably the best replacement to the antibacterial Peridex</li>
            <li>I have a large bottle that expires 1/16 that has a fresh non lingering taste.  </li>
            <li>First time trying this</li>
            <li>This company is probably trying to cut corners and save money so it is not the best on the market anymore, unfortunately.</li>
            <li>Check with your dentist first to see if he/</li>
            <li>I have used Biotene Mouthwash to fight the effects of dry mouth for many years.</li>
            <li>It does kind of have the consistency of saliva but a little thinner, but it didn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s simply the 2nd best thing I ever did for my mouth (the 1st was buying an all natural toothpaste that wasn&#x27;t full of excessive mint flavor).</li>
            <li>again thanks</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Imagine a mouthwash with a soothing, gentle feel...  </li>
            <li>It really works just like that, soothing, gentle and</li>
            <li>My husband tried it as soon as I brought it home, and it really works.</li>
            <li>REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li>and this is very helpful.  </li>
            <li>the product itself is great for mouthwash but the cap was broken and I contacted seller.  </li>
            <li>It has a decent taste and is definitely not too strong.</li>
            <li>reason why this mouthwash is so superior is because other mouthwashes simply use alcohol to \\&quot;kill</li>
            <li>I never had the old formula, but I think it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice minty taste that is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>but, I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m educated sufficiently to know whether it&#x27;s actually doing what it says and worth the rather high price.</li>
            <li>Based on proving I personally recommend both of them twice (this sequence brought success:</li>
            <li>I read that using a mouth rinse would help, but most are so harsh that they take my breath away.  </li>
            <li>specially formulated for those experiencing dry mouth or having oral irritations\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely telling my dentist that I can&#x27;t take Peridex anymore and that I&#x27;m switching to Biotène although it&#x27;s recommended for dry mouth mostly, something I don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better for different causes of dry mouth.</li>
            <li>After TheraBreath, only Biotene was able to promote more good bacteria (and less bad bacteria).</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>New and Improved?</li>
            <li>Maybe as thick as a strong cup of hot cocoa.</li>
            <li>Even though it cost a little more than the generic stuff, it didn&#x27;t have any alcohol and said it was anti-bacterial, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough after my wisdom tooth was pulled.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s burning my mouth while I use it</li>
            <li>This is definitely a product worth the extra money you spend.</li>
            <li>I had not previously tried this product.  </li>
            <li>Gently swirl the mouth wash, nobody likes dry socket.</li>
            <li>I have dry mouth from medicine, and this really works.  </li>
            <li>Really helps if you have dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>However, unlike other mouthwashes, this has a really mild taste, so doing a little swish doesn&#x27;t shock you awake with the intense flavor.  </li>
            <li>the top was  broken when received.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much milder than other mouthwashes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s no excuse not to use a mouthwash that tastes and works this good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it does lubricate, pretty darn well for a few minutes.</li>

            <li> And it does lubricate, pretty darn well for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much for mouthwash, but my sister recommend this after I complained about my new medication giving me dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really find that it helped keep my mouth from getting dry during the night, although I used it as directed before bed By 2 am, nope, all dried out.  </li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t last very long though, maybe a half-hour max.</li>
            <li> It gave her instant relief from a dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I take multiple medications and often get dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve started adding essential oils to it for whatever my needs and really like that</li>
            <li> I sometimes wonder if people are better off brushing and rinsing with only water as the fake sugars increase bacterial growth, the heavy mint is used to cover up the fact that the baste taste isn&#x27;t entirely gone (it does came back doesn&#x27;t it?).</li>

            <li> He was brushing and using a generic Scope-like mouthwash, but his breath would only improve a little bit for a short time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i purchased this for my mom and she is very pleased with the results. It gave her instant relief from a dry mouth. again thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much for mouthwash, but my sister recommend this after I complained about my new medication giving me dry mouth. For a mouthwash it works pretty good. No burning, no bad taste, and it&#x27;s pretty good and refreshing my mouth.</li>
            <li> see previous review. Good product.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is very gentle on the gums and it does seems to freshen your breathe and soothe your gums!  It does kind of have the consistency of saliva but a little thinner, but it didn&#x27;t really bother me. You aren&#x27;t supposed to eat or drink 30 minutes after using it and after that time period any flavor is gone, it doesn&#x27;t effect the taste of anything.  I am happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Bottle had some stain on it which just made it kind of sketchy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a hardcore user of Listerine for about 4 years (I&#x27;m so health concious I was only using the unflavored brown one because the fake sugars and flavors aren&#x27;t going to make your mouth healthier anyways).&lt;br /&gt;I can say after only 3 days of using Biotene I was sold on the product, it&#x27;s simply the 2nd best thing I ever did for my mouth (the 1st was buying an all natural toothpaste that wasn&#x27;t full of excessive mint flavor). Before using the product I would wake up with a nasty taste in my mouth, and it would be much worse if I didn&#x27;t brush the night before (which I normal do but sometimes I forgot). In fact my mouth is so clean now there have been a couple times when I was in a hurry, and didn&#x27;t brush or rinse my mouth the night before and the next morning and I didn&#x27;t even realize I had skipped 2 cleanings, and I&#x27;m not exaggerating.&lt;br /&gt;The reason why this mouthwash is so superior is because other mouthwashes simply use alcohol to \\&quot;kill the germs\\&quot; but the problem is, you need a solution of approx 75% alcohol to kill all the germs. Unfortunately the alcohol content of mouthwashes are regulated at 25% so leave it to say most of the germs will survive. Now add to that fact that the fake sugars in other mouthwashes actually PROMOTES bacterial growth. Then also add in the fact that alcohol is BAD for your gums. I mean why did you think other mouthwashes burn? That burning is gum tissue damage, alcohol actually promotes gum recession, which is what your trying to prevent (gingivitis).&lt;br /&gt;Biotene contains the same exact enzymes your mouth naturally produces to kill bad bacteria and uses a natural sugar alcohol that doesn&#x27;t promote bacterial growth. Also there&#x27;s no heavy mint flavor to cover up the fact you still have bad bacteria in your mouth so you can enjoy that glass of orange juice in the morning without the nasty mint side effect you currently get.&lt;br /&gt;Really think about the products you use, these all chemical mouthwashes and toothpaste you use have heavy mint flavor and fake sugars. I sometimes wonder if people are better off brushing and rinsing with only water as the fake sugars increase bacterial growth, the heavy mint is used to cover up the fact that the baste taste isn&#x27;t entirely gone (it does came back doesn&#x27;t it?). With Biotene it often takes days for the classic bad mouth taste to come back.&lt;br /&gt;Do your mouth a favor, give Biotene a try.y mint flavor and fake sugars.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the prescription-only Peridex that my dentist prescribed to me for care after a scaling/root-planing procedure. That stuff was nasty. Peridex is one of the worst-tasting oral rinses ever, and it changes the way food tastes. That&#x27;s one of the side-effects.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I was looking for an alternative to Peridex.&lt;br /&gt;I bought some Biotène at my local Target and tried it a few times, and it&#x27;s probably the best replacement to the antibacterial Peridex I&#x27;ve tried. &lt;br /&gt;Biotène is fresh, fresh-tasting, cheery, and has no alcohol, so it does not burn my mouth and tongue like Peridex does (which does have alcohol). It also does not taste bitter, nor does it leave a bitter aftertaste in the mouth that affects later food tasting. I&#x27;m definitely telling my dentist that I can&#x27;t take Peridex anymore and that I&#x27;m switching to Biotène although it&#x27;s recommended for dry mouth mostly, something I don&#x27;t have. I will use it for its antibacterial properties.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Biotene--no alcohol, feels really good and refreshing in my mouth but, I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m educated sufficiently to know whether it&#x27;s actually doing what it says and worth the rather high price.</li>
            <li> Biotene Mouthwash, TheraBreath Oral Ringe, twice/day brushing and once/day flossing together helped us (me and my family) to get rid of bad oral bacteria and bad breadth. Manufacturers claim (Biotene and TheraBreadth) was OK for us. The TheraBreath Oral Ringe was able to clean bacteria (including sulfur bacteria in tonsils), but you know, bacteria grows fast. After TheraBreath, only Biotene was able to promote more good bacteria (and less bad bacteria). Based on proving I personally recommend both of them twice (this sequence brought success: morning brush/TheraBreath, noon Biotene, evening brush/TheraBreath and before bed flossing/Biotene).</li>
            <li> Biotene has a great flavor, slightly minty and very mild. Someone else said it was \\&quot;oily\\&quot;. I wouldn&#x27;t say that, but it is slightly viscous, slightly thicker than water but not like a syrup. Maybe as thick as a strong cup of hot cocoa. I imagine it has to be somewhat viscous to lubricate your mouth. And it does lubricate, pretty darn well for a few minutes. I doesn&#x27;t last very long though, maybe a half-hour max. If it lasted longer it would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re desperate then give this a try. It can&#x27;t hurt, and maybe it will last longer for you than it did for me. They also make a spray version which might be better because you could take it with you and reapply as needed: [[ASIN:B0015HPTQW Biotene Moisturizing Mouth Spray 1.5 fl oz (45 ml)]].</li>
            <li> Breath is fresh all the time!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been having problems with dry mouth and this has resolved the problem. No more dry mouth.</li>
            <li> its real nice mouthwash i use it twice aday.</li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff. I hated Listerine because it burned my mouth and I could never make it the entire 30 seconds or whatever it is, and I had heard about this when I got my tongue pierced years ago. I decided to try it recently, and it makes my mouth feel tons cleaner than listerine.</li>
            <li> I had a bad dentist experience a few months ago which left my gums a bit cut up and irritated. A sought out a product to help along the recovery and biot&amp;egrave;ne mouthwash is what I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it says on the back of the package: \\&quot;Imagine a mouthwash with a soothing, gentle feel...  specially formulated for those experiencing dry mouth or having oral irritations\\&quot;. It really works just like that, soothing, gentle and the taste is good too. It helped me right away, making my mouth feel better. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since, there&#x27;s no excuse not to use a mouthwash that tastes and works this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not counting to 30 in agony as you swish some toxic liquid back and forth in your mouth sounds good to you, then try out biot&amp;egrave;ne.</li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised. Thank you</li>
            <li> I use Biotene mouthwash and purchase it regularly.  It was not packaged correctly thus one bottle leaked all over the rest of the items in the box.  It ruined the dunkin donuts coffee and I had a sticky mess with the chips that were in the box.  Very unhappy with this order.</li>
            <li> I have a large bottle that expires 1/16 that has a fresh non lingering taste.  We bought that at the local big box store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle (exp 1/17)  just opened and immediately thought that it must have gone bad.  Has a slimy after taste.  Upon examining the bottle I find that the original has xylitol but the newer bottle has both xylitol and sorbitol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effect is a thick,  syrupy and unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why change a product that works?</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> For some reason my husband was having a real problem with bad breath. He was brushing and using a generic Scope-like mouthwash, but his breath would only improve a little bit for a short time. I had read that the alcohol and artificial flavors can actually cause bad breath in the long run. I looked at several of the products at the drugstore and ended up buying Biotene. Even though it cost a little more than the generic stuff, it didn&#x27;t have any alcohol and said it was anti-bacterial, so I decided to give it a try. My husband tried it as soon as I brought it home, and it really works. He has not had bad breath since. This is definitely a product worth the extra money you spend. It has a decent taste and is definitely not too strong. This is a really great product. We can snuggle and kiss without having to worry about our breath. What&#x27;s better than that?</li>
            <li> This is really good for reducing cotton mouth after using a certain smokeable medicinal plant that starts with &amp;#34;M&amp;#34; and ends with &amp;#34;ijuana&amp;#34;. Took off one star because honestly it&#x27;s not super freshening and the effect doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> best product for dry mouth</li>
            <li> I take multiple medications and often get dry mouth. I&#x27;d tried brushing, other mouthwashes but Biotene works the best! I think that even if I didn&#x27;t have the medication dry mouth, I&#x27;d use Biotene!</li>
            <li> About average.  Nothing special, but nothing wrong.</li>
            <li> BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS AND IT DOES THE JOB EFFECTIVELY.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth. Besides that, I love that it doesn&#x27;t bite. Does it keep my mouth from being dry in the morning--no. Do I think any product will accomplish that--no. So, this is the best we have to work with. Lately, I&#x27;ve started adding essential oils to it for whatever my needs and really like that I can use it this way!</li>
            <li> Does what it promises; a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Very good for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I would order this again from this company.</li>
            <li> BEST FOR BURING MOUTH SYNDROME PROVIDES FASTEST HEALING AND CLONAZEPAM ORAL DISOLVING TABLETS PRESCRIPTION REALLY WORKS TO TAKE CARE OF BURNING MOUTH SORES AND TONGUE GEO PATTERNS</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. Gentle enough after my wisdom tooth was pulled. Gently swirl the mouth wash, nobody likes dry socket.</li>
            <li> I have dental problems, notably gum disease. This is the best mouthwash by far.</li>
            <li> I had not previously tried this product.  It provided effective relief of mouth issues. I definitely would purchase it again.  vendor provided prompt delivery in secure packaging.</li>
            <li> I have used this before as suggested by my dentist.  It does help with my dry mouth and is an excellent mouth wash.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom and she likes it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really find that it helped keep my mouth from getting dry during the night, although I used it as directed before bed By 2 am, nope, all dried out.  However, unlike other mouthwashes, this has a really mild taste, so doing a little swish doesn&#x27;t shock you awake with the intense flavor.  Maybe it works better for different causes of dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my auntie per the recommendation of her dental office - so far so good - and she&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li> Seems to work great.  Taste leaves something to be desired though.</li>
            <li> The Dentists told Me this is the Best for My teeth.......Several years ago &amp; He must Be Right!!!! Little More expensive  buying From Amazon ? I haven&#x27;t purchased it in a while because I buy 2 -16 ounce bottles everytime,forget to look  at prices when I am at Walmart ? It is a great so That conviences  Me!</li>
            <li> Been using product for a long time great freshness and mild alcohol free clean</li>
            <li> This mouthwash tastes great and you can tell it has moisturizing capabilities. It is also somewhat affordable for a mouthwash and the claims it presents. My only problem is that I bought this for my dry-mouth which only happens at night during sleep. I rinsed with this before bed time and still ended up having dry-mouth. I guess its more for people that have it continuously during the day and can reapply? Either Way I would only get this if the later is your problem, if its the former it probably will not work.</li>
            <li> First time trying this and I Like it.... Although I only use at bedtime. Very subtle spearmint taste, not harsh.</li>
            <li> I experience dry mouth and this is very helpful.  It has a good taste and seems mild/healthier than some mouthwashes with alcohol.</li>
            <li> I never had the old formula, but I think it works pretty well.  And it definitely doesn&#x27;t burn like some of the negative reviews state.  It&#x27;s much milder than other mouthwashes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s review:  I ordered this because I have a problem with tonsil stones (food/phlegm build up wedged in my tonsils) due to my allergies and constant drainage.  I read that using a mouth rinse would help, but most are so harsh that they take my breath away.  I have been using this for about 6 weeks and love it so far.  It is not harsh, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s burning my mouth while I use it or after I have used it.  It has a nice minty taste that is not overwhelming.  I use it once or twice a day and have noticed a drastic reduction in build up in the back of my throat/tonsils.  Would recommend for anyone suffering from tonsil stones.</li>
            <li> Good now not so dry mouth</li>
            <li> I used to use this years ago and it was light, refreshing, and would keep my mouth moist for hours.  I recently bought this to again tackle dry mouth, and it is so different in a bad way. It burns my mouth and leaves a very thick tasting peppermint \\&quot;film\\&quot; instead of providing the moisture.  I am looking elsewhere for another, better product.  This company is probably trying to cut corners and save money so it is not the best on the market anymore, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I use it every night.  I have dry mouth from medicine, and this really works.  Could not live without it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Great product to use. I found that the price on Amazon was very similar to the price I paid in the store. It was so much more convenient to buy this online and have it shipped directly to me. I think Biotene is very good if you have a dry mouth and don&#x27;t like using Listerine! My dentist advised that I use this mouthwash, and he was right. Check with your dentist first to see if he/she thinks that this product is good for you!</li>
            <li> love this brand.  hard to find at a good price! But its here!</li>
            <li> Great product; good price.</li>
            <li> Concerning price, as of 3/26, Walmart retail stores priced it at $5.63  -  a suggestion for Amazon, which often has the lowest prices on such things.</li>
            <li> Good to help make your mouth feel cleaner! Freshens breathe! Always good after a good brush</li>
            <li> Works as promised to help prevent dry mouth</li>
            <li> Recommend for chemo mouth care</li>
            <li> Really helps if you have dry mouth.  Its not just a gimmick.  I was doing mints al day to counteract dry mouth.  Between this and  the mouth waste, its no longer much of an issue</li>
            <li> Good at keeping your mouth moisturized for a while, but it doesn&#x27;t last all night.</li>
            <li> I have used Biotene Mouthwash to fight the effects of dry mouth for many years. I was shocked when I recently opened and used a bottle of the New Improved pH Balance Formula as it caused a burning sensation in my mouth. New and Improved? Rubbish! This product has been ruined by GlaxoSmithKline; I will never purchase it again. Save your money and try something else.</li>
            <li> I take a lot of meds and suffer from a dry mouth.  This product works great.</li>
            <li> Works great but tastes like peroxide</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, and Biotene is a must for me. I&#x27;ve tried store brands - like Kroger - and they are simply not the same. Biotene prices have gone up recently, and it&#x27;s been more difficult to get samples at my dentist, so I hope that I&#x27;m able to continue purchasing this product that is very important for my well-being. The mouthwash keeps your mouth moist without burning. It works for me!</li>
            <li> yes, it helped as it was supposed to . i was told to get it instead of any other mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Not worth it, all ... This product tastes very bad. No flavor at all. Save money and time. Buy something else...</li>
            <li> the top was  broken when received. the product itself is great for mouthwash but the cap was broken and I contacted seller.  still waiting to see outcome.</li>
