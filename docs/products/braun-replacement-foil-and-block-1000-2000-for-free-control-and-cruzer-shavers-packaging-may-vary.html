            <li>A great value!</li>
            <li>This is a great deal!</li>
            <li>The Braun Replacement Foil and Block comes from a company that I believe produces excellent electric equipment.</li>
            <li>It arrived in time and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly ,,,,, the manual on the shaver , called for a yearly replacement of the foil .</li>
            <li>This replacement fits and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect replacement shaver head and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The color did not match, but fits perfect.</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this.</li>

            <li>I got a great price on the replacement parts</li>
            <li>I like my Braun shaver and was happy to find a vendor that sells them.</li>
            <li>The price was great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to not go shaver shopping but think Electronic sonic(who mine was sold by) or braun or buy-it-now-store needs to update the listing to show the product they are selling.</li>
            <li>price is great though.</li>
            <li>Great pricing (20% cheaper) comparing to ordering from authorized Braun dealer.  </li>
            <li>This is the factory replacement for my razor, and works great.</li>
            <li>was a great experience and the shipping was in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>As the price was great compared to what I would have paid at retail locations (i.e. Walmart, Target)</li>
            <li>This was a Great product worked just like</li>
            <li>As best as I could research the matter, both on Amazon.con and on Braun&#x27;s own site, this seemed to be the correct replacement screen and cutter block, in spite of indications to the contrary in some of the feedback.</li>
            <li>Great price for the replacement cutter/foil package.</li>
            <li>en una palabra AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Got it quickly at a good price.  </li>
            <li>But I gave it a good try anyway.  </li>
            <li>Good replacement.  </li>
            <li>Good razor.</li>
            <li>Good customer service</li>

            <li>Still gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>This was shipped promptly and fit perfectly</li>
            <li>No problems, good shave.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Very pleased we don&#x27;t need to throw shaver away.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal, purchase more then one</li>
            <li>, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>fast service, great product, great price including</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>So buyer beware and purchase this at your own</li>
            <li>Nice doing business with you.</li>
            <li>Product was excellent and shipment was fast.</li>
            <li>I own a 1000 model Braun shaver.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again if I couldn&#x27;t get the kind that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li>it was documented, I would tell my friends to buy it, honest.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave nice and uniform and even catches/pulls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the original, but definitely a good replacement since I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li>This one is just like the original and works great.</li>
            <li>The old one was tearing his face up, so he is very happy!!  </li>
            <li>So far I believe I have gotten excellent value out of my freecontrol razor and replacement blades (I&#x27;ve had the razor for about three years).  </li>
            <li>As far as product performance, it is Braun quality at its best.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a perfect replacement foil and block for my old Braun 1775 shaver.  </li>
            <li>This replacement foil does not provide as good a shave as the original foil.  </li>
            <li>The new one is great, just as good as the original...maybe better.  </li>
            <li>It sure would be nice if the vendor gave you color choice to be sure you always get what you want.</li>
            <li>Electric razors seems to work great a first then as they get some age, or in my case mileage, they tend to leave stubble.  </li>
            <li>However, when I received it, it was actually a Braun product and worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The 1000 series Braun shaver I purchased years ago is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li>foil will not be like the one you are replacing if you own the Free Control shaver from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>hope that it works better for you than it did for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe there is any way to make sure you get the correct color shaver head</li>
            <li>Amazon and love this replacement part.</li>
            <li>I looked through many listings and compared pictures/reviews to get the correct one.</li>
            <li>it IS the same part number and fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>it is being sold at a much better price than can be found at discounters like Walmart.</li>
            <li>Most Excellent Shaver have been using it for 3 years now daily on my face&amp;head !  </li>
            <li>I am glad that they did ship the model I want.</li>
            <li>When buying replacements for your electric razor always buy the foil and block as a unit; buying the block separate from the foil can and will cause problems with them fitting snugly together.</li>
            <li>&quot; There was a paper label stuck across the top of the package that read:</li>
            <li>This seems to work more efficiently on my beard.</li>
            <li>Found a better foil that fits Cruzer, but it takes longer to shave.</li>
            <li>To say I am a satisfied buyer is an understatement.</li>
            <li>Works great, arrived incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>I have a 1000 series and this thing fit like a glove (and not the O.J. kind).</li>
            <li>It fits just fine and works as good as the original.</li>
            <li>it works, it&#x27;s not as good as the one that came with the shaver, but it works and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Much better than buying a brand new razor; my wallet is happy.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what we needed and received good service.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver but the foil is so easy to break.</li>
            <li>I am sure glad that the replacement block and foil are still available after all these years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this replacement, it is actually better than the original .</li>
            <li>Picked this up for my 2+ year old Cruzer series razor and works great.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised, replaces my old blades and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The original wore out after many years of use.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely as good as new!  </li>
            <li>It was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>The shaver replacement cutter and screen were well packaged, easy to order through Amazon,and are working well.  </li>
            <li>Durability and the length of good quality usage is what I consider a high quality craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product at a fair price, with prompt shipping and high reviews.</li>
            <li>says nothing about this fitting a free control 1775, but it seems to fit and work fine.</li>
            <li>It fit the shaver and it gave a better shave than the original foil--which should have been replaced years ago.</li>
            <li>works as good as the new one.</li>
            <li>The razor was running fine</li>
            <li>THE TRANSACTION WAS FINE</li>
            <li>Works fine</li>
            <li>This device fit perfectly and made my 5 year old shaver feel like new.</li>
            <li>huge surprice since the shaver and the part were made in</li>
            <li>from the one that came with my Braun Free Control shaver.  </li>
            <li>This replacement package works for my Free Control, Series 1000 (1775) electric razor.  </li>
            <li>The replacement foil and block work great; however, the foil has a blue plastic housing.</li>
            <li>For Free Control and Cruzer Shavers]]</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone whose shave is not as smooth as smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is the genuine one.</li>
            <li>No difference in color or fit on my razor.  </li>
            <li>am very happy and the shaver is doing it just and acting just like new again!</li>
            <li>Does not shave as close and accurate as my original foil, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It was an exact fit for my razor that I have had for about 5 or more years.</li>
            <li>Different color than original shaver head but fits perfectly an works like new.</li>
            <li>They have worked as well as the original parts.  </li>
            <li>The original Braun replacement shaver head in the corect color.</li>
            <li>We bought the electric shaver replacement foil after the original wore out.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be structurally as well made as the original.</li>
            <li>But being Braun original I would expect that.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, he was very pleased.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t give you the closest shave you&#x27;ve ever had, but it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick response to my order, all arrived in good condition and the item has been put on the shelf waiting for the old one to give up the ghost.</li>
            <li>so perhaps I just got lucky.</li>
            <li>The picture shown was of the older type which in my opinion works much better.</li>
            <li>This is the exact replacement part for the Bruan Free Control 1775 razor.</li>
            <li>The electric razor works much better with the new parts.  </li>
            <li>Not like new but does ok</li>
            <li>I recommend, at this price, just pay $10 more dollars and get a new shaver.</li>
            <li>It is black, fits correctly, and works great.</li>
            <li>thanks!!</li>
            <li>Amazon had it readily available and at a reasonable price with quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t online shopping fun?</li>
            <li>almost&#x27; as close a shave as with my old foil, but at the price of more razor burn.</li>
            <li>All the debate about the different foils made me reluctant to order a replacement but the shaver is still well liked</li>
            <li>if you like, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>With the cost of electric shavers these days, anything that will prolong this expense is worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the foil design had changed, but it was for the better.</li>
            <li>Getting a new blade and foil is usually just all you need and the Braun replacement is excellent!</li>
            <li>However, I did have to go to Braun website to figure out the right product to buy.</li>
            <li>Treat your face right.</li>
            <li>The new foil actually shaves closer than the original and was more comfortable as well.</li>
            <li>But I am glad that they acted quickly for a replacement even though it was a different product then advertised.</li>
            <li>A quick snap in, and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li>This item was very reasonably priced and I thought it might be a replacement made by another company.  </li>
            <li>I have it for 2 months now and so far they are working fine.</li>
            <li>Speaking of the original, buying this basically made my razor new again.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I had to replace these parts on a shaver I purchased two years ago.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The product was shipped from Shaver Time World and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I have owned only three Braun products and have used each of them for many years.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased my Braun razor (1000 series)</li>
            <li>This is exactly what you need if your shaver becomes something that may resemble an Epilady.</li>
            <li>No big deal unless you are metro sexual or something.  </li>
            <li>Exact replacement for my Braun Washable 1775 electric razor.</li>
            <li>delivery was efficient, part was the exact replacement.</li>
            <li>IF they carried them, I can&#x27;t complain, but I would appreciate the product delivered to match the product ordered, and more differentiation if there is a difference such as color.</li>
            <li>The replacement part I received was an exact duplicate to my OEM part.  </li>
            <li>The Braun replacement foil and block is exactly what I needed for my Braun &amp;#34;Free Control&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If you post a picture please make sure you send the same thing as shown in the picture and as described in your heading.</li>
            <li>for the hole pattern, this new design works better than the old.</li>
            <li>Although it works fine, it probably fits the 2000 model a little better.  </li>
            <li>As anyone that has ever used a 1775 knows these are incredible razors that were crazy cheap ($30)</li>
            <li>I found what I was looking for and the company who I bought it from was very fast in shipping it and the prices were reasonable.  </li>
            <li>The store did not have it for a long time and it was quite a bit more.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s perfectly serviceable, the holes in the foil are smaller than what originally came with the razor, so I find I need to work a little harder to get the same shave, and I find I miss a lot more with this one, compared to the older one.</li>
            <li>This item was unavailable at many local stores and way overpriced at many other sources.</li>
            <li>The silver part that attaches to shaver can be easily changed with the original black part if you prefer.</li>
            <li>This is not the same as the original or the first replacement that I bought.</li>
            <li>So, bottom line is, I would look for one with larger holes if I could, but this one&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>You really have to watch out</li>
            <li>This is a very cost-effective replacement.</li>
            <li>Thanks Braun.</li>
            <li>Supplier responded quickly, reasonable shipping.</li>
            <li>shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>All in all, cheaper than replacing the whole shaver.  </li>
            <li>I just need to shave more carefully.</li>
            <li>I got a better shave when I put the old blade back on.</li>
            <li>If the color is an issue, the foil mounting snaps out of the collar easily, so you can use your original black collar with the new foil mounting.</li>
            <li>Different color than my original shaver.  </li>
            <li>It fits the free control 1775 fine, the foil is the right color (black gray as shown), but it has the pattern shown in the fourth photo of the 2000 series not the 1000 series.</li>
            <li>The foil part fits perfect, but not happy with how long foil lasts.</li>
            <li>The part worked fine, looked fine, despite all the unreasonably negative reviews.  </li>
            <li>It is the correct black color and the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; block was very easy to replace with the new one.  </li>
            <li>On my release day in Jan 2008, I somehow managed to shave my full facial beard with a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>My shaver is now working just like new!  </li>
            <li>After reading some many reviews good and bad, I decided to get this cutter block/foil from this seller.  </li>
            <li>This particular foil&lt;br</li>
            <li>A decent shave again.</li>
            <li>The color is black instead of the original silver and blue, and the hole pattern is different than the old foil, but it works even better than the original pattern even when it was new.</li>
            <li>As long as it works, I will always purchase original parts for it.</li>
            <li>With a sweet price like I received from this merchant, it only makes sense to replace these parts rather than purchase a new shaver...</li>
            <li>highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>The screen was fine, though off-color, but the blades were not sharp enough for me.</li>
            <li>That was far better than for any other shaver I ever had.  </li>
            <li>The item was ordered from Shaver Outlet, Inc. and arrived quickly and exactly as specified and for half the price of most other places.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite my trepidation I ordered from this seller on 7/3 and received it on 7/5 despite opting for normal delivery.  </li>
            <li>I get cracking at left or right edge and then it cuts up my face as I shave.</li>
            <li>It was a choice of a new razor or just replacing the the blade and screen.</li>
            <li>Saved some money and the razor shaves like new.</li>
            <li>My reward for getting released from the hospital was to treat myself to a new electric shaver.</li>
            <li>After changing the foil and block ($29.93 w/S&amp;H), it works like new.</li>
            <li>I did notice that the new foil was designed a bit&lt;br</li>
            <li>The parts matched and no problem changing them and mu razor acts like a new one</li>
            <li>Shaves like new again.</li>
            <li>Like new</li>
            <li>The replacement was just like the orginial and gave my Braun a new life, at a lower cost than new.</li>
            <li>My Braun razor is now just like new.  </li>
            <li>This replacement will breathe new life into your old razor.</li>
            <li>replacement part makes my old razor seem like new</li>
            <li>I have the black Free Control 1775</li>
            <li>The 2000 series does fit, but it&#x27;s gray colored verses black.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this product locally and was ready to just buy a new razor when I decided to check Amamzon just in case.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care about the color change, and it almost looks better on the razor than the old color as there are several black pieces on the razor as it is, and this replacement part does not look out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine is black, like the original.</li>
            <li>I could not find these particular replacement parts in the local stores and I did not want to have to buy a new electric razor.</li>
            <li>This is the second replacement foil I&#x27;ve ordered for my shaver and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I had gone 2 years , till I had cracks in the old foil .</li>
            <li>I ordered mine directly from Amazon, which may be the difference.</li>
            <li>Direct replacement for 1775.</li>
            <li>Does not shave nearly as well for me or my father who I also bought one for.</li>
            <li>Lately, I have been using it more and it was time to get a replacement</li>
            <li>Service was prompt &amp; professional...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll shave again, had used the old block and foil for about 3 years</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a different design, more durable, but takes a few minutes longer.</li>
            <li>This patter of openings in the foil is an irregular shape rather than round as in the original foils.</li>
            <li>It brought my Braun rechageable razor back to life, with a fraction of the cost of buying a complete new one.</li>
            <li>I would even consider buying a new one (about $120), and prefer the same model, which can be used while in the shower.</li>
            <li>That being said, after two weeks there is not a noticeable difference in performance, but then, I haven&#x27;t replaced the parts in at least two years so they should have been less effective than when new.</li>
            <li>I wanted to write a quick review because the reviews on the main page were confusing.</li>
            <li>Got it within a few days with standard free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blue Series 2000 replacement foil DOES fit the black Series 1000 razors, but the seller should change the picture in his/her listing to relect the actual item.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase two for less than half of what my local retailer was asking.   </li>
            <li>If you want a black one, like the first two pictures in the ad, then don&#x27;t buy from this seller.  </li>
            <li>For less than $30 these new parts will make your Braun new again.</li>
            <li>My original screen unit consisted of a black collar attached to a black foil mounting that held the metal foil; the replacement part came as a gray collar attached to a blue foil mounting.</li>
            <li>The only difference is that it is new and sharp and was here in two days over a holiday.  </li>

            <li> The Braun Replacement Foil and Block comes from a company that I believe produces excellent electric equipment.</li>
            <li> It arrived in time and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>

            <li> I got a great price on the replacement parts</li>
            <li> I like my Braun shaver and was happy to find a vendor that sells them.</li>
            <li> The price was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to not go shaver shopping but think Electronic sonic(who mine was sold by) or braun or buy-it-now-store needs to update the listing to show the product they are selling.</li>
            <li> price is great though.</li>
            <li> Great pricing (20% cheaper) comparing to ordering from authorized Braun dealer.  </li>
            <li> This is the factory replacement for my razor, and works great.</li>
            <li> was a great experience and the shipping was in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> As the price was great compared to what I would have paid at retail locations (i.e. Walmart, Target)</li>
            <li> This was a Great product worked just like</li>
            <li> As best as I could research the matter, both on Amazon.con and on Braun&#x27;s own site, this seemed to be the correct replacement screen and cutter block, in spite of indications to the contrary in some of the feedback.</li>
            <li> Great price for the replacement cutter/foil package.</li>
            <li> en una palabra AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Got it quickly at a good price.  </li>
            <li> But I gave it a good try anyway.  </li>
            <li> Good replacement.  </li>
            <li> Good razor.</li>
            <li> Good customer service</li>

            <li> Still gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> This was shipped promptly and fit perfectly</li>
            <li> No problems, good shave.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very pleased we don&#x27;t need to throw shaver away.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal, purchase more then one</li>
            <li> , I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> fast service, great product, great price including</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> So buyer beware and purchase this at your own</li>
            <li> Nice doing business with you.</li>
            <li> Product was excellent and shipment was fast.</li>
            <li> I own a 1000 model Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again if I couldn&#x27;t get the kind that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li> it was documented, I would tell my friends to buy it, honest.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave nice and uniform and even catches/pulls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the original, but definitely a good replacement since I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> This one is just like the original and works great.</li>
            <li> The old one was tearing his face up, so he is very happy!!  </li>
            <li> So far I believe I have gotten excellent value out of my freecontrol razor and replacement blades (I&#x27;ve had the razor for about three years).  </li>
            <li> As far as product performance, it is Braun quality at its best.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a perfect replacement foil and block for my old Braun 1775 shaver.  </li>
            <li> This replacement foil does not provide as good a shave as the original foil.  </li>
            <li> The new one is great, just as good as the original...maybe better.  </li>
            <li> It sure would be nice if the vendor gave you color choice to be sure you always get what you want.</li>
            <li> Electric razors seems to work great a first then as they get some age, or in my case mileage, they tend to leave stubble.  </li>
            <li> However, when I received it, it was actually a Braun product and worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The 1000 series Braun shaver I purchased years ago is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li> foil will not be like the one you are replacing if you own the Free Control shaver from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> hope that it works better for you than it did for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe there is any way to make sure you get the correct color shaver head</li>
            <li> Amazon and love this replacement part.</li>
            <li> I looked through many listings and compared pictures/reviews to get the correct one.</li>
            <li> it IS the same part number and fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> it is being sold at a much better price than can be found at discounters like Walmart.</li>
            <li> Most Excellent Shaver have been using it for 3 years now daily on my face&amp;head !  </li>
            <li> I am glad that they did ship the model I want.</li>
            <li> When buying replacements for your electric razor always buy the foil and block as a unit; buying the block separate from the foil can and will cause problems with them fitting snugly together.</li>
            <li> &quot; There was a paper label stuck across the top of the package that read:</li>
            <li> This seems to work more efficiently on my beard.</li>
            <li> Found a better foil that fits Cruzer, but it takes longer to shave.</li>
            <li> To say I am a satisfied buyer is an understatement.</li>
            <li> Works great, arrived incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> I have a 1000 series and this thing fit like a glove (and not the O.J. kind).</li>
            <li> It fits just fine and works as good as the original.</li>
            <li> it works, it&#x27;s not as good as the one that came with the shaver, but it works and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Much better than buying a brand new razor; my wallet is happy.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what we needed and received good service.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver but the foil is so easy to break.</li>
            <li> I am sure glad that the replacement block and foil are still available after all these years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this replacement, it is actually better than the original .</li>
            <li> Picked this up for my 2+ year old Cruzer series razor and works great.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, replaces my old blades and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The original wore out after many years of use.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely as good as new!  </li>
            <li> It was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> The shaver replacement cutter and screen were well packaged, easy to order through Amazon,and are working well.  </li>
            <li> Durability and the length of good quality usage is what I consider a high quality craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product at a fair price, with prompt shipping and high reviews.</li>
            <li> says nothing about this fitting a free control 1775, but it seems to fit and work fine.</li>
            <li> It fit the shaver and it gave a better shave than the original foil--which should have been replaced years ago.</li>
            <li> works as good as the new one.</li>
            <li> The razor was running fine</li>
            <li> THE TRANSACTION WAS FINE</li>
            <li> Works fine</li>
            <li> This device fit perfectly and made my 5 year old shaver feel like new.</li>
            <li> huge surprice since the shaver and the part were made in</li>
            <li> from the one that came with my Braun Free Control shaver.  </li>
            <li> This replacement package works for my Free Control, Series 1000 (1775) electric razor.  </li>
            <li> The replacement foil and block work great; however, the foil has a blue plastic housing.</li>
            <li> For Free Control and Cruzer Shavers]]</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone whose shave is not as smooth as smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is the genuine one.</li>
            <li> No difference in color or fit on my razor.  </li>
            <li> am very happy and the shaver is doing it just and acting just like new again!</li>
            <li> Does not shave as close and accurate as my original foil, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It was an exact fit for my razor that I have had for about 5 or more years.</li>
            <li> Different color than original shaver head but fits perfectly an works like new.</li>
            <li> They have worked as well as the original parts.  </li>
            <li> The original Braun replacement shaver head in the corect color.</li>
            <li> We bought the electric shaver replacement foil after the original wore out.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be structurally as well made as the original.</li>
            <li> But being Braun original I would expect that.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, he was very pleased.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t give you the closest shave you&#x27;ve ever had, but it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick response to my order, all arrived in good condition and the item has been put on the shelf waiting for the old one to give up the ghost.</li>
            <li> so perhaps I just got lucky.</li>
            <li> The picture shown was of the older type which in my opinion works much better.</li>
            <li> This is the exact replacement part for the Bruan Free Control 1775 razor.</li>
            <li> The electric razor works much better with the new parts.  </li>
            <li> Not like new but does ok</li>
            <li> I recommend, at this price, just pay $10 more dollars and get a new shaver.</li>
            <li> It is black, fits correctly, and works great.</li>
            <li> thanks!!</li>
            <li> Amazon had it readily available and at a reasonable price with quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t online shopping fun?</li>
            <li> almost&#x27; as close a shave as with my old foil, but at the price of more razor burn.</li>
            <li> All the debate about the different foils made me reluctant to order a replacement but the shaver is still well liked</li>
            <li> if you like, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> With the cost of electric shavers these days, anything that will prolong this expense is worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> and I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the foil design had changed, but it was for the better.</li>
            <li> Getting a new blade and foil is usually just all you need and the Braun replacement is excellent!</li>
            <li> However, I did have to go to Braun website to figure out the right product to buy.</li>
            <li> Treat your face right.</li>
            <li> The new foil actually shaves closer than the original and was more comfortable as well.</li>
            <li> But I am glad that they acted quickly for a replacement even though it was a different product then advertised.</li>
            <li> A quick snap in, and you are ready to go.</li>
            <li> This item was very reasonably priced and I thought it might be a replacement made by another company.  </li>
            <li> I have it for 2 months now and so far they are working fine.</li>
            <li> Speaking of the original, buying this basically made my razor new again.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I had to replace these parts on a shaver I purchased two years ago.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> The product was shipped from Shaver Time World and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I have owned only three Braun products and have used each of them for many years.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased my Braun razor (1000 series)</li>
            <li> This is exactly what you need if your shaver becomes something that may resemble an Epilady.</li>
            <li> No big deal unless you are metro sexual or something.  </li>
            <li> Exact replacement for my Braun Washable 1775 electric razor.</li>
            <li> delivery was efficient, part was the exact replacement.</li>
            <li> IF they carried them, I can&#x27;t complain, but I would appreciate the product delivered to match the product ordered, and more differentiation if there is a difference such as color.</li>
            <li> The replacement part I received was an exact duplicate to my OEM part.  </li>
            <li> The Braun replacement foil and block is exactly what I needed for my Braun &amp;#34;Free Control&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If you post a picture please make sure you send the same thing as shown in the picture and as described in your heading.</li>
            <li> for the hole pattern, this new design works better than the old.</li>
            <li> Although it works fine, it probably fits the 2000 model a little better.  </li>
            <li> As anyone that has ever used a 1775 knows these are incredible razors that were crazy cheap ($30)</li>
            <li> I found what I was looking for and the company who I bought it from was very fast in shipping it and the prices were reasonable.  </li>
            <li> The store did not have it for a long time and it was quite a bit more.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s perfectly serviceable, the holes in the foil are smaller than what originally came with the razor, so I find I need to work a little harder to get the same shave, and I find I miss a lot more with this one, compared to the older one.</li>
            <li> This item was unavailable at many local stores and way overpriced at many other sources.</li>
            <li> The silver part that attaches to shaver can be easily changed with the original black part if you prefer.</li>
            <li> This is not the same as the original or the first replacement that I bought.</li>
            <li> So, bottom line is, I would look for one with larger holes if I could, but this one&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> You really have to watch out</li>
            <li> This is a very cost-effective replacement.</li>
            <li> Thanks Braun.</li>
            <li> Supplier responded quickly, reasonable shipping.</li>
            <li> shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> All in all, cheaper than replacing the whole shaver.  </li>
            <li> I just need to shave more carefully.</li>
            <li> I got a better shave when I put the old blade back on.</li>
            <li> If the color is an issue, the foil mounting snaps out of the collar easily, so you can use your original black collar with the new foil mounting.</li>
            <li> Different color than my original shaver.  </li>
            <li> It fits the free control 1775 fine, the foil is the right color (black gray as shown), but it has the pattern shown in the fourth photo of the 2000 series not the 1000 series.</li>
            <li> The foil part fits perfect, but not happy with how long foil lasts.</li>
            <li> The part worked fine, looked fine, despite all the unreasonably negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> It is the correct black color and the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; block was very easy to replace with the new one.  </li>
            <li> On my release day in Jan 2008, I somehow managed to shave my full facial beard with a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> My shaver is now working just like new!  </li>
            <li> After reading some many reviews good and bad, I decided to get this cutter block/foil from this seller.  </li>
            <li> This particular foil&lt;br</li>
            <li> A decent shave again.</li>
            <li> The color is black instead of the original silver and blue, and the hole pattern is different than the old foil, but it works even better than the original pattern even when it was new.</li>
            <li> As long as it works, I will always purchase original parts for it.</li>
            <li> With a sweet price like I received from this merchant, it only makes sense to replace these parts rather than purchase a new shaver...</li>
            <li> highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> The screen was fine, though off-color, but the blades were not sharp enough for me.</li>
            <li> That was far better than for any other shaver I ever had.  </li>
            <li> The item was ordered from Shaver Outlet, Inc. and arrived quickly and exactly as specified and for half the price of most other places.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite my trepidation I ordered from this seller on 7/3 and received it on 7/5 despite opting for normal delivery.  </li>
            <li> I get cracking at left or right edge and then it cuts up my face as I shave.</li>
            <li> It was a choice of a new razor or just replacing the the blade and screen.</li>
            <li> Saved some money and the razor shaves like new.</li>
            <li> My reward for getting released from the hospital was to treat myself to a new electric shaver.</li>
            <li> After changing the foil and block ($29.93 w/S&amp;H), it works like new.</li>
            <li> I did notice that the new foil was designed a bit&lt;br</li>
            <li> The parts matched and no problem changing them and mu razor acts like a new one</li>
            <li> Shaves like new again.</li>
            <li> Like new</li>
            <li> The replacement was just like the orginial and gave my Braun a new life, at a lower cost than new.</li>
            <li> My Braun razor is now just like new.  </li>
            <li> This replacement will breathe new life into your old razor.</li>
            <li> replacement part makes my old razor seem like new</li>
            <li> I have the black Free Control 1775</li>
            <li> The 2000 series does fit, but it&#x27;s gray colored verses black.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product locally and was ready to just buy a new razor when I decided to check Amamzon just in case.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about the color change, and it almost looks better on the razor than the old color as there are several black pieces on the razor as it is, and this replacement part does not look out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine is black, like the original.</li>
            <li> I could not find these particular replacement parts in the local stores and I did not want to have to buy a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> This is the second replacement foil I&#x27;ve ordered for my shaver and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I had gone 2 years , till I had cracks in the old foil .</li>
            <li> I ordered mine directly from Amazon, which may be the difference.</li>
            <li> Direct replacement for 1775.</li>
            <li> Does not shave nearly as well for me or my father who I also bought one for.</li>
            <li> Lately, I have been using it more and it was time to get a replacement</li>
            <li> Service was prompt &amp; professional...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll shave again, had used the old block and foil for about 3 years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a different design, more durable, but takes a few minutes longer.</li>
            <li> This patter of openings in the foil is an irregular shape rather than round as in the original foils.</li>
            <li> It brought my Braun rechageable razor back to life, with a fraction of the cost of buying a complete new one.</li>
            <li> I would even consider buying a new one (about $120), and prefer the same model, which can be used while in the shower.</li>
            <li> That being said, after two weeks there is not a noticeable difference in performance, but then, I haven&#x27;t replaced the parts in at least two years so they should have been less effective than when new.</li>
            <li> I wanted to write a quick review because the reviews on the main page were confusing.</li>
            <li> Got it within a few days with standard free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blue Series 2000 replacement foil DOES fit the black Series 1000 razors, but the seller should change the picture in his/her listing to relect the actual item.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase two for less than half of what my local retailer was asking.   </li>
            <li> If you want a black one, like the first two pictures in the ad, then don&#x27;t buy from this seller.  </li>
            <li> For less than $30 these new parts will make your Braun new again.</li>
            <li> My original screen unit consisted of a black collar attached to a black foil mounting that held the metal foil; the replacement part came as a gray collar attached to a blue foil mounting.</li>
            <li> The only difference is that it is new and sharp and was here in two days over a holiday.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting to receive a blue foil because of other reviews, but mine was black, exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> , use my old foil, use the other shaver, or use a blade.  </li>
            <li> Replacement foils and blocks usually cost nearly as much as the entire shaver!</li>
            <li> Though the picture shows it in black and clear, it comes in silver and blue.</li>
            <li> The labeling is a little confusing, but it did fit my razor.  </li>
            <li> Within a couple of hours after using it I have to go back and try again on several rough spots.</li>
            <li> Due to reasons for buying the shaver (pending hand &amp; wrist surgery on my right hand)I was forced to buy a different shaver hence foil replacement lives in a drawer somewhere.</li>
            <li> I spent the extra to get the item shown</li>
            <li> It meets with the standard of quality I have been expected to get from BrAun products wnd why I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> Long lasting foil and has cutter stayed sharp for over six months and still going.</li>
            <li> When the parts are found, they are often almost as expensive as the original product.</li>
            <li> I have replaced several due to damage rather than wear.    </li>
            <li> Now I have to buy a new shaver because the trimmer hardly cuts anything anymore.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize my blades were as dull as they were until I popped the new one on.</li>
            <li> The old pattern was offset rows and the new pattern is a crazy honeycomb design with holes that are different shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li> The bait-and-switch-outlet will send you a blue one even though you wanted the black one and then will be extremely pissy when you complain.  </li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> a few years back.  </li>
            <li> It installs in less than one minute and lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I ordered both but the supplier for the shaver could not deliver the shaver but the other distributor had already shipped the replacement foil.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth the effort of returns, etc.</li>
            <li> My previous blade lasted over 2 years.</li>
            <li> Item shown in listing is the black housing for the Series 1000 replacement foil.</li>
            <li> This may bother those of you who care that the rest of the shaver is black.</li>
            <li> This replacement foil cost much less than the others, and it appears I got what I paid for.  </li>
            <li> However, the product photo showed a black foil head for the 1000 series, which I wanted as my Braun razor is  that model and also black.</li>
            <li> Got the newer foil head that is not round but a weird pattern.</li>
            <li> so I purchased a half dozen packages of the parts!</li>
            <li> little confusing, but the picture is not the one that ships.</li>
            <li> Small, ergonomic and efficient, in addition to being cordless and washable.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was sent a completely different product, which didn&#x27;t even resemble the product shown on this page.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to find the replacement at the local stores.</li>
            <li> Save yourself some hard earned dollars, and order one today.</li>
            <li> When the foil gets torn and the blades get dull - don&#x27;t throw out the shaver.    </li>
            <li> the Foil&amp;Block hold up well hard to find replacement in stores always sold out but</li>
            <li> Really hard to understand why they would change something like this.</li>
            <li> The lesson here is not buy secondary advertised items.</li>
            <li> No, I don&#x27;t mean the color.  </li>
            <li> It is worse than dull.</li>
            <li> This replacement I have used over a year until the foil wore thin.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not happy</li>
            <li> Not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun foil shavers for for 20 years and they have progressively gotten worse over the years.</li>
            <li> I am not satisified because it was falsely advertised.  </li>
            <li> These new foils that Braun uses are terrible.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing to say the least.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is difficult to find replacement parts for the 1000 series.</li>
            <li> You get to pay for them to ship the wrong thing to you</li>
            <li> Braun obviously changed their blades because this didn&#x27;t work with the razor I had--the shave was terrible!  </li>
            <li> How can you get this wrong?  </li>
            <li> WTF?</li>
            <li> or else you will put a hole in it and risk cutting yourself when you shave.</li>
            <li> Simply terrible.  </li>

            <li> Braun shavers are premier electic razors. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find replacement parts for the 1000 series. When the parts are found, they are often almost as expensive as the original product.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver but the foil is so easy to break. You really have to watch out or else you will put a hole in it and risk cutting yourself when you shave.</li>
            <li> This item was very reasonably priced and I thought it might be a replacement made by another company.  However, when I received it, it was actually a Braun product and worked perfectly.  This is a very cost-effective replacement.</li>
            <li> It was a choice of a new razor or just replacing the the blade and screen. The razor was running fine so, the choice was made. Saved some money and the razor shaves like new.</li>
            <li> I received the part as described in a timely fashion and well packed.  The price, quality and service were all what anyone could want.  Thank-You!  Joe -n- Sharon</li>
            <li> This is the second replacement foil I&#x27;ve ordered for my shaver and it works very well. It installs in less than one minute and lasts for a very long time. A great value!</li>
            <li> If you want a black one, like the first two pictures in the ad, then don&#x27;t buy from this seller.  The bait-and-switch-outlet will send you a blue one even though you wanted the black one and then will be extremely pissy when you complain.  Then they reluctantly offer only to refund the purchase price.  So ... guess what? You get to pay for them to ship the wrong thing to you and then you get to pay to ship it back to them. Isn&#x27;t online shopping fun?</li>
            <li> Replacement foils and blocks usually cost nearly as much as the entire shaver! With a sweet price like I received from this merchant, it only makes sense to replace these parts rather than purchase a new shaver...so I purchased a half dozen packages of the parts! The merchant was very good with customer support as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this Braun replacement foil for my husband&#x27;s razor.  The old one was tearing his face up, so he is very happy!!  It was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> None of the stores carry the replacement head for my Braun T1000.  It has been running for YEARS now, but needs a replacement head once every year or so.  Thanks Amazon! Skybird</li>
            <li> fast service, great product, great price including shipping.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second order from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> The 1000 series Braun shaver I purchased years ago is still my favorite.  Small, ergonomic and efficient, in addition to being cordless and washable.  I am sure glad that the replacement block and foil are still available after all these years.Thanks Braun.</li>
            <li> In 2008, I had a 30-day hospital stay during which I could only get a sponge bath and opted not to shave because of the additional physical effort. On my release day in Jan 2008, I somehow managed to shave my full facial beard with a disposable razor. My reward for getting released from the hospital was to treat myself to a new electric shaver. I selected the Braun 1000 series and have continued to use it 3 years later. After changing the foil and block ($29.93 w/S&amp;H), it works like new. I would even consider buying a new one (about $120), and prefer the same model, which can be used while in the shower.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what we needed and received good service.We are thinking of ordering a spare in the future to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Braun replacement foil for my Braun Cruzer electric shaver.  Unfortunately, I was sent a completely different product, which didn&#x27;t even resemble the product shown on this page.  I uploaded a couple of pictures of what they actually sent me.  Doesn&#x27;t anyone at Amazon actually check out the product prior to sending it out?</li>
            <li> Electric razors seems to work great a first then as they get some age, or in my case mileage, they tend to leave stubble.  Getting a new blade and foil is usually just all you need and the Braun replacement is excellent!</li>
            <li> This item was unavailable at many local stores and way overpriced at many other sources. Amazon had it readily available and at a reasonable price with quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This replacement will breathe new life into your old razor. A quick snap in, and you are ready to go. Save yourself some hard earned dollars, and order one today. You won&#x27;t ever be foiled again.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal! The store did not have it for a long time and it was quite a bit more.</li>
            <li> I bought a replacement foil and block for my 1000 series Braun electric shaver.  This is the first time I had to replace these parts on a shaver I purchased two years ago.  That was far better than for any other shaver I ever had.  I got a great price on the replacement parts and they arrived promptly.  They have worked as well as the original parts.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The part worked fine, looked fine, despite all the unreasonably negative reviews.  Got it quickly at a good price.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> Maybe it is the thickness of my beard, I don&#x27;t know.  I did notice that the new foil was designed a bit&lt;br /&gt;different from the one that came with my Braun Free Control shaver.  No, I don&#x27;t mean the color.  I could care&lt;br /&gt;less about that.  Just that the holes in the foil seemed smaller and arranged differently.  Something that just&lt;br /&gt;might matter.  But I gave it a good try anyway.  After 15 minutes of running the shaver around my face, I did&lt;br /&gt;get &#x27;almost&#x27; as close a shave as with my old foil, but at the price of more razor burn. This particular foil&lt;br /&gt;just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Thankfully, I have another shaver.  I had been doing some comparisons.  For awhile&lt;br /&gt;the Braun was holding it&#x27;s own.  But now, I see I will either have to search for yet another Braun replacement&lt;br /&gt;foil, use my old foil, use the other shaver, or use a blade.  So buyer beware and purchase this at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;This foil will not be like the one you are replacing if you own the Free Control shaver from Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that it works better for you than it did for me.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this replacement blade;  the last time was about 18 months ago.  So far I believe I have gotten excellent value out of my freecontrol razor and replacement blades (I&#x27;ve had the razor for about three years).  It won&#x27;t give you the closest shave you&#x27;ve ever had, but it&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped from Shaver Time World and was exactly what I ordered. The original Braun replacement shaver head in the corect color. I don&#x27;t believe there is any way to make sure you get the correct color shaver head so perhaps I just got lucky. It sure would be nice if the vendor gave you color choice to be sure you always get what you want.</li>
            <li> My shaver like all products do wear out so parts must be replaced. I like my Braun shaver and was happy to find a vendor that sells them. The parts matched and no problem changing them and mu razor acts like a new one</li>
            <li> I wanted to write a quick review because the reviews on the main page were confusing. I have the black Free Control 1775 and i wanted to replace the foil and cutter. I ordered from Essex Technology Group and received the correct item. It is black, fits correctly, and works great. So if you have that model buy with confidence from this seller.</li>
            <li> The Braun Replacement Foil and Block comes from a company that I believe produces excellent electric equipment. I have owned only three Braun products and have used each of them for many years. When I first purchased my Braun razor (1000 series) I replaced the foil and block after six months as recommended. This replacement I have used over a year until the foil wore thin. Durability and the length of good quality usage is what I consider a high quality craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> Good replacement.  Different color than my original shaver.  But it totally restored performance.  I hope it lasts another 1.5 years.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what you need if your shaver becomes something that may resemble an Epilady. Though the picture shows it in black and clear, it comes in silver and blue. The silver part that attaches to shaver can be easily changed with the original black part if you prefer. The item was ordered from Shaver Outlet, Inc. and arrived quickly and exactly as specified and for half the price of most other places.</li>
            <li> Good razor. The replacements are what make a razor. While these work well, the foil is a bit fragile. I have replaced several due to damage rather than wear.    Supplier responded quickly, reasonable shipping.</li>
            <li> As expected. Good customer service</li>
            <li> This is the exact replacement part for the Bruan Free Control 1775 razor. My previous blade lasted over 2 years. It works like a charm. I can already feel the differnce. 2 thumbs up. Kudos to the seller as well. It arrived in time and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Amazon and love this replacement part.</li>
            <li> The problem is I ordered a Amazon advertised shaver and in doing so a banner for a replacement foil appeared. I ordered both but the supplier for the shaver could not deliver the shaver but the other distributor had already shipped the replacement foil. Due to reasons for buying the shaver (pending hand &amp; wrist surgery on my right hand)I was forced to buy a different shaver hence foil replacement lives in a drawer somewhere. The lesson here is not buy secondary advertised items.</li>
            <li> The color I got was different than the color shown.  No big deal unless you are metro sexual or something.  Then it might ruin your day.  Oh yea.  The price was great.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly ,,,,, the manual on the shaver , called for a yearly replacement of the foil . I had gone 2 years , till I had cracks in the old foil . I would recommend this to anyone ,,,, verify the numbers and photo for your shaver .</li>
            <li> All the debate about the different foils made me reluctant to order a replacement but the shaver is still well liked so I gave it a shot. I looked through many listings and compared pictures/reviews to get the correct one. It fits the free control 1775 fine, the foil is the right color (black gray as shown), but it has the pattern shown in the fourth photo of the 2000 series not the 1000 series. This is not the same as the original or the first replacement that I bought. $25 is a lot for shaver parts so a person ought to know what they are getting. That being said, after two weeks there is not a noticeable difference in performance, but then, I haven&#x27;t replaced the parts in at least two years so they should have been less effective than when new. I&#x27;m happy to not go shaver shopping but think Electronic sonic(who mine was sold by) or braun or buy-it-now-store needs to update the listing to show the product they are selling. This is what I actually received and it was $4 cheaper. I spent the extra to get the item shown so I&#x27;m not happy but it&#x27;s not worth the effort of returns, etc. [[ASIN:B001VEK1LW Braun Series 1 Combi 10B Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 1000/2000)]] I would give it four stars for performance but three for price and two for not knowing what you are ordering. So avg. 3 it is.</li>
            <li> This replacement fits and works perfectly. Very pleased we don&#x27;t need to throw shaver away. We will definitely order again when needed!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal, purchase more then one if you like, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Item shown in listing is the black housing for the Series 1000 replacement foil. What was received is the Series 2000 replacement foil, which has a blue housing.     The blue Series 2000 replacement foil DOES fit the black Series 1000 razors, but the seller should change the picture in his/her listing to relect the actual item.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s necessary to get one of these about once year or so to keep the shaver working well. The color doesn&#x27;t match with the unit bit it IS the same part number and fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the original, but definitely a good replacement since I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect replacement shaver head and works as advertised.  it is being sold at a much better price than can be found at discounters like Walmart.</li>
            <li> Simply terrible.  The original wore out after many years of use.  Would not recommend the replacement to anyone.  It is worse than dull.</li>
            <li> When the foil gets torn and the blades get dull - don&#x27;t throw out the shaver.    For less than $30 these new parts will make your Braun new again.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product locally and was ready to just buy a new razor when I decided to check Amamzon just in case.  I found what I was looking for and the company who I bought it from was very fast in shipping it and the prices were reasonable.  I&#x27;ll definitely use them the next time I need the parts!</li>
            <li> This replacement package works for my Free Control, Series 1000 (1775) electric razor.  The labeling is a little confusing, but it did fit my razor.  Shaves like new again.</li>
            <li> I ordered a replacement \\&quot;foil\\&quot; for my 5-year-old BRAUN 1000 SERIES. The price with shipping was lower than what was charged by local stores and I did not have to get in the car, wait for an air-head clerk,etc! The foil arrived sooner than promised. It fit the shaver and it gave a better shave than the original foil--which should have been replaced years ago.</li>
            <li> Picked this up for my 2+ year old Cruzer series razor and works great. The color did not match, but fits perfect.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to receive a blue foil because of other reviews, but mine was black, exactly as pictured. I ordered mine directly from Amazon, which may be the difference. It fits just fine and works as good as the original.</li>
            <li> Braun obviously changed their blades because this didn&#x27;t work with the razor I had--the shave was terrible!  I am switching to Remington.  George Perrine</li>
            <li> It meets with the standard of quality I have been expected to get from BrAun products wnd why I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> WHY DOES AMAZON FORCE ME TO WRITE A REVIEW??? THE TRANSACTION WAS FINE BUT I DON&#x27;T NEED TO WRITE A POEM ABOUT IT.</li>
            <li> Most Excellent Shaver have been using it for 3 years now daily on my face&amp;head !  the Foil&amp;Block hold up well hard to find replacement in stores always sold out but not   on Amazon.com they rule .  buzz</li>
            <li> little confusing, but the picture is not the one that ships. a blue one ships. And the package says 2000 series, cruzer- cruzer 3. says nothing about this fitting a free control 1775, but it seems to fit and work fine. price is great though. may order another one. shipping was really fast. thanks!!</li>
            <li> Nice doing business with you. Product was excellent and shipment was fast. It was all that it was advertised, kudos!!!!</li>
            <li> The replacement foil and block work great; however, the foil has a blue plastic housing. This may bother those of you who care that the rest of the shaver is black.</li>
            <li> Does not shave as close and accurate as my original foil, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Works fine but I&#x27;m still looking for an electric shaver that will give me a faster, closer shave.</li>
            <li> The electric razor works much better with the new parts.  I could not find these particular replacement parts in the local stores and I did not want to have to buy a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> good quality part, great fit,was very happy w/ my choice.&lt;br /&gt;A huge surprice since the shaver and the part were made in CHINA.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has been a good performing machine.</li>
            <li> The foil has done the job as advertised, but I didn&#x27;t think about the fact that this doesn&#x27;t replace the long-hair trimmer blade.  Now I have to buy a new shaver because the trimmer hardly cuts anything anymore.</li>
            <li> Got it within a few days with standard free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The website offered the two models to choose from but did not have a button to for the buyer to select the one they wanted.  I am glad that they did ship the model I want. Great pricing (20% cheaper) comparing to ordering from authorized Braun dealer.  I have it for 2 months now and so far they are working fine.</li>
            <li> Es mi primera maquina de afeitar. Puedo decir me parece increible tener toda esa calidad por tan buen precio, el producto es de diseño aleman algo que ya da una idea de la calidad. les recomiendo comprar unos 2 o 3 reemplazos extras y tendran maquina para 5 años o más.. en una palabra AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This replacement foil cost much less than the others, and it appears I got what I paid for.  It doesn&#x27;t cut evenly or deeply without a lot of additional effort.  Within a couple of hours after using it I have to go back and try again on several rough spots.</li>
            <li> I had ordered 2 of the Braun 1000 series replacement as advertised on Amazon.  However, when got my merchandise, they sent me a Braun 2000 series replacement head and a Braun 8000 series replacement head.  How can you get this wrong?  I had ordered two of the same thing?  I emailed customer service and they said that the 2000 series fits the razor and to send the 8000 series back.  They sent me another 2000 series to replace it.  The 2000 series does fit, but it&#x27;s gray colored verses black.  What is that?  You advertise 1000 series, but you get something else?    I am not satisified because it was falsely advertised.  But I am glad that they acted quickly for a replacement even though it was a different product then advertised.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement for my Braun Washable 1775 electric razor. When buying replacements for your electric razor always buy the foil and block as a unit; buying the block separate from the foil can and will cause problems with them fitting snugly together.</li>
            <li> delivery was efficient, part was the exact replacement. the part is working just fine&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy and the shaver is doing it just and acting just like new again!</li>
            <li> This replacement foil does not provide as good a shave as the original foil.  A bit disappointing to say the least.</li>
            <li> This is the factory replacement for my razor, and works great.</li>
            <li> This replacement was for 1000 and 2000 foil shavers.  I own a 1000 model Braun shaver. Although it works fine, it probably fits the 2000 model a little better.  All in all, cheaper than replacing the whole shaver.  Still gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> works as good as the new one.</li>
            <li> it works, it&#x27;s not as good as the one that came with the shaver, but it works and the price was right. I would buy it again if I couldn&#x27;t get the kind that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li> We bought the electric shaver replacement foil after the original wore out.  The new one is great, just as good as the original...maybe better.  The price the cheaper through Amazon than through the brick and mortal store.</li>
            <li> The shaver replacement cutter and screen were well packaged, easy to order through Amazon,and are working well.  I&#x27;ll order them again when I need another replacement.&lt;br /&gt; AJM</li>
            <li> The product ordered was just what I needed for my husbands shaver. I went to three stores prior to purchase on Amazon was a great experience and the shipping was in a timely fashion. I will purchase again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> As far as product performance, it is Braun quality at its best. However, the product photo showed a black foil head for the 1000 series, which I wanted as my Braun razor is  that model and also black. What I received was a silver and blue foil head, which I would assume was for the Cruzer model. As the price was great compared to what I would have paid at retail locations (i.e. Walmart, Target) IF they carried them, I can&#x27;t complain, but I would appreciate the product delivered to match the product ordered, and more differentiation if there is a difference such as color. A generic shot-gun compatibility description does not serve the product.[[ASIN:B000WLU3YA Braun Replacement Foil and Block, 1000 2000 For Free Control and Cruzer Shavers]]</li>
            <li> Not like new but does ok</li>
            <li> This razor sat for 3 yrs. couldn&#x27;t find replacement anywhere. I&#x27;m using it every day now. Well worth it. Like new</li>
            <li> I shopped around for the Braun Foil &amp; Block replacement. I do not buy only on price..I will read reviews on the product and the service provided by the vendor. This is a quality product at a fair price, with prompt shipping and high reviews. You all earned your 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This was a Great product worked just like it was documented, I would tell my friends to buy it, honest.</li>
            <li> With the cost of electric shavers these days, anything that will prolong this expense is worth it. This device fit perfectly and made my 5 year old shaver feel like new. Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> There seems to be some confusion over this product. I, too have a Braun FreeControl washable 1775. As best as I could research the matter, both on Amazon.con and on Braun&#x27;s own site, this seemed to be the correct replacement screen and cutter block, in spite of indications to the contrary in some of the feedback. The replacement that I received came in a package labeled, \\&quot;Braun 2000 Series, cruZer^3/cruZer.\\&quot; There was a paper label stuck across the top of the package that read: \\&quot;For 1000/2000 FreeControl&amp;Cruzer.\\&quot; The cutter block was identical to that of the FreeControl 1775, and the replacement screen unit was identical except in color: My original screen unit consisted of a black collar attached to a black foil mounting that held the metal foil; the replacement part came as a gray collar attached to a blue foil mounting. If the color is an issue, the foil mounting snaps out of the collar easily, so you can use your original black collar with the new foil mounting. (The collar doesn&#x27;t wear out.) Hope this helps to clarify the matter.</li>
            <li> Absolutely as good as new!  I would recommend this to anyone whose shave is not as smooth as smooth.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, replaces my old blades and works perfectly.  However, I did have to go to Braun website to figure out the right product to buy. I ordered another one only to find out it may be a Chinese knock off, and had to cancel and reorder. This is the genuine one.</li>
            <li> Different color than original shaver head but fits perfectly an works like new. It seems to be structurally as well made as the original.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a perfect replacement foil and block for my old Braun 1775 shaver.  I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Braun Series 1 cruZer foil and cutter block. (10B/20B, 1000/2000 series).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement part fits my Braun cruZer3 razor perfectly. The color is black instead of the original silver and blue, and the hole pattern is different than the old foil, but it works even better than the original pattern even when it was new. I don&#x27;t care about the color change, and it almost looks better on the razor than the old color as there are several black pieces on the razor as it is, and this replacement part does not look out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the hole pattern, this new design works better than the old. The old pattern was offset rows and the new pattern is a crazy honeycomb design with holes that are different shapes and sizes. This seems to work more efficiently on my beard. Also, this pattern seems to glide over my face smoother than the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement part makes my old razor seem like new, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Direct replacement for 1775. The blade part snaps in perfect. The foil part fits perfect, but not happy with how long foil lasts. I get cracking at left or right edge and then it cuts up my face as I shave. Found a better foil that fits Cruzer, but it takes longer to shave. It&#x27;s a different design, more durable, but takes a few minutes longer. This one is just like the original and works great.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it. The screen was fine, though off-color, but the blades were not sharp enough for me. I got a better shave when I put the old blade back on. I recommend, at this price, just pay $10 more dollars and get a new shaver.</li>
            <li> These new foils that Braun uses are terrible. This patter of openings in the foil is an irregular shape rather than round as in the original foils. Does not shave nearly as well for me or my father who I also bought one for. Really hard to understand why they would change something like this. I have been using Braun foil shavers for for 20 years and they have progressively gotten worse over the years.</li>
            <li> I finally had to replace the foil head and blades for my Braun razor and I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the foil design had changed, but it was for the better. The new foil actually shaves closer than the original and was more comfortable as well. Great design Braun!</li>
            <li> I was unable to find the replacement at the local stores. This was shipped promptly and fit perfectly (I had my doubts).</li>
            <li> Always have a spare one at hand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally satisfied with this replacement, it is actually better than the original .</li>
            <li> Has held up for over a year now, perhaps 2.  No problems, good shave.  But being Braun original I would expect that.</li>
            <li> After reading some many reviews good and bad, I decided to get this cutter block/foil from this seller.  I was looking for a replacement part for my OEM part on my 1775.  As anyone that has ever used a 1775 knows these are incredible razors that were crazy cheap ($30) a few years back.  I had never replaced my block/foil even though I have had mine for several years as I only use it occasionally.  Lately, I have been using it more and it was time to get a replacement part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my trepidation I ordered from this seller on 7/3 and received it on 7/5 despite opting for normal delivery.  The replacement part I received was an exact duplicate to my OEM part.  No difference in hole patterns in the foil.  No difference in color or fit on my razor.  The only difference is that it is new and sharp and was here in two days over a holiday.  Additionally, this seller offered it at the best price around.  To say I am a satisfied buyer is an understatement.</li>
            <li> Great price for the replacement cutter/foil package. Long lasting foil and has cutter stayed sharp for over six months and still going.</li>
            <li> Service was prompt &amp; professional... The replacement was just like the orginial and gave my Braun a new life, at a lower cost than new.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as one of my son&#x27;s Christmas gifts. As far as I know, he was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Works great, arrived incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> I have a 1000 series and this thing fit like a glove (and not the O.J. kind). Blue housing? WTF? Mine is black, like the original. Speaking of the original, buying this basically made my razor new again. I didn&#x27;t realize my blades were as dull as they were until I popped the new one on. 1,2, 3, BAM! Treat your face right.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase two for less than half of what my local retailer was asking.   b</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick response to my order, all arrived in good condition and the item has been put on the shelf waiting for the old one to give up the ghost.</li>
            <li> It brought my Braun rechageable razor back to life, with a fraction of the cost of buying a complete new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll shave again, had used the old block and foil for about 3 years and I guess nothing lasts forever.  A decent shave again.</li>
            <li> The Braun replacement foil and block is exactly what I needed for my Braun &amp;#34;Free Control&amp;#34; Model 1775 (washable).  It is the correct black color and the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; block was very easy to replace with the new one.  My shaver is now working just like new!  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The replacement was just what we needed and couldn&#x27;t get in our local stores anymore.  we are thankful we didn&#x27;t have to throw it away</li>
            <li> I have owned my brain cruzer shaver for over 8 years and never had any issues with it at all. As long as it works, I will always purchase original parts for it.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s perfectly serviceable, the holes in the foil are smaller than what originally came with the razor, so I find I need to work a little harder to get the same shave, and I find I miss a lot more with this one, compared to the older one. Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well on longer stubble. So, bottom line is, I would look for one with larger holes if I could, but this one&#x27;s fine. I just need to shave more carefully.</li>
            <li> My Braun razor is now just like new.  Much better than buying a brand new razor; my wallet is happy.</li>
            <li> Product was what I ordered and came quicker than I thought it would.It was an exact fit for my razor that I have had for about 5 or more years.</li>
            <li> Got the newer foil head that is not round but a weird pattern. I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;like the foil pattern that was sent. Doesn&#x27;t shave nice and uniform and even catches/pulls. The picture shown was of the older type which in my opinion works much better. If you post a picture please make sure you send the same thing as shown in the picture and as described in your heading. The one in the picture is called 1000 series. The one sent to me was for the 10B and the foil is different.</li>
