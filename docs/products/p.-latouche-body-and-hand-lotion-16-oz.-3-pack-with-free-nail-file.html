            <li> 2008,I cousin bought two of P.Latouche B&amp;H Lotion, from his coworker and he gave one to me. I put it on, one Friday and went to work. Because of its awesome smell, some women surrounded to me, enjoying niceness of its odor. I later, tried it in crowded gas station, and everyone started to look at me (their noses up). From there, I never stop buying it. Right now, I am about to order 3-pack $24 with free shipping!</li>
            <li> I just love the fragrance of this lotion. I use it instead of perfume very often. Someone gave me a small bottle of it about 5 years ago. I kept the empty bottle all of this time so I could eventually purchase some more.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because a friend uses it and I always complimented her. So I finally found it through amazon and ordered it.  I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> wonderful skin product.</li>
            <li> Such a pleasant smell and rich moisturizing texture. The price was also unbelievably low for such a fine product. I will definitely purchase again! Everyone assumes I&#x27;m wearing perfume or a body spray and would never guess it was only lotion!</li>
            <li> This lotion is absolutely fabulous. It softens and moisturizes your skin. As an added plus, the fragrance is very subtle. I often get compliments on the perfume I&#x27;m wearing. I no longer wear any fragrance other than my P. Latouche lotion. This lotion is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I got to try this lotion from my co-worker and my gosh! awesome product. When I use this I don&#x27;t need to use perfume.  Just the smell of it--my husband said, I smell like a baby! My skin feels better, looks better!</li>
            <li> The pastors wife put this hand lotion in the ladies bathroom. I&#x27;m not a big fan of lotion. But I decided to use this one. When I got home the smell was still there and my daughters loved it. It moisturizes and not greasy. I found it online, ordered 3 bottles, one for me the others for my daughters. Might pick up more as gifts because people ask me what is that fragrance? Stays on after washing your hands.</li>
            <li> Thanks alot, got a lot more than I bargained for.  I&#x27;ve used this lotion in the past but have never found a better deal than Amazon offers.</li>
            <li> Ordered this through Amazon and it arrived quickly! Traveled to Europe and took a bottle of this lotion. Freinds loved it so much I gave it to them and told them where and how to order.</li>
            <li> The small is tasteful.  Often people walk by and ask what is that small you small great.</li>
            <li> Purchased this lotion for my husband and he loves it and so do I.</li>
            <li> The Best Lotion in the World...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and I always gave it five stars, but lately I am  disappointed with the scent or lack of it. It seems that the formula has been changed.  The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long as it did in the past.</li>
            <li> smells great. But does not last long</li>
            <li> P. Latouche makes my skin shiny and smooth. My three teenagers love it also. When I&#x27;m around people they always ask me what perfume am I wearing and I tell them it&#x27;s lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful user of P.latouche lotion for over 13 years. This lotion has a soft lingering smell that will produce multiple compliments especially paired with the right perfume. This lotion keeps the skin moisturized and silky feeling for a long time.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but definitely not cheap. You may use this alone or with your favourite perfume for the layered effect. This product is great to use alone as well as it is long lasting. Best when used after your bath and shower. It is like a pheromone.</li>
            <li> This product smell so good everyone ask me what are you wearing. My skin feels so soft after applying. The smell last for hours. I brought 6 bottles with my last order.</li>
            <li> Always available at a stable price. Only place I can find it is on Amazon. Have referred it to many colleagues and they are pleased with the product as well</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants a lasting fragrant scent that lasts the whole day. Every time I where this lotion, I get a compliment on how good it smells. The price is good for the value and the bottle lasts about 6 months to a year depending on how frequently and how much you apply the product. I used it pretty regularly and it lasts. The smell can be pretty strong once applied but it tones down throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this product before, but I find it so good I am willing to review it again.  The texture and the fragrance of this lotion makes it my absolute favorite.  It also has a slight iredescence that gives my skin a lovely glow.  Once in a while I will give it as a gift, but I like keeping it for myself.</li>
            <li> Everyone that smells the lotion wants to know what it is and where it can be purchase.  I love the this product and have bought it numerous times.</li>
            <li> Been wearing this lotion for years and it still amazes me how I will lotion up in the morning and all through the day I&#x27;ll get compliments on how I smell good. The scent lasts all day long until night.</li>
            <li> This body lotion is great it moisturizes you skin leaving is glowing and the smell of it is very pleasant to anyone who comes in contact with you.  I wore it once alone nothing else and went to the store a lady followed me into the store to ask what was I wearing because she could smell it from the sidewalk in the breeze that past her.  So if you&#x27;re looking for a all in one this is it. Nice fragrance and a moisturizer too.  It last all day, if I may add.</li>
            <li> If you want an amazing lotion that smells great, but this! I receive compliments every time I put it on. However, be aware that if you wear this lotion, you can&#x27;t wear a perfume or cologne. Then again, there&#x27;s no need too.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells terrific, and all you need is a small amount to do the job.  People are always telling me that I smell good.  I will definitely purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I used P. Latouche every day it keep my skin moist, everyone wants to know what fragrance of cologne are you wearing.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that I have used for about 2 years now.  It is a great moisturizer and the smell is the best.  I get complements all of the time when I am shopping.  I carry a small bottle in my purse so that when someone asks about it, I can show them what it is and where they can order it.  I wish that it was sold in stores near me.</li>
            <li> I love a lotion that last all day and makes strangers say, &amp;#34;you smell great! What are you wear?&amp;#34; This lotion has become my all time favorite over my Light Blue:-)</li>
            <li> The first encounter that I had with this lotion was with my sister. I went to her job and she had this great smell.  And I inquired what was that you have you have on and her reply was PLatouche. I immediately told her to purchase one for me. Since then this is the only lotion that I use. I&#x27;ve receive so many compliments, that I gifted over and over again I am a regular user and purchaser of this lotion. Once you&#x27;ve tried this lotion you&#x27;re never use anything else.PS this lotion complements well whit lavender oil.</li>
