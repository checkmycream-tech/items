            <li>i am trying this product for free thanks to Braun.for</li>
            <li>I have noticed a distinct difference in the smoothness and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>brush is just the right texture for your body.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need any attachment for my Braun Silk-Epil 7, it clicked right in</li>
            <li>First of all this brush is intended for the body, not the face.</li>
            <li>i have tryed lots of others and nothing works like this brush when i first used this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s summertime and nobody wants the flaky skin showing!  </li>
            <li>These did not need any extra pieces and worked even better than my first brush did.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the Braun Silk Epil Female Replacement Brush.  </li>
            <li>Several months ago I got to try the Braun Silk-Epil 7 free from Braun and when they offered to send me a new Braun Silk-Epil 7 SkinSpa replacement brush for free; I jumped at the chance.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this brush works fine with my skin, and makes my skin extra smooth.</li>
            <li>Summer is pretty much here, and your skin will be on display for all to see.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so I epilate my hair with my Braun silk skin spa 7 Epilator, then I follow with some exfoliation using the replacement brush, wash up, get dry and add a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Prior to receiving this new brush I got a professional exfoliation from a spa, and I must admit I liked</li>
            <li>The reason i rated it 4 stars and not 5 is because in some areas it is too gentle</li>
            <li>My skin feels a lot softer and looks so much clearer.</li>
            <li>I think I need to get my legs ready for summer</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity from Braun to try The Braun Silk epil Female replacement brush spa for free from Braun.  </li>
            <li>I like how the attachment works with the Braun Silk which I received earlier to try for free from Braun.  </li>
            <li>it is very soft...not realy scrubing</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied with the product because it barley even does anything.</li>
            <li>This attachment has made my skin very soft, glowing and ready for Summer!</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t put it down because it made my skin feel so soft and nice</li>
            <li>The exfoliating brush shines my skin up by removing dead loose skin cells, allowing more healthy living skin.  </li>
            <li>It sure turned my dry cracked icky feeling not to mention gross looking heels into soft beautiful looking heels.  </li>
            <li>I recently received a new replacement brush free for my Braun Silk-epil 7 SkinSpa Exfoliation Brush from Braun to try.</li>
            <li>an you are left with smooth soft skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this little brush</li>
            <li>I love my Braun Silk-Epil 7 and all the little attachments that come with it.</li>
            <li>and i feel like i require more of a heavy duty brush.</li>
            <li>I was over due for a new one, so someone is paying attention at Braun or Bzzagent when they sent me a replacement t brush free to try out and tell others what I thinks.</li>
            <li>the only downfall is that the replacement heads to purchase are very pricey!</li>
            <li>When I first received this I thought I could only use it for my face,</li>
            <li>This brush has made this process easier for me in that it quickly and reliably removes the dead skin without having to focus too much on it.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>The brush was just too soft.</li>
            <li>After buying it I thought it should be attached directly to (</li>
            <li>I thought if it makes my face feel so soft and refreshed why not try it on my feet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s time to fix the damage that has been done by Old Man Winter.  </li>
            <li>Yes it is a little time consuming but in my opinion it is worth it!</li>
            <li>My daily routine involves a warm shower with some type of scrubber ( a loofah, poof, or something else slightly abrasive such as this brush) combined with a moisturizing body wash followed by a quick towel dry and immediately applying a heavy moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This exfoliation brush is gentle and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation to skin nor does it over dry.</li>
            <li>I saw that many others had the same complaint.</li>
            <li>It is soft enough for my sensitive skin, but it does the scrubbing</li>
            <li>It is not too soft, and definitely not too abrasive.</li>
            <li>At 40 years old, I still suffer from the occasional acne breakout.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin</li>
            <li>My one complaint about the original Braun Silk-Ã©pil 7 SkinSpa was the exfoliating brush because I didn&#x27;t feel or see a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin, not too hard and not too soft.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product to use as a facial exfoliator, as I felt it was too weak for the rest of my body.</li>

            <li> I have normal to dry skin and im prone to cellulite on mostly my legs. This exfoliation brush is gentle and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation to skin nor does it over dry. I am pleased with the results. The reason i rated it 4 stars and not 5 is because in some areas it is too gentle and i feel like i require more of a heavy duty brush. Overall i was impressed ðŸ˜„</li>
            <li> First of all this brush is intended for the body, not the face. Do not use it on your face unless you can handle something akin to a pumice stone scrubbing your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note, this is a refill for the Braun body brush attachment, yes you need an attachment to connect this to your epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry skin and eczema. My daily routine involves a warm shower with some type of scrubber ( a loofah, poof, or something else slightly abrasive such as this brush) combined with a moisturizing body wash followed by a quick towel dry and immediately applying a heavy moisturizer. This brush has made this process easier for me in that it quickly and reliably removes the dead skin without having to focus too much on it.&lt;br /&gt;With this brush I have noticed a distinct difference in the smoothness and texture of my skin. I am not having many problems with flaky skin. My patches of eczema are less pronounced, and in some cases are gone.&lt;br /&gt;This brush is just the right texture for your body. It is not too soft, and definitely not too abrasive. my skin is sensitive, and this is a great balance for softness and texture for me.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free thanks to Braun, and I LOVE it!! it makes my skin feel amazing! Yes it is a little time consuming but in my opinion it is worth it! I use the brush twice a week or so the only downfall is that the replacement heads to purchase are very pricey! keep up the good work Braun!</li>
            <li> This brush is honestly amazing, I was sent this amazing brush free for review by bzzagent.com (check it out it&#x27;s great) for my honest opinion and I have another facial brush which was about 200 and this one is basically the same. Would defiantly recommend as well as repurchase! I have sensitive skin and this brush works fine with my skin, and makes my skin extra smooth. And fits right on epilator ( which is great as well! )</li>
            <li> Braun Silk Epilator replacement Brush! Brought to you by silky smooth and sexy feeling legs here in NY. After receiving my replacement brush, I was so happy. I was over due for a new one, so someone is paying attention at Braun or Bzzagent when they sent me a replacement t brush free to try out and tell others what I thinks. So, you know that scaly dry skin we get over the winter? And how when we shave, lotion up, and go about our day, we end up needing several apps of lotion to keep us from descending back to dust before its our time.. Lol... But this is my routine, and it is phenomenol, i tell you!!!!! Ok, so I epilate my hair with my Braun silk skin spa 7 Epilator, then I follow with some exfoliation using the replacement brush, wash up, get dry and add a moisturizer. THATS IT!!!! 1 APPLICATION OF LOTION IS ALL I NEED FOR THE ENTIRE DAY!!!! The exfoliating brush literally shines my skin up by removing dead loose skin cells, allowing more healthy living skin to shine and allow you to be that sexy silky smooth girl!!! DO IT UP--- I know I have and I will continue using this product. I have not shaved with a razor or used anything to exfoliate my skin since I was blessed with this amazing woman tool!!! You will be too... This I promise you</li>
            <li> I was received this product through Bzzagent.com to test out, and I love it.  It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin :) My skin feels a lot softer and looks so much clearer.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush it&#x27;s so awesome and it makes your legs look and feel super nice i have tryed lots of others and nothing works like this brush when i first used this i couldn&#x27;t put it down because it made my skin feel so soft and nice it&#x27;s not to hard or to soft just right I can feel a difference everything i use it if you buy this you will love it so go and try it out for your self i am trying this product for free thanks to Braun.for my own review on i just love it</li>
            <li> My one complaint about the original Braun Silk-Ã©pil 7 SkinSpa was the exfoliating brush because I didn&#x27;t feel or see a difference. The brush was just too soft. I saw that many others had the same complaint. Exfoliating is very important with using an epilator as ingrown hairs can occur. I was so happy that Braun heard our reviews and sent the new and improved exfoliating brush. It is so much better than the original! The brushes are stiffer and actually feel like they exfoliate. Now that summer is back and I&#x27;m using my epilator again, I am looking forward to using this exfoliator to have smooth skin. I received this replacement brush from bzzagent to review for free.</li>
            <li> it is good head for very delicate exfoliation , it is good to use it after taking a shower .</li>
            <li> I received this product free to try and write my honest feedback thanks to Braun.&lt;br /&gt;I love that there is now a replacement brush for my Braun Silk Epil 7.  It makes your skin feel so smooth.  I like that it is easy to use and easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> Smooth, Soft, and leaves your skin beautiful.  I recently received a new replacement brush free for my Braun Silk-epil 7 SkinSpa Exfoliation Brush from Braun to try. Prior to receiving this new brush I got a professional exfoliation from a spa, and I must admit I liked my Braun Silk Epil Brush alot better. It allows your skin to stay silky smooth, and glowing, even hours after a shave. Dry skin runs in my family, but I never have that problem after using this exfoliation brush. THANKS BRAUN AND BZZAGENT!!! I am now a faithful user of this Braun exfoliation brush. This product made me love exfolation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> What great timing for Braun/BzzAgent to send a replacement exfoliation brush!  It&#x27;s summertime and nobody wants the flaky skin showing!  The exfoliating brush shines my skin up by removing dead loose skin cells, allowing more healthy living skin.  This brush is just the right texture for your body (would not recommend using on your face)t is not too soft or abrasive -  a great balance for softness and texture.  The tool is very easy to use!  Go Get One!</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this brush free from the manufacturer Braun. I like it and will replace it if/ when the time comes. It is soft enough for my sensitive skin, but it does the scrubbing I think I need to get my legs ready for summer an possibly a tattoo. It&#x27;s very easy to attach and detach. I like that it&#x27;s automatic so I don&#x27;t have to worry that I&#x27;m not exfoliating evenly. This way I won&#x27;t have any odd rough spots.</li>
            <li> I love this brush the way it can just keep my skin clear and the black heads away nothing but love!! great job!!</li>
            <li> Several months ago I got to try the Braun Silk-Epil 7 free from Braun and when they offered to send me a new Braun Silk-Epil 7 SkinSpa replacement brush for free; I jumped at the chance. I got to try both products free from Braun and so thankful they sent them to me. I love my Braun Silk-Epil 7 and all the little attachments that come with it. I use the Braun Silk-Epil 7 SkinSpa Exfoliation Brush about twice a week, I use it all over my body for a nice deep clean. My skin always feels soft and smooth after I use it, and really clean too! I didn&#x27;t need any attachment for my Braun Silk-Epil 7, it clicked right in and I used it immediately.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It keeps my skin feeling smooth and looking healthy. Plus it&#x27;s the simplest thing to attach. Just click and your on your way yo smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun Epilator for at least 6 months. This attachment is a perfect tool to use before you use the epilator, and anytime you want smooth skin. The bristles are soft yet effective. This attachment has made my skin very soft, glowing and ready for Summer! I did receive this attachment for free, thanks to Braun for the purpose of review, but the opinion expressed is 100% honest feedback.</li>
            <li> After buying it I thought it should be attached directly to (Braun SE7681 Silk-Ã©pil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator, White ) that&#x27;s why I bought them together&lt;br /&gt;But I discovered it needs an adapter which is not mentioned in description</li>
            <li> These brush heads work great!  After the initial exfoliation brush I got with my Braun Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 7 SkinSpa stopped working as well, I wanted to replace it.  However, I read some reviews from others saying that some of the Braun attachments may need an adapter piece.  I was a bit worried, but I&#x27;m so glad Braun decided to send me some new brushes for free.  These did not need any extra pieces and worked even better than my first brush did.  I just turn my brush on to the lowest speed setting and move it along my skin; the brush takes care of the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those readers that didn&#x27;t like the exfoliation brush from when they bought the Silk-epil 7, these ones are a definite improvement.  The initial one was softer by comparison and didn&#x27;t work quite as well as this one does.  I really suggest giving this one a try because it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity from Braun to try The Braun Silk epil Female replacement brush spa for free from Braun.  I like how the attachment works with the Braun Silk which I received earlier to try for free from Braun.  Thanks so much for the opportunity Braun to use your wonderful products.  I love the attachment.  When I first received this I thought I could only use it for my face, Oh,  I was so wrong.  I have such dry legs and feet especially my heels.  I thought if it makes my face feel so soft and refreshed why not try it on my feet.  I love how the shape of the tool reached in those difficult angles with ease.  It sure turned my dry cracked icky feeling not to mention gross looking heels into soft beautiful looking heels.  It takes all the dead sking off an you are left with smooth soft skin.  You feel and look so much younger as well.  There is no reason to not feel like you are a getting a spa treatment every thime you use the exfolliating brush.  You may use it on any body part.  I highly recommend you to purchase this brush as it is a tool I use everyday and it makes me look and feel like a million bucks.  I feel this is a must have tool to use with your Braun Silk Epil 7</li>
            <li> it is very soft...not realy scrubing</li>
            <li> I was received this product through Bzzagen.com to test out, and I love it. The entire Braun spa skin line is wonderful too. This works with the epilator on an attachment. It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin, not too hard and not too soft. I can feel a difference each time. My skin feels refreshed and a lot softer than just using a traditional loofa. I recommend this to anyone with the product who likes the body exfoliation feature.</li>
            <li> At 40 years old, I still suffer from the occasional acne breakout. I have used many products over time but none truly helped or either helped one condition and aggravated another condition.&lt;br /&gt;I received the SkinSap Exfoliation Brush to be used in conjunction with my Braun Silk epil 7 for free in exchange for my honest review and love it!  I haven&#x27;t had to suffer from overly dry skin because there are no harmful chemicals. From the first time I used it, it was like magic. I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my skin because it felt so smooth. I use it once a day with slightly more focus on my problem areas (nose and chin).</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the Braun Silk Epil Female Replacement Brush.  This brush does a very good job of exfoliating your body. I love exfoliating my skin because I feel that my skin is softer when I exfoliate, and my lotion absorbs better into my skin. I&#x27;ve had my Braun Silk-epil 7 Epilator for about 10 months (which included a Braun Silk Epil Brush), so it was time to replace the SkinSpa Exfoliation Brush.  This brush is not at all painful, and actually feels like I&#x27;m getting a mini massage.  I use the brush on my body about two times a week to exfoliate my skin.  Summer is pretty much here, and your skin will be on display for all to see.  You don&#x27;t want your skin looking dry and flaky.  It&#x27;s time to fix the damage that has been done by Old Man Winter.  The solution is the Braun Silk-epil 7 SkinSpa Exfoliation Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I received this product for free from Braun for the purpose of review.  However, the opinions expressed in this review are 100% my own***</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied with the product because it barley even does anything. Although it claims to exfoliate 4x better then manually,  it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I get much better results with a srub pad in the shower. ..</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product to use as a facial exfoliator, as I felt it was too weak for the rest of my body. A manual brush would do better. I usually do oil cleansing method on my face once a week, and I use body oil as a moisturizer, so I had to switch to a cream cleanser to use the exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for free from BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to waxing the unfortunate consequence of southern European ancestry -- hair on my upper lip and chin. I used this epilator and wound up with what looks for all the world like a scabby rug burn.</li>
