            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>but if a product is good then its worth paying for.</li>
            <li>Would most definately use again.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I would never have tried it myself because I would have been sure that it would have made it greasy.  </li>
            <li>and I love that as well.</li>
            <li>The product delivered was NOT the genuine version.</li>
            <li>This product does not make your hair look or feel greasy, but makes it shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sound like</li>
            <li>But it really gave my hair nice body and texture.  </li>
            <li>This product allows my hair to stay healthy, soft and shiny even though I have it highlighted every six weeks and straighten it every day.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair that is hard to control, and this works great at keeping my hair shiny - even when I abuse my hair with a blow-dryer and iron.</li>
            <li>For people leaving reviews of this product as a positive, maybe their bottles were legitimate.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist is constantly amazed that my hair is so strong ans durable.  </li>

            <li>Using too much will leave your hair oily.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Takes a while to figure out how much to use so that it will work yet not make your hair oily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem like oil.  </li>
            <li>Counterfeiting is such a financial and creative &#x60;slap in the face&#x27; not to mention the pocket for the originator.  </li>
            <li>I am 7 months pregnant and would like to know what I actually put on my hair.</li>
            <li>seller of this has requested that I \\&quot;please remove this feedback so we can finish this transaction in normal way\\&quot; and that \\&quot;this feedback was not nesesery.</li>
            <li>Even my hairdresser was amazed how healthy it is for such long hair.  </li>
            <li>I blow dry and my hair feels soft and smooth again.  </li>
            <li>It controls frizz and leaves my hair shiny and natural.  </li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil is the best ever product, none greasy on hair gives brillant shine, smells good, only need to use small amount so will last a long time, the only down side is that its what I call expensive</li>
            <li>I have very long hair which is highlighted and straight.</li>
            <li>A little on the pricey side but worth it.</li>
            <li>The real Moroccan Oil has a faint nutty smell, the one I purchased from this vendor has a strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li>We both use it, she has thick course hair and mine is fine and blonde.</li>
            <li>After I shampoo my hair every other day, and it is towel dry, I put about about a dime sized (or a little more) in my palm and rub it through all of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m upset that I purchased this, but I guess I should have known that buying something much cheaper than the original would be a fake.</li>
            <li>It did the same for my four year old grandaughter who also has very dry hair.</li>

            <li> I was skeptical because my hair is fine and oil is the enemy.  </li>
            <li> You use only a small amount and it makes your hair soft and shiney without making your hair oily.  </li>
            <li> so we can resolve this like normal people\\&quot;, but I believe anyone who sells on Amazon is responsible for the product that they sell and this product is fake.</li>
            <li> Remember that a little goes a long way and depending on your hair lenght, you will only need to use the amount the size of a dime to quarter.  </li>
            <li> My hairstylist gave me a bit of the Moroccan Oil Treatment to use because I have very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> The price was always the same, it&#x27;s not cheap.  </li>
            <li> I use it after washing my hair still still wet.  </li>
            <li> I emailed the company when my order didn&#x27;t arrive 4 days after the expected date.  </li>
            <li> I bought it myself after that and have been addicted for the last year and a half, and am only on my third bottle.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount and this calms the frizz and makes my hair manageable.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;I just got to your other email.</li>
            <li> I am very upset to see fake bottles being sold and hope that Amazon recognizes this as a problem as I have now seen that I am not the only one who has bought and noticed that there are fake Moroccan Oil products being sold on Amazon through 3rd party sellers.</li>
            <li> I had searched beauty salons and the internet previously for this product with no luck.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount in the palm of my hand and work it through my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick long hair...</li>
            <li> A little bit is all I use, but the condition of my hair has improved noticeably and I don&#x27;t have the flyaways that I usually get in the 100% humidity of Atlanta June weather.  </li>
            <li> What a pain - if they don&#x27;t&#x27; refund my money tomorrow, I&#x27;ll have make a complaint with Amazon.    </li>
            <li> In addition, they had other reviews of singular sold 3.4 ounce bottles of Moroccan Oil stating that there was either something wrong with it or it was fake.</li>
            <li> It pains me to give any star at all to a fake item but based on your review system we must enter a least one.(Hello</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t tell if the item is fake.</li>
            <li> The product that I received is fake.</li>
            <li> Can we report that this is a fake though?</li>
            <li> Very sorry for the delay in response.  </li>
            <li> They did refund my order and did state that they understood why I would be frustrated with their service.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product arrived on time and well packaged.  It is an awesome price and product!</li>
            <li> The product delivered was NOT the genuine version. (Hello Amazon - do you care?) The reviewer on December 13, 2010 has already noted this I now realise; I made my purchase in November but did not open the box until recently. It pains me to give any star at all to a fake item but based on your review system we must enter a least one.(Hello again Amazon have you thought about changing this?)     It is close in appearance, but the smell and texture are not the same; the shape and the colour of the bottle differs as does  the label - front and back. Counterfeiting is such a financial and creative &#x60;slap in the face&#x27; not to mention the pocket for the originator.  It is perhaps best to buy from a salon as you can examine more closely; buying on-line you can&#x27;t tell if the item is fake. I now realise also that Moroccanoil is often counterfeited.    Perhaps I should have realised that the price was too good to be true. I hope there is nothing unsafe/unhealthy in this counterfeit treatment.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount and this calms the frizz and makes my hair manageable.  I really like this product and intend to always keep it on hand.  This two pack was a great way to go.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair... and this makes it feel like silk. LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I had searched beauty salons and the internet previously for this product with no luck. The price was always the same, it&#x27;s not cheap.  I decided to try again and was amazed at the price and ease of delivery.  This is a great product for all types of hair.  My good friend who is also my hair stylist recommended Moroccan oil.  We both use it, she has thick course hair and mine is fine and blonde.</li>
            <li> I love this product. You use only a small amount and it makes your hair soft and shiney without making your hair oily.  I have recommended this product to many of my friends and hairdressers who also are amazed at the results.</li>
            <li> This product does not make your hair look or feel greasy, but makes it shiny and smooth.  It also smells great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I color my hair on a regular basis and this tends to make my hair course.  But Moroccian oil reverses all that damage.  I apply a small amount in the palm of my hand and work it through my wet hair.  I blow dry and my hair feels soft and smooth again.  It also smells great.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE! I am 7 months pregnant and would like to know what I actually put on my hair. I have contacted the seller about this issue and am expecting a refund. The product that I received is fake. The smell is noticeably off. There is no registration mark on the packaging or bottle. The font and color, text on the bottle is different. The cap is different from a salon purchased bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller of this has requested that I \\&quot;please remove this feedback so we can finish this transaction in normal way\\&quot; and that \\&quot;this feedback was not nesesery. please remove. so we can resolve this like normal people\\&quot;, but I believe anyone who sells on Amazon is responsible for the product that they sell and this product is fake. In addition, they had other reviews of singular sold 3.4 ounce bottles of Moroccan Oil stating that there was either something wrong with it or it was fake. These reviews are now gone and the same products have been re-listed without reviews. I only assume this will happen with this product as well and am contacting Amazon again about this seller as well as Moroccan Oil. For people leaving reviews of this product as a positive, maybe their bottles were legitimate. Maybe they have not purchased this from a salon to know differently. It doesn&#x27;t matter. The product that I received is counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real product is the most wonderful thing ever and I have been using it for almost 2 years. I am very upset to see fake bottles being sold and hope that Amazon recognizes this as a problem as I have now seen that I am not the only one who has bought and noticed that there are fake Moroccan Oil products being sold on Amazon through 3rd party sellers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman of African descent.  My hairstylist gave me a bit of the Moroccan Oil Treatment to use because I have very dry hair.  After just one use I was impressed.  It kept my hair moisturized (not oily),silky with a healthy glow--not to mention it also smells great. It did the same for my four year old grandaughter who also has very dry hair. A little on the pricey side but worth it.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil is the best ever product, none greasy on hair gives brillant shine, smells good, only need to use small amount so will last a long time, the only down side is that its what I call expensive but if a product is good then its worth paying for. Would most definately use again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I use it after washing my hair still still wet.  It smells really good.  I use about a nickel size amount.  This product allows my hair to stay healthy, soft and shiny even though I have it highlighted every six weeks and straighten it every day.  My hair is healthier now than it has ever been.  My hair stylist is constantly amazed that my hair is so strong ans durable.  I never have split ends or breakage.  I also use the Moroccanoil Gold Glimmer Shine Spray.  Remember that a little goes a long way and depending on your hair lenght, you will only need to use the amount the size of a dime to quarter.  Using too much will leave your hair oily.  A 3.4 oz. bottle lasts around 3 months for me.</li>
            <li> This is not the same Moroccan Oil I purchased at the salon. The real Moroccan Oil has a faint nutty smell, the one I purchased from this vendor has a strong perfume smell. It&#x27;s very different. I&#x27;m upset that I purchased this, but I guess I should have known that buying something much cheaper than the original would be a fake. Can we report that this is a fake though?</li>
            <li> Morrocan oil is great for my curly hair.  It controls frizz and leaves my hair shiny and natural.  My husband uses it too.  It smells good too! A great price for the 2 bottles!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair which is highlighted and straight. My hairdresser used this on my hair once and I loved the smell and feel.  I would never have tried it myself because I would have been sure that it would have made it greasy.  I bought it myself after that and have been addicted for the last year and a half, and am only on my third bottle.  After I shampoo my hair every other day, and it is towel dry, I put about about a dime sized (or a little more) in my palm and rub it through all of my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t sound like that would be enough to make a difference, but over time I could not believe the change in the feel of my hair.  Even my hairdresser was amazed how healthy it is for such long hair.  I also recently got the shimmer spray and I love that as well. My hair has always been in fairly good shape, but never this great.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I emailed the company when my order didn&#x27;t arrive 4 days after the expected date.  Got the following reply.  \\&quot;I just got to your other email. Very sorry for the delay in response.  I will be reshipping your order ASAP.\\&quot;  Um, how about you just send my order and give me a tracking number?      So when I emailed the following day and told them I needed a tracking number - I got no reply.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if the price is good if they take your money and don&#x27;t send the product. I ordered two weeks ago and it still hasn&#x27;t even been sent. What a pain - if they don&#x27;t&#x27; refund my money tomorrow, I&#x27;ll have make a complaint with Amazon.    _____________________________    Note on the aftermath:  They did refund my order and did state that they understood why I would be frustrated with their service.    SMW</li>
            <li> Takes a while to figure out how much to use so that it will work yet not make your hair oily. I have a lot of hair that is hard to control, and this works great at keeping my hair shiny - even when I abuse my hair with a blow-dryer and iron. It also has a pleasant smell. This is not the mask, which is what I thought I had ordered.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 6 months. It is good, smells good and makes my hair smoothie, I am just giving it 4 stars because I think it is really expensive and not that magic.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used Moroccan Oil on my hair the last time I visited her.  I was skeptical because my hair is fine and oil is the enemy.  But it really gave my hair nice body and texture.  It doesn&#x27;t really seem like oil.  A little bit is all I use, but the condition of my hair has improved noticeably and I don&#x27;t have the flyaways that I usually get in the 100% humidity of Atlanta June weather.  Love it!</li>
            <li> i found moroccan oil at my salon - this two pack is an amazing value!!</li>
