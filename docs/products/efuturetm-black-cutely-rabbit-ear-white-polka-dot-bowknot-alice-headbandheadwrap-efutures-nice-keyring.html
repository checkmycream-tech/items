            <li>overall really cute</li>
            <li>It is very simple as exspected, I purchased this for my grand daughters</li>
            <li>At first, both \\&quot;ears\\&quot; were not the same size, but this can be easily changed for it is an adjustable knot that slides wherever you want it on thee headband.</li>

            <li> It is hard to tell when you buy the cheaper accessories online here, but this one was a success.  </li>
            <li> There are also wires in the ears so you can stand them up or wear them flat.</li>
            <li> Earlier then expected though.</li>
            <li> kind of disappointed..</li>
            <li> The ears are bigger than I thought they would be, so I like to fold each ear in half to make it look like a bow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item arrived a lot faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived just as expected.</li>
            <li> The rabbit ears are adjustable and has a bendable metal under it to move them up down or to the side.</li>
            <li> The ears can stand up like a bunny or lay down as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> but my little girl loves it.</li>
            <li> they also have a little wire in the bow</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> but the thing is it&#x27;s kinda small</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a tad but small for my head.</li>
            <li> and this headband should be for small girls like toddlers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s durable and goes with most of my boring outfits.</li>
            <li> band itself is a bit small at the ends.</li>
            <li> The head band is made of a hard plastic that is covered with a silky cottony material.</li>
            <li> I mean I guess you pay for</li>
            <li> Awkward looking bow.</li>
            <li> horrible buy, came in the mail in two pieces.</li>

            <li> Super cute, looks just like the picture. Item takes a while to arrive. I like how it has a &amp;#34;housewife doing chores&amp;#34; feel to it... if that makes sense :/ I would recommend if you don&#x27;t mind a wait.</li>
            <li> I was looking for some super cheap gifts for friends and these worked great! There is a wire inside the bow so you can stand them up like bunny ears.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and looks like the picture. There is wire in the bow so you can shape it different ways.</li>
            <li> my daughters one 17 and the other 5 absolutely loved these headbands&lt;br /&gt;they were what was expected and fit perfectly</li>
            <li> Has become my favorite hair box. I like the fit and I plan on ordering more. I do recommend this style to anyone wanting a head band</li>
            <li> I love this headband! It is adorable and the bow can slide to either side. HOWEVER, after the 3rd wear the fabric at the end tore. I&#x27;m so upset and because of international shipping it would cost a fortune to replace. I am really upset that this wasn&#x27;t more durable.</li>
            <li> I like this headband a lot. My daughter will grow into it. It&#x27;s a bit big now, but for the very cheap price, it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Its wonderful cute, and it came the time it said it would Great buy, for so cheap, defiantly worth it!</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fully fit my head but is still cute.  Definitely would buy it again , great price also :)</li>
            <li> I am from Baltimore, Maryland. I ordered the item on December 21, 2013, and received the item on January 13, 2014. Very fast shipping for an item from China! It came before the estimate shipping date. The head band is made of a hard plastic that is covered with a silky cottony material. The rabbit ears are adjustable and has a bendable metal under it to move them up down or to the side. I&#x27;m expecting to receive two more of these headbands in the mail. The item is a great price. Only 69 cents! And fits my head perfectly. The headbands are reccommended for people with a smaller head size. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Feels kind of cheap. Got what I paid for. The bow is removable so it could just be a headband if you wished. I would not buy this again. receieved promptly however and did get again, what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Cute headband. Awkward looking bow. The good thing is that it is removable so I did just that to be able to wear it.</li>
            <li> Hi I&#x27;m a 12 year old girl and this headband should be for small girls like toddlers and then there&#x27;s a wire which I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s for and the as soon as I picked up the headband and tried it on the bow fell I mean I guess you pay for plus there are no instructions about the wire so some people may throw it out</li>
            <li> It is the best headband i have! It&#x27;s durable and goes with most of my boring outfits. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> this item (i thought) was intended for an adult to wear. when i received it..it is really only big enough for my 3 year old to wear..kind of disappointed..but my little girl loves it. thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute! Love that I got it for cheap. A nice headband and the bow makes it even better. I&#x27;m excited to wear it.</li>
            <li> I just recently received this order. Happy with headbands. The picture is accurate they are very cute I would order again</li>
            <li> i was expecting to break traveling so far but i didn&#x27;t think of that till after i placed the order Dx good news! it didn&#x27;t break and its exactly like the picture :) plus you can move the bow around to where ever you want it :DD they also have a little wire in the bow so you can bend it how you want (mostly just to keep it straight though)</li>
            <li> horrible buy, came in the mail in two pieces. would not in any way recommend. waste of money.</li>
            <li> As with my other review of a similar band this one is cute and functional but does take awhile to ship and arrive.</li>
            <li> This headband is so adorable. The ears can stand up like a bunny or lay down as shown in the picture. There is a pad under the band so your hair will not get stuck in it. Great and price too!</li>
            <li> This item arrived a lot faster than I expected. The headband fit perfectly on my head and the bow has a wire in it which allows you to shape it. Love that little extra touch!</li>
            <li> Super cute...20 days to get here....Earlier then expected though. I like how you can turn the bow into bunny ears!!!</li>
            <li> Ok.  Thought would be cute. Arrived in pieces.  Fixed and now wearable.  It&#x27;s ok product for price.  Unsure if purchase again.</li>
            <li> It was ok. I guess in actuality it&#x27;s a get what you pay for situation. It&#x27;s not a bad headband, just not something I would like. Very skinny and the bow does not look like a bow should.</li>
            <li> It is very simple as exspected, I purchased this for my grand daughters and it&#x27;s adorable. We like it. :)</li>
            <li> I love everything about this headband, it&#x27;s a cute black color and you can make it go high or low! So cute and goes well with a spring outfit.</li>
            <li> Super adorable and it ddoesn&#x27;t hurt your head by squeezing at all~ I wear it every chance I can get!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> It is hard to tell when you buy the cheaper accessories online here, but this one was a success.  The headband looks just as nice in person as in the picture. It&#x27;s a good fit for my head, and looks very cute.  A good purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for kids, not for adults.</li>
            <li> Arrived just as expected. At first, both \\&quot;ears\\&quot; were not the same size, but this can be easily changed for it is an adjustable knot that slides wherever you want it on thee headband. There are also wires in the ears so you can stand them up or wear them flat. The ears are bigger than I thought they would be, so I like to fold each ear in half to make it look like a bow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band itself is a bit small at the ends. Kind of pokes my head. But for ~$1.50, I like it a lot! Also, it arrived MUCH sooner than the estimated delivery date, which is really nice.</li>
            <li> Too short and too soft but looks beautiful</li>
            <li> For. $1 you can&#x27;t beat this. Had it for almost a year now. Hasn&#x27;t broke yet, and I break a lot of headbands</li>
            <li> Great for my babygirl!</li>
