            <li>I have tried many oil blotting papers and for the price, these are great!  </li>
            <li>The blotting paper absorbed the oil flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>I am very glad I purchased two orders of this product.</li>
            <li>Great my wife love</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I still suffer from oily skin and haven&#x27;t found a good solution besides what sheets provide which is maybe 2 hours of worry free shine.</li>
            <li>Also, they are by far the best deal on the market.</li>
            <li>I love the pricey ones, but can&#x27;t justify the price.  </li>
            <li>Will probably buy more.</li>
            <li>These are the best quality and cheapest (!)</li>
            <li>These blotting sheets really work over makeup and a true great value :)</li>
            <li>I like these paper blotting sheets much better than the \\&quot;clean and clear\\&quot; vinyl-feeling ones.</li>
            <li>As one reviewer mentions, they do tear easily.</li>
            <li>I normally use Clean &amp; Clear oil blotting sheets, but I thought I&#x27;d try this brand since 100 sheets for the price seemed like a great value.</li>
            <li>Love this product so much.</li>
            <li>Blotting Paper - 100 Sheets - Ultra-fine, Handmade Japanese Paper Is Silky-soft to the Touch and Instantly Absorbs Excess Oil]]      Excellent for when your skin presents excess of fat ..</li>
            <li>The paper is transparent so you can see how much oil is soaked up and comes in a very handy&amp; secure packaging you can put anywhere, plus this is cheap compared to the other brands!</li>
            <li>there many other products like this in the market that are better, it just works fine.  </li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with these, the material is really soft and the price is great, I would definitely recommend these to anyone who has a problem with oily skin, and certainly will be buying them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin get&#x27;s very oily from my makeup and oily throughout the day at school, and when I used just one of these sheets it easily picks up all the oil and my face feels fresh again.</li>
            <li>the paper is quite sturdy... not like rubber aka clean and clear but strong paper nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>I grab just one of these and it removes all the extra oils on my face and appears more clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and after a couple of hours from applying my make up I get a shinny face; using these blotting papers removes the excess oil without removing my make up, and makes my face look fresh!</li>
            <li>I used the blotting papers this morning for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Having an oily face as many people know is quite unnerving and makes you constantly worry about how shiny your face is.</li>
            <li>In my quest for better products I found Up and Up sheets at Target which are $4.04 which do the same thing these do</li>
            <li>Good product, mops up excess oil with a few sheets.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: Long overdue, however, this update is meant to better inform those seeking relief from oily skin.</li>
            <li>The blotting papers come in a handy little case which protects them from getting scrunched up or basically destroyed in my purse.</li>
            <li>Boy, did I succeed: I got a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; item: these tissue papers are easily torn, difficult to use effectively, and don&#x27;t absorb nearly as much oil as Clean &amp; Clear.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I purchased the Noevir Blotting Paper</li>
            <li>papers\\&quot; -- you press them gently on your face.</li>
            <li>This blotting paper didn&#x27;t really meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>this is very helpful if u have shiny or oily skin</li>
            <li>Not for very oily skin</li>
            <li>Additionally, this vendor is reliable and fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>the J&amp;J product does not tear (at all) and resists wadding much,</li>
            <li>much</li>
            <li>These do well, but you get more value from the synthetic ones and the pack lasts longer even though it has less.</li>
            <li>The only drawback I can find with the Up and Up sheets is that they are a synthetic sheet meaning flushing them down the toilet such as I used to do with these sheets isn&#x27;t the best option, and they are also not biodegradable to my knowledge.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than the clean and clear ones and larger.  </li>
            <li>They did remove oil, but I had to use twice as many sheets as usual (and the sheets are even much larger than the Clean &amp; Clear).</li>
            <li>I had tried the Johnson &amp; Johnson \\&quot;Clean &amp; Clear\\&quot; pads, but they were much more expensive</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>but in far fewer sheets.</li>
            <li>I will pay the extra to get the real thing, and this is NOT IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess if you only have a tiny bit of shine, they&#x27;d work for you, but I&#x27;m pretty oily, so these just don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>I have an oily t-zone, especially around my forehead, and it takes about 2-3 papers to completely absorb all the oil on my face.</li>

            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I purchased the Noevir Blotting Paper and I was pleasantly surprised.

Usually, one paper is enough to absorb all the oil on my t-zone. The protective case and quality of the blotting papers make this product a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have tried many oil blotting papers and for the price, these are great!  I love the pricey ones, but can&#x27;t justify the price.  Since The Body Shop quit selling their powered ones, I decided to try these and they are great!  I have no problem with them being too thin.  As another reviewer said, \\&quot;they are blotting papers\\&quot; -- you press them gently on your face.</li>
            <li> great product, ive used it and am happy.  Cheaper than the clean and clear ones and larger.  Not sure how the person ripped theirs... the paper is quite sturdy... not like rubber aka clean and clear but strong paper nonetheless.  The consistency reminds me of wax paper.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy probably.</li>
            <li> I like these paper blotting sheets much better than the \\&quot;clean and clear\\&quot; vinyl-feeling ones. These work just as well, if not better, for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> These papers are the perfect size.  The package fits nicely in my purse and they work great!</li>
            <li> The other reviewer who said it wads up and tears when they wipe-- it&#x27;s called blotting paper for a reason.  When you wipe, you disturb your makeup.  Good product, mops up excess oil with a few sheets.</li>
            <li> I normally use Clean &amp; Clear oil blotting sheets, but I thought I&#x27;d try this brand since 100 sheets for the price seemed like a great value. This blotting paper didn&#x27;t really meet my expectations. They&#x27;re basically just extremely thin pieces of tissue paper, oddly similar to the toilet seat protectors in public restrooms, haha.

            <li> I used the blotting papers this morning for the first time.  If only I could connect a pump to my oily complexion, I could retire. That&#x27;s the intensity of the oil problem I have. The blotting paper absorbed the oil flawlessly.  Not even a molecule of foundation appeared disturbed. I am very glad I purchased two orders of this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have very oily skin and after a couple of hours from applying my make up I get a shinny face; using these blotting papers removes the excess oil without removing my make up, and makes my face look fresh! I keep one in the car, in my purse..everywhere.</li>
            <li> this is very helpful if u have shiny or oily skin but u end up using about 5-7 a day if your face constantly gets back oily</li>
            <li> These are the best blotting papers. I  am a makeup artist and give them to my bridal clients after I finish doing their makeup on their wedding day. They don&#x27;t have any powder on them- the paper itself takes away the shine without messing up the makeup and you don&#x27;t have to worry about adding layers of powder every time you need to get rid of the shine.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much. My skin get&#x27;s very oily from my makeup and oily throughout the day at school, and when I used just one of these sheets it easily picks up all the oil and my face feels fresh again. I will definately buy again!</li>

            <li> Not quite what I expected to receive. Different than the ones I purchased in Tokyo but I&#x27;m getting used to them. Will probably buy more.</li>
            <li> These are the best quality and cheapest (!) oil blotting sheets I&#x27;ve found.  Definitely worth it.  I won&#x27;t use anything else again.</li>
            <li> Great my wife love it is a repeated item for us</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and looked forward eagerly to its arrival.  I had tried the Johnson &amp; Johnson \\&quot;Clean &amp; Clear\\&quot; pads, but they were much more expensive and I wanted a cheaper alternative.  Boy, did I succeed: I got a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; item: these tissue papers are easily torn, difficult to use effectively, and don&#x27;t absorb nearly as much oil as Clean &amp; Clear.  I will never purchase this item again.  I will pay the extra to get the real thing, and this is NOT IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another complaint: this paper tends to wad up and crease (and then tear) when wiping it over your skin-- the J&amp;J product does not tear (at all) and resists wadding much, much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used oil blotting paper before, you will be impressed with this product.  If you&#x27;ve ever used any other blotting paper, you are going to be VERY disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> Great price! These blotting sheets really work over makeup and a true great value :)</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter recommened this to me.  When she would see me at lunch she would comment on how shiny my face was.  I grab just one of these and it removes all the extra oils on my face and appears more clean and fresh.  A definate recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!  Wish the papers were a bit thicker though.  Doesn&#x27;t remove or smudge make-up!  I will definitely purchase again, and yes recommend the product!!</li>
