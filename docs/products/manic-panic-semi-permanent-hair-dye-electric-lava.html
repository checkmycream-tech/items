            <li>I love it!!!</li>
            <li>Great hair dye.  </li>
            <li>Great color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dude and slapped this stuff on my wife&#x27;s head, It came out looking great.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply!</li>
            <li>On the bright side, my hair is not damaged at all, and my paler roots and darker ends dyed in a way that made them look even.</li>
            <li>Loved the color</li>
            <li>I loved the color.</li>
            <li>I love the color and it stays bright through 3 or 4 shampoos!</li>
            <li>and I gotta say, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Love manic panic!</li>
            <li>It fades to a nice coppery-red color.</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>If you want a super bright and lovely shade of Orange I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves all the manic panics and loves to mix them too when she feels like it to great effect very vibrant colors and cheaper then beauty supply shops excluding the shipping of course</li>
            <li>I love this dye.</li>
            <li>I would say three shampoos at most</li>
            <li>I love this shade and the brightness of it.</li>
            <li>This looks more like the results you&#x27;d expect from \\&quot;vampire red\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;electric</li>
            <li>I love the versatility of this product.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Manic Panic for 20 years and will continue to order more colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really great product as far as Manic Panic goes.</li>
            <li>This was easy to apply and did not stain my daughters lighter colored hair.</li>
            <li>it damages easily and some of the color seems to fade with damage or exposure to sunlight.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s perfectly fine to leave it on for hours.</li>
            <li>May be fine in winter though.</li>
            <li>i loved this color, my hair was a light brown, and it turned a nice red, and my blonde highlights looked amazing!</li>
            <li>I was expecting a bright orange, but this dye is more of an orange-based red.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will fade nicely with shampooings and look a bit more natural.</li>
            <li>My hair actually turned out great despite the misinformation about the color.</li>
            <li>Washes out and is easy to clean out of towels.  </li>
            <li>Fun for the kids!</li>
            <li>My hair stayed bright red for several weeks, and eventually faded to the bright orange that is advertised for this dye.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better Manic Panic colors IMO, some of them don&#x27;t like to stay in my hair very well.</li>
            <li>The on l y downfall is it fades super quick.</li>
            <li>This is the most vibrant dye I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It looks a lot more red in the jar, but it you wanted an orange red this is definitely good.</li>
            <li>coverage wise (including bleeding when wet)</li>
            <li>It was great the first day and a half.</li>
            <li>Good color, last decently, doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, no damage to the product, and it was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>This color is a super vibrant orange.</li>
            <li>but it was a bit more red than orange (which I was going for).  </li>
            <li>More of medium red that fades to an orangey-pink.  </li>
            <li>So pretty meh in all.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bleach it, but I didn&#x27;t want to look like a comic book character.</li>
            <li>I, however, have really enjoyed using it in the shower to perk up auburn hair between regular dyes.</li>
            <li>True bright color and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I was pretty upset at first.</li>
            <li>It was more red than orange and is not the color it looks like on the advertisement</li>
            <li>Color wise it feels like a waste of money,</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the service.</li>
            <li>I was really expecting an orange dye.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s better than expected.  </li>
            <li>My result was a bright red, with a slightly safety-orange tint to it.</li>
            <li>Dyed over a very light apricot blonde color from my last faded orange.</li>
            <li>I must warn people using manic panic, it doesn&#x27;t last very long, but its great for color without long term commitment.</li>
            <li>The color is definitely more red than orange but vibrant all the same!</li>
            <li>I love the way it turned out and always would pick an orange red over a purple red any day.</li>
            <li>I like that the formula contains more natural ingredients and isn&#x27;t super-damaging- it even contains Cetearyl Alcohol, which is an active ingredient in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is much better than Splat, which is actually fabric dye and will dry out and harm your hair.  </li>
            <li>next day, it was the exact color TM uses for the run.</li>
            <li>but it actually showed up early!!!!</li>
            <li>I had to see a professional</li>
            <li>I also left the dye in for much longer than the recommended time.</li>
            <li>but it is actually a very orange based flame red.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural redhead-</li>
            <li>, I had every intention of shaving off the mohawk because the following Monday real life kicked in</li>
            <li>Just be aware that it will dye EVERYTHING in your bathroom red if  you&#x27;re not careful with minute-by-minute cleanup of any specks on the walls or curtains.</li>
            <li>Would have gotten nearly the exact same color by using their Rock-n-Roll red (which I already have a jar of).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably not \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; enough that I&#x27;ll be in trouble with the strict corporation I work with, but think something like really cheap red hair dye.</li>
            <li>Mixed it with just a little bit of another MP in &amp;#34;Pillarbox Red&amp;#34; for some pink-ness - I was initially thinking this would be a rich orange (electric lava)</li>
            <li>Expected a TRUE orange after looking at other users pictures...</li>
            <li>The red came out nicely, though and was very dark for several days then started to fade out into a dull orange red.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The only problem was that it ran every time my hair for wet, alot.</li>
            <li> long shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Orange-ish red, but red none the less.</li>
            <li> Next time I will use Manic Panic&#x27;s other orange.</li>
            <li> However, I received a bottle of dark red dye, but it was still labeled as Electric Lava.</li>
            <li> My hair came out a dark red.</li>
            <li> BUT, when loose hair comes out and lands on the bathroom sink or the side of the bathtub, and that loose hair gets wet, the dye runs and stains the counter</li>
            <li> didnt work at all ;-; barley turned my hair pink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used henna a few times to intensify the color, but I dislike having to do root touchups and the only way to get henna out of your hair is to cut it</li>
            <li> It may be partially that my damaged hair took on a lot of the stain, but my hair is now sort of the color</li>
            <li> I expected a bottle of orange dye.</li>
            <li> and it took way longer than i expected to fade!</li>
            <li> The pictures of this product were extremely misleading.</li>
            <li> The color of the dye in the image and the color of the actual product are completely different, I recently used it and it turned my hair fire engine red, which did not look too bad, but was absolutely not the color I was going for.</li>
            <li> i think it was a imitation manic panic since ive never had this problem before</li>
            <li> my hair is approximately the orangish red equivalent of a dishwater blonde-</li>
            <li> We may try some other colors as well!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried</li>
            <li> : I am a little upset.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it would run when I sweat, but negative.&lt;br /&gt;Still a little upset about the bathroom sink tho...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve scrubbed with paper towel and soapy water and it got the harsh orange out.</li>
            <li> I wanted a semi-permanent formula that would approximate henna- adding a red orange stain to my hair.</li>
            <li> I even still have half a jar that I can use to re-dye my hair when it fades!</li>
            <li> It grabbed into my hair and is holding tight!</li>
            <li> and I had to put my suit back on, so the color degradation didn&#x27;t matter, but the color bled off BAD with each consecutive shower, especially with shampoo.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Not in my hair, at least.  </li>
            <li> Not thrilled.</li>
            <li> The goal was to turn my mohawk orange for a Tough Mudder I was running.</li>
            <li> I know some people use it for dramatic results over bleached hair.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with beyond the one outrageous orange and manic panic electric banana to achieve my desired color.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this dye. Good color, last decently, doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair. I always use manic panic on my hair and I ALWAYS get compliments</li>
            <li> Do not use unless you want orange hair indefinitely.  I had to see a professional and it is STILL orange.  Will not use again.</li>
            <li> This is freakin RED. Orange-ish red, but red none the less. Doesn&#x27;t look like photo either. There is a website that has photos of people who used this color and their hair looks orange. I hope to dear god this fades!!!!! Totally ruined what I was trying to do with my hair. Next time I will use Manic Panic&#x27;s other orange.</li>
            <li> Fun for the kids! This was easy to apply and did not stain my daughters lighter colored hair. We may try some other colors as well!</li>
            <li> This did not come as pictured and I explained. They refunded me but I dont suggest anyone buy this color of manic panic ever online as you can not garuntee it will arrive as you think.</li>
            <li> This dye was labeled as electric lava but looked like pillarbox red. DO NOT buy it. I wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> didnt work at all ;-; barley turned my hair pink i think it was a imitation manic panic since ive never had this problem before</li>
            <li> When I got this in the mail it looked red. I was a little worried but oh well.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was bleached blonde (REALLY blonde) and after applying this, my hair turned a deep orange and I gotta say, I LOVE IT! I even still have half a jar that I can use to re-dye my hair when it fades! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I am a little upset. I haven&#x27;t had any \\&quot;running\\&quot; like a lot of people say. BUT, when loose hair comes out and lands on the bathroom sink or the side of the bathtub, and that loose hair gets wet, the dye runs and stains the counter :/ I&#x27;ve scrubbed with paper towel and soapy water and it got the harsh orange out. But if you look close you can still see orange squiggly lines where the strand of hair once was.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I have no problem with this product. I thought maybe it would run when I sweat, but negative.&lt;br /&gt;Still a little upset about the bathroom sink tho... I am now debating on whether I will want to re-dye it once it fades or if I should just forget about it......</li>
            <li> The color is definitely more red than orange but vibrant all the same! I love it!!! I mixed it with beyond the one outrageous orange and manic panic electric banana to achieve my desired color. I received an email from Amazon stating that it wouldn&#x27;t be arriving as scheduled with my 2 day shipping request but it actually showed up early!!!! Will definitely buy again!!!!</li>
            <li> my dye showed up a lot earlier than it said it was going to be delivered. I can not wait to get my extensions so that way I can start dying them with this color!</li>
            <li> i loved this color, my hair was a light brown, and it turned a nice red, and my blonde highlights looked amazing! and it took way longer than i expected to fade! love it!</li>
            <li> It looks a lot more red in the jar, but it you wanted an orange red this is definitely good. Think rainbow dash red you&#x27;ve got a winner. The on l y downfall is it fades super quick. I would say three shampoos at most and it&#x27;s already orange. It was great the first day and a half. Then you wash your hair and it gets dramatically less vibrant.</li>
            <li> This is the most vibrant dye I have ever used. My result was a bright red, with a slightly safety-orange tint to it. I started with hair that had been bleached and toned several times, almost platinum blonde. I also left the dye in for much longer than the recommended time. Since Manic Panic is not harsh--and actually conditions your hair while it sits--it&#x27;s perfectly fine to leave it on for hours. I believe I let this sit for about two hours. My hair stayed bright red for several weeks, and eventually faded to the bright orange that is advertised for this dye.</li>
            <li> This color is a super vibrant orange. It grabbed into my hair and is holding tight! This is one of the better Manic Panic colors IMO, some of them don&#x27;t like to stay in my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I love this shade and the brightness of it. It&#x27;s a really great product as far as Manic Panic goes.</li>
            <li> Loved the color but it was a bit more red than orange (which I was going for).  BUT, the color ran for me.  Even after 5-7 shampooings, if I perspired (and it is summer folks) the collars of my shirts turned red and there were drips of stain on my shirts.  May be fine in winter though.</li>
            <li> The pictures of this product were extremely misleading. I was expecting a bright orange, but this dye is more of an orange-based red. My hair actually turned out great despite the misinformation about the color. I&#x27;ve had the dye in for around three months, retouching it once. It fades to a nice coppery-red color.</li>
            <li> Great hair dye.  Washes out and is easy to clean out of towels.  This is much better than Splat, which is actually fabric dye and will dry out and harm your hair.  I love the color and it stays bright through 3 or 4 shampoos!</li>
            <li> Great color. Mixed it with just a little bit of another MP in &amp;#34;Pillarbox Red&amp;#34; for some pink-ness - I was initially thinking this would be a rich orange (electric lava) but it is actually a very orange based flame red. Dyed over a very light apricot blonde color from my last faded orange. I love the way it turned out and always would pick an orange red over a purple red any day. Hope this helps in your decision making!</li>
            <li> I was really expecting an orange dye.  It&#x27;s not orange.  Not in my hair, at least.  More of medium red that fades to an orangey-pink.  Would have gotten nearly the exact same color by using their Rock-n-Roll red (which I already have a jar of).  Color wise it feels like a waste of money, coverage wise (including bleeding when wet) I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s better than expected.  So pretty meh in all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural redhead- my hair is approximately the orangish red equivalent of a dishwater blonde- it damages easily and some of the color seems to fade with damage or exposure to sunlight. I&#x27;ve used henna a few times to intensify the color, but I dislike having to do root touchups and the only way to get henna out of your hair is to cut it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wanted a semi-permanent formula that would approximate henna- adding a red orange stain to my hair. I didn&#x27;t bleach it, but I didn&#x27;t want to look like a comic book character. I like that the formula contains more natural ingredients and isn&#x27;t super-damaging- it even contains Cetearyl Alcohol, which is an active ingredient in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied about 1/4 of the container mixed with Shea Moisture&#x27;s conditioner to my hair (it&#x27;s between bsl and waist length) and left it in about 20 minutes before rinsing. It may be partially that my damaged hair took on a lot of the stain, but my hair is now sort of the color you&#x27;d get if you applied henna to someone&#x27;s hair if it was medium brown- a ginger tea color that reminds me of a cross between Jessica Rabbit and Felicia Day. It&#x27;s probably not \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; enough that I&#x27;ll be in trouble with the strict corporation I work with, but think something like really cheap red hair dye. Hopefully it will fade nicely with shampooings and look a bit more natural. This looks more like the results you&#x27;d expect from \\&quot;vampire red\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;electric lava.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think next time I&#x27;ll try Nalpalm Orange. On the bright side, my hair is not damaged at all, and my paler roots and darker ends dyed in a way that made them look even. Also, my hair feels similar to when it&#x27;s been given a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves all the manic panics and loves to mix them too when she feels like it to great effect very vibrant colors and cheaper then beauty supply shops excluding the shipping of course</li>
            <li> I love the versatility of this product. I know some people use it for dramatic results over bleached hair. I, however, have really enjoyed using it in the shower to perk up auburn hair between regular dyes. Just be aware that it will dye EVERYTHING in your bathroom red if  you&#x27;re not careful with minute-by-minute cleanup of any specks on the walls or curtains.</li>
            <li> I loved the color. The only problem was that it ran every time my hair for wet, alot.</li>
            <li> Love manic panic! True bright color and long lasting. Great that leftover color can be used again! I have been a fan of Manic Panic for 20 years and will continue to order more colors. Easy to use!</li>
            <li> Expected a TRUE orange after looking at other users pictures... unfortunately this came out as more of a red. Not thrilled.</li>
            <li> I expected a bottle of orange dye. However, I received a bottle of dark red dye, but it was still labeled as Electric Lava. I shrugged it off and thought to myself that perhaps the dye just looked that way but that my hair would still be orange. WRONG. My hair came out a dark red. I was pretty upset at first. I didn&#x27;t wanna spend extra money just to have another red dye since I had one already in my cabinet. The red came out nicely, though and was very dark for several days then started to fade out into a dull orange red. I don&#x27;t regret buying this but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone if they wanted orange hair.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply! I&#x27;m a dude and slapped this stuff on my wife&#x27;s head, It came out looking great.</li>
            <li> This is my favourite manic panic colour. If you want a super bright and lovely shade of Orange I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was more red than orange and is not the color it looks like on the advertisement</li>
            <li> The goal was to turn my mohawk orange for a Tough Mudder I was running. I bleached it and applied the dye, and it was definitely a shade or three too red until I took a long shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, it was the exact color TM uses for the run. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I had every intention of shaving off the mohawk because the following Monday real life kicked in and I had to put my suit back on, so the color degradation didn&#x27;t matter, but the color bled off BAD with each consecutive shower, especially with shampoo. Just food for thought.</li>
            <li> Junk all the way around don&#x27;t be fooled this is very red very very red</li>
