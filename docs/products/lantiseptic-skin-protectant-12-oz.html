            <li> This cream completely cleared her skin and is helping to keep her dry.</li>
            <li> Very Denice so a bit difficult to apply at first.</li>
            <li> and she has never developed any type of skin irritation since that last time last year.</li>
            <li> My husband has had dry, sensitive skin for some time due  to some medications he takes.  </li>
            <li> I witnessed first-hand a diabetic&#x27;s foot being healed, after the doctors had given up all hope, simply by applying handfuls of lantiseptic to the foot and loosely bandaging it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommended it as a substitute for chamois creams for bike riders--too tacky for long rides.</li>
            <li> It was the only cream that would work on my child&#x27;s diaper rash when she was a baby (other than coconut oil).  </li>
            <li> the wound was completely dry and sealed.  </li>
            <li> Lantiseptic has 50 % lanoline and Lanoline is recommended for severe dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My mother is a stroke victim and sits all day.</li>
            <li> I remember I came across Lantiseptic Skin Protectant last year at the right time when my mother had developed a painful split on her skin between one of her thigh joints.  </li>
            <li> Pure Lanoline is very thick and is harder to apply so</li>
            <li> I was given this at MD Anderson Cancer Center after my colon removal resulted in diarrhea and skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> this brand is getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well for all rashes, excoriations, diaper rash, etc.</li>
            <li> I run 4 days a week, I have used half of the the 14.0OZ jar in 5 months.</li>
            <li> A little over a year after my surgery, I still have some problems now and then and keep this on hand.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily in the winter time on both my legs and hands to help prevent chapped/dry skin, which I have a problem iwth in cold and low humidity weather.</li>
            <li> I always order it for her every few months.</li>
            <li> Work it into the skin for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> Before Lantiseptic, we have used other skin protectants to treat instances of a bed sore or a rash that my mother, who is bedbound, has had, but the healing process had been too slow.  </li>
            <li> They all seem to heal in no more than two days.</li>
            <li> The diaper rash was completely gone in less than 24 hours, no matter how bad it was.</li>
            <li> Skin chafing is common among runners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a thick consistancy, slippery, but somewhat sticky when you apply it.</li>
            <li> She researched it and there is nothing in Lantiseptic that is bad for a baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> One of the side effects from her medicine is that her skin is cracking around her fingernails and it is painful.  </li>
            <li> The Lantiseptic has helped to heal her skin and close the painful cracks.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Having used lantiseptic in the past I already knew that it is a great product for any type of skin irrations and does an excellent job.  The merchant was excellent to deal with and shipped professionally and quickly. Also the price was excellent as well.</li>
            <li> This is the best diaper cream ever, I&#x27;ve used it for 4 years with both of my children, it works great!</li>
            <li> Very Denice so a bit difficult to apply at first. Body heat softens it quickly which makes it easier on tender skin.</li>
            <li> I swing a sledgehammer a lot for work, and use Lantiseptic to eliminate hot spots on my hands. Works great with leather gloves. Also comes in handy for eliminating chafing in &#x27;sensitive&#x27; areas on particularly hot and saucy days. Good stuff, worth having in a work truck. 1 14oz bottle should last you years for blister prevention on hands and feet.     It&#x27;s got a thick consistancy, slippery, but somewhat sticky when you apply it. Stays put and does it&#x27;s job well. Thicker and slicker than petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> It is the best skin protectant against bed sores ever!!!!!!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never know how pleased I was to find an old favorite product under a new name.......Lantiseptic! The old product was Corona - lanolin rich antiseptic with 50% lanolin the same ingredient as Lantiseptic. This ointment earns high marks for its performance in care of the skin from dry skin to Staph infection! I&#x27;ve used these ingredient In both products since 1958! After a futile search I called Summit Ind. &amp; learned where I could purchase Lantiseptic!  Your service was very professional &amp; timely!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mom whom we care for at home.  She absolutely needs a skin protectant and this is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Lantiseptic is a good, effective, inexpensive alternative product to use as a chamois cream when bicycling.&lt;br /&gt;Granted it will (via body heat) \\&quot;seep\\&quot; from bike shorts to the saddle of the bike. Of course, given those specific circumstances, the same would occur should you go directly from sitting on the bike to a auto seat or home furniture (chair, sofa, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;So for myself at least, I do place a towel on furniture, until I am able to shower the product off.</li>
            <li> This is a lanolin rich cream that appears thick and sticky but spreads evenly and easily on warm skin. Provides excellent protection from moisture.</li>
            <li> Great product for a senior citizen who needs some protection in private body areas.</li>
            <li> This cream works so well!!!!</li>
            <li> great protectant will get this again it helped a lot with the healing of a bed sore</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for use on skin that has been damaged from chemotherapy.  Better than other products we have tried!</li>
            <li> a good product for someone who has to sit in his chair all day. my husband has alzhemier and needed something that would protect him because he has very tender skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good protectant.  I don&#x27;t recommended it as a substitute for chamois creams for bike riders--too tacky for long rides.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the elderly, it really helps prevent bedsores and rashes.  I have been using it for years for both my mother and my father.</li>
            <li> Great Product , great presentation</li>
            <li> This product is used by my grandma. She loves it and will not use anything else. I always order it for her every few months.</li>
            <li> My husband has had dry, sensitive skin for some time due  to some medications he takes.  Lantiseptic has made him much more comfortable by relieving itching and scaling.</li>
            <li> Before Lantiseptic, we have used other skin protectants to treat instances of a bed sore or a rash that my mother, who is bedbound, has had, but the healing process had been too slow.  I remember I came across Lantiseptic Skin Protectant last year at the right time when my mother had developed a painful split on her skin between one of her thigh joints.  We applied the Lantiseptic one night and the very next morning the wound was completely dry and sealed.  It truly was like magic. Since that time, Lantiseptic is the very best and the one and only cream that we will ever use on my mom, We use it on her back and all around her diaper area and she has never developed any type of skin irritation since that last time last year. If you have a love one who is bed bound, please do use this cream. As far as protecting his or her skin, he or she will be happy you do, and so will you.  I have ordered it through Amazon from different vendors and it gets delivered the next day, even though I have chosen the free two-day shipping.</li>
            <li> I was given this at MD Anderson Cancer Center after my colon removal resulted in diarrhea and skin irritation.  Great barrier product and I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  A little over a year after my surgery, I still have some problems now and then and keep this on hand.  Can always rely on it, it works fast.  If irritation continues, use it over a couple of days and you&#x27;ll be find.  My daughter also uses it on my 9 month old grandson with great results.  She researched it and there is nothing in Lantiseptic that is bad for a baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful ointment for almost all cuts, abrasions, and burns on numerous minor lacerations. They all seem to heal in no more than two days.</li>
            <li> Have tried many different brands of skin protectants for various ailments: bed sores, bleeding hemorrhoids, baby diaper rash, etc.  This is the only product that was effective.  It protected the affected areas, giving them time to heal, and, more importantly, did not burn or hurt when applied. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The cure for skin ailments period.</li>
            <li> It worked amazing on disper rashes within 3 days rash went away only thing i would change is the scent!</li>
            <li> my doctor had recommended this protectant for a scaly skin problem on my legs, and it has really helped keep them clear.  I use it daily in the winter time on both my legs and hands to help prevent chapped/dry skin, which I have a problem iwth in cold and low humidity weather.</li>
            <li> Greatest stuff since canned beer</li>
            <li> Wears off fast and doesn&#x27;t do much for rashes. Smell is fine and easy to put on, but I noticed when I had to open the diaper back up right away that nothing was on the buttocks any longer. Perhaps it st still works from the diaper? IDK</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well for all rashes, excoriations, diaper rash, etc. As a nurse I&#x27;ve used this product on many clients and have always had great results. I would recommend this product to anyone,</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Using for my 4 month old on her diaper rash. The BEST barrier cream!</li>
            <li> l have used this for years.  i have Reynards in my hands and they freeze and get red.  using this cream fixes them right away.  highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Long-standing skin problems responded quickly to being treated with this &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; remedy, dryness disappeared, elasticity was restored and healing resulted.</li>
            <li> Very good for bed sores</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years to soothe chafing and sore hands.  For areas that are just beginning to get sore, this will stop the progression.  For already really sore areas, a few applications will make a big difference in the healing process.  Please note:  this is somewhat sticky when first applied.  Work it into the skin for a few seconds.  The stickiness WILL disappear, and within a short time your skin will feel smooth.  Remember, this is a protective barrier!</li>
            <li> My Mother is bedridden and had the beginning of a bed sore.  This cream completely cleared her skin and is helping to keep her dry.</li>
            <li> WOW! Does this stuff work amazingly! I&#x27;ve used it on both of my kids. With my first baby (now potty trained) I tried everything from Butt Paste to Desitin to everything in between. Then, luckily, a friend tipped me off on to this little gem. I threw everything else away! The diaper rash was completely gone in less than 24 hours, no matter how bad it was.</li>
            <li> Skin chafing is common among runners. Apply Lantistepic to the hot spot areas before your run and you will be amaze. Better than glide. Long lasting and a very therapeutic when you have skin chafing after a run in those areas you did not apply Lantistepic prior to your run. I run 4 days a week, I have used half of the the 14.0OZ jar in 5 months.</li>
            <li> This works better than butt paste, desitin, and any other diaper cream we&#x27;ve tried on our babies. All my kids have had sensitive skin and this heals up diaper rash within 1 day every time. I also live the flip lid. So easy to use!</li>
            <li> Great for skin irritation!!</li>
            <li> this was a wonderful product to purchase for  the required treatment of skin breakdown. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a skin protectant.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It was the only cream that would work on my child&#x27;s diaper rash when she was a baby (other than coconut oil).  It seemed to really cool her skin too and take away the burning for her.</li>
            <li> My mother is a stroke victim and sits all day. I use this cream on her upper thighs every morning after bathing. It keeps her skin nice and moist but not messy thus avoiding any type of sores. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> GOOD love it. Came fast, works good, look forward to ordering fom here again. Hope this helped you out. (:</li>
            <li> Motherinlaw felt that it helped chafing skin.</li>
            <li> I work at a nursing home, and I see Lantiseptic&#x27;s amazing healing ability every day. For any kind of skin breakdown, irritation, rash (except ones caused by fungal or yeast infections), cuts, etc, this stuff is amazing. I witnessed first-hand a diabetic&#x27;s foot being healed, after the doctors had given up all hope, simply by applying handfuls of lantiseptic to the foot and loosely bandaging it. For diaper rash, it is the #1 best ointment available, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin protectant that I know of for older adults. It really stays on and provides a good barrier against skin breakdown.</li>
            <li> this brand is getting harder to find. I have looked in Walgreen, CVS and Walmart with no sucess. This is a best product I have found, (in paste form) to protect from rash. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Use this item to prevent saddle sores in cycling!  It works great!</li>
            <li> For healing or preventing heel cracks and for winter protection of your hands nothing is better than Lantiseptic. Period. With 50% lanolin there is no need to feel sheepish about using it, so to speak.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a neighbor who is undergoing chemo treatments for cancer.  One of the side effects from her medicine is that her skin is cracking around her fingernails and it is painful.  The Lantiseptic has helped to heal her skin and close the painful cracks.  She applies it liberally each day and now it is preventing any more cracks from appearing. Lantiseptic has 50 % lanoline and Lanoline is recommended for severe dry skin.  Pure Lanoline is very thick and is harder to apply so the Lantiseptic works much better because it is creamier and easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Use on my father who is bed boound. Works excellently in caring for his skin and protecting it.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for those who deal with incontinence issues.</li>
