            <li>It&#x27;s best to not shower for a full 24 hours after applying so sleep on a towel and wear black!&lt;br /&gt;Slow</li>

            <li>I am fair skinned so the 1st bottle was amazing</li>

            <li>The thing I notice most is that it lasts for days before I need to reapply.</li>

            <li>It was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Not too strong either, just enough.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>

            <li>I have an olive complexion to begin with which is why it seemed light to me</li>

            <li>Spreads very easily, but also dries fast so be quick!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>The sweet smell eventually goes away and you do get a bit of that self tanner smell</li>
            <li>I had been using the St. Tropez whipped Bronze mousse for several years and decided to try the Norvell brand since I had heard good reviews about it.</li>
            <li>Since you can&#x27;t apply lotion for a full 24 hours after use, expect to be itchy.</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a mousse it takes a good while to completely dry.</li>
            <li>This goes on very smoothly and smells sweet unlike many other self tanners.</li>
            <li>Nothing gives me a fresh even tan like Norvell Self tanning mouse.&lt;br /&gt;Remember to wash hands after use.</li>
            <li>and I just started trying it out this year for the first time.</li>
            <li>It smells ALOT better than most tanning lotions and it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes as much as past tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>You will not find a better bronzer (especially for the price!).</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; produced is a natural tan color and the smell is pleasant - not at all like other tanning products.  </li>
            <li>but if you are very pale this would be a good color for you.</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I am always willing to give something new a try.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t gotten any, I have had some splotches where more was applied than other areas.&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li>I will begin seeing results in about an hour or two, with full results the next day.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>a huge improvement from other self tanning products I have used.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how light it was since I&#x27;m very used to having the dark guide color of the St.Moriz</li>
            <li>So if you have an hour or so and are comfortable walking around your house naked with your arms above your head</li>
            <li>, I have noticed a more fake smell with this new bottle too.</li>
            <li>This made application much easier than with other lotions or gels I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>so it was a little difficult to make sure it was going on right.</li>

            <li> Leaves a nice even color to your skin. I&#x27;m fair completed and I looked like I had been out in sun for several days. The secret is to exfoliate before using. The color will last a lot longer if you do. Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! Not good coverage or color!</li>
            <li> I usually use St.Moriz self tanning mousse but decided to try something different so I bought this. This goes on very smoothly and smells sweet unlike many other self tanners. Amber is a very good word to describe this color. I was surprised at how light it was since I&#x27;m very used to having the dark guide color of the St.Moriz so it was a little difficult to make sure it was going on right. I have an olive complexion to begin with which is why it seemed light to me but if you are very pale this would be a good color for you. The sweet smell eventually goes away and you do get a bit of that self tanner smell but it goes away quickly. I use two layers and it gives me a beautiful glowing tan and I have no streaks. Unfortunately it doesnt hold up too well in the shower and I would say about 60% washes off which was kind of disappointing but I would definitely repurchase this. I may choose a darker color next time though</li>
            <li> I was sent an expired bottle.  It was expiration date was only a few months back so I decided to try it. And it did not work--gave me no color at all. It was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Nothing gives me a fresh even tan like Norvell Self tanning mouse.&lt;br /&gt;Remember to wash hands after use.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> great color. no smell. no skin irritation - which i often get from self tanners</li>
            <li> I think the formula they use in this has changed, I had the same bottle before and my tan was coming out beautiful and even. This new bottle makes me streaky and uneven and way too fake looking. I am fair skinned so the 1st bottle was amazing, I have noticed a more fake smell with this new bottle too. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is one of the best sunless tanning items that I have ever used and I just started trying it out this year for the first time. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  No streaking.  Very easy to apply.  Beautiful, natural color.  I would highly recommend this product to any one who wants a great, easy tan.</li>
            <li> Loved this!! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Works great and smells good.</li>
            <li> Love it, love the price and have shared with friends</li>
            <li> perfect tint and easy to apply</li>
            <li> Smells funky &amp; drys your skin out 😔</li>
            <li> I had been using the St. Tropez whipped Bronze mousse for several years and decided to try the Norvell brand since I had heard good reviews about it. Love it! The thing I notice most is that it lasts for days before I need to reapply. You will need to exfoliate each time you re-apply but the color will last for 4-6 days. It smells ALOT better than most tanning lotions and it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes as much as past tanning lotions. I have fair skin and it gives a beautiful tan color without giving me a yellow-orangish color. I appyled it all over-even to my face-and it looked great! I just found that it made me break out a little on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a huge improvement from other self tanning products I have used. Recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> The best of all products!</li>
            <li> Since we are in the age of heightened skin CANCER awareness, I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re surfing reviews for self tanning lotions. After a good amount of online research I decided to give the Norvell Brand a try, since the spray tan salon I go to uses this brand. But hey.. If I can do it myself instead of spending $30 every two weeks just so I can stand naked in front of a stranger to get a spray tan, I&#x27;ll give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Pros of Norvell self tanning mousse:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a mousse. This made application much easier than with other lotions or gels I&#x27;ve tried. Spreads very easily, but also dries fast so be quick!&lt;br /&gt;Good final color. Final color doesn&#x27;t look fake. It does look natural, and best of all not ORANGE!&lt;br /&gt;Scent. This stuff has a nice scent. Flower-like. Not too strong either, just enough.&lt;br /&gt;Fast acting. I will begin seeing results in about an hour or two, with full results the next day.&lt;br /&gt;Cons of Norvell mousse:&lt;br /&gt;No color indicator. You won&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re going to end up with streaks until the next day. While I haven&#x27;t gotten any, I have had some splotches where more was applied than other areas.&lt;br /&gt;Skin drying. It does dry your skin. Since you can&#x27;t apply lotion for a full 24 hours after use, expect to be itchy. And expect to have to use extra moisturizer as long as you are using this.&lt;br /&gt;Fabric staining. This WILL stain clothes and sheets! It&#x27;s best to not shower for a full 24 hours after applying so sleep on a towel and wear black!&lt;br /&gt;Slow to completely dry. Seriously. Even though it&#x27;s a mousse it takes a good while to completely dry. So if you have an hour or so and are comfortable walking around your house naked with your arms above your head so you don&#x27;t get lines under your breasts, then this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to Norvell. You are getting what you pay for. It&#x27;s a good product for the price. But I do recommend doing your homework on how to apply self tanner properly. Otherwise enjoy the sun kissed glow this will give you.</li>
            <li> Awesome product - I am fair-skinned and my legs NEVER tan.  In the summer, I use sunless tanning products to give the effect of a tan on my otherwise blindingly white legs.  Most sunless tanning agents turn my legs a shade of orange rather than tan and smell awful.  This product does neither.  The &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; produced is a natural tan color and the smell is pleasant - not at all like other tanning products.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using self tanners for a LONG time.  I am always willing to give something new a try.&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;Little smell&lt;br /&gt;Easy application&lt;br /&gt;Looks natural&lt;br /&gt;Price on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;Seems to take a while to dry</li>
            <li> Best Mousse bronzer on the market!!! You will not find a better bronzer (especially for the price!). My tan gets gradually darker over 24 hours with this mousse which looks amazing. This is my second bottle and I will forever be a Norvell user!</li>
