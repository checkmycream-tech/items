            <li> There just isn&#x27;t another product that can moisturize &amp; repair the dry, red skin on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin was not as red and inflamed and it healed quicker than usual.  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li> This is a thick cream that coats my skin at night.</li>
            <li> The dispenser, however, is messy and inconvenient.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great product, even for older gentlemen that have spent alot of time in the sun.  would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> So far so good using this with matrix support.  Skin looks better already only been using one week so I willasd another review in couple months.  Oh yea shipping was fast from this company.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I used it for 4 months.</li>
            <li> My daughter used this and I noticed her skin look so much nice.  Then I ordered it and use it and love it.</li>
            <li> One of my go-tos. NeoStrata products work very well for my skin in terms of elasticity, moisture, and non-irritating. I&#x27;ve been using their stuff for years. I&#x27;ve got aging skin, but still have a tendency towards oiliness. This never makes me breakout. Improves tone, elasticity. I just bought the neck cream.</li>
            <li> Product arrived early, great care taken inshiiping of item. Very happy with product. I have sensitive skin and  this cream works well for me</li>
            <li> When my doctor started me on a retinol product, my fair, acne-prone skin became excessively dry and scaly.  This cellular restoration seemed to help overnight.  My skin was not as red and inflamed and it healed quicker than usual.  It does not break me out, but hydrates well (which U love!).</li>
            <li> Worth every drop!  I tried many products. This one really delivers results especially on my neck area. Works with other products.</li>
            <li> I love this night product (I don&#x27;t technically think it is a cream) - my skin feels moisturized and rejuvenated the next morning. It may also be lightening my discoloration, but I don&#x27;t think it is drastic enough to say that is why I purchase it. I think this line is great!</li>
            <li> it is spectacular cream, for my 100% works.</li>
            <li> Love this! &amp; Super fast delivery - definitely ordering again</li>
            <li> Love this product line!  This stuff is great you will feel a difference after one use and see the results in a month</li>
            <li> NeoStrata Cellular Restoration is the only product I use for my sensitive skin. There just isn&#x27;t another product that can moisturize &amp; repair the dry, red skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Works for me great cream. Use it during the day time for my skin.</li>
            <li> When I asked my dermatologist what I can do for my aging skin.  I am in my late sixties and have been told I have lovely skin</li>
            <li> Product came quickly, but not worth the cost</li>
            <li> Feel like it is working, the two products together are doing a good job, time will tell!!!!!! Better then over the counter creams!!</li>
            <li> Great product for day wear.  Apply after a citrus lotion and glycolic acid 10% moisturizer.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;ve always been afraid to put too much moisturizer on my face because of fear of breakouts.  My skin is so soft and not greasy at all. The product absorbs and leaves you with just soft skin.  I love all the Neostrata products.</li>

            <li> My husband cannot live without this product! He has sensitive skin and is thrilled that Cellular Restoration only does good for his face.</li>

            <li> Excellent product.  Really works.</li>
            <li> good product, quick, original</li>
            <li> Recently started to use this as my Dermatologist recommended.  I has a wonderful texture and is the a newer version than the NeoStrata I was using.  So far so good!</li>
            <li> This cellular restoration really works.  My face is extremely smooth.</li>
