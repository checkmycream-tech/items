            <li>The clasp is a bit difficult and I almost broke it right away but as long as you&#x27;re careful they are nice earrings especially for the price.</li>

            <li> I am living with these because they took a long time to arrive (expected) and are not worth the cost to ship back - but I was like</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected they did arrive way faster than promised, but after wearing them my ears are killing me!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even get them in my ears and they don&#x27;t stay closed</li>

            <li> Too small, thought they  would be larger.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long before they tarnish</li>
            <li> They have a little weight to it which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>

            <li> but I think too small like kid size.</li>
            <li> They were that small.</li>
            <li> So if you know your ear piercing is at least 20g don&#x27;t get these.</li>
            <li> It was that they are to thick for my ears.</li>
            <li> Very small.</li>

            <li> Tiny,  but gorgeous! !!</li>
            <li> They are very nice.  They have a little weight to it which I don&#x27;t care for. But doesn&#x27;t take from the look.</li>
            <li> May be nickel plated but will stay in day to day.  Really small,  so am I but I think too small like kid size.</li>
            <li> The earrings are very pretty but they didn&#x27;t fit which has never happened to be before. It was that they are to thick for my ears. I compared them to all my earrings and the gauge in these  is significantly thicker about 20 i would say while most earlobe piercings are about 22g. So if you know your ear piercing is at least 20g don&#x27;t get these.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken. Cannot even wear. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Love them. The are very cute</li>
            <li> They look like Zales earrings!</li>
            <li> Comfortable fit for small ears</li>
            <li> I bought two for my girls thinking this would be more secure and it won&#x27;t fall off since they&#x27;re not still young. As you can see, the metal isn&#x27;t even rounded. It&#x27;s as if someone was using pliers to shape it. And one earring won&#x27;t even stay clasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little flower part is cute but still very cheap. I guess you really do get what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
            <li> Cannot open!  I have to go to a bench jeweler to see if they can.</li>
            <li> Beautiful earrings would love to have gotten to waer them But the stud part is to big wont go in ears....</li>
            <li> These are really dainty and pretty!  I really like them and will continue buying from here in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karel</li>
            <li> Super cute.  Not sure how long before they tarnish but they are worth what I spent for sure.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised... Inexpensive , but look great!!</li>
            <li> I like them the only thing it&#x27;s that is a little bit hard to put them on but they are goid for the price.</li>
            <li> i loved then! Ive been wearing them on and off since i got then and they are by far my favorite pair of earings:-)</li>
            <li> The earrings doesnt close, it keeps opening! Looks like such a waste of money! Very upset to see the product!  Do not waste ur money n time!</li>
            <li> It is too small , but it&#x27;s nice earring</li>
            <li> I am living with these because they took a long time to arrive (expected) and are not worth the cost to ship back - but I was like -----where is it? when I opened the package. They were that small. Not at all like the pic and TINY - seriously tiny. I had intended to wear in my bottom hole in my ears but they are so small, I can only use in the top hole.</li>
            <li> Too small, thought they  would be larger.They should have been listed in children&#x27;s section.</li>
            <li> Very small. I can&#x27;t even get them in my ears and they don&#x27;t stay closed</li>
            <li> These earrings are beautiful and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> So incredibly tiny. Can&#x27;t even tell they are flowers, let alone anything but silver circles.</li>
            <li> Great price and beautiful earrings.  After I bought them for myself, I bought several pairs to give away as gifts.  Worth the price.  I&#x27;ve had mind for a while now with no issues!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought, pretty but not exactly like the pic. The clasp is a bit difficult and I almost broke it right away but as long as you&#x27;re careful they are nice earrings especially for the price.</li>
            <li> These earrings are beautiful.  Small and sparkly....very nice.</li>
            <li> Does not clasp together</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected they did arrive way faster than promised, but after wearing them my ears are killing me!!! Very low quality metal.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Thank goodness they were cheap! These are so tiny and will not go into my ear. They also don&#x27;t latch correctly.</li>
            <li> Darling! They are my go to! Never hurt my ears and i have very sensitive ears! I thought I&#x27;d only get to wear them on rare occasions but almost daily!</li>
