            <li>But overall really happy with purchase</li>
            <li>If you want or need something different having to do with skulls this would be great.</li>

            <li>Nicely made and necklace is long and comfortable!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super cool design.</li>
            <li>I love the Skull and I LOVE everything about this cute little thing!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The size is also good, large enough to see without being bulky.</li>
            <li>Great for wearing on Day of the Dead.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Worth my money.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty cool to me as well.</li>
            <li>So worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is one of the things that I purchased for my metalhead wife and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>It looks almost exactly like the picture online.  </li>
            <li>rough.&lt;br /&gt;The pendant itself is certainly worth the price but isn&#x27;t as vibrant as shown on the website.</li>
            <li>Not sure about the recipient because I bought for someone else to give as a gift, but it is very cute and pretty for a skull.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The item looks much nicer in the pictures.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely adores it.  </li>
            <li>The photos are true to the actual necklace.</li>
            <li>it had super glue all over the outside of the pendent !</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Colors seem less vibrant than the picture online, but overall still a cute necklace!  </li>
            <li>The pendant itself was very cool and definitely something different.</li>
            <li>The entire necklace is good material and heavy duty!</li>
            <li>However, the actual skull necklace seems like it has more blue in it than the actual photo.</li>
            <li>it looks a little cheap</li>
            <li>It is fun and looks much more expensive than it is.</li>
            <li>Lots of compliments thus far.</li>
            <li>This old lady isn&#x27;t too into skulls, but if you like skulls I think you would like this.</li>
            <li>I like the fact the seller got it here quickly before Christmas but definitely not worth the price</li>
            <li>I have yet to see this worn since it is a christmas gift, but i love the way it is designed, the look, and the pink little bag it came in.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed in the chain, it looked very cheapy in comparison to the pendant, however the good thing is you can always slide it off and get another necklace that suites your needs.</li>
            <li>smaller and less colorful than expected</li>

            <li> So worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is one of the things that I purchased for my metalhead wife and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> It looks almost exactly like the picture online.  </li>
            <li> rough.&lt;br /&gt;The pendant itself is certainly worth the price but isn&#x27;t as vibrant as shown on the website.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the recipient because I bought for someone else to give as a gift, but it is very cute and pretty for a skull.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The item looks much nicer in the pictures.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely adores it.  </li>
            <li> The photos are true to the actual necklace.</li>
            <li> it had super glue all over the outside of the pendent !</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Colors seem less vibrant than the picture online, but overall still a cute necklace!  </li>
            <li> The pendant itself was very cool and definitely something different.</li>
            <li> The entire necklace is good material and heavy duty!</li>
            <li> However, the actual skull necklace seems like it has more blue in it than the actual photo.</li>
            <li> it looks a little cheap</li>
            <li> It is fun and looks much more expensive than it is.</li>
            <li> Lots of compliments thus far.</li>
            <li> This old lady isn&#x27;t too into skulls, but if you like skulls I think you would like this.</li>
            <li> I like the fact the seller got it here quickly before Christmas but definitely not worth the price</li>
            <li> I have yet to see this worn since it is a christmas gift, but i love the way it is designed, the look, and the pink little bag it came in.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the chain, it looked very cheapy in comparison to the pendant, however the good thing is you can always slide it off and get another necklace that suites your needs.</li>
            <li> smaller and less colorful than expected</li>
            <li> The photo makes it look like it&#x27;s got some depth when in fact it&#x27;s just a flat picture under plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Still</li>
            <li> Didnt like the toilet chain.</li>
            <li> The chain will be too short for the person I&#x27;m giving it to for Christmas, so I will be replacing it with something a little longer.  </li>
            <li> , the only thing is I wish the necklace was a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can post is that it comes with a generic &amp;#34;dog tag-style&amp;#34; necklace, but I&#x27;m still giving a 5-star review because I didn&#x27;t order it for the necklace.</li>
            <li> ( it was in a pink see through bag)</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> , my only slight complaint is that the silver metal frame/chain is a little brighter than I had expected it to be.</li>
            <li> and it was a little shorter</li>
            <li> but, what a waste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is made EXTREMELY well!!!</li>
            <li> The skull is on paper and was very pale, and glue showed through the paper.  </li>
            <li> I guess I could use some crazy glue to stick it back on</li>
            <li> I think it was a little expensive also.</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> The chain is awful and has to be replaced.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really love the detail on the charm and the chain is actually pretty nice for the price.  My friend liked mine so much I bought her one for Valentine&#x27;s Day. Super cute!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this necklace as a Christmas present for my best friend. She loves anything that has a skull on it. This necklace is stunning. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was the way they packaged it ( it was in a pink see through bag) and I would prefer a different chain. This is absolutely worth the buy. O she loves it!!!</li>
            <li> I have yet to see this worn since it is a christmas gift, but i love the way it is designed, the look, and the pink little bag it came in. thank you</li>
            <li> Tons of compliments. Love the piece</li>
            <li> I love the necklace, and there was fast delivery and definatly one of a kind. I ordered this for my Aunt and I know she will love it as much as I did, the only thing is I wish the necklace was a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> The pendant itself was very cool and definitely something different. I bought it as a gift for a friend who shares a love of skulls. I was disappointed in the chain, it looked very cheapy in comparison to the pendant, however the good thing is you can always slide it off and get another necklace that suites your needs.</li>
            <li> I received the necklace 9-10 days after ordering it. The photos are true to the actual necklace. However, the actual skull necklace seems like it has more blue in it than the actual photo. It&#x27;s a super cool design. The necklace is shorter than I prefer, but it could always be switched out. The entire necklace is good material and heavy duty! Worth my money.</li>
            <li> Totally loved it when I saw it.  I would have loved to have a longer chain with it but am satisfied. Very stylish and unique.</li>
            <li> I wear it a lot and have had many positive comments about it. Very light and comfortable to wear. NICE.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous piece of jewelry.  I love it and get a lot of compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Julia :)</li>
            <li> It is truly a GREAT necklace that would go with almost ANYTHING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for a necklace with a skull for A WHILE! I wanted something that I could wear every day and it would go with almost anything!!!  And this is the P-E-R-F-E-C-T! Absolutely perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made EXTREMELY well!!! I LOVE the chain! I love the Skull and I LOVE everything about this cute little thing!!!&lt;br /&gt;It DOESN&#x60;T look cheap! And I am VERY pleased with the quality of the piece!</li>
            <li> She seems to go for this type of thing. Well packaged and just as described. Looks pretty cool to me as well.</li>
            <li> Does not look like the piece in the picture. The piece in the picture doesn&#x27;t look like a &amp;#34;print&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s just a photo on a piece of paper with a piece of glass glued on it. Total waste of money. I was really excited to gift this to my wife who loves sugar skulls. Regretfully it&#x27;s just going in the trash.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful and I just adore it I wear it almost everyday and the skull  color amazing beautifully worth buying</li>
            <li> I liked it.. &amp; It Was made well.. But the skull itself was just a peice of paper.. I thought it was gonna B 3 dimensional.. &amp; Made out of the of the Shell Marble</li>
            <li> Lots of compliments thus far. Very pretty piece, I&#x27;m enjoying it! One can never have enough skulls in their life. Well, that&#x27;s my opinion anyhow lol</li>
            <li> The item looks much nicer in the pictures. It is not what I expected. Very cheap looking.</li>
            <li> this necklace has the perfect amount of creepy while still being absolutely gorgeous.  I love it!  So worth the money.  :)</li>
            <li> The skull is on paper and was very pale, and glue showed through the paper.  It is just ok, chain should be longer.</li>
            <li> loved this necklace will most likely buy some more for my daughters, they love this kind of things.&lt;br /&gt;if asked I will let friends know</li>
            <li> I received this necklace today and I love it.  The quality is very nice and the colors on the skull are beautiful.  I know this necklace will get a ton of wear from me.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love any kind of Skulls! This one is different and looks like the picture. The only thing is the skull sits crooked in its setting. But overall really happy with purchase came super quick!</li>
            <li> Three days into wearing this necklace the skull pendant fell out. I guess I could use some crazy glue to stick it back on but, what a waste. I love the necklace but, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail today and I would have to say that the quality is very nice, the sugar skull picture is under glass and I love the handmade look that the necklace has, my only slight complaint is that the silver metal frame/chain is a little brighter than I had expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Heavier than I had imagined. The white part of the pendant design glows in UV blacklight. The chain, clasp and pendant all seem to be good quality. The design is as beautiful as the picture. I had bought this for a Halloween costume and have since worn is just a beautiful jewelry.</li>
            <li> This is really beautiful, which I honestly didn&#x27;t expect.  It has a nice weight, beautiful color, and comes with a chain which I wasn&#x27;t sure of when looking at the details.  I might order one for myself too!</li>
            <li> This is a very cool pendant!  It looks almost exactly like the picture online.  If you want or need something different having to do with skulls this would be great. I bought it as a gift for my sister.  It is fun and looks much more expensive than it is. I would recommend this to anyone.  It&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li> This Piece is beautiful.  Well crafted.  I purchased this as a gift for my girlfriend and she absolutely adores it.  The only negative I can post is that it comes with a generic &amp;#34;dog tag-style&amp;#34; necklace, but I&#x27;m still giving a 5-star review because I didn&#x27;t order it for the necklace.</li>
            <li> The pendent is great it looks a little cheap and it was a little shorter then I thought but it is of good quality so far and still does look cute.</li>
            <li> I bought this necklace because the reviews were good, and it surpassed my expectations. Just the right length, beautiful artwork. I love skulls, and this makes a festive addition to my collection. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Thank you, I love it,, I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on it. I would like to see what else you have.</li>
            <li> Cool necklace and pendant!!! The skull has a lot more detail in person! Nicely made and necklace is long and comfortable! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter loved them!</li>
            <li> made of brass not worth your good money!!!</li>
            <li> This necklace looks like it just came out of a gum ball machine...  very cheap looking.  I like the fact the seller got it here quickly before Christmas but definitely not worth the price</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. Looks just like the picture. I will be changing the chain because I don&#x27;t like that type of chain anyways, but I knew I would want to change it when I bought it. Great necklace.</li>
            <li> This piece is very different. Seems to be well made and is nice looking. The size is also good, large enough to see without being bulky.</li>
            <li> Skull pendent is quarter-sized.</li>
            <li> The chain is awful and has to be replaced. It&#x27;s too short and is quite rough.&lt;br /&gt;The pendant itself is certainly worth the price but isn&#x27;t as vibrant as shown on the website. The photo makes it look like it&#x27;s got some depth when in fact it&#x27;s just a flat picture under plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Still an interesting piece and I&#x27;m keeping it. Great for wearing on Day of the Dead.</li>
            <li> Didnt like the toilet chain. It should be longer or the pendant should be strung on leather. I think it was a little expensive also.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the pic. Did not like at all.</li>
            <li> smaller and less colorful than expected</li>
            <li> Love this pendant, put it on a nicer chain</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  Cute, sweet.  Good quality, great service....love it.</li>
            <li> Love my necklace! It looks as cool in person as it does in the picture. Very happy with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> THIS NECKLACE IS AMAZING. (: THE COLORS WITHIN THE BULB STICK OUT AND ARE VERY PLEASANT TO THE EYE. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the recipient because I bought for someone else to give as a gift, but it is very cute and pretty for a skull.  This old lady isn&#x27;t too into skulls, but if you like skulls I think you would like this.</li>
