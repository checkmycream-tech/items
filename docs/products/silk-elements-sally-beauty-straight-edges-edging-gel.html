            <li>I&#x27;m not going natural, I just wanted to ease up on the frequency, which my new stylist said was too long for me to go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice thick formula, the hold last a long time, it has a clear consistency, it also leaves no flakes or white build-up (</li>
            <li>I gave the product a 4 because it worked with my natural coily curls and flat ironed/pressed hair.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t mention the name, but they are very similar and the other one is much cheaper.</li>

            <li> I  live in a country that average temp is 110 F degrees</li>
            <li> When my hair is loose or in a puff, I slightly damp my edges, place a small amount on my front edges, smooth with my hands and coily moist curls spring up.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of 13$.</li>
            <li> , I never had a white residue like every other gel or flaking.</li>
            <li> It holds my edges together all day long without having to take my hair down because my edges came back up.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for 3C-MBL hair that gets alot of single strand knots.</li>
            <li> Weather my hair is wet or dry</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> My stylist said use the glaze due to its moisture.</li>
            <li> Stays down for like 5 seconds, Thats it.</li>
            <li> For years off and on when I needed something to lay edges down I would use Eq Glaze.</li>
            <li> It works for a little while</li>
            <li> A little background, I just got a sew in 2 weeks ago while I&#x27;m exercising and letting my hair rest.</li>
            <li> But when I use that I have to put a little water on and then tie up for a little while,</li>
            <li> When I add a little peppermint gel, it lays wavy.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair harsh.</li>
            <li> Still not sure if I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> But needless to say my edges are rough!</li>
            <li> Too bad they only sale it at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply and online.</li>
            <li> kick back is the buildup :[</li>
            <li> Anyhoo, just giving details because I hate when people leave reviews with no info on their hair type.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did not work for me at all. Stays down for like 5 seconds, Thats it. A complete waste of 13$. Very Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Perfect for healthy looking edges</li>
            <li> It is greasy and I noticed hair shed. It works for a little while then it stops working. I through this in the trash after using 25%. I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This product is 4·79 - 5·00 all day at Sally &#x27;s.... great product for relaxed, transitioning, or.natural hair.</li>
            <li> This edge control gel wirks better for my edges, I never had a white residue like every other gel or flaking. It holds my edges together all day long without having to take my hair down because my edges came back up. I highly recommend this edge control gel !</li>
            <li> Everyone always complains of build up with edge controls but you get build up regardless when you put extra stuff in your hair. I on the other hand love this stuff. It&#x27;s a nice thick formula, the hold last a long time, it has a clear consistency, it also leaves no flakes or white build-up (atleast not for me) but I also coat my hair with castor oil before and after use of any product. I have to order two or three because I use this for my entire head sometimes. I recommend this for 3C-MBL hair that gets alot of single strand knots.</li>
            <li> This is the best edge control I&#x27;ve ever tired amongst a lit if others. I&#x27;ve tried olive oil edge control which made my hair turn white and flakey after it dried and argan oil edge control which made my hair very oily after a while but it has a great smell to it.. However silk element is the only one I love that has no compliant. It&#x27;s not hard to get off, make you hair oily or leave white flakes. It&#x27;s the best. Too bad they only sale it at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply and online.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t mention the name, but they are very similar and the other one is much cheaper. This works ok. Still not sure if I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Works really good on the edges even if you dont have a perm I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The best edge control out there right now and trust me when I say I TRIED THEM ALL. I love this gel.</li>
            <li> I adore this product, I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I just go this today after reading somewhere else. A little background, I just got a sew in 2 weeks ago while I&#x27;m exercising and letting my hair rest. I haven&#x27;t had a perm since July, it&#x27;s now February. I&#x27;m not going natural, I just wanted to ease up on the frequency, which my new stylist said was too long for me to go. Anyhoo, just giving details because I hate when people leave reviews with no info on their hair type. But needless to say my edges are rough! Lol. For years off and on when I needed something to lay edges down I would use Eq Glaze. But when I use that I have to put a little water on and then tie up for a little while, like while in shower. It works for the day, but the next day I have to re-do it. Now with the sew in that&#x27;s not really as possible, especially if I have flexi rods in. This stuff works pretty good. Where my hair is longer it seemed to raise a little bit, but still pretty good. My stylist said use the glaze due to its moisture. I&#x27;ve read too many people&#x27;s reviews on the edge control and how it took their edges out! No thanks. Well I&#x27;ve rambled enough. Hope I helped. Worth the purchase. On sale at Sally&#x27;s for $3.99 regular price $4.99 I will come back in a month or so for a update.</li>
            <li> My edges was laid!!! This is a really good product</li>
            <li> Weather my hair is wet or dry this product does what it say it will and even with humidity it out performs most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kick back is the buildup :[</li>
            <li> This works great! It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair harsh.</li>
            <li> I gave the product a 4 because it worked with my natural coily curls and flat ironed/pressed hair.  When my hair is loose or in a puff, I slightly damp my edges, place a small amount on my front edges, smooth with my hands and coily moist curls spring up. When I add a little peppermint gel, it lays wavy. If I put it on my edges dry, I end up with straight edges and afro hair. I love all of that, but I don&#x27;t like having to be sure that the thick clear product was dispersed well or later find a clumpy area of hair. Overall, I like it and plan to continue to purchase it!</li>
            <li> This product applied a good firm hold on my natural course hair.</li>
            <li> can not handle high heat and it turns white.... I  live in a country that average temp is 110 F degrees ---this stuff did not hold or smooth</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and sculpts your hair better then the more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on frizzy hair.</li>
