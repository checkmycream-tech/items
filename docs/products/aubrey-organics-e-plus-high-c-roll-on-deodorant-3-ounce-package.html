            <li>Best truly natural deodorant out there!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using natural deodorants for over 10 years and this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t significantly fade or turn \\&quot;sour\\&quot; like many others.</li>
            <li>IT WORKS FINE!</li>
            <li>It lasts quite a while, and I&#x27;m soooo pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It smells okay</li>
            <li>I asked my husband many times and he would tell me if I did.</li>
            <li>once all that yuckyness was out of me,this worked a thousand times better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>Delivered to your door at this price is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that most alternative deodorant options do not work.</li>
            <li>This is just the most fabulous deodorant!  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>THINGS MOST PRODUCTS ARE FULL OFF!</li>
            <li>it works awesome, But I had to do a detox, which was i use my own homemade deodorant for a few months and detoxed and</li>
            <li>Additionally, I have been working out at the gym more frequently, and this product wasn&#x27;t as effective as I would have liked it to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I goes on easily and stays all day.</li>
            <li>The weather has been hot recently and this product has done it&#x27;s job perfectly.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, dries fast, and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend making your own deodorant to detox and that part is probably the hardest</li>
            <li>I found it to be very strong (with normal application) and it smells like (to be insensitive)</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work better than the &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; deodorant rock that I use, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Maybe just my body chemistry, but I&#x27;ll keep searching for an effective natural product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for the day (unlike others that I&#x27;ve had to apply numerous times).</li>
            <li>The first day it worked fine.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent (not too floral-y, woods-y, fruit-y, spice-y or citrus-y...just a light clean scent).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to find something natural but haven&#x27;t found anything I like yet.  </li>
            <li>I do not perspire much at all so that might be significant.</li>
            <li>That being said, Aubrey&#x27;s E Plus High C is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I was looking high and low for an effective, organic deodorant after I found out</li>
            <li>Deodorants alone don&#x27;t work for me in the hot, humid weather.  </li>
            <li>I love it and its the only thing I been using for four years.</li>
            <li>this is the only one I have come across that smells amazing and is effective for at least a few hours even in the most hot and humid conditions.</li>
            <li>Really wanted this to work out, but it did not.</li>
            <li>but after you get through it, This product works really well.  </li>
            <li>Also once you detox you just do not sweat as much anyway.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife as she is very health concious and wants to avoid products that contain aluminum.</li>
            <li>Most natural deodorants I&#x27;ve found smell a little strange, but this one smells lovely and fresh.</li>
            <li>It may be a decent product except for the overpowering fragrance - I just can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>NORMAL SWEATING -</li>
            <li>I have used several different &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and this one works better than any of them, I am still &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; the following day.</li>
            <li>The price is much better than the health food stores that usually carry it.</li>
            <li>BUT KNWOING THAT ITS DOING ITS JOB AND ISNT BAD SMELLING AND IS FULL OF GOOD THINGS AND NOT POISONOUS</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little runny, but goes on fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a 100% completely natural deodorant that works for years.</li>
            <li>I personally can not take the fragrance - it&#x27;s too much.  </li>
            <li>I have tried to s of natural deodorants or antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>I got the white cover and it is very drippy when dispensed.</li>
            <li>I suppose the deodorant works well enough, but I really have an issue with the smell.</li>
            <li>sun screen for old people.</li>
            <li>I have highly sensitive skin and concerns about applying aluminum to my body.</li>
            <li>but like many other natural deodorants, the odor protection doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this newer formula does not smell as nice or work nearly as well as the old one.</li>
            <li>I tried it one day and ended up running to the pharmacy during my lunch break to get regular old toxic deodorant!</li>
            <li>It is difficult to get, so I am so glad it can be ordered here!</li>
            <li>My wife is very happy with this product as it does not contain all the nasty chemicals of other deodorants, allows her to sweat, and keeps her smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this product based on other reviews.</li>
            <li>Not a very good description, sure, but I find it to be an undesirable scent alone, and it definitely will conflict with any other scents, should you use any.</li>
            <li>and although some worked in certain conditions (certainly not in humidity!!)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I agree that sweating is natural but what I could not deal with is the odor because the other products she was using did not work all day.</li>
            <li> I have to order it now as its not easy to find where I live.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying out various natural deodorants over the last year (at least!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a chalky pink color, but the color fades when you put it on</li>
            <li> I was desperate  -- even trying Old Spice Classic for men.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5 years due to its friendliness to the body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and none of them compare.</li>
            <li> I purposely had searched to purchase the green one from past experience with the white cover.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on a 2-pack by trusting in other people&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and traditional antiperspirants such as Ban and Dove are less expensive.</li>
            <li> I find that the scent either fades away or lingers slightly but either way</li>
            <li> ITS VERY HARD TO FIND DEODORANTS WITH SUCH WHOLESOME ORGANIC INGREDIENTS!</li>
            <li> I started buying this deodorant for my daughter a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Yes I would recommend this to a friend or family member looking for a deodorant that lasts all day without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> The smell is not great but the fact that I don&#x27;t end up smelling like it is the end result.</li>
            <li> Much worse, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the order included 2 of these</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed how deceitful this was.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a 100% completely natural deodorant that works for years. THIS ACTUALLY WORKS!!! I bought it in the 2-pack this last time. It lasts quite a while, and I&#x27;m soooo pleased with it. It&#x27;s a chalky pink color, but the color fades when you put it on and it doesn&#x27;t stain your lighter colored clothes. Very, very happy customer here.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant ever!  It doesnt contain any harmful chemicals, has a clean, fresh scent, and it works great!</li>
            <li> I started buying this deodorant for my daughter a few years ago. It&#x27;s the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t cause her an allergic reaction. It has pleasant fragrance and it lasts.</li>
            <li> I personally can not take the fragrance - it&#x27;s too much.  I&#x27;d love to find something natural but haven&#x27;t found anything I like yet.  Unfortunately, the order included 2 of these so I&#x27;m stuck with them.  It may be a decent product except for the overpowering fragrance - I just can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever!  Most natural deodorants I&#x27;ve found smell a little strange, but this one smells lovely and fresh.</li>
            <li> Best truly natural deodorant out there!&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell and it has great protection from dampness.&lt;br /&gt;I have found the perfect deodorant for me!</li>
            <li> I have used several different &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and this one works better than any of them, I am still &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; the following day.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have been trying out various natural deodorants over the last year (at least!) and although some worked in certain conditions (certainly not in humidity!!) this is the only one I have come across that smells amazing and is effective for at least a few hours even in the most hot and humid conditions.</li>

            <li> I have tried to s of natural deodorants or antiperspirants. This one doesn&#x27;t work. Period. It smells okay but does t do anything.</li>
            <li> I got the white cover and it is very drippy when dispensed. I purposely had searched to purchase the green one from past experience with the white cover. Very disappointed how deceitful this was.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and find it works as well as any deodorant out there.  It&#x27;s a little runny, but goes on fine.</li>
            <li> I was looking high and low for an effective, organic deodorant after I found out my Alvera had ALUMINUM in it. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a lot of different ones, and then gave up, going back to the Alvera.  Then my husband brought this home, and I&#x27;ve never turned back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABSOLUTELY THE BEST I&#x27;VE TRIED!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the scent (not too floral-y, woods-y, fruit-y, spice-y or citrus-y...just a light clean scent).  Although it is a bit drying (I guess that&#x27;s sort of thd idea), it does prevent underarm odor (even after studio cycling/spin class).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 5, 2013 (revised)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I have gone back to using antiperspirant.  Deodorants alone don&#x27;t work for me in the hot, humid weather.  Additionally, I have been working out at the gym more frequently, and this product wasn&#x27;t as effective as I would have liked it to be.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and traditional antiperspirants such as Ban and Dove are less expensive.</li>
            <li> I had burning and itching from this product.( Not to the point of having to go to the hospital.) The first day it worked fine. But after a week, I realized I could not use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work out for me. I tried it one day and ended up running to the pharmacy during my lunch break to get regular old toxic deodorant! Really wanted this to work out, but it did not.</li>
            <li> The smell is not great but the fact that I don&#x27;t end up smelling like it is the end result. I asked my husband many times and he would tell me if I did. It keeps me from having any BO odor. I do not perspire much at all so that might be significant.</li>
            <li> it works awesome, But I had to do a detox, which was i use my own homemade deodorant for a few months and detoxed and once all that yuckyness was out of me,this worked a thousand times better. I love it and its the only thing I been using for four years. I have to order it now as its not easy to find where I live.  I highly recommend making your own deodorant to detox and that part is probably the hardest but after you get through it, This product works really well.  Also once you detox you just do not sweat as much anyway. I don&#x27;t wear any deodorant on the weekends if I can help it. Except when I go to service of course.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this product based on other reviews. I suppose the deodorant works well enough, but I really have an issue with the smell. I found it to be very strong (with normal application) and it smells like (to be insensitive) sun screen for old people. Not a very good description, sure, but I find it to be an undesirable scent alone, and it definitely will conflict with any other scents, should you use any. I shouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on a 2-pack by trusting in other people&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work better than the &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; deodorant rock that I use, but it didn&#x27;t. Much worse, unfortunately. Maybe just my body chemistry, but I&#x27;ll keep searching for an effective natural product.</li>
            <li> HELLO. I LOVE THAT THIS DOESNT CONTAIN TOXIC INGREDIENTS. ITS VERY HARD TO FIND DEODORANTS WITH SUCH WHOLESOME ORGANIC INGREDIENTS! IVE BEEN USING THIS FOR OVER TWO YEARS. OK IT MIGHT NOT SMELL THE GREATEST BUT KNWOING THAT ITS DOING ITS JOB AND ISNT BAD SMELLING AND IS FULL OF GOOD THINGS AND NOT POISONOUS THINGS MOST PRODUCTS ARE FULL OFF! HOWEVER FAMILY MEMBERS ALSO TRIED THIS AND IF YOU SWEAT ALOT THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE PRODUCT FOR YOU! NORMAL SWEATING - IT WORKS FINE! I USE THIS LIKE I SAID BECAUSE ITS NOT TOXIC WHATSOEVER AND WILL KEEP USING THIS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using natural deodorants for over 10 years and this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across. The smell is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t significantly fade or turn \\&quot;sour\\&quot; like many others. I only need to apply it once and I&#x27;m good for the day (unlike others that I&#x27;ve had to apply numerous times). Additionally I&#x27;m prone to red rashes in my underarm area and once I started using this deodorant the rash has noticeably faded (and hopefully will go away altogether!). The weather has been hot recently and this product has done it&#x27;s job perfectly. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells very good but like many other natural deodorants, the odor protection doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5 years due to its friendliness to the body. The price is much better than the health food stores that usually carry it. Delivered to your door at this price is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me......had to return to Mitchum</li>
            <li> I have highly sensitive skin and concerns about applying aluminum to my body. I&#x27;ve also found that most alternative deodorant options do not work. That being said, Aubrey&#x27;s E Plus High C is fabulous. It goes on easily, dries fast, and smells nice. I find that the scent either fades away or lingers slightly but either way I make it home without body odor.</li>
            <li> This is just the most fabulous deodorant!  It is difficult to get, so I am so glad it can be ordered here!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as she is very health concious and wants to avoid products that contain aluminum. I agree that sweating is natural but what I could not deal with is the odor because the other products she was using did not work all day. This deodorant actually lasts all day! My wife is very happy with this product as it does not contain all the nasty chemicals of other deodorants, allows her to sweat, and keeps her smelling fresh. She will be using this product from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_Bottom Line_ Yes I would recommend this to a friend or family member looking for a deodorant that lasts all day without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 15 years. I love it. I wouldn&#x27;t use any thing else. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and none of them compare. I didn&#x27;t like the roll on to begin with but with time got used to it. I highly recommend this. Just remember this is NOT an antiperspirant. Our bodies are supposed to sweat.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this newer formula does not smell as nice or work nearly as well as the old one. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used this for years. It has a great gender neutral scent. I goes on easily and stays all day. If you are working out or sweat a lot, you would need to reapply. This works the best for natural deoderant!</li>
