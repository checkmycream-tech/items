    <ol>
            <li>This is the best mascara in the WORLD!!  </li>
            <li>Awesome as always!</li>
            <li>(online sellers have been great, though)!  </li>
            <li>Best Mascara EVERRRR!!!</li>
            <li>Best Mascara Ever!  </li>
            <li>This is the best, best, best mascara ever!</li>
            <li>Very good mascara</li>
            <li>so when I saw this again I was so happy.</li>
            <li>and I was happy to find it.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it rinses of with soap and water very easily.  </li>
            <li>good length added, separates your lashes without clumping them together.</li>
            <li>Good....  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fair mascara, but it does flake like the rest.</li>
            <li>My wife was very pleased to find a product with a curved brush.  </li>
            <li>It has a beautiful glossy finish, and no annoying clumps to have to fool around with.</li>
            <li>Love using it at home, even!</li>
            <li>Love this mascara!</li>
            <li>The mascara itself has the perfect consistency to mimic real eyelash appearance for thickening and lenthening.</li>
            <li>A nice mascara, but doesn&#x27;t stay put.</li>
            <li>It really is the most perfect mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>In fact, it looks just as great after 12 hours of wear as when it was first applied.</li>
            <li>for comparison, I bought in CVS a very cheap (around $4) made in Germany mascara</li>
            <li>It is not bad, but with all the hundreds of mascaras out there it did not stand out as exceptional.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never been able to find a mascara like 2000 calorie since they stopped selling it in US stores.</li>
            <li>I am pleased as punch with the product and my purchase..</li>
            <li>I am pleased as punch with the product and my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I tried so many out there in the market.</li>
            <li>and it works much better.</li>
            <li>I have tried to find a mascara better than this since it was discontinued in the United States.</li>
            <li>I love using it during the day and at night.</li>
            <li>I will forever love Max Factor 2000 Calorie Mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>So, when I found it online, I was very excited and made the purchase immediately.</li>
            <li>Overall is it a good product, however nothing exceptional.</li>
            <li>This stuff can be a pain to find in the stores, but with amazon, it&#x27;s easy peasy.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to find a legit  source for it, I&#x27;ll definitely order it again!</li>
            <li>The curved brush is amazingly lush, unlike all the spiky brushes that are popular currently in most mascaras: it separates, fans out and curls each lash with precision.</li>
            <li>The consistency is very fine before it&#x27;s been applied and mimics really lashes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that the original color, creamy texture and size is now gone.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara on the market, whether it be drug store brands (such as Cover Girl, or Revlon), pricer department store brands (i.e. Lancome, or Este Lauder), or somewhere in between (like Mary Kay, or Avon).</li>
            <li>The only good thing about it - it&#x27;s washed out easily.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice dark black, doesn&#x27;t flake or clump, and the curved brush makes it so that I can apply it perfectly every time.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I want: natural look; no smudge; eyelashes feel no burden; curved brush make it easy to apply... love this product.</li>
            <li>As if I haven&#x27;t tried that first!).</li>
            <li>Flakes a bit at the end of the day, but worth it.</li>
            <li>miss being able to buy it local.</li>
            <li>They should have left a winning product alone and not redone the formula.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy again. :)</li>
            <li>I did not notice length, only thickening that comes with applying many coats.  </li>
            <li>So glad they come back with this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Some pinhead emailed me back and thanked me for the complements, \\&quot;It&#x27;s always nice to hear people love our products!\\&quot; (geez!), then went on to tell me what I already told them I knew: they had left the US, weren&#x27;t coming back ...</li>
            <li>I emailed Max Factor UK, appealed to them about the loyal customers they left behind who can no longer buy their products - told them it is the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Product was not sealed and not new, no way to test if it is safe</li>
            <li>I love the curved brush which can be a little hard to find although they are making more and more of them.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s definitely important to know prior to purchase.</li>
            <li>but it did not lengthen as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>and I am very thankful that I can still get it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is a product that is no longer sold in the US, so I was very dissapointed to find that it was not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>This is by far my all-time favorite, go to mascara product can not live without it!</li>
            <li>Lashes are long, full, and beautiful to the point that some people ask me if I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes.  </li>
            <li>After a long search for my favorite discontinued mascara I finally found it!&lt;br /&gt;Max</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by this and probably would have not purchased it based on that fact.</li>
            <li>Said I should try Cover Girl mascara \\&quot;It&#x27;s nearly the same\\&quot; (ah, no - it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>Almost did it too, until I found it reasonably priced on Amazon.com that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, on to the review of the actual product.</li>
            <li>I have tried countless other mascaras, some as much as $60 a tube and nothing compares to Max Factor&#x27;s 2000 Calorie.  </li>

            <li> I have tried countless other mascaras, some as much as $60 a tube and nothing compares to Max Factor&#x27;s 2000 Calorie.  </li>
            <li> I am a HUGE Max Factor 2000 Calorie Mascara fan, used it for nearly 20 years - that is until they rudely packed up and left for Europe, abandoning the loyal US based customers and leaving us out in the cold.</li>
            <li> After one strike I have to take another dry brush to separate eyelashes and take extra mascara off.</li>
            <li> Not many products are outstanding amongst other brands - this is one of very few that delivers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This looks different than the other 2000 calorie mascara cases, but it is the same on the inside.  </li>
            <li> Factor is gone from the US, but as long as I can purchase it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I found it strange</li>
            <li> Minimal clumping and maximum volume.</li>
            <li> This purchase was just as she expected.</li>
            <li> Unknown if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Goes on a little thin for the first few uses, but multiple layers are no problem.  </li>
            <li> I never have to separate my lashes with a lash comb or any other object.  </li>
            <li> It is unknown if it was previously opened.  </li>
            <li> It came ahead of schedule, appeared brand new/unopened (hard to tell when some products don&#x27;t come in a sealed packaging, or have a safety seal, but I&#x27;ve seen it that way before it left the US) and was everything, as promised, it would be.</li>

            <li> This mascara is average.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, I&#x27;ve been using it for over a decade.  </li>
            <li> I did not notice any curling effect (my lashes do not face down)</li>
            <li> Compared to my previous mascaras...</li>
            <li> It really makes my lashes look longer and thicker and gives my eyes a perfectly dramatic look every time!</li>
            <li> I have no iidea why it iis not available everywhere in the United States.</li>
            <li> otherwise you get dried out tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The formula is quite wet; it will clump if applied too thick.</li>
            <li> no more smearing.</li>
            <li> Tube is almost too small to hold on to.</li>
            <li> so now I can continue buying it at least online.  </li>
            <li> Not too thick, not too thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would sadly cry off all my mascara.</li>
            <li> I would avoid the waterproof as it is everything proof and difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I was disappointed when it arrived without being in the manufacturer&#x27;s sealed packaging.</li>
            <li> I had always used Max Factor&#x27;s 2000 Calorie mascara and was so disappointed when I could no longer find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> So disappointing!</li>
            <li> and I hate having to order it online</li>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE this mascara.  Gives your eyelashes fullness that is perfection!&lt;br /&gt;I miss being able to buy it local.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this product.</li>
            <li> The mascara came out of the package and it wasn&#x27;t even sealed, also the tube looked used. I returned it.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara in the WORLD!!  Literally, because they no longer sell Max Factor in the US.  Thank goodness for Amazon so now I can continue buying it at least online.  I&#x27;ve used this mascara for over 20 years and it&#x27;s quality has not changed.  It&#x27;s a nice dark black, doesn&#x27;t flake or clump, and the curved brush makes it so that I can apply it perfectly every time.  I never have to separate my lashes with a lash comb or any other object.  Lashes are long, full, and beautiful to the point that some people ask me if I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes.  I hope they never stop selling it!!  I would sadly cry off all my mascara.</li>
            <li> Product was not sealed and not new, no way to test if it is safe</li>
            <li> Product was not sealed. Like a dummy I used it anyways and now I have a stye.</li>
            <li> After a long search for my favorite discontinued mascara I finally found it!&lt;br /&gt;Max Factor is gone from the US, but as long as I can purchase it on Amazon I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Awesome as always! This is by far my all-time favorite, go to mascara product can not live without it! Beyond 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Goes on a little thin for the first few uses, but multiple layers are no problem.  No clumping, no flaking, no under eye bleeding.  I can sleep in this and can wake up without raccoon eyes.  The best part is that it rinses of with soap and water very easily.  I love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did MF quit selling to the USA ???  I MISS my mascara and I hate having to order it online (online sellers have been great, though)!  Bring back my mascara to the USA!!!!  grrrrr!</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find a mascara like 2000 calorie since they stopped selling it in US stores. I am so happy to find a legit  source for it, I&#x27;ll definitely order it again!</li>
            <li> The shape of the brush helps to curl the lashes. Application is clumpless and even. I have no iidea why it iis not available everywhere in the United States.</li>
            <li> Product was not sealed and this was not mentioned in the product description. I was very surprised by this and probably would have not purchased it based on that fact. That&#x27;s definitely important to know prior to purchase.</li>

Said I should try Cover Girl mascara \\&quot;It&#x27;s nearly the same\\&quot; (ah, no - it&#x27;s not. As if I haven&#x27;t tried that first!). Dah ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even attempted to buy it online in UK stores, but they want a fortune to ship it to the US. Almost did it too, until I found it reasonably priced on Amazon.com that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, on to the review of the actual product. This is by far the best mascara on the market, whether it be drug store brands (such as Cover Girl, or Revlon), pricer department store brands (i.e. Lancome, or Este Lauder), or somewhere in between (like Mary Kay, or Avon). The mascara itself has the perfect consistency to mimic real eyelash appearance for thickening and lenthening. It has a beautiful glossy finish, and no annoying clumps to have to fool around with. The curved brush is amazingly lush, unlike all the spiky brushes that are popular currently in most mascaras: it separates, fans out and curls each lash with precision. For contact lenses wears, it doesn&#x27;t flake off as the day wears on like some mascaras have a tendency to do. In fact, it looks just as great after 12 hours of wear as when it was first applied. It really is the most perfect mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. Not many products are outstanding amongst other brands - this is one of very few that delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy from this seller again, until the supply is depleted. It came ahead of schedule, appeared brand new/unopened (hard to tell when some products don&#x27;t come in a sealed packaging, or have a safety seal, but I&#x27;ve seen it that way before it left the US) and was everything, as promised, it would be.

            <li> I have used all my life. and I tried so many out there in the market. so when I saw this again I was so happy. no more smearing. I love the curved brush which can be a little hard to find although they are making more and more of them. this is the tops for me.</li>
            <li> Very good mascara but it did not lengthen as much as I had hoped. I will probably buy this again one day.</li>
            <li> Best Mascara EVERRRR!!!</li>
            <li> It came without package. After one strike I have to take another dry brush to separate eyelashes and take extra mascara off. The only good thing about it - it&#x27;s washed out easily.&lt;br /&gt;Just for comparison, I bought in CVS a very cheap (around $4) made in Germany mascara and it works much better.</li>
            <li> Best Mascara Ever!  Hands down, I&#x27;ve been using it for over a decade.  This stuff can be a pain to find in the stores, but with amazon, it&#x27;s easy peasy.</li>
            <li> I have tried to find a mascara better than this since it was discontinued in the United States. I have yet to do so, and will continue ordering it online. Minimal clumping and maximum volume. I would avoid the waterproof as it is everything proof and difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 25 years and I am very thankful that I can still get it through Amazon.  I have tried countless other mascaras, some as much as $60 a tube and nothing compares to Max Factor&#x27;s 2000 Calorie.  I do recommend ordering from a seller in the UK otherwise you get dried out tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old fashioned glamour</li>
            <li> Color is lighter than it used to be. Also,  make-up not as creamy and tube is about 1/2 the size it used to be. Tube is almost too small to hold on to. It&#x27;s a shame that the original color, creamy texture and size is now gone. They should have left a winning product alone and not redone the formula.</li>
            <li> Specifically says curved brush in the purchase title. Did not have a curved brush. In addition, the actual mascara was gummy and did not seem to be anything like the Max Factor 2000 Calorie Mascara that I have been using for years. This is a product that is no longer sold in the US, so I was very dissapointed to find that it was not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This is the best, best, best mascara ever! It makes my eyes pop fantablously! The consistency is very fine before it&#x27;s been applied and mimics really lashes! It really makes my lashes look longer and thicker and gives my eyes a perfectly dramatic look every time! I love using it during the day and at night. Love using it at home, even!</li>
            <li> Compared to my previous mascaras...good length added, separates your lashes without clumping them together. I will definitely buy again. :)</li>
            <li> Lengthens so well I don&#x27;t have to curl my eyelashes any longer.  Flakes a bit at the end of the day, but worth it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is average.  It is not bad, but with all the hundreds of mascaras out there it did not stand out as exceptional.  The formula is quite wet; it will clump if applied too thick. I did not notice any curling effect (my lashes do not face down) I did not notice length, only thickening that comes with applying many coats.  Overall is it a good product, however nothing exceptional.</li>
            <li> Good....  Doesn&#x27;t smear or feel sticky.  Not too thick, not too thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t mind purchasing it again, and recommending it to others.</li>
            <li> I have used Max Factor mascara for decades and I was happy to find it.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I want: natural look; no smudge; eyelashes feel no burden; curved brush make it easy to apply... love this product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this would be waterproof and flake-proof, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a fair mascara, but it does flake like the rest. I used to use mascara that would stay on while I was diving and swimming. I can&#x27;t find anything like that again and this definitely won&#x27;t do the trick. A nice mascara, but doesn&#x27;t stay put.</li>
            <li> I had always used Max Factor&#x27;s 2000 Calorie mascara and was so disappointed when I could no longer find it in the stores. So, when I found it online, I was very excited and made the purchase immediately. Sadly, I was disappointed when it arrived without being in the manufacturer&#x27;s sealed packaging. So, it went into the garbage because I didn&#x27;t want to risk the possibility of using a contaminated product. So disappointing!</li>
            <li> My wife was very pleased to find a product with a curved brush.  This purchase was just as she expected.</li>
            <li> I will forever love Max Factor 2000 Calorie Mascara.  I can&#x27;t find it in the drug stores anymore.</li>
            <li> This looks different than the other 2000 calorie mascara cases, but it is the same on the inside.  Love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I found it strange it came without packaging.  It is unknown if it was previously opened.  Unknown if I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  So glad they come back with this mascara.  I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of months and I can see a drastic improvement in lashes.</li>
