            <li> Pevonia bottle doesn&#x27;t have a pump, and the plastic is stiff, so I end up getting too much lotion each time I use it.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other brands, even ones that have been recommended by my dermatologist, but none can compare to the Pevonia, which I have used for years.</li>
            <li> I have use this product at least three times only on my face and each time I have never gotten sunburn.</li>
            <li> I returned this product because it left a white film on my face that was difficult to work into skin and had to be wiped off with tissue.  </li>
            <li> I started using this sunscreen less than a month ago</li>
            <li> greasy, and a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog pores or feel heavy on my face.</li>
            <li> You will not catch me without applying this on my face and neck everyday.  </li>
            <li> I find this product a bit heavy, and it tends to make me break out.</li>
            <li> Also contains the ingredients that truly protect from the sun without being too thick.</li>
            <li> I hope the company will continue to make this as I cannot live without this anymore :(</li>
            <li> However, bottle design is very inconvenient.  </li>

            <li> Perfect lotion/sunscreen. Hydrating, smells great and not too thick. Also contains the ingredients that truly protect from the sun without being too thick.</li>
            <li> I love the sunscreen, it feels weightless and doesn&#x27;t clog the pores. I knew it was good -- I had a sample from my cosmetologist.  However, bottle design is very inconvenient.  Most high end beauty products either have some sort of a pump inside the bottle or are made of flexible plastic that&#x27;s easy to squeeze.  Pevonia bottle doesn&#x27;t have a pump, and the plastic is stiff, so I end up getting too much lotion each time I use it.</li>
            <li> excellent sunscreen goes on very nice is a great base for makeup not oily like some sunscreens does not burn your eyes all around great!!</li>
            <li> I love the Pevonia line and the Hydrating Sunscreen is great for everyday! I have oily/sensitive skin and I use this every morning as a moisturizer under my make-up. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores or feel heavy on my face.</li>
            <li> I work in construction and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sunscreens but this is by far the best. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for about three years now, and it&#x27;s a favorite. Light enough to go under a tinted moisturizer, not oily, smells lovely, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever! Most sunscreens make my eyes tear. NOT this one!</li>
            <li> I love all pevonia products but am new to this one.  I am really liking the texture of it and the coverage and have not burned since I started using it. 3 cheers for this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> This product works great on my skin. I wore it during a very long bike ride with sun and wind and my face was fine.</li>
            <li> I discovered Pevonia sunscreen 3 years ago Now I use nothing else Creamy application. My skin feels hydrated even after lots of hours in the sun. Light fragrance of roses is also very nice.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product for the first time and I have been using it for about 2 weeks now.  So far I have not had any allergic reactions and it actually works well.  However if you are in the sun especially in the Caribbean you would need to reapply a few time a day for best results. I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Creamy, easy to apply and best of all it WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen truly feels like you are putting on Pevonia facial lotion. Very light feel but super protection.</li>
            <li> I returned this product because it left a white film on my face that was difficult to work into skin and had to be wiped off with tissue.  Since I do not wear foundation daily and am fair skinned, this was unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;The product&#x27;s scent was light and pleasant and I thought it would be a good value considering quantity and price.</li>
            <li> I have use this product at least three times only on my face and each time I have never gotten sunburn. My friends grandmother uses this product and claims it was the best product she&#x27;s ever used and I totally agree with her. I have Polish in my background so therefore it is very easy for me to get sunburned and this product did not let my skin burn.</li>
            <li> love it , fast ship&lt;br /&gt;trust which is very great business relationship with customers.&lt;br /&gt;buyers need to trust them  and buy it because i have great positive feel with them.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best sunblocks I have ever used.</li>
            <li> You will not catch me without applying this on my face and neck everyday.  This product block 99% if not all of the UW in my opinion.  I don&#x27;t see any sun damage to my face when I started using this product.  I hope the company will continue to make this as I cannot live without this anymore :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work there!</li>
            <li> I started using this sunscreen less than a month ago and I really like it. I apply over my Pevonia moisturizer. It is light enough on the skin to use daily and under my makeup.</li>
            <li> Fast shipper, very pleased.</li>
            <li> It looks white on my face.  I have light tan complexion.  It doesn&#x27;t spread well.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is light weight for the face, great for under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Non greasy, and a little goes along way. My sister is a beautician and recommended pevonia to me.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; light, absorbs well.  Make-up goes on with no problem.  The price point is excellent for the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin (especially when it comes to sunscreen on my face) and find that Pevonia products work well for me. I tried a sample of this and found that it agreed with my face, so I purchased a bottle of it. Used it for 10 days on vacation in the Caribbean and not only did it keep my face from getting sunburned, it did not cause me to break out. I also don&#x27;t like to wear hats to shade my face, because they give me a headache and make my forehead itch. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love Pevonia products. I use many of them without any problems. They improve my skin immeasurably. I naturally chose Pavonia for sunscreen. I find this product a bit heavy, and it tends to make me break out. Does seem to keep the sun out, which is a good thing. It has a fresh scent, but not a nice as most of their products.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen/moisturizer, because it is comfortable on the skin, is not sticky, applies smoothly, and the SPF 30 rating provides safe protection. I have tried numerous other brands, even ones that have been recommended by my dermatologist, but none can compare to the Pevonia, which I have used for years.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen . Not greasy. Smells clean.</li>
