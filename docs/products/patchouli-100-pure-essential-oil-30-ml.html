            <li>OMG, this is the best Patchouli!</li>

            <li>The added sample was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>people stop me and tell me how great I smell ,, It always make me smile</li>
            <li>A great volume for the price, true, rich scent...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been completely satisfied with this oil.</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;m sure you will like it)  </li>
            <li>I use it in a candle powered oil burner and it smells even better than putting my nose to the bottle.  </li>
            <li>It has been refreshing for weeks, from just a couple drops.  </li>
            <li>Its not over-powering, and it lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>Bought a lot of patchouli many smelled like pine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean rustic antique type smell that reminds me of a cabin in the woods.  </li>
            <li>Very Good Quality Patchouli Oil.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend &amp; order again.</li>
            <li>Love Plantlife, the service is always first class.</li>
            <li>Great product, arrived on time and was what I had expected.</li>
            <li>If you are a true Patchouli lover, this is the one.</li>
            <li>this product is the true essence scent recommend anyone to buy this product.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>So....I wanted a more authentic patchouli scent, bought this, and got the same reaction.</li>
            <li>The oil does not have a very pleasant aroma and does not last long at all.  </li>
            <li>I love the natural aroma this stuff puts out.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the fresh and soulful scent of patchouli but received a product that smells of gym socks.</li>
            <li>Not even on freshly washed clothing.</li>
            <li>I bought this item thinking the price was right</li>
            <li>I sometimes buy Patchouli oil that does not smell quite right.  </li>
            <li>you can order the bigger 30 ml size which i do on a regular basis  great quality oil without all the dragons and wizards and crazy stuff---a more refined mature product for those who want the best!!!!  </li>
            <li>But I love the scent and will definitely buy again.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>This is the real patchouli,  and it stays with you too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of fragrances to the point of getting headaches, yet this patchouli oil not only doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I just love the scent!      </li>
            <li>So many times I&#x27;ve bought patchouli, only to get it home and realize it wasn&#x27;t the real thing, or smelled funny.  </li>
            <li>Was 100% pure as promised.</li>
            <li>Its a good sized bottle, will last me a long time!</li>
            <li>I can pull out the clothes from last last season and they will still smell amazing.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and a reasonable price..</li>
            <li>This stuff is not thick, does not smell strong and does not last at all.</li>
            <li>not exactly what i was expecting but is ok</li>
            <li>This stuff, I will take about three or four fingers worth and it does not even last when you put that much on.</li>
            <li>It must be highly diluted or something.</li>
            <li>I use to be a pretty major cologne wearer.</li>
            <li>I wasted about $100.00 trying to order the right rich patchouli I used to get from the Body Shop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive to try the small bottle and the scent lingers in a lovely way.</li>
            <li>but I keep finding new uses for it..</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, bottle was bigger than expected, plus there were two left</li>
            <li>Finally this is exactly the one.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it and female co- workers have also made positive comments.</li>
            <li>100% Pure Essential oil.</li>
            <li>I flippantly bought a bottle of patchouli oil at Waterbeds N Stuff and wore a little to work.</li>
            <li>The real stuff i had was a one tiny dab on your finger will do it type thing.</li>
            <li>the only stuff that smells like the real patchouli of the 70s.</li>
            <li>Lasts pretty long as well.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of my older male relatives.</li>
            <li>The scent is pure and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Not sure what the original intended purpose was</li>
            <li>I look forward to dealing with them again in the near future.</li>
            <li>However, the oil does burn a little fast and produces a bit of smoke.  </li>

            <li> it just doesnt last long enough.i was after a stronger longer lasting smell like the body works had years ago.</li>
            <li> was really &amp;#34;impotent&amp;#34;, that is - had little aroma, unlike other patchoulis I have been exposed to..almost not there; asked for refund, obtained through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This stuff goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> WILL LAST A LONG TIME DUE TO DILUTING.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;pure essential oil&#x27; is of poor quality.  </li>
            <li> I have always used another brand but thought I&#x27;d try something different &amp; maybe a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Product and delivery were as expected.</li>
            <li> I had a small vial of Patchouli from a head shop I had been using and it was running low</li>
            <li> you can use very little and it gos a long way.</li>
            <li> My wife has worn Patchouli since the late 60&#x27;s, it seems harder and harder to find &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If you like patchouli but have trouble finding those without additives that make the oil change scent after awhile or give you headaches, try this one.  </li>
            <li> I got the small bottle</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear every day, but still think I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of use from this small bottle!    </li>
            <li> Very disappointed and would like to return it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot of fragrances to the point of getting headaches, yet this patchouli oil not only doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I just love the scent!      I got the small bottle and it&#x27;s lasted me over a year. I don&#x27;t wear every day, but still think I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of use from this small bottle!    If you like patchouli but have trouble finding those without additives that make the oil change scent after awhile or give you headaches, try this one.

            <li> after spiritual sky changed manufacturers i looked for a comparable patchouli scent and found it with the plantlife  brand.  initially i recommend you buy a 10 ml then after you sample it (i&#x27;m sure you will like it)  you can order the bigger 30 ml size which i do on a regular basis  great quality oil without all the dragons and wizards and crazy stuff---a more refined mature product for those who want the best!!!!  --sunshinemacaroni</li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected. I was looking for a fragrance to give as a gift and this was not the product I thought.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived on time and was what I had expected. I look forward to dealing with them again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I MIX THIS WITH WATER IN ANOTHER SPRAY BOTTLE AND IT SMELLS GREAT.  WILL LAST A LONG TIME DUE TO DILUTING.</li>
            <li> OMG, this is the best Patchouli! 100% Pure Essential oil. I wasted about $100.00 trying to order the right rich patchouli I used to get from the Body Shop. Finally this is exactly the one. If you are a true Patchouli lover, this is the one. I&#x27;m ordering a stock of it.</li>

            <li> GOOD AT ALL  FATA  FATI</li>
            <li> This version of Patchouli is not what I&#x27;m used to, but I like it a lot.  It has a nice clean rustic antique type smell that reminds me of a cabin in the woods.  I use it in a candle powered oil burner and it smells even better than putting my nose to the bottle.  However, the oil does burn a little fast and produces a bit of smoke.  But I love the scent and will definitely buy again.  If you&#x27;re looking for a Patchouli to wear as a perfume try Spiritual Sky&#x27;s Patchouli Musk Perfume Oil.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, bottle was bigger than expected, plus there were two left so I got both of them!</li>

            <li> Great smelling Patchouli as always...And great seller too. Love Plantlife, the service is always first class.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes a long way.  I used it on my truck carpet just below the heater vent. It has been refreshing for weeks, from just a couple drops.  I use it on my 110 lb German Sheppard after I give him a bath. He smells great for weeks. considering his activity level, that is a lot.    I love the natural aroma this stuff puts out. Not sure what the original intended purpose was but I keep finding new uses for it..</li>

            <li> not exactly what i was expecting but is ok i will try a diferent bottle next time</li>
            <li> I have purchased Patchouli soap and body lotion and they have a great scent.  The oil was too musky for my likening.</li>
            <li> So many times I&#x27;ve bought patchouli, only to get it home and realize it wasn&#x27;t the real thing, or smelled funny.  I decided to order this, and hoped it would be good, and it was.  Its a good sized bottle, will last me a long time!</li>

            <li> I have used patchouli oil for about 10 years in my home made laundry detergent. I have always used another brand but thought I&#x27;d try something different &amp; maybe a little cheaper. Plantlife smells wonderful, but there&#x27;s none of the wonderful smell I have come to expect on my laundry. I can pull out the clothes from last last season and they will still smell amazing. With Plantlife, well, there&#x27;s just nothing. Not even on freshly washed clothing.</li>
            <li> Received as described</li>
            <li> excellent, five stars plus.  It smells absolutely delicious.  Iam using it without having difficulty with my allergies.  Good product. and a reasonable price..</li>
            <li> the only stuff that smells like the real patchouli of the 70s. you can use very little and it gos a long way.</li>
            <li> I use to be a pretty major cologne wearer. Spending umpteen amounts of dollars on various bottles of the finest colognes. I flippantly bought a bottle of patchouli oil at Waterbeds N Stuff and wore a little to work. I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments. So....I wanted a more authentic patchouli scent, bought this, and got the same reaction. Awesome stuff. Lasts pretty long as well. Good buy.</li>
