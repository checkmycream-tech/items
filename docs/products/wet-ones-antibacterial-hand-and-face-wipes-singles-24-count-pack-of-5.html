            <li>It came quickly and great value.</li>
            <li>, I always carry this in a handy place--usually in a close backpack pocket, or in the top pouch of my cycling bag.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used this kind of wipes, and I love citrus scent, however, it is not citrus</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good price!</li>

            <li>The &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; scent seems more like pineapple/tropical fruit to me, but I find it to be a fresh and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I love the singles because I don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying up</li>

            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>They are much better than the travel pack.  </li>
            <li>I love these convenient hand, face, table, car, highchair, toy, etc, wipes.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews have commented on them being more tropical scented than citrus........</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a refreshing scent that men and women would like.  </li>
            <li>There are so many uses.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was timely and the item is a favorite.</li>
            <li>Have used these for years and am glad to be able to still buy them in bulk.</li>
            <li>I used to love these wipes.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I will be ordering more when I need more.</li>
            <li>this makes more sense to me.</li>
            <li>and they smell fabulous!</li>
            <li>But could have been more appealing.</li>
            <li>We love them and use them often.</li>
            <li>Well,  just pull one of these handy wipes out of your purse or pocket and you can instantly clean your hands with these singles and toss them easily away in the trash.  </li>
            <li>What I like best is when I&#x27;m in a restaurant and can use a single before and/or after dinner!  </li>
            <li>...and they are the best smelling of the Wet Ones.  </li>
            <li>The citrus scent has a nice fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>Nice and moist, doesn&#x27;t dry out and smells great</li>
            <li>, so they&#x27;re easy to keep in the car and use as needed without drying out.</li>
            <li>easy to use during flu season.  </li>
            <li>also easy to carry in your pocket</li>
            <li>Easy to carry and use.</li>
            <li>I can take them with me and never need to worry about being able to clean my hands.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry</li>
            <li>4 stars because while they are a fine product, they are not citrus scented.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, smell pleasant (I always make sure to get the Citrus scent) and when finished just wad up and put back in wrapper for disposal.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell</li>
            <li>&quot; if it smells like a cheap rum?</li>
            <li>Great to throw in your purse or bag, especially when you got out to eat.</li>
            <li>The individual packets are handy to keep in my jeans pockets so that they are always handy for cleaning up my grandson&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li>This individual wrapped hand wipes comes very handy.</li>
            <li>Tlhese wipes were purchased for a &amp;#34;ribs&amp;#34; party, and were very useful.</li>
            <li>We need to keep clean (my husband is prone to infections, being a post-transplant patient)  -  </li>
            <li>I also clean my hands before eating in a restaurant.</li>
            <li>I am handicapped and I use them to clean between my toes.</li>
            <li>They clean your hands.</li>
            <li>I prefer individually wrapped wipes, and non-alcohol, this met those expectations but an added bonus is the pleasant scent, a pina colada ish aroma.</li>
            <li>You appreciate these things when you discover how useful they are (they can make you feel safe and downright civilized in certain moments).  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for wet wipes, these are great.  </li>
            <li>The citrus-scent Wet Ones are great.</li>
            <li>I use them for makeup removal a quick wash or keeping my hands clean.</li>
            <li>this is true.</li>
            <li>Well worth it as they are not the cheapest available.</li>
            <li>good smelling wipes for hands in individual packaging.  </li>
            <li>While the scent is not bad, it is not what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Because they&#x27;re individually packaged, it&#x27;s easy to slip a couple into your shirt pocket or purse or whatever and have it handy...</li>
            <li>Mild scent.</li>
            <li>As others have noted, although &#x27;citrus&#x27; is technically correct, they don&#x27;t have a refreshing lemon fragrance as most would assume, but instead a nauseating pineapple smell.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these packets and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>A must for frequent travelers - wipe down your area on the airplane, the doorknobs and remotes at the hotels, so many good uses!</li>
            <li>Perfect size for planes &amp; travel .... what people say about the weird aroma is true, doesn&#x27;t really bother me , but it would be so much better if they could infuse a true lemon scent.</li>
            <li>Perfect to have handy when you&#x27;re out and about and need to wash little ones hands and faces, or to wipe down an eating surface when you&#x27;re traveling!</li>
            <li>It is a nice pineapple scent, definitely not cheapy or overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>I use them for the grand kids, my 92 year old mother-in-law, and all the time at the restaurant.</li>
            <li>, not all Wet Ones smell good to me.</li>
            <li>However, I find that to be a positive!</li>
            <li>I love the scent of these, but noticed they have parabens - will look for something more natural next time.</li>
            <li>The individual wrap is very convenient, it smells like pina colada, and is doesn&#x27;t take up much space in wife&#x27;s purse (good for travel).</li>
            <li>The scent is most pleasant and my hands clean up without any of the residual sliminess like so many other hand sanitizing products leave behind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It leaves a much better trace scent on your hands than, say, the standard &amp;#34;Fresh Scent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Thanks for the mission!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not one of those cheapy scents as the name might imply (&amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I had no issues and got exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Holy cow, I&#x27;m glad I always had them in my pockets!</li>
            <li>The large well-saturated paper clothes are large enough to thoroughly clean my hands and the steering wheel, too!</li>
            <li>smell good work fine, would rather they were larger, like for a small man&#x27;s hands</li>
            <li>; are usually large enough to be easily manipulated around your fingers and palms and face/neck.  </li>
            <li>Large sized wipes a plus.</li>
            <li>The standard red package smells like drek, but these have sort of a pina colada smell that is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>They smell like straight pineapple.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>I need to know that it will be ready to go when I need it.</li>
            <li>The packets are sealed in a mylar type tear-open packet with a plastic outer covering, so they stay preserved and ready to use even after years of storage</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I recommend this and know others will like it as much as our family does.</li>
            <li>Really like these newer &amp;#34;Citrus&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>These have Wet Ones have better fragrance</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>The citrus smell is nice and not too heavy.</li>
            <li>Very useful product because the towelettes are individually wrapped</li>
            <li>Like many other posters I think it smells like Pina Colada</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think the foil packages are entirely eco friendly</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other kinds of hand sanitizers</li>
            <li>more and more public bathrooms seem to have less and less available . . . .</li>
            <li>I use Wet Ones all the time out in the world of contagious illness and these little packets are great for carrying in my purse.  </li>
            <li>The bottom line is, they take up little room in your pocket or purse and really feel refreshing and hygenic to use.  </li>
            <li>As these are individually wrapped, they are handy and stay wet.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot find these particular ones at Target anymore:</li>
            <li>I keep them next to my chair for wiping off hands and in the kitchen for quick cleaning of hands after chopping whatever --</li>
            <li>Many of us have all been in the situation where we have no choice but to use the local facilities, and much to our dismay there is a lack of toilet paper!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I love having this little things on hand.</li>
            <li>Ordered these because Amazon didn&#x27;t show Germ-X, the ones I normally use and like.</li>
            <li>I put a few packets in my pocketbook and use them after touching items in the store, like packaged meats.</li>
            <li>Nice for small handbags!</li>
            <li>Sure, they still wipe fine, but for people who are sensitive to smells, this is a big negative.</li>
            <li>The fragrance can be a bit strong, so you may what to try a small pack if smells really bother you.</li>
            <li>so they are somewhat more durable in your pocket than the usual paper packets.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I opened my new package, because they have a new scent.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and product is as expected.</li>
            <li>I love these wipes--the singles can be hard to find in the stores sometimes.</li>
            <li>Also great for cleaning the dirty table before you have your coffee and treat.</li>
            <li>These were great to have for our daughter&#x27;s outdooor wedding reception where we served chicken and corn on the cob.  </li>
            <li>These individual wipes hold up very well.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the old citrus scent, these are not the wipes you are looking for.  </li>
            <li>Fresh scent with the well known quality of Wet Ones.  </li>
            <li>You can pack a few in your purse or pocket and it will be ready to use right before a snack or a meal when you don&#x27;t have access to water and soap.</li>
            <li>I washed my hands several times and still didn&#x27;t completely get rid of the odor.</li>
            <li>Our guests appreciated the wet ones for cleaning up after the meal.</li>
            <li>These little packs are just right for in the car, purse, backpack, etc.  </li>
            <li>your hands have touched a bit too much, from opening doors to using the bathroom to clutching railings on escalators or other structures?  </li>
            <li>I was always buying the larger plastic containers but don&#x27;t use them fast enough so they dry out</li>

            <li> , I always carry this in a handy place--usually in a close backpack pocket, or in the top pouch of my cycling bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this kind of wipes, and I love citrus scent, however, it is not citrus</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good price!</li>
            <li> Best for travel and always come in handy...love the smell, not too strong or soft.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; scent seems more like pineapple/tropical fruit to me, but I find it to be a fresh and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I love the singles because I don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying up</li>
            <li> So convenient and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Being in rehab, their are many opportunities to use one.  </li>
            <li> Love this scent....</li>
            <li> I love a choice.</li>
            <li> The wipes are more pina colada scented...  </li>
            <li> Love these things.  </li>
            <li> They were also perfect for cleaning our hands in public whenever the need arose.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.</li>
            <li> They are much better than the travel pack.  </li>
            <li> I love these convenient hand, face, table, car, highchair, toy, etc, wipes.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews have commented on them being more tropical scented than citrus........</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a refreshing scent that men and women would like.  </li>
            <li> There are so many uses.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was timely and the item is a favorite.</li>
            <li> Have used these for years and am glad to be able to still buy them in bulk.</li>
            <li> I used to love these wipes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> and I will be ordering more when I need more.</li>
            <li> this makes more sense to me.</li>
            <li> and they smell fabulous!</li>
            <li> But could have been more appealing.</li>
            <li> We love them and use them often.</li>
            <li> Well,  just pull one of these handy wipes out of your purse or pocket and you can instantly clean your hands with these singles and toss them easily away in the trash.  </li>
            <li> What I like best is when I&#x27;m in a restaurant and can use a single before and/or after dinner!  </li>
            <li> ...and they are the best smelling of the Wet Ones.  </li>
            <li> The citrus scent has a nice fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> Nice and moist, doesn&#x27;t dry out and smells great</li>
            <li> , so they&#x27;re easy to keep in the car and use as needed without drying out.</li>
            <li> easy to use during flu season.  </li>
            <li> also easy to carry in your pocket</li>
            <li> Easy to carry and use.</li>
            <li> I can take them with me and never need to worry about being able to clean my hands.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry</li>
            <li> 4 stars because while they are a fine product, they are not citrus scented.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use, smell pleasant (I always make sure to get the Citrus scent) and when finished just wad up and put back in wrapper for disposal.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell</li>
            <li> &quot; if it smells like a cheap rum?</li>
            <li> Great to throw in your purse or bag, especially when you got out to eat.</li>
            <li> The individual packets are handy to keep in my jeans pockets so that they are always handy for cleaning up my grandson&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> This individual wrapped hand wipes comes very handy.</li>
            <li> Tlhese wipes were purchased for a &amp;#34;ribs&amp;#34; party, and were very useful.</li>
            <li> We need to keep clean (my husband is prone to infections, being a post-transplant patient)  -  </li>
            <li> I also clean my hands before eating in a restaurant.</li>
            <li> I am handicapped and I use them to clean between my toes.</li>
            <li> They clean your hands.</li>
            <li> I prefer individually wrapped wipes, and non-alcohol, this met those expectations but an added bonus is the pleasant scent, a pina colada ish aroma.</li>
            <li> You appreciate these things when you discover how useful they are (they can make you feel safe and downright civilized in certain moments).  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for wet wipes, these are great.  </li>
            <li> The citrus-scent Wet Ones are great.</li>
            <li> I use them for makeup removal a quick wash or keeping my hands clean.</li>
            <li> this is true.</li>
            <li> Well worth it as they are not the cheapest available.</li>
            <li> good smelling wipes for hands in individual packaging.  </li>
            <li> While the scent is not bad, it is not what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Because they&#x27;re individually packaged, it&#x27;s easy to slip a couple into your shirt pocket or purse or whatever and have it handy...</li>
            <li> Mild scent.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, although &#x27;citrus&#x27; is technically correct, they don&#x27;t have a refreshing lemon fragrance as most would assume, but instead a nauseating pineapple smell.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these packets and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A must for frequent travelers - wipe down your area on the airplane, the doorknobs and remotes at the hotels, so many good uses!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for planes &amp; travel .... what people say about the weird aroma is true, doesn&#x27;t really bother me , but it would be so much better if they could infuse a true lemon scent.</li>
            <li> Perfect to have handy when you&#x27;re out and about and need to wash little ones hands and faces, or to wipe down an eating surface when you&#x27;re traveling!</li>
            <li> It is a nice pineapple scent, definitely not cheapy or overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> I use them for the grand kids, my 92 year old mother-in-law, and all the time at the restaurant.</li>
            <li> , not all Wet Ones smell good to me.</li>
            <li> However, I find that to be a positive!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of these, but noticed they have parabens - will look for something more natural next time.</li>
            <li> The individual wrap is very convenient, it smells like pina colada, and is doesn&#x27;t take up much space in wife&#x27;s purse (good for travel).</li>
            <li> The scent is most pleasant and my hands clean up without any of the residual sliminess like so many other hand sanitizing products leave behind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It leaves a much better trace scent on your hands than, say, the standard &amp;#34;Fresh Scent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Thanks for the mission!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not one of those cheapy scents as the name might imply (&amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I had no issues and got exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Holy cow, I&#x27;m glad I always had them in my pockets!</li>
            <li> The large well-saturated paper clothes are large enough to thoroughly clean my hands and the steering wheel, too!</li>
            <li> smell good work fine, would rather they were larger, like for a small man&#x27;s hands</li>
            <li> ; are usually large enough to be easily manipulated around your fingers and palms and face/neck.  </li>
            <li> Large sized wipes a plus.</li>
            <li> The standard red package smells like drek, but these have sort of a pina colada smell that is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> They smell like straight pineapple.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> I need to know that it will be ready to go when I need it.</li>
            <li> The packets are sealed in a mylar type tear-open packet with a plastic outer covering, so they stay preserved and ready to use even after years of storage</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I recommend this and know others will like it as much as our family does.</li>
            <li> Really like these newer &amp;#34;Citrus&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These have Wet Ones have better fragrance</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> The citrus smell is nice and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Very useful product because the towelettes are individually wrapped</li>
            <li> Like many other posters I think it smells like Pina Colada</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think the foil packages are entirely eco friendly</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other kinds of hand sanitizers</li>
            <li> more and more public bathrooms seem to have less and less available . . . .</li>
            <li> I use Wet Ones all the time out in the world of contagious illness and these little packets are great for carrying in my purse.  </li>
            <li> The bottom line is, they take up little room in your pocket or purse and really feel refreshing and hygenic to use.  </li>
            <li> As these are individually wrapped, they are handy and stay wet.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot find these particular ones at Target anymore:</li>
            <li> I keep them next to my chair for wiping off hands and in the kitchen for quick cleaning of hands after chopping whatever --</li>
            <li> Many of us have all been in the situation where we have no choice but to use the local facilities, and much to our dismay there is a lack of toilet paper!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I love having this little things on hand.</li>
            <li> Ordered these because Amazon didn&#x27;t show Germ-X, the ones I normally use and like.</li>
            <li> I put a few packets in my pocketbook and use them after touching items in the store, like packaged meats.</li>
            <li> Nice for small handbags!</li>
            <li> Sure, they still wipe fine, but for people who are sensitive to smells, this is a big negative.</li>
            <li> The fragrance can be a bit strong, so you may what to try a small pack if smells really bother you.</li>
            <li> so they are somewhat more durable in your pocket than the usual paper packets.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I opened my new package, because they have a new scent.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery and product is as expected.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes--the singles can be hard to find in the stores sometimes.</li>
            <li> Also great for cleaning the dirty table before you have your coffee and treat.</li>
            <li> These were great to have for our daughter&#x27;s outdooor wedding reception where we served chicken and corn on the cob.  </li>
            <li> These individual wipes hold up very well.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the old citrus scent, these are not the wipes you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> Fresh scent with the well known quality of Wet Ones.  </li>
            <li> You can pack a few in your purse or pocket and it will be ready to use right before a snack or a meal when you don&#x27;t have access to water and soap.</li>
            <li> I washed my hands several times and still didn&#x27;t completely get rid of the odor.</li>
            <li> Our guests appreciated the wet ones for cleaning up after the meal.</li>
            <li> These little packs are just right for in the car, purse, backpack, etc.  </li>
            <li> your hands have touched a bit too much, from opening doors to using the bathroom to clutching railings on escalators or other structures?  </li>
            <li> I was always buying the larger plastic containers but don&#x27;t use them fast enough so they dry out</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Discreet packaging, they lay flat in your pockets.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Living in the desert anything with moisture will dry out in a short time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Durable packages didn&#x27;t accidently open when they are in your pockets day after day.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent cleaners for skin and other surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the situation and people, they can be reused multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> There are so many times when you handle something dirty or germy and don&#x27;t have soap and water to wash your hands with afterwards.  </li>
            <li> When I go on long, all-day hikes for cycling adventures</li>
            <li> + on a roll, but find that no matter how carefully I seal the container they always dry out before I manage to use them all.&lt;br /&gt;These individual packs may be a little more expensive, but considering the fact that the lesser expensive packaging means more waste due to dried up wipes....</li>
            <li> Wet Ones single wipes.  </li>
            <li> Today for instance, I had some minor foot cuts due to a bunch of &amp;#34;foxtails&amp;#34; embedded in my shoes.</li>
            <li> Its not overly wet, but wet enough to scrub down your desk space, mouse, and keyboard.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using the Wet Ones for a number of years now.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve been harder and harder to find in stores</li>
            <li> I have used Wet Ones before</li>
            <li> That one always opens in my purse and gets stuff wet.  </li>
            <li> Kinda like the lemon wet wipes you get after eating BBQ ribs at a restaurant .</li>
            <li> The wipes and packages are small enough to be discreetly disposed of too.</li>
            <li> I never paid any attention to the scent other than to notice that it was pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very wet</li>
            <li> Only complaint: they&#x27;re NOT &amp;#34;citrus scent.&amp;#34; They smell like piÃ±a colada air freshener from an &#x27;80s-era car wash.</li>
            <li> the cost is about average for this type of product...</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I tore open my first wipe</li>
            <li> I had a friend get me started on these little wipes.  </li>
            <li> I keep a few packs in the car at all times.  </li>
            <li> Ms. Cypressgreen ordered a few boxes of these to take with us on the trip.</li>
            <li> I send one with my kids everyday to school.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the wipes getting dried out.</li>
            <li> I carry a few with me when I go to work, because sometimes I get ink or dirt on my hands</li>
            <li> They never clean them!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few years ago and was unable to find it in the local retail store since then.  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve carried the wipes in plastic containers in my car...</li>
            <li> Wish they were not so expensive</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I keep a supply in my car and in my purse--particularly during cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> You will be shocked at what comes off.  </li>
            <li> We hate to be without them.  </li>
            <li> FILTHY!!</li>
            <li> and there is no soap, or the seat is kinda nasty.  </li>
            <li> Not the worst smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. Mild scent. Individual packets to not tear in my pockets like some brands. Perfect on the go.</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance, effective and convenient.  Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I was expecting citrus, I got Pina Colada scent, which is not one I like</li>
            <li> Living in the desert anything with moisture will dry out in a short time. These individual wipes hold up very well. Traveling with our grandchildren requires sanitizing and these are excellent.</li>
            <li> I keep these in my purse at all times. I love the singles because I don&#x27;t have to worry about them drying up and I can keep a couple in my pocket when i&#x27;m not carrying a bag. One thing to keep in mind is that they don&#x27;t smell like citrus at all. They smell like straight pineapple. I enjoy the smell so it&#x27;s 5 stars for me.</li>
            <li> These are just great for those germophobes among us.  I keep a few packs in the car at all times.  Since they are each sealed, they can last for months without drying up, even in the summer months.  They&#x27;re also great for giving the steering wheel a quick wipe every now and then.  You will be shocked at what comes off.  Have used them for years and will continue to do so.  The fragrance can be a bit strong, so you may what to try a small pack if smells really bother you.</li>
            <li> Trusted brand and good price via subscribe and save</li>
            <li> Very useful product because the towelettes are individually wrapped, so they&#x27;re easy to keep in the car and use as needed without drying out. Only complaint: they&#x27;re NOT &amp;#34;citrus scent.&amp;#34; They smell like piÃ±a colada air freshener from an &#x27;80s-era car wash.</li>
            <li> Great for airplane travel, and these ones are the best smelling out there, like pinacolada. I use them for makeup removal a quick wash or keeping my hands clean. Now, I never go anywhere without them.</li>
            <li> I take these wipes with me everywhere and use them for my daughter&#x27;s hands as well as mine. I read that you have to wash your hands for 3 minutes to disinfect them. However, if you use wipes or liquid hand sanitizer, as soon as it dries you are good to go.</li>
            <li> I use Wet Ones all the time out in the world of contagious illness and these little packets are great for carrying in my purse.  Very convenient.</li>
            <li> We need to keep clean (my husband is prone to infections, being a post-transplant patient)  -  So, these do the trick for now!</li>
            <li> easy to use during flu season.  also easy to carry in your pocket</li>
            <li> This individual wrapped hand wipes comes very handy. The individual package is tiny and light-weight. You can pack a few in your purse or pocket and it will be ready to use right before a snack or a meal when you don&#x27;t have access to water and soap.</li>
            <li> So convenient and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Perfect to have handy when you&#x27;re out and about and need to wash little ones hands and faces, or to wipe down an eating surface when you&#x27;re traveling!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few years ago and was unable to find it in the local retail store since then.  At that time it had a wonderful lemon scent. This time I was dissapointed.  The scent isn&#x27;t any like any citrus I have ever smelled. Doesn&#x27;t smell like lemon, orange or grapefruit. I will use these but I will keep looking.</li>
            <li> I have used these hand wipes for years and wouldn&#x27;t be without them. They are easy to use, smell pleasant (I always make sure to get the Citrus scent) and when finished just wad up and put back in wrapper for disposal. I have a box in the bathroom, our RV and vehicles. Carry them in my pocket when walking the dogs, and always have some in my purse.</li>
            <li> We keep a box of these in each of our cars and in our packs when we go out bicycling.  There are so many times when you handle something dirty or germy and don&#x27;t have soap and water to wash your hands with afterwards.  We&#x27;ve been using the Wet Ones for a number of years now.  We hate to be without them.  They&#x27;ve been harder and harder to find in stores so Amazon kind of saved the day when we ran out of them I couldn&#x27;t find them in any of the retail stores we searched in.</li>
            <li> They seem to work.  The packets are aluminized plastic so they are somewhat more durable in your pocket than the usual paper packets.  The &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; scent seems more like pineapple/tropical fruit to me, but I find it to be a fresh and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of these, but noticed they have parabens - will look for something more natural next time.</li>
            <li> Best for travel and always come in handy...love the smell, not too strong or soft.</li>
            <li> I have used Wet Ones before but I decided to get the citrus this time. BIG mistake! Why would you name a product \\&quot;Citrus\\&quot; if it smells like a cheap rum? Like many other posters I think it smells like Pina Colada but I do not like it. YUCK!</li>
            <li> They work well and smell great.  I keep them in my car and at work.  I have had several people ask me about them after they have &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; some from me.</li>
            <li> Wet Ones stay moist and are soft on your hands.  The citrus scent has a nice fresh smell.  We use them after using the ATM, filling car with gas and before we eat something with our hands when we are out.  Also great for cleaning the dirty table before you have your coffee and treat.</li>
            <li> Great service. Nice for small handbags!</li>
            <li> I like this size to carry.  Being in rehab, their are many opportunities to use one.  Also good size to carry in purse.</li>
            <li> Great wipes...so neat to carry.  I never am without them.  Love this scent....but it would be so nice if they would market these in a variety of scents box.  Like maybe a box of different fruit scents:lemon, lime, coconut, mango, watermelon, banana.  I love a choice.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Used for travel and day trips especially during the summer on motorcycle rides/trips. Convenient cleaning that goes in your pocket.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the value but what a revolting scent. As others have noted, although &#x27;citrus&#x27; is technically correct, they don&#x27;t have a refreshing lemon fragrance as most would assume, but instead a nauseating pineapple smell. Life&#x27;s too short. I&#x27;m tossing them.</li>
            <li> It smells like pina colada which is great because I use it to clean my face after it gets oily. Its not overly wet, but wet enough to scrub down your desk space, mouse, and keyboard.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for wet wipes, these are great.  If you are looking for the old citrus scent, these are not the wipes you are looking for.  The wipes are more pina colada scented...  While the scent is not bad, it is not what I was looking for.  I assumed citrus meant citrus...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave 4 stars because while they are a fine product, they are not citrus scented.</li>
            <li> These are great in the car to wash my hands before eating after going through a drive through.  I keep in the car and in hand bag</li>
            <li> always nice to be refreshed before eating or doing something else.  always keep them around in car or purse</li>
            <li> wish they were a bit larger, but they are acceptable... the cost is about average for this type of product...</li>
            <li> Ordered these because Amazon didn&#x27;t show Germ-X, the ones I normally use and like. I opened one of these things and made the mistake of using it on my hands. Citrus my foot, it smells like a chemical pina colada--UCH!  I washed my hands several times and still didn&#x27;t completely get rid of the odor. All the rest are in the Goodwill box, I hope somebody can use them.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good price!</li>
            <li> The individual wrap is very convenient, it smells like pina colada, and is doesn&#x27;t take up much space in wife&#x27;s purse (good for travel).</li>
            <li> When I go on long, all-day hikes for cycling adventures, I always carry this in a handy place--usually in a close backpack pocket, or in the top pouch of my cycling bag. I&#x27;ve literally used them dozens of times. The &amp;#34;single&amp;#34; kind works best, since it&#x27;s always sealed. I need to know that it will be ready to go when I need it. Today for instance, I had some minor foot cuts due to a bunch of &amp;#34;foxtails&amp;#34; embedded in my shoes. Out come the &amp;#34;Wet Ones.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;âœ” Good product, recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;â™« A Review by Chris Lawson</li>
            <li> THese are great anti-bacterial wipes to keep around in your toolbox or glovebox or carry bag.  &amp;#34;Wet Ones&amp;#34; are usually large enough to be easily manipulated around your fingers and palms and face/neck.  The packets are provided in twins, so you snap one off as needed.  The packets are sealed in a mylar type tear-open packet with a plastic outer covering, so they stay preserved and ready to use even after years of storage (yes, I&#x27;ve verified this by keeping some stored for ten years!).  The lemon scent is a bonus feature.  It leaves a much better trace scent on your hands than, say, the standard &amp;#34;Fresh Scent&amp;#34; version of these wipes.  (Those are excellent product also, but they leave a more institutional odor after use.)</li>
            <li> The citrus-scent Wet Ones are great. The scent is nice, even for my scent-sensitive husband. The individual packets are handy to keep in my jeans pockets so that they are always handy for cleaning up my grandson&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this kind of wipes, and I love citrus scent, however, it is not citrus, it&#x27;s more like pina colada, even though it smells great, I would have preferred citrus.</li>
            <li> Love these things.  Hand sanitizer bottles are too bulky for my pockets so I carry these.  Problem solved!</li>
            <li> I recived these from a smily360 mission! Love the smell and the product! Easy to use and great with all this sickness being spread around! Thanks for the mission!</li>
            <li> Many of us have all been in the situation where we have no choice but to use the local facilities, and much to our dismay there is a lack of toilet paper! I was warned about this possibility ahead of time for a recent trip. Ms. Cypressgreen ordered a few boxes of these to take with us on the trip. Mr. Cypressgreen always kept two packets of these in his pockets. Holy cow, I&#x27;m glad I always had them in my pockets! I&#x27;ll just say that these are good for ANY exterior part of the body that needs to be cleaned. They were also perfect for cleaning our hands in public whenever the need arose. The wipes and packages are small enough to be discreetly disposed of too. I never paid any attention to the scent other than to notice that it was pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Discreet packaging, they lay flat in your pockets.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;Moist&lt;br /&gt;Durable, they didn&#x27;t shred when you used them.&lt;br /&gt;Durable packages didn&#x27;t accidently open when they are in your pockets day after day.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent cleaners for skin and other surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the situation and people, they can be reused multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;The actual wipes are flushable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the foil packages are entirely eco friendly</li>
            <li> These are convenient for purse, pocket, car, or camping when washing hands is not possible.</li>
            <li> Great to throw in your purse or bag, especially when you got out to eat.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It&#x27;s not one of those cheapy scents as the name might imply (&amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34;). It is a nice pineapple scent, definitely not cheapy or overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for planes &amp; travel .... what people say about the weird aroma is true, doesn&#x27;t really bother me , but it would be so much better if they could infuse a true lemon scent.</li>
            <li> I like the individual packs.  They are much better than the travel pack.  That one always opens in my purse and gets stuff wet.  These packs are the best if you like to carry these in your purse.</li>
            <li> I love having this little things on hand.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell and perfect for my kids lunches!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other kinds of hand sanitizers but I find that this one works out the best for me. I keep a supply in my car and in my purse--particularly during cold and flu season. The large well-saturated paper clothes are large enough to thoroughly clean my hands and the steering wheel, too! The scent is most pleasant and my hands clean up without any of the residual sliminess like so many other hand sanitizing products leave behind. I get these through my Amazon &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; program so that I always have them. Hand cleaning is the best preventative against picking up viruses. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These are so handy and have a great scent</li>
            <li> These smell delicious! They have a hint of pineapple scent.</li>
            <li> Good price, good scent and fits well in my pocket.</li>
            <li> These smell amazing and do the job. I send one with my kids everyday to school. If you ever want to be grossed out, send your kid to school with one, have them wipe their hands before eating, and then have them bring it home so you can see everything that came off their hands. GROSS!</li>
            <li> I love these convenient hand, face, table, car, highchair, toy, etc, wipes.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews have commented on them being more tropical scented than citrus........this is true. However, I find that to be a positive! Pina Colada?? Yes, please!</li>
            <li> I had a friend get me started on these little wipes.  You know how when you go out in public and just know your hands have touched a bit too much, from opening doors to using the bathroom to clutching railings on escalators or other structures?  Well,  just pull one of these handy wipes out of your purse or pocket and you can instantly clean your hands with these singles and toss them easily away in the trash.  I especially love the scent, which is nice and citrussy, and not just that antiseptic smell.  It&#x27;s actually a refreshing scent that men and women would like.  What I like best is when I&#x27;m in a restaurant and can use a single before and/or after dinner!  There are so many uses.  The bottom line is, they take up little room in your pocket or purse and really feel refreshing and hygenic to use.  I confess to carrying several, and I&#x27;ve shared them with friends in need and then I see that they become hooked also.  As a side note, when you buy them on Amazon, the 24-count/pack of 5 is so nice and lasts quite a while!</li>
            <li> I prefer individually wrapped wipes, and non-alcohol, this met those expectations but an added bonus is the pleasant scent, a pina colada ish aroma.</li>
            <li> These worked out well at our BBQ wedding.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and great value. Foil packets ideal as there is no leakage.</li>
            <li> smell good work fine, would rather they were larger, like for a small man&#x27;s hands</li>
            <li> I bought these to keep in the car glove compartment and I love them!  I never thought I would write this review.  They are oversized and have a lot of cleaner on them.  I was always buying the larger plastic containers but don&#x27;t use them fast enough so they dry out and I wind up throwing them out.  As these are individually wrapped, they are handy and stay wet.  Well worth it as they are not the cheapest available.</li>
            <li> Shipping was timely and the item is a favorite. I recommend this and know others will like it as much as our family does.</li>
            <li> great price and I cannot find these particular ones at Target anymore:)_</li>
            <li> Very nice hand and face wipes. Great for all sorts of occasions.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry and use. I can take them with me and never need to worry about being able to clean my hands.</li>
            <li> These were great to have for our daughter&#x27;s outdooor wedding reception where we served chicken and corn on the cob.  Our guests appreciated the wet ones for cleaning up after the meal.</li>
            <li> I had no issues and got exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Have used these for years and am glad to be able to still buy them in bulk.</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping in my diaper bag for on the go diaper changes!  Also great for cleaning hands when eatin on the go.</li>
            <li> I used to love these wipes. They had a lemony-citrus smell, which I prefer over the &amp;#34;fresh scent&amp;#34; type smell. I was so disappointed when I tore open my first wipe and it smelled like pineapple. It was distracting and after washing my hands twice I could still smell it. Sure, they still wipe fine, but for people who are sensitive to smells, this is a big negative. Especially when the smell has changed but the scent advertised has not. Meh.</li>
            <li> A must for frequent travelers - wipe down your area on the airplane, the doorknobs and remotes at the hotels, so many good uses!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  I keep them in my car and in  my purse.  I was pleasantly surprised when I opened my new package, because they have a new scent.  They smell like pineapple and coconut, not the citrusy scent of the prior ones.  I LOVE these packets and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes--the singles can be hard to find in the stores sometimes. These are so nice to put in the car, diaper bag, or my purse. The citrus smell is nice and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Wish they were not so expensive</li>
            <li> I put a few packets in my pocketbook and use them after touching items in the store, like packaged meats. I also clean my hands before eating in a restaurant. I feel I get a lot for my money since there are five boxes with 24 in each box. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I use them for the grand kids, my 92 year old mother-in-law, and all the time at the restaurant. You can&#x27;t go wrong. They are very wet so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the wipes getting dried out. I&#x27;m very happy with them. I ordered about 8 boxes and I will be ordering more when I need more.</li>
            <li> good smelling wipes for hands in individual packaging.  I keep them next to my chair for wiping off hands and in the kitchen for quick cleaning of hands after chopping whatever -- onion smell gone..  carry them in my purse for going out in case there is nothing in the bathroom where ever we may be.  more and more public bathrooms seem to have less and less available . . . . it may be a cost thing.</li>
            <li> I like them.  I am handicapped and I use them to clean between my toes.</li>
            <li> Really like these newer &amp;#34;Citrus&amp;#34; Wet Ones single wipes.  Fresh scent with the well known quality of Wet Ones.  Great to keep in glove box for those shopping/refueling clean ups.  Large sized wipes a plus.</li>
            <li> Good size do the job!</li>
            <li> they sure are handy!!! Use em on shopping cart handles! FILTHY!! They never clean them! Ask the store...they don&#x27;t even know! My pet peeve!</li>
            <li> You appreciate these things when you discover how useful they are (they can make you feel safe and downright civilized in certain moments).  I like the citrus scent; they are a godsend when you, for instance, use a bathroom and there is no soap, or the seat is kinda nasty.  I carry a few with me when I go to work, because sometimes I get ink or dirt on my hands and I just want to get it off.  Because they&#x27;re individually packaged, it&#x27;s easy to slip a couple into your shirt pocket or purse or whatever and have it handy... you never know!</li>
            <li> These little packs are just right for in the car, purse, backpack, etc.  In the past I&#x27;ve carried the wipes in plastic containers in my car... the packs that hold 20+ on a roll, but find that no matter how carefully I seal the container they always dry out before I manage to use them all.&lt;br /&gt;These individual packs may be a little more expensive, but considering the fact that the lesser expensive packaging means more waste due to dried up wipes.... this makes more sense to me.</li>
            <li> Tlhese wipes were purchased for a &amp;#34;ribs&amp;#34; party, and were very useful. I would recommend this product for hand cleanup.</li>
            <li> ...and they are the best smelling of the Wet Ones.  The standard red package smells like drek, but these have sort of a pina colada smell that is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and product is as expected.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry and they smell fabulous!</li>
            <li> They clean your hands. The smell though. Not too citrusy.  Not the worst smell. But could have been more appealing. Kinda like the lemon wet wipes you get after eating BBQ ribs at a restaurant .</li>
            <li> With all the phobia over germs why wouldn&#x27;t you stay armed with these handy and antibacterial wipes. I never leave home without them - and well - I have them all around my house too.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent! not too perfumey.Love It!! will buy again!!1</li>
            <li> These have Wet Ones have better fragrance and I prefer it.</li>
            <li> Nice and moist, doesn&#x27;t dry out and smells great, not all Wet Ones smell good to me. I keep them in my purse, in the car, by the bed (not that I have a midnight snack of Cheetoes or anything)for emergencies. We love them and use them often. They are great if you like to be prepared to fight germs while you tidy up your hands.  Very convenient.</li>
