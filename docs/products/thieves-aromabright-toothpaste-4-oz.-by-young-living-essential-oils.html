            <li>This is my first time to try this.</li>
            <li>trying this for the first time.</li>
            <li>Pretty bummed since they have discontinued the Ultra Dentarome line.</li>
            <li>Especially when paired with a waterpik flosser and Sonicare toothbrush, this toothpaste leaves my teeth and gums clean and fresh for hours.</li>
            <li>Anyone who will pay this much for this toothpaste please let me know</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>The tube did not have as much tooth paste as I thought it should.  </li>
            <li>That will let me know if product really works.</li>
            <li>use this every other day with Jasons Healthy Mouth with Floride.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel it gave me the same clean.</li>
            <li>Seems to work better than regular toothpaste on my gums, Haven&#x27;t been back to dentist for a cleaning yet.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam like toothpaste normally does</li>
            <li>Unlike quite a few of my other natural toothpastes this one actually leaves a good minty flavor in your mouth!</li>
            <li>Any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used was a full tube.  </li>
            <li>I have been waiting for Young Living to fill my dentra</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t tossed the old cap so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to stick with natural toothpaste for a while now</li>
            <li>Glycerin is known to coat the teeth and prevent essential minerals from entering your teeth and making the enamel stronger which can be very problematic.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste helps sensitive teeth and reversing gums plus whitens your teeth .</li>
            <li>I give this toothpaste high marks because it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that agrees with pregnancy.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty bland flavor, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting much due to the reviews and the fact that it&#x27;s all natural, but my low expectations left me pleasantly surprised.</li>

            <li> Whereas the standard toothpastes have made me feel nauseous or worse -- the Aromabright flavor is mild and the essential oils are soothing.</li>
            <li> Since the item is open, money spent, and the flavor is not objectionable I still feel compelled to keep using it for the purported health benefits.</li>
            <li> Slightly salty, not enough peppermint/spearmint.</li>
            <li> As an experiment it was used after one of Tom&#x27;s toothpaste but still didn&#x27;t feel like it made anymore difference than a wet toothbrush.</li>

            <li> (A second brushing is usually beneficial for me.)</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this product.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the Thieves Ultra Dentarome toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Because since I&#x27;ve been using this and the essential oil in a diffuser I haven&#x27;t been sick once.</li>
            <li> I expect &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; to be thicker; this runs thin.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Must have during cold and flu season along with the rest of the thieves line of products you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay $18 than be miserable with a cold.</li>
            <li> I knocked off one star for the outrageous price and another star because it has glycerin.</li>

            <li> Mouth feels very clean.  Germ free.</li>
            <li> Anyone who will pay this much for this toothpaste please let me know and I&#x27;ll sell you some ocean front property in Mo! This is awesome toothpaste but I pay half the cost! This is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Perfect and taste great too!</li>
            <li> Yes I love my thieves aromabright .  My dentist even bragged on my teeth.</li>
            <li> We have been using for over a month, alternating with fluoride toothpaste… no colds, flu or sore throats, so far….</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste, would highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> This is addictive. Leaves a fresh clean taste.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting much due to the reviews and the fact that it&#x27;s all natural, but my low expectations left me pleasantly surprised. I really like it a lot. I have been waiting for Young Living to fill my dentra plus -or whatever the fancier thieves toothpaste is- order for over a month, so it looks like I will be buying another tube of this in the meantime with amazon&#x27;s great quality and fast shipping for all their customers.</li>
            <li> One of the best things i tried,  I will never go back to regular toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks you,  no problems with this order,,,,,,,</li>
            <li> Love the Product but the lid did not work properly, it would not close.&lt;br /&gt;good thing I hadn&#x27;t tossed the old cap so could replace it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the taste.</li>
            <li> Makes my gums feel great</li>
            <li> reordered, good product</li>
            <li> I like anything that involves THIEVES natural oils -- great toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I was amazed that one tube of toothpaste was $20 on Amazon when it costs $8:00 on the website!!</li>
            <li> I love the taste and the feel in your mouth after using Thieves toothpaste.  I also love that it is good for you.</li>
            <li> I enjoy all things by young living.  This toothpaste left an after taste. discontinued using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it cleaned my teeth!!  My gums did not feel any different!  I think it was a waste of good money!!  The tube did not have as much tooth paste as I thought it should.  Only 3/4 full!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time to try this. Seems to work better than regular toothpaste on my gums, Haven&#x27;t been back to dentist for a cleaning yet. That will let me know if product really works.</li>
            <li> Who in their right minds would pay $18 for a tube of toothpaste? Well I&#x27;ve reordered this 4 times.  Why? Because since I&#x27;ve been using this and the essential oil in a diffuser I haven&#x27;t been sick once. Meanwhile people all around me are falling I&#x27;ll. I&#x27;d rather pay $18 than be miserable with a cold. Oh, and my gums look nice and healthy now too.</li>
            <li> Tastes great and my teeth do really feel quite clean after using.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every other day with Jasons Healthy Mouth with Floride.</li>
            <li> Only giving 3 stars because I&#x27;ve only used it once.  My problem with this product is the price together with amount.  Says 4 ounces but it can&#x27;t be.  Had to do quite a bit of squeezing from the bottom to get any toothpaste at all.  Any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve used was a full tube.  Not so here.  Better be really good stuff or won&#x27;t buy again.  And even then may not.</li>
            <li> I give this toothpaste high marks because it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that agrees with pregnancy. Whereas the standard toothpastes have made me feel nauseous or worse -- the Aromabright flavor is mild and the essential oils are soothing. Especially when paired with a waterpik flosser and Sonicare toothbrush, this toothpaste leaves my teeth and gums clean and fresh for hours.</li>
            <li> good taste and clean feeling. trying this for the first time.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the Thieves Ultra Dentarome toothpaste. Slightly salty, not enough peppermint/spearmint. Doesn&#x27;t really feel like it gets your teeth clean. Pretty bummed since they have discontinued the Ultra Dentarome line.</li>
            <li> Must have during cold and flu season along with the rest of the thieves line of products you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Excellent product essential oil in this product has a wonderful effect on teeth as well as lasting taste in the mouth not drying at all</li>
            <li> I got just what I needed in great time.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for a more powerful flavor of thieves.  The toothpaste also dries out around the edges of the dispenser tube.  It is a pretty bland flavor, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Gets my teeth white, kills germs and does not have toxic fluoride in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this product. I expect &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; to be thicker; this runs thin. It doesn&#x27;t foam like toothpaste normally does and I didn&#x27;t feel it gave me the same clean. As an experiment it was used after one of Tom&#x27;s toothpaste but still didn&#x27;t feel like it made anymore difference than a wet toothbrush. (A second brushing is usually beneficial for me.) Since the item is open, money spent, and the flavor is not objectionable I still feel compelled to keep using it for the purported health benefits.</li>
            <li> Works well, nice flavor. Not overpowering.  Seems to help my receding gum issue. The price though! Think I&#x27;ll stick to making my own.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the texture as much, but overall good toothpaste and refreshing</li>
            <li> A good, quick trabsaction.</li>
            <li> I love this. I&#x27;ve only had it a few days but my teeth feel cleaner after using this. I&#x27;ve tried to stick with natural toothpaste for a while now since I keep learning about all the chemicals that we put on/in our bodies and I&#x27;ve been trying to eliminate the ones that I can. Unlike quite a few of my other natural toothpastes this one actually leaves a good minty flavor in your mouth! I love it. (and my teeth are already whiter!)</li>
            <li> Tastes VERY good and is refreshing. Very pure product. It also has a very thin consistency and does not foam much so do not expect that. I knocked off one star for the outrageous price and another star because it has glycerin. Glycerin is known to coat the teeth and prevent essential minerals from entering your teeth and making the enamel stronger which can be very problematic. Look it up for yourself, there is a lot of material on it. Other than that, good product.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste helps sensitive teeth and reversing gums plus whitens your teeth . Love it</li>
