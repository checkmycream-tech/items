            <li>Good for medium length hair or longer.</li>

            <li>So that&#x27;s a good sign.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing volumizing brush</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I decided to buy my own.</li>
            <li>Really liked this brush</li>
            <li>It still has issues brushing through my naps, lmao.</li>
            <li>Nice quality.  </li>
            <li>Should have gotten the medium sized brush, maybe that would be suitable for the kind of hair I have.</li>
            <li>I loved this brush and was so excited to see it for sale here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush - easy to hold and makes adding volume a breeze with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Really nice helps my fine hair detangle easier</li>
            <li>Pretty good product, good quality, it does help a lot while drying the hair, specially if you like the brushing style or just want your hair to stay together.</li>
            <li>I hope that I will be able to choose my haircut for style rather than</li>
            <li>Love Conair, never had any problems.     </li>
            <li>I am no expert in styling, so most of the brushes I have used would leave my ends looking like a broom...</li>
            <li>so I put in an order for replacement to try it one more time.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I am ordering more of this Conair product.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s safe to assume that people drop their hair brushes.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>but I can add that it could be better.</li>
            <li>I love love love this brush.</li>
            <li>At first, I absolutely loved this hair brush...</li>
            <li>Wouldnt break easily.</li>
            <li>It holds hair easily and is efficient to make any hair style.</li>
            <li>A strong brush.</li>
            <li>so It is not so easy for me to return the item, so the best thing I can do is keep other girls from wasting their money!</li>
            <li>Hair dries smoothly and quickly :)</li>
            <li>It was love at first sight!</li>
            <li>This brush is so great that I bought three of them to put away for future use.</li>
            <li>You might want to consider a light one.</li>
            <li>It is such a great styling tool.</li>
            <li>Light weight brush facilitated ease during styling.</li>
            <li>Its fantastic and</li>
            <li>hair looks so shiny and smooth after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>If you would like more curl to the hair end, I believe you can easily roll up the ends on the brush &amp; blow hot air over it a bit longer.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair, so I love that!It</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush, can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I also own the smaller model and like it better.  </li>
            <li>it may be too large for most people.  </li>
            <li>I just love this brush, it really works in regards of leaving the hair with zero frizz and so silky feeling touch.</li>
            <li>This brush is absolutely the best for shine ,less drying time and styling control.</li>
            <li>Overall this might be the best under 10 buck purchase I have made in my entire life!!</li>
            <li>My hair dries quickly and without frizz.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to manage and it really does make hair shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth</li>
            <li>I thought my angled barely-shoulder length in the front hair would be too short for this large brush, but it worked perfectly - even for the shorter (approx 4&amp;#34;) pieces in the back.  </li>
            <li>A good brush but not exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I am not blessed with great hair - mine is fine and thin and lacks body, but this brush helps add volume and makes blow drying my hair faster and easier.  </li>
            <li>There are no trouble spots on the brush where the hair can get easily stuck and yank.  </li>
            <li>If you use a very hot hair dryer I don&#x27;t recommend using to close to the brush because the \\&quot;central\\&quot; part does heat fast.</li>
            <li>With this brush, it doesn&#x27;t take much effort to achieve a *near* salon-quality blow-out, even for someone like me, at best a hair amateur, and the price definitely makes me appreciate this brush even more.</li>
            <li>Have purchased 3 of them from Amazon (different sizes) and love them all.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>first couple times I used it</li>
            <li>really does the job, it doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this brush I love it.</li>
            <li>I needed a smaller brush I guess because my bob is shorter, so this one is okay</li>
            <li>Its a good round brush.</li>
            <li>As some of the others  mentioned, it appears really large in size, but somehow just really combs smoothly over my fine long hair.</li>
            <li>HELPS DRY HAIR FASTER WITH MORE BODY</li>
            <li>Whatever glue is used isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li>With this Conair Tourmaline Brush (Large), I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li>The bristles hold the hair and crest a taughtness when drying and the large barrel means that there are no kinks.</li>
            <li>Large means LARGE...</li>
            <li>I just wished it wasn&#x27;t so large.  </li>
            <li>and I like to style it straight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought them for my whole family.  </li>
            <li>I have very think curly medium length hair.</li>
            <li>Does not tangle my hair and dries out hair fast with the help of blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush and would buy again.  </li>
            <li>It works much better than expected.  </li>
            <li>This brush is better at shaping my hair than the $30 brushes that I was buying previously.</li>
            <li>Which I gave to my older sister.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand and model, just not the size.</li>
            <li>I got myself convinced that I needed to buy expensive brushes to make my hair look great, but this one changed my mind.  </li>
            <li>- it just might be that I have perfectly normal thickness that I was pulling out whilst detangling -</li>
            <li>My favorite round brush.</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed because if it wasn&#x27;t for the bad quality of the  brush I would have loved it, because it made my hair look so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>New design and</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t snag my hair and leaves it very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Very professional look with an affordable price.  </li>
            <li>The only thing negative I can say is that I am already seeing some bent bristles so it won&#x27;t last forever, but it really is a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair and this brush is good for blow drying and straightening it.</li>
            <li>so I think this large brush is too big for me.</li>
            <li>A little too big for my hands and caused static</li>
            <li>So Quality Assurance should have made sure they created a break-proof product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to send it back, as the postage/handling would be $3-4, and the brush only cost me $8, so I&#x27;d be throwing good money after bad</li>
            <li>So far I like it smooths out my frizzy hair when blowing out Update:</li>
            <li>Other than that, love the fact that it matches my dryer and does the job but expect to use it when you&#x27;ve got extra time to rest in between brush strokes and work with smaller sections of hair...</li>
            <li>I use this brush to blow dry my hair straight every day.</li>
            <li>Oh, and as for the static - not perfect, but I&#x27;d say 60 or 70 percent improvement as long as I use it with my blow dryer - it does nothing for static if I air dry and use it for regular brushing.   </li>
            <li>and I have a hard time finding brushes that leave my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>it shines better than ever and no fly aways.</li>
            <li>I also really love this brush&#x27;s bristles, especially compared to some other drug-store brand round brushes with nylon bristles.  </li>
            <li>Using the round brush with the blow dryer is like using a very gentle curling iron -- it puts some body into my hair and curls the ends a bit, so</li>
            <li>Previously I would have described my hair as THIN, curly and easy to tangle, but now I&#x27;m not so sure if I really do have thin hair</li>
            <li>I have long &amp; curly natural hair &amp; this brush</li>
            <li>But if you are someone who does a lot of blow drying or takes a long time to blow dry (especially curly hair for which you&#x27;ll need to do a lot of pulling and rolling while blow drying straight) ...this may not be for you</li>
            <li>Mine hasn&#x27;t fallen apart like all the other reviews, but the shorter bristles started MELTING after my first use and now the long bristles are starting to warp.  </li>
            <li>(seriously, when I was a teenager my dad once had to use pliers to pull all of the bristles out of a brush that I got stuck in my matted hair), but I just had to try because the static was making me crazy, and now I am SO glad that I did.    </li>
            <li>believe the brush does all the work, because I blow dry my hair with an old \\&quot;pharmacy bought\\&quot; blow dryer and it still makes my hair look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> So Quality Assurance should have made sure they created a break-proof product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to send it back, as the postage/handling would be $3-4, and the brush only cost me $8, so I&#x27;d be throwing good money after bad</li>
            <li> So far I like it smooths out my frizzy hair when blowing out Update:</li>
            <li> Other than that, love the fact that it matches my dryer and does the job but expect to use it when you&#x27;ve got extra time to rest in between brush strokes and work with smaller sections of hair...</li>
            <li> I use this brush to blow dry my hair straight every day.</li>
            <li> Oh, and as for the static - not perfect, but I&#x27;d say 60 or 70 percent improvement as long as I use it with my blow dryer - it does nothing for static if I air dry and use it for regular brushing.   </li>
            <li> and I have a hard time finding brushes that leave my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> it shines better than ever and no fly aways.</li>
            <li> I also really love this brush&#x27;s bristles, especially compared to some other drug-store brand round brushes with nylon bristles.  </li>
            <li> Using the round brush with the blow dryer is like using a very gentle curling iron -- it puts some body into my hair and curls the ends a bit, so</li>
            <li> Previously I would have described my hair as THIN, curly and easy to tangle, but now I&#x27;m not so sure if I really do have thin hair</li>
            <li> I have long &amp; curly natural hair &amp; this brush</li>
            <li> But if you are someone who does a lot of blow drying or takes a long time to blow dry (especially curly hair for which you&#x27;ll need to do a lot of pulling and rolling while blow drying straight) ...this may not be for you</li>
            <li> Mine hasn&#x27;t fallen apart like all the other reviews, but the shorter bristles started MELTING after my first use and now the long bristles are starting to warp.  </li>
            <li> (seriously, when I was a teenager my dad once had to use pliers to pull all of the bristles out of a brush that I got stuck in my matted hair), but I just had to try because the static was making me crazy, and now I am SO glad that I did.    </li>
            <li> believe the brush does all the work, because I blow dry my hair with an old \\&quot;pharmacy bought\\&quot; blow dryer and it still makes my hair look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having always had curly, insanely easy to tangle hair, it has pretty much been a daily torture for me to deal with it - half a bottle of conditioner (chosen after trying hundreds of brands over the years) to comb through the tangles every morning, then spend the day terrified of the slightest breeze, and not daring to rest my head against anything for fear of the mats that will develop, then grit my teeth brushing it out and carefully tying it up before going to bed - no matter how tired, this was a must, and no matter how late I might be running in the morning, washing and combing through with conditioner every morning was also imperative to stay a step ahead of my hair felting into one solid dread-lock.    </li>
            <li> and oh my gosh - a drop of conditioner and this brush glides through my hair like a warm knife through butter - not one hair broken or torn out - seriously, with this brush, in a week I am not losing half as much hair as I used to rip out every day of my life!  </li>
            <li> so you have to dry smaller sections at a time.    </li>
            <li> Yes, it will still get caught in a tangle or two when my hair is dry, but without a doubt it gets through them 20 times faster, and with much less broken hairthan my standard brush, so I am still racking up the extra hair wet and dry:-)  </li>
            <li> I have a Brazilian blow out and have to blow dry my hair to achieve a voluminous straight look since it still has a small amount of wave.</li>
            <li> Prefect size for shoulder long hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and soft and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair at least twice a week (for about 10 years now) and I had never tried one that really works like this one.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to blow-out my long, thick, curly hair in a high humidity area.  </li>
            <li> With this brush I just blow dry and it&#x27;s tamed.</li>
            <li> I should have selected the next size down.</li>
            <li> First round brush that I purchase so its hard to compare it to others.</li>
            <li> And because of its \\&quot;in between\\&quot; bristles, this makes brushing thick (straight) harder since there is less contact with the plastic bristles</li>
            <li> It came on time and as expected.  </li>
            <li> The center is 1.5 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find one stong enough to hold my thick hair and actually work.</li>
            <li> Bought the same large brush about 7yrs ago and sadly the other week I dropped it on the ground and the handle snapped off.  </li>
            <li> My long hair never gets caught anywhere on the brush - even in the little crevice where the handle meets the brush head.  </li>
            <li> The other times I used it the bristles started to fall, so much that at this time about half of them are missing!!!!</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> and it does cut down on curl</li>
            <li> the only bad thing is that when I hit shows much drier because the paste is heated and makes off.</li>
            <li> Wish it would leave my hair with less volume but</li>
            <li> I wanted something to put a slight curl on the end of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair</li>
            <li> but with a little bit of volume in the ends.</li>
            <li> I should have gotten something a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Also, the tips have the little plastic balls on the ends so that this brush does not hurt when you brush it against your scalp.  </li>
            <li> coz this is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> and this is one of the few round brushes that doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair.  </li>
            <li> had this brush for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned round brushes before and bought this one for leaving in my gym bag at work.  </li>
            <li> whenever people see me after I blow dried my hair</li>
            <li> material(s) make(s) this brush heavy and rather uncomfortable on the wrist, especially if you have long or thick hair or just with prolong use.  </li>
            <li> I used to blow dry then flat iron my crazy hair.</li>
            <li> I have bought numerous brushes and have been left frustrated.</li>
            <li> Got this brush was because I was having horrible static problems - though from looking at it</li>
            <li> Maybe it was a defective brush not sure.</li>
            <li> And she usually tells me, when something if she likes it, or not.</li>
            <li> is not very good quality</li>
            <li> I have average to thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I find it Hard to maneuver on my head while blow drying it.</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait to see how thick my hair is a year from now - dare</li>
            <li> I have thick, shoulder-length hair</li>
            <li> and while I really like the brush itself it does not stay attached to the base after a month or 2 of usage.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong, but I&#x27;ve bought two of these and they haven&#x27;t held up with hairdryer use.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, thin hair</li>
            <li> I hope it doesnt break as the other reviews mentioned tho :(</li>
            <li> The worst part is that I have had it only for about three months...</li>
            <li> That I haven&#x27;t heard, anything bad about this product.</li>
            <li> Coming apart at the base .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought the same large brush about 7yrs ago and sadly the other week I dropped it on the ground and the handle snapped off.  I loved this brush and was so excited to see it for sale here on Amazon.  Fantastic brush, can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair and this is one of the few round brushes that doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair.  Have purchased 3 of them from Amazon (different sizes) and love them all.</li>
            <li> Got this brush was because I was having horrible static problems - though from looking at it I was terrified that being a born tangler it would get get stuck and never come out (seriously, when I was a teenager my dad once had to use pliers to pull all of the bristles out of a brush that I got stuck in my matted hair), but I just had to try because the static was making me crazy, and now I am SO glad that I did.    Having always had curly, insanely easy to tangle hair, it has pretty much been a daily torture for me to deal with it - half a bottle of conditioner (chosen after trying hundreds of brands over the years) to comb through the tangles every morning, then spend the day terrified of the slightest breeze, and not daring to rest my head against anything for fear of the mats that will develop, then grit my teeth brushing it out and carefully tying it up before going to bed - no matter how tired, this was a must, and no matter how late I might be running in the morning, washing and combing through with conditioner every morning was also imperative to stay a step ahead of my hair felting into one solid dread-lock.    Then along came this brush and oh my gosh - a drop of conditioner and this brush glides through my hair like a warm knife through butter - not one hair broken or torn out - seriously, with this brush, in a week I am not losing half as much hair as I used to rip out every day of my life!  Previously I would have described my hair as THIN, curly and easy to tangle, but now I&#x27;m not so sure if I really do have thin hair - it just might be that I have perfectly normal thickness that I was pulling out whilst detangling - I can hardly wait to see how thick my hair is a year from now - dare I hope that I will be able to choose my haircut for style rather than how well I can get it to cover my scalp?!  Yes, it will still get caught in a tangle or two when my hair is dry, but without a doubt it gets through them 20 times faster, and with much less broken hairthan my standard brush, so I am still racking up the extra hair wet and dry:-)  Oh, and as for the static - not perfect, but I&#x27;d say 60 or 70 percent improvement as long as I use it with my blow dryer - it does nothing for static if I air dry and use it for regular brushing.   Overall this might be the best under 10 buck purchase I have made in my entire life!!</li>
            <li> Really nice helps my fine hair detangle easier</li>
            <li> I have medium length, thin hair so I think this large brush is too big for me. I find it Hard to maneuver on my head while blow drying it. Should have gotten the medium sized brush, maybe that would be suitable for the kind of hair I have.</li>
            <li> HELPS DRY HAIR FASTER WITH MORE BODY</li>
            <li> Love Conair, never had any problems.     New design and material(s) make(s) this brush heavy and rather uncomfortable on the wrist, especially if you have long or thick hair or just with prolong use.  And because of its \\&quot;in between\\&quot; bristles, this makes brushing thick (straight) harder since there is less contact with the plastic bristles so you have to dry smaller sections at a time.    Other than that, love the fact that it matches my dryer and does the job but expect to use it when you&#x27;ve got extra time to rest in between brush strokes and work with smaller sections of hair...</li>
            <li> I know people write reviews saying ( The BEST THING EVER!!) ...BUT PLEASE TRUST ME ON THIS ONE. It IS the best brush I have ever used! I blow dry my hair at least twice a week (for about 10 years now) and I had never tried one that really works like this one. I have wavy hair and I like to style it straight but with a little bit of volume in the ends. I am no expert in styling, so most of the brushes I have used would leave my ends looking like a broom...With this Conair Tourmaline Brush (Large), I don&#x27;t have that problem. My hair looks salon style. It&#x27;s really easy to manage and it really does make hair shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the brush does all the work, because I blow dry my hair with an old \\&quot;pharmacy bought\\&quot; blow dryer and it still makes my hair look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t just buy this one out of the blue. A friend owns it and I would constantly ask her to lend it to me. It was love at first sight! That&#x27;s why I decided to buy my own.</li>
            <li> Mine hasn&#x27;t fallen apart like all the other reviews, but the shorter bristles started MELTING after my first use and now the long bristles are starting to warp.  I&#x27;ve only had this brush for a month.  I have NEVER had a brush melt on me before.  Will not purchase another Conair brush.</li>
            <li> I have thick, shoulder-length hair and I have a hard time finding brushes that leave my hair smooth. This brush is so great that I bought three of them to put away for future use. This brush is better at shaping my hair than the $30 brushes that I was buying previously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just returning from vacation where I borrowed this brush and immediately ordered it from Amazon! I thought my angled barely-shoulder length in the front hair would be too short for this large brush, but it worked perfectly - even for the shorter (approx 4&amp;#34;) pieces in the back.  The bristles hold the hair and crest a taughtness when drying and the large barrel means that there are no kinks. I am not blessed with great hair - mine is fine and thin and lacks body, but this brush helps add volume and makes blow drying my hair faster and easier.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush has changed my hair care routine!!  It leaves my hair smooth and soft.  My hair never snags or catches on it.  I use it with my ionic hair drier and it is great.  I would not hesitate to buy this again!</li>
            <li> Large means LARGE... it may be too large for most people.  I would recommend the medium (or smaller) one.  This is a quality brush and it does a great job.  I also own the smaller model and like it better.  I highly recommend this brand and model, just not the size.</li>
            <li> Its a good round brush. But if you are someone who does a lot of blow drying or takes a long time to blow dry (especially curly hair for which you&#x27;ll need to do a lot of pulling and rolling while blow drying straight) ...this may not be for you coz this is a little heavy. You might want to consider a light one. Otherwise its great... A strong brush. Wouldnt break easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped this brush a ton of times and its never broke.  I&#x27;ve bought them for my whole family.  Still no breaks.  My favorite round brush.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend karina loves this product</li>
            <li> Great brush. It is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Prefect size for shoulder long hair. Make my morning easier.</li>
            <li> So far I like it smooths out my frizzy hair when blowing out Update: had this brush for a few weeks now and it started falling apart all the bristles are coming out in bunches . Coming apart at the base . Really liked this brush first couple times I used it so I put in an order for replacement to try it one more time. Maybe it was a defective brush not sure.</li>
            <li> Amazing volumizing brush</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. I saw the reviews but had to try it myself. It is such a great styling tool. It makes my hair shiny and soft and fluffy.  I have fine, straight hair, so I love that!It definitely doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> It came on time and as expected.  I just wished it wasn&#x27;t so large.  I should have selected the next size down.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I have long &amp; curly natural hair &amp; this brush really does the job, it doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair! Love it</li>
            <li> I use this brush to blow dry my hair straight every day. It don&#x27;t snag my hair and leaves it very soft and shiny. I have a Brazilian blow out and have to blow dry my hair to achieve a voluminous straight look since it still has a small amount of wave. I would definitely recommend this brush I love it.</li>
            <li> Nice brush - easy to hold and makes adding volume a breeze with a blow dryer. I have used it about 10 times already and it makes styling my blowout really simple. The only thing negative I can say is that I am already seeing some bent bristles so it won&#x27;t last forever, but it really is a great brush for the price.</li>
            <li> I needed a smaller brush I guess because my bob is shorter, so this one is okay but maybe not for short hair.</li>
            <li> Light weight brush facilitated ease during styling.</li>
            <li> It holds hair easily and is efficient to make any hair style. good!</li>
            <li> I have very think curly medium length hair. Lots of brushes I&#x27;ve tried won&#x27;t go through my hair......this works like a dream. Hair dries smoothly and quickly :)</li>
            <li> I got myself convinced that I needed to buy expensive brushes to make my hair look great, but this one changed my mind.  My hair dries quickly and without frizz.  My long hair never gets caught anywhere on the brush - even in the little crevice where the handle meets the brush head.  An excellent buy!</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely the best for shine ,less drying time and styling control. I have thick coarse shoulder length hair. When I use this brush ( I have several kinds) it shines better than ever and no fly aways. That&#x27;s why I am ordering more of this Conair product. Well worth it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned round brushes before and bought this one for leaving in my gym bag at work.  Using the round brush with the blow dryer is like using a very gentle curling iron -- it puts some body into my hair and curls the ends a bit, so whenever people see me after I blow dried my hair they think I got my hair done or something (compared to always just wearing it in a ponytail) and ask &amp;#34;Are you going somewhere special?&amp;#34;  Works great!</li>
            <li> Hi all,&lt;br /&gt;This would be the perfect hair brush, except that I dropped it about 3 feet &amp; it broke in half.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s safe to assume that people drop their hair brushes. So Quality Assurance should have made sure they created a break-proof product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to send it back, as the postage/handling would be $3-4, and the brush only cost me $8, so I&#x27;d be throwing good money after bad</li>
            <li> I should have gotten something a little stronger. It still has issues brushing through my naps, lmao.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and this brush is good for blow drying and straightening it.</li>
            <li> At first, I absolutely loved this hair brush... Until it started falling apart... The second time I used it, it broke in two pieces, but with some glue I could fix it. The other times I used it the bristles started to fall, so much that at this time about half of them are missing!!!! The worst part is that I have had it only for about three months... I am very dissapointed because if it wasn&#x27;t for the bad quality of the  brush I would have loved it, because it made my hair look so soft and smooth. I am not a U.S. resident so It is not so easy for me to return the item, so the best thing I can do is keep other girls from wasting their money!</li>
            <li> Not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong, but I&#x27;ve bought two of these and they haven&#x27;t held up with hairdryer use. ( which is only one or two times per week...) Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. I used to blow dry then flat iron my crazy hair. With this brush I just blow dry and it&#x27;s tamed.</li>
            <li> As some of the others  mentioned, it appears really large in size, but somehow just really combs smoothly over my fine long hair. I have average to thin hair.  And it just gives my hair shine &amp; smoothness like out of the saloon &amp; gives me a good curl at the end of my hair.  If you would like more curl to the hair end, I believe you can easily roll up the ends on the brush &amp; blow hot air over it a bit longer. I have not tried doing it that yet as am often in a rush to get to work. Perhaps will try one day.</li>
            <li> First round brush that I purchase so its hard to compare it to others. Over all it gets to job done in styling my hair but I can add that it could be better. Does not tangle my hair and dries out hair fast with the help of blow dryer. Wish it would leave my hair with less volume but that is just a work in progress.</li>
            <li> Breaks. I&#x27;ve gone through 3 of these now and while I really like the brush itself it does not stay attached to the base after a month or 2 of usage. Whatever glue is used isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> I love love love this brush. I couldn&#x27;t find one stong enough to hold my thick hair and actually work. I have bought numerous brushes and have been left frustrated. NOT ANYMORE! This brush is the BOMB! Thank you</li>
            <li> I just love this brush, it really works in regards of leaving the hair with zero frizz and so silky feeling touch. I hope it doesnt break as the other reviews mentioned tho :(</li>
            <li> Works great. My hair seems to get drier faster.</li>
            <li> Nice quality.  Arrived as described.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product, good quality, it does help a lot while drying the hair, specially if you like the brushing style or just want your hair to stay together. If you use a very hot hair dryer I don&#x27;t recommend using to close to the brush because the \\&quot;central\\&quot; part does heat fast.</li>
            <li> My brush finally kicked the bucket after about 10 years and I found this one as a replacement. Its fantastic and I love it!</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for my use.  I wanted something to put a slight curl on the end of my hair.  This brush does so and seems to prevent frizz.  Also, the tips have the little plastic balls on the ends so that this brush does not hurt when you brush it against your scalp.  I really like this brush and would buy again.  It&#x27;s just under 3&amp;#34; in diameter from brush tip to brush tip.  The center is 1.5 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush for a great price! The same brush is sold at drug stores for almost 12 dollars and I got mine on here for like 8!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush!! This brush immediately replaced my CHI ceramic brush (+$30)&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks so shiny and smooth after blow drying.  Very professional look with an affordable price.  I will definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Good for medium length hair or longer. Does not tug hair. Great for straightening and it does cut down on curl/frizz.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this.  I bought one for more in the drugstore and am sorry I did.  This one is good quality, good price.</li>
            <li> A little too big for my hands and caused static</li>
            <li> the only bad thing is that when I hit shows much drier because the paste is heated and makes off. is not very good quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically what i said. About the smartphone covers. That I haven&#x27;t heard, anything bad about this product. Which I gave to my older sister. And she usually tells me, when something if she likes it, or not. And she has not yet. So that&#x27;s a good sign.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to blow-out my long, thick, curly hair in a high humidity area.  It works much better than expected.  There are no trouble spots on the brush where the hair can get easily stuck and yank.  I thought it might be a problem that there are no holes to promote air movement, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any.  I also really love this brush&#x27;s bristles, especially compared to some other drug-store brand round brushes with nylon bristles.  With this brush, it doesn&#x27;t take much effort to achieve a *near* salon-quality blow-out, even for someone like me, at best a hair amateur, and the price definitely makes me appreciate this brush even more.</li>
            <li> A good brush but not exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
