            <li>Best mascara ever!  </li>
            <li>Needed to use a Q tip to make the lashes curl up - again, still trying to figure out the best brush angle.</li>
            <li>and ive applied it to my bottom lashes flawlessly..</li>
            <li>that great product and do recommend!!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly -  I like it!  </li>
            <li>Lengthens and thickens beautifully.</li>
            <li>It sounded like a great idea.  </li>
            <li>I wore this mascsra all day &amp; the staying power is really great.</li>
            <li>My lashes have never looked so amazing!  </li>
            <li>The brush on this product is wonderful - it allows you to easily layer mascara.  </li>
            <li>but it still was a good buy.</li>
            <li>I like my maybelline much more!  </li>
            <li>Nice try Avon</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lashes look so nice</li>
            <li>this mascara makes applying mascara very easy.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>but I do love this mascara.</li>
            <li>use an eyelash curler and it&#x27;ll look even better.</li>
            <li>I used two coats, and still used another mascara on top of it to make them look thicker, but I truly love this product.</li>
            <li>avon is selling it for more than triple what I paid at amazon.</li>
            <li>Overall,  I am happy I tried this product out!</li>
            <li>Some smudging, but I do have that issue with most mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I truly love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I received this from my sister in law who sells avon products and she gve me a sample, im in love.</li>
            <li>so i never put mascara on those i just do the top and leave unsatisfied</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t have any problem removing the mascara, it came off easily as I removed my makeup with a towelette &amp; cleansing.</li>
            <li>You can move the brush up &amp; down depending on what works best for you.</li>
            <li>it is so tiny and the mascara isnt clump free great quality.  </li>
            <li>My lashes looked long and clump free, it also worked great on my bottom lashes too.  </li>
            <li>It has a unique brush which can be bend any way i wish, making application easier.</li>
            <li>The unique brush also separates my lashes (so</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product when I read the description.  </li>
            <li>and I could not get the top off in the first place.  </li>
            <li>To everyone&#x27;s credit the return procedure was quick and smooth.</li>
            <li>Ok ladies if youre like me and have been wearing mascara long enough that you feel youre good at applying but can never master the bottom lashes: this mascara is for you!!</li>
            <li>one coat will cover all your lashes, but if you want to layer coats to make more volume and fullness like i do, you&#x27;ll get clumps pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>overall i think this is a really good product.</li>
            <li>also, it clumps pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Recieved this quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the new approach to the brush.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is runny and the wand is just too hard to work with...not a good purchase!</li>
            <li>My left top lashes have a natural downward curl, and this is the only mascara that lifts them up and makes them look great.  </li>
            <li>so I curled them first and then tried to apply this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I just recently got this mascara and fell in love with it,it makes my eyet&lt;br</li>
            <li>it does take getting used to but it makes lashes look so good that the downsides aren&#x27;t such a big deal.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite mascara and not my least favorite.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a fun new product to try.  </li>
            <li>firstly, you need a steady hand.</li>
            <li>Okay mascara, fun to apply  - but no special effects.</li>
            <li>product at all color is good brush is hard to use</li>
            <li>BUT â€¦ I really really like this.  </li>
            <li>In one swipe this brush covers my whole eye with mascara</li>
            <li>Maybe this would work for some people but not so much for me.</li>
            <li>I think I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>but I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clump at all, it went on so smooth, and made my lashes look so long and separated them.</li>
            <li>It could just be this particular one</li>
            <li>I was a bit apprehensive about buying this mascara because of the negative reviews, but I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the top won&#x27;t stay on after a few times of using it.  </li>
            <li>The brush is not hard to use at all.</li>
            <li>Perhaps mine was just defective,and as I said, they took it right back-</li>
            <li>This was kind of dried up when I received it and thought I would try this approach to applying mascara since it is done differently using this applicator.</li>
            <li>Then I tried to put this on first and curl my lashes second.  </li>
            <li>the one i received seem like old product!</li>
            <li>it dried out very quickly -</li>
            <li>Avon must have paid magazines and yahoo some big bucks to get the positive reviews published.</li>
            <li>otherwise it&#x27;s going to be a huge mess.</li>
            <li>A little odd to use at first but a good product, not too wet and not crumbly.</li>
            <li>but I will go back to the old way of applying mascara</li>
            <li>A little difficulty getting the brush to click in to the right angle,</li>
            <li>Buy it only if you want to play with a new toy, not because you expect super-performance - the actual mascara is pretty average.</li>
            <li>and coats tiny / new eyelashes especially at the corner of each eye (making them look fuller).</li>
            <li>My only complaint is this dries out very, very quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll go back to my regular old mascara.  </li>
            <li>i used to get compliments on how long and full my lashes looked while wearing this, so i do like this product and how it looks, but there are a few downsides.</li>
            <li>the only con I have about this product is the size it looked alot bigger in the picture but surprised me with how small it was when I first opened it up all then</li>

            <li> The only thing I got was clumps of wet, runny mascara on my lashes and splotches of mascara all over my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit smaller than I expected,  </li>
            <li> also, another pro, is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> I put the cap in as instructed and it was dry within 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Dry mascara is a hazard, so it had to go in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Others may like a dry lash, so</li>
            <li> It took a few times to get the hang of the brush because it&#x27;s big and fat</li>
            <li> I have thin, straight lashes</li>
            <li> as expected</li>
            <li> I expected</li>
            <li> but, I&#x27;m not interested in retrying it.</li>
            <li> all my other mascaras loreal, maybelline</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very dark and it does make the lashes VERY long.</li>
            <li> It is not like a conventional mascara &amp; may take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> Unless you like the look of black globs on your lashes and cheeks and lids, run the other direction.</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to put on the first time but after a little practice it&#x27;s easier.</li>
            <li> My lashes were still curled, and there wasn&#x27;t any black rings underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> Lashes are black, long thick and doesn&#x27;t run - lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> I gave this mascara number 3 because first of all the brush is awkward to use</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting use to holding on to the handle, but after that the color goes on faster.  </li>
            <li> It is a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> i lost the cap to mine and it still hasn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself was dried out.</li>
            <li> I use mine everyday, and it needs replaced monthly at longest.</li>
            <li> it will be very difficult to do, be messy, and look strange because it makes the lashes SO long.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, my eyes usually look a bit smudged at the corners.</li>
            <li> It is messy, impossible to apply without looking like a two year old did it, and it won&#x27;t come off without nuclear-strength remover.</li>
            <li> what a mess!!</li>
            <li> The mascara brush is near impossible to use.</li>
            <li> just because I didn&#x27;t become of a lover of the product doesn&#x27;t mean someone else will.</li>
            <li> Brush is a little uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Very clumsy.</li>
            <li> That was an even worse idea.  </li>
            <li> Not the dramatic eyelashed</li>
            <li> If you get mascara under your eyes you must be doing it wrong because the brush makes it impossible to even mess up your makeup.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the execution leaves alot to be desired.  </li>
            <li> I woke up with a horrible red rash.  </li>
            <li> The box is already opened and it looks been used  :(((</li>
            <li> Just awful.</li>
            <li> Worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Surprisingly -  I like it!  It took a few times to get the hang of the brush because it&#x27;s big and fat and I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like it BUT â€¦ I really really like this.  In one swipe this brush covers my whole eye with mascara AND it curls them at the same time!  Lashes are black, long thick and doesn&#x27;t run - lasts all day.  It&#x27;s like a hair brush for you lashes - you comb your lashes like you would comb or brush your hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Will definantely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara. It has a unique brush which can be bend any way i wish, making application easier. The unique brush also separates my lashes (so no clumping- Yay!) and coats tiny / new eyelashes especially at the corner of each eye (making them look fuller). However, it is not waterproof. At the end of the day, my eyes usually look a bit smudged at the corners. That&#x27;s my only problem.</li>
            <li> This was kind of dried up when I received it and thought I would try this approach to applying mascara since it is done differently using this applicator. Nice try Avon but I will go back to the old way of applying mascara</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product when I read the description.  It sounded like a great idea.  Unfortunately the execution leaves alot to be desired.  I have thin, straight lashes so I curled them first and then tried to apply this mascara.  The only thing I got was clumps of wet, runny mascara on my lashes and splotches of mascara all over my eyelids.  Then I tried to put this on first and curl my lashes second.  That was an even worse idea.  So I fed this to my trash can and I&#x27;ll go back to my regular old mascara.  Maybe this would work for some people but not so much for me.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever!  Lengthens and thickens beautifully.</li>
            <li> what a mess!! it gets  everywhere when opening. it didnt do anything to help with my beauty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for everybody and it takes getting used to, but I do love this mascara. it&#x27;s very dark and it does make the lashes VERY long. use an eyelash curler and it&#x27;ll look even better. i used to get compliments on how long and full my lashes looked while wearing this, so i do like this product and how it looks, but there are a few downsides. firstly, you need a steady hand. otherwise it&#x27;s going to be a huge mess. also, it clumps pretty easily. there is a TON of mascara on the brush. one coat will cover all your lashes, but if you want to layer coats to make more volume and fullness like i do, you&#x27;ll get clumps pretty quickly. fix this with an eyelash comb or do another layer of a different mascara. also, i wouldn&#x27;t apply this mascara to bottom lashes. it will be very difficult to do, be messy, and look strange because it makes the lashes SO long. also, another pro, is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out. i lost the cap to mine and it still hasn&#x27;t dried out. overall i think this is a really good product. it does take getting used to but it makes lashes look so good that the downsides aren&#x27;t such a big deal.</li>
            <li> this mascara makes applying mascara very easy. It separates the eyelashes so that they look fuller.  It is compact as well. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Did not notice that it had mascara in it. I am returning mine.</li>
            <li> I had to return this product. To everyone&#x27;s credit the return procedure was quick and smooth. Thank you. The mascara brush is near impossible to use. Very clumsy. The mascara itself was dried out. Just awful. Perhaps mine was just defective,and as I said, they took it right back-but, I&#x27;m not interested in retrying it.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting use to holding on to the handle, but after that the color goes on faster.  I like it.  Thinking outside the box!</li>
            <li> This mascara worked just as described. It didn&#x27;t clump at all, it went on so smooth, and made my lashes look so long and separated them. I used two coats, and still used another mascara on top of it to make them look thicker, but I truly love this product. Especially for the price...avon is selling it for more than triple what I paid at amazon. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> the one i received seem like old product! ( the box re-taped)&lt;br /&gt;color as expected</li>
            <li> Worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. It is messy, impossible to apply without looking like a two year old did it, and it won&#x27;t come off without nuclear-strength remover. Avon must have paid magazines and yahoo some big bucks to get the positive reviews published. Unless you like the look of black globs on your lashes and cheeks and lids, run the other direction.</li>
            <li> I think I really like this mascara. It is a little difficult to put on the first time but after a little practice it&#x27;s easier. It covers well &amp; hasn&#x27;t smudged.</li>
            <li> The brush on this product is wonderful - it allows you to easily layer mascara.  The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the top won&#x27;t stay on after a few times of using it.  It could just be this particular one but it pops off very easily, especially when in your make up bag.  Will try it again though.</li>
            <li> I woke up with a horrible red rash.  Another reason to avoid Avon makeup.  And wash mt face before bed.</li>
            <li> ...it dried out very quickly - I put the cap in as instructed and it was dry within 5 weeks. Dry mascara is a hazard, so it had to go in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite mascara and not my least favorite.  It is a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive about buying this mascara because of the negative reviews, but I am so glad I did!  It is a bit smaller than I expected,  but I really like this mascara. The brush is not hard to use at all. It is not like a conventional mascara &amp; may take some getting used to.  You can move the brush up &amp; down depending on what works best for you. My lashes looked long and clump free, it also worked great on my bottom lashes too.  I wore this mascsra all day &amp; the staying power is really great. My lashes were still curled, and there wasn&#x27;t any black rings underneath my eyes. I also didn&#x27;t have any problem removing the mascara, it came off easily as I removed my makeup with a towelette &amp; cleansing. Overall,  I am happy I tried this product out! I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I love the new approach to the brush.  A little difficulty getting the brush to click in to the right angle, but it&#x27;s a fun new product to try.  Some smudging, but I do have that issue with most mascaras.  Needed to use a Q tip to make the lashes curl up - again, still trying to figure out the best brush angle.</li>
            <li> I truly love this mascara.  My lashes have never looked so amazing!  My left top lashes have a natural downward curl, and this is the only mascara that lifts them up and makes them look great.  My only complaint is this dries out very, very quickly.  I use mine everyday, and it needs replaced monthly at longest.</li>
            <li> Okay mascara, fun to apply  - but no special effects. Buy it only if you want to play with a new toy, not because you expect super-performance - the actual mascara is pretty average.</li>
            <li> brush is too clunky didnt like product at all color is good brush is hard to use wont rebuy product</li>
            <li> it is so tiny and the mascara isnt clump free great quality.  I like my maybelline much more!  No need to spend the money!</li>
            <li> Ok ladies if youre like me and have been wearing mascara long enough that you feel youre good at applying but can never master the bottom lashes: this mascara is for you!! I received this from my sister in law who sells avon products and she gve me a sample, im in love. Honesty all my other mascaras loreal, maybelline whatever do not work well enough to get all of my bottom lashes so i never put mascara on those i just do the top and leave unsatisfied but ive been using this for a week and ive applied it to my bottom lashes flawlessly.. If you get mascara under your eyes you must be doing it wrong because the brush makes it impossible to even mess up your makeup.</li>
            <li> I did not like this mascara at all. The consistency is runny and the wand is just too hard to work with...not a good purchase!</li>
            <li> The box is already opened and it looks been used  :(((</li>
            <li> A little odd to use at first but a good product, not too wet and not crumbly. I didn&#x27;t get any smudging all day on lower lash line.</li>
            <li> I gave this mascara number 3 because first of all the brush is awkward to use and I could not get the top off in the first place.  Secondly I feel there is not enough mascara in the container. I have to tip it twice to get the mascara.</li>
            <li> I found it to be flaky by the end of the day.  I prefer a creamier, softer mascara.  But, you never know until you try!  Others may like a dry lash, so just because I didn&#x27;t become of a lover of the product doesn&#x27;t mean someone else will.</li>
            <li> Recieved this quickly. Not the dramatic eyelashed I expected but it still was a good buy. Brush is a little uncomfortable</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  like the  product</li>
            <li> I just recently got this mascara and fell in love with it,it makes my eyet&lt;br /&gt;Lashes look so nice the only con I have about this product is the size it looked alot bigger in the picture but surprised me with how small it was when I first opened it up all then that great product and do recommend!!</li>
