    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Not the best of business practices, but is used by millions of companies.     </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a senior and my skin is awesome.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is great but the packaging wasn&#x27;t how it should have been.</li>
            <li>It is great for my skin even if it did not prevent aging.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find it on Amazon because  some of the products were sold out on the Dermitage Site.</li>
            <li>These two creams bring remarkable results...</li>
            <li>I used it for about 6 months loved  it</li>
            <li>But all in all it&#x27;s a good product and has worked for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very many wrinkles on my face</li>
            <li>I have used both Dermitage anti-aging and anti-wrinkle and the anti-wrinkle works much better for me, I would recommend using the anti-wrinkle kit!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It helps ageing skin look so much better!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Kind of dries out the skin and doesn&#x27;t do anything to hide or improve wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I doubt they get many repeat customers.    </li>
            <li>The cream feels refreshing on my skin, but after 10 days I cannot see any improvement to my skin tone or texture.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for over a year now and just love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was finally able to afford some cream for my face and chose to use this one.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results of this product.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it because I could not afford it any more.</li>
            <li>The more you use these products; the more results you will see.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and can tell no difference in my appearance.  </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; order process has happened more than once.  </li>
            <li>Most of all, I have seen zero results from this product.</li>
            <li>This seems Ok</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>As best as I can tell this is a scam to trap people into a single purchase.</li>
            <li>When you receive your receipt it explains that unless you pay to return the products within so many days that you will be billed $99.95 for using the products in the \\&quot;free trial.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I have ordered this from the original website and love it.  </li>
            <li>My opinion on the reviews pertaining to being charge monthly, read the fine print or just shop around and buy it from ebay or from Amazon like I did then</li>
            <li>This really leaves a nice glow.</li>
            <li>it aint free.</li>
            <li>I suggest that people READ the \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; information before submitting credit card numbers and then complaining about being billed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fortunate to find it via a source that does NOT automatically and unwittingly rope you into a monthly shipment plan with a dubious free trial enticement.</li>
            <li>I see people staring at me and some have commented that my skin looks so clear and bright.  </li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a chance to return it right away, so then I got another one!  </li>
            <li>At the end of our conversation she agreed to give me a full refund, which I did receive within a week.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many skin products and this is the one the really makes the difference.</li>
            <li>Trust me as a person who gets to hear about it first hand from a person who uses it daily,,, This has got to be good stuff</li>
            <li>And the whole free trial?</li>
            <li>After going on a spree to find something that would really work for me, a fair skinned, sun damaged woman of 50, I finally got around to this product.</li>
            <li>I called right away, and was told \\&quot;all sales are final\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Like several others, I hit the \\&quot;order\\&quot; button on the free two week trial without reading the fine print.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little sceptical that it would work, but I went ahead and bought it to try it and found that it does work good.</li>
            <li>I did read it immediately thereafter however, so was aware of the automatic enrollment in Dermitage&#x27;s monthly renewal subscription.</li>
            <li>This company offers a \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; of some of there products.  </li>
            <li>I saw a top ten anti aging article and this was listed</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and have used it for several years.</li>
            <li>I thought my skin looked pretty good before, but now that I&#x27;m using Dermitage, I realise what I&#x27;ve been missing -</li>
            <li>THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li>I have 4 boxes of unsed product if anyone wants them.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.  </li>
            <li>my daughter gave me this product to try and it really does work fast.  </li>
            <li>i will buy more when this bottle is empty</li>
            <li>and it was so much cheaper</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li>Claimed was new out of box, out of the box would have been ok, but the security tape around the container was missing.  </li>
            <li>The product duo works very quickly to produce smoother, younger, firmer skin which has been noticeable by people who see me daily.  </li>
            <li>It actually starts to work right after you put it on.</li>
            <li>Additionally, you will automatically be signed up to recieve new products every month and be billed for those too.  </li>
            <li>everyone around me commented on my new glow.</li>
            <li>It is nongreasy, smooths and penetrates immediately, and leaves the skin with a soft glow.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before, but I bought it from dermitage directly.</li>
            <li>I am 76 years old and have smooth skin with few wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have very few wrinkles, just some fine lines around my eys and mouth.</li>
            <li>She then offered me a partial refund, but when I asked how much, she hung up on me.  </li>
            <li>The bottling on this order was not the same as what I had gotten before directly from dermitage.</li>
            <li>They are broken off at the top so you can&#x27;t pump it out.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream, but the instant lifting cream on my last order was half empty and there was no pump</li>
            <li>and I had  been billed the previous day for the first month.</li>
            <li>I suffer from horrible acne and this product gives me a gentle peel leaving my face clear and beautiful.</li>

            <li> The product is expensive and feels nice, but for me it is not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to say effect on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> But your skin will return to its former inglorious self if you stop using it, just like any other topical treatment.  </li>
            <li> my face looks younger after only a few times of using it.  </li>
            <li> So not new.</li>
            <li> I used their trial products, and saw no real result after a month, but then received, and was charged $119 for,</li>
            <li> After 2 years of hell I looked like I had aged 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I called Dermitage on Friday, Feb. 25 to let them know I was not interested in the subscription.</li>
            <li> (I am in my 50&#x27;s) and one or the other of these products</li>
            <li> I thought I would try some other products, over the counter ones and the one Cindy Crawford is selling.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy it from ebay and just got the above set for $40.00.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase this product again, it was not worth the $59.00 I paid.</li>
            <li> The product was fine and was as expected since I used the product before, but I was a little disappointed that the Lifting Creme was not in a box or sealed.</li>
            <li> This is a subject that must include with its ingredients, MIRACLES. .</li>
            <li> When times got tough financially</li>
            <li> Just another hype that does nada, I am telling you dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I could be unlucky enough to keep getting broken ones?????</li>
            <li> After giving birth to my third child my face was uneven and just tired looking.</li>
            <li> It plainly states that you will be charged ongoing monthly charges,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used before and especially like to use the tube of Dermitage for applying on face before applying regular base make-up - allows base make-up to glide on effortlessly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Only a seriously expensive peel will do that.</li>
            <li> Just two small amounts allow me to use it on my face, neck, elbows and knees.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure what this lotion was.</li>
            <li> which are hard to find these</li>
            <li> Sent complaint no response.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this worked wonders.</li>
            <li> I wanted results and FIB gave me what I wanted, these other serums were a waste:(</li>
            <li> so I decided to try a few other ones and they are horrible.  </li>
            <li> You will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> THIS COMPANY IS HORRIBLE!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Like several others, I hit the \\&quot;order\\&quot; button on the free two week trial without reading the fine print. I did read it immediately thereafter however, so was aware of the automatic enrollment in Dermitage&#x27;s monthly renewal subscription. I received the trial product on Tuesday, Feb. 15. I called Dermitage on Friday, Feb. 25 to let them know I was not interested in the subscription. They said, \\&quot;too late!\\&quot; My two week trial was already up and I had  been billed the previous day for the first month. Of course, I cancelled immediately and they will not have any of my business in the future. As best as I can tell this is a scam to trap people into a single purchase. I doubt they get many repeat customers.    The cream feels refreshing on my skin, but after 10 days I cannot see any improvement to my skin tone or texture. I have very few wrinkles, just some fine lines around my eys and mouth. They look the same. The instant lifting creme doesn&#x27;t appear to do anything except clog my pores. I have not had a breakout in over 10 years (I am in my 50&#x27;s) and one or the other of these products did cause my face to break out.</li>
            <li> This company offers a \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; of some of there products.  When you receive your receipt it explains that unless you pay to return the products within so many days that you will be billed $99.95 for using the products in the \\&quot;free trial.\\&quot;  Additionally, you will automatically be signed up to recieve new products every month and be billed for those too.  I don&#x27;t know how well there products work, however, in my opinion, their business practices suck.</li>
            <li> THIS COMPANY IS HORRIBLE!!!! I used their trial products, and saw no real result after a month, but then received, and was charged $119 for, a refill order I didn&#x27;t request!  I didn&#x27;t get a chance to return it right away, so then I got another one!  When I finally returned it to the local distributor, they told me I would get a refund in 7-10 days, but I had to call Dermitage to get it. I called right away, and was told \\&quot;all sales are final\\&quot;.  That was unacceptable, so I asked to speak to a supervisor, but the operator wouldn&#x27;t get me one.  She then offered me a partial refund, but when I asked how much, she hung up on me.  I called back, a second operator would not get me a supervisor, and then she hung up on me!  The third time I called, someone hung up the phone without ever speaking!  The fourth time I was put on hold for 10 minutes, but finally got through to the supervisor.  At the end of our conversation she agreed to give me a full refund, which I did receive within a week.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY&#x27;S PRODUCTS!!!  THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  After giving birth to my third child my face was uneven and just tired looking. I saw a top ten anti aging article and this was listed so I bought some.  I had the company put me on a 120 refill so that I dont keep getting them monthly.  After just one use I saw visible results and after a month I was getting compliments on my skin and how refreshed and glowing I looked.  I have been using it for over a year now and just love it.  I recenly ran out and I have not renewed my subscription so I decided to try a few other ones and they are horrible.  Olay left my face feeling greasy and Boots made me break out.  I am going back to Dermatage!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It actually starts to work right after you put it on. It also uses herbs and botanicals that make your skin glow,</li>
            <li> After 2 years of hell I looked like I had aged 10 years.  I was finally able to afford some cream for my face and chose to use this one.  After using it for 2 months I already started getting compliments.  When times got tough financially I thought I would try some other products, over the counter ones and the one Cindy Crawford is selling.  I can tell you that nothing compares to this product!!!  I have found my way back to it and will only use this product now.</li>
            <li> Claimed was new out of box, out of the box would have been ok, but the security tape around the container was missing.  So not new. Sent complaint no response.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, but the instant lifting cream on my last order was half empty and there was no pump so I have to shake it out. The cream itself is great but the packaging wasn&#x27;t how it should have been.</li>
            <li> The product was fine and was as expected since I used the product before, but I was a little disappointed that the Lifting Creme was not in a box or sealed.</li>
            <li> I have used both Dermitage anti-aging and anti-wrinkle and the anti-wrinkle works much better for me, I would recommend using the anti-wrinkle kit!</li>
            <li> This really leaves a nice glow. The big thing for me is it is not greasy. I have tried several they always leave your face feeling greasy. Dermitage will not. Haven&#x27;t used long enough to say effect on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I fell for this. I have 4 boxes of unsed product if anyone wants them. the pump by the way tends not to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a scam. You will get charge hundred of dollars once you give your credit card info to these people.</li>
            <li> Just another hype that does nada, I am telling you dont waste your money. And the whole free trial? it aint free. I did a lotta research and found videos on youtube that sold me on FIB facelift in a bottle. The product dries in couple of minutes and instantly pulls your skin! Now thats what I am talking about. I wanted results and FIB gave me what I wanted, these other serums were a waste:(</li>
            <li> I love this product. After going on a spree to find something that would really work for me, a fair skinned, sun damaged woman of 50, I finally got around to this product. I spared no expense trying tons of products, so if you don&#x27;t want to do that, read on. This is considered medium priced in my experience.  Seriously, this worked wonders. It evened out my skin tone and smoothed the texture. It does &#x27;soften&#x27; wrinkles, not erase. Only a seriously expensive peel will do that. I always get compliments, so I know it must be working. But your skin will return to its former inglorious self if you stop using it, just like any other topical treatment.  As to their customer service, I have had no problems, but if you do, just keep what you have, ask them to stop sending it, and notify your credit card that you will not pay any charges from them. That actually works, they will stop sending it if they don&#x27;t get paid.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and have used it for several years. I suggest that people READ the \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; information before submitting credit card numbers and then complaining about being billed. Why do you think they want your card number? It plainly states that you will be charged ongoing monthly charges, Obvious?.. yes. Sneaky?.. yes. Not the best of business practices, but is used by millions of companies.     I usually buy it from ebay and just got the above set for $40.00. Pays to shop.</li>
            <li> The product duo works very quickly to produce smoother, younger, firmer skin which has been noticeable by people who see me daily.  I really like the product.  It&#x27;s fortunate to find it via a source that does NOT automatically and unwittingly rope you into a monthly shipment plan with a dubious free trial enticement.</li>
            <li> This product is truly a skin renewal skin care technique.  It is nongreasy, smooths and penetrates immediately, and leaves the skin with a soft glow.  Just two small amounts allow me to use it on my face, neck, elbows and knees.  It is great for my skin even if it did not prevent aging.</li>
            <li> my daughter gave me this product to try and it really does work fast.  my face looks younger after only a few times of using it.  i will buy more when this bottle is empty</li>
            <li> I thought my skin looked pretty good before, but now that I&#x27;m using Dermitage, I realise what I&#x27;ve been missing - I think I look ten years younger! My skin has such a youthful radiance.  I see people staring at me and some have commented that my skin looks so clear and bright.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 4 years ago however the company I was buying it from was charging 100 dollar for the lifter and the cream. I used it for about 6 months loved  it there was an immediate change in the texture and look of my face everyone around me commented on my new glow. I stopped using it because I could not afford it any more. About 2 months ago I saw it on amazon and it was so much cheaper I have started to use it again and I am not disappointed. I suffer from horrible acne and this product gives me a gentle peel leaving my face clear and beautiful. It does not moisturize though that&#x27;s the only draw back. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than any other product I have tried. I&#x27;ve used it for years and I&#x27;m a senior and my skin is awesome.</li>
            <li> These two creams bring remarkable results...I am 76 years old and have smooth skin with few wrinkles. The more you use these products; the more results you will see.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and can tell no difference in my appearance.  I even took pictures of myself each year to see the &amp;#34;improvement&amp;#34;.  Not there...I continue to age visually.  The product is expensive and feels nice, but for me it is not worth the price.  Additionally, a couple of times my order did not reach me on time, so I was without any face cream for the duration.  This &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; order process has happened more than once.  I have now ceased my order of this product.  I will use something else.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, but I bought it from dermitage directly. The bottling on this order was not the same as what I had gotten before directly from dermitage. Just one example, the directions on the Instant lifting cream states use one pump twice a day. Well the problem is the instant lifting cream comes in a squeeze tube. The second problem, both of the bottles had already reached their expiration date. Most of all, I have seen zero results from this product. I will not purchase this product again, it was not worth the $59.00 I paid.</li>
            <li> This was not the dermitage i&#x27;ve ordered before. i&#x27;m not sure what this lotion was.</li>
            <li> This is a subject that must include with its ingredients, MIRACLES. . which are hard to find these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can say is that it improves what all woman want to improve at all aging. . It works somewhat,&lt;br /&gt;but no miracles, this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee Evers</li>
            <li> I have ordered this from the original website and love it.  This seems Ok but all three times I have ordered it, the pump doesn&#x27;t work on them.  They are broken off at the top so you can&#x27;t pump it out.  This one will pump out sometimes...I don&#x27;t know how I could be unlucky enough to keep getting broken ones?????</li>
            <li> I bought this item in January and I&#x27;ve seen the difference. At first I was a little sceptical that it would work, but I went ahead and bought it to try it and found that it does work good. I don&#x27;t have very many wrinkles on my face but I wanted to start early and found that the few wrinkles that I do have are almost completely unseeable. My opinion on the reviews pertaining to being charge monthly, read the fine print or just shop around and buy it from ebay or from Amazon like I did then you don&#x27;t have to worry about being charged monthly. But all in all it&#x27;s a good product and has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this product based on the photo posted. I can&#x27;t believe that I was sent the white tube when the only picture I could see on the website at the time was silver pump. You will be disappointed. Don&#x27;t bother to buy this product,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used before and especially like to use the tube of Dermitage for applying on face before applying regular base make-up - allows base make-up to glide on effortlessly and smoothly.  Product arrived promptly and as advertised.  Would recommend to any woman at any age.</li>
            <li> The pumping device was damaged and I can not get to the cream. I have been to request approval to return it but I just keep getting replies on how I should just try to work with it.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot seems to help with wrinkles and as a moisturizer .  I would recommend it.  Great</li>
            <li> It does what it says and my spouse refuses to use anything different. Trust me as a person who gets to hear about it first hand from a person who uses it daily,,, This has got to be good stuff</li>
            <li> Although I am a man, I spend time outdoors and was looking leathered up well before my time. I tried this on a whim and my friends say I look years younger.</li>
            <li> Kind of dries out the skin and doesn&#x27;t do anything to hide or improve wrinkles. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Not Like they said... No istant lift. U really only need one of these product because they just seem to do the same thing ... Moisturize. Which u can buy at any store.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It helps ageing skin look so much better! I was so happy to find it on Amazon because  some of the products were sold out on the Dermitage Site. I have tried so many skin products and this is the one the really makes the difference.</li>
