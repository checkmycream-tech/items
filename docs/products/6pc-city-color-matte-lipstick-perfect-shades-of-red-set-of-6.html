            <li>That&#x27;s not a deal breaker for this set, it&#x27;s cheap and the colors are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fairly long-lasting, I just suggest a layer of a waxy, drier lip balm between re-applications.</li>
            <li>A bit 90&#x27;s, but still good.</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick, has awesome staying power and arrived quickly!</li>

            <li>, I love them!</li>
            <li>I liked them :)</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t bleed, they have good pigmentation, and they have pretty good staying power.</li>
            <li>This 6-pack is an even better deal.</li>
            <li>, well ive still got the best deal, most lipsticks in stores are ten dollars a piece if not way more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought the lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try more products from this line.</li>
            <li>so well I just love them all......</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more shades soon.</li>
            <li>this is an ok product.</li>
            <li>IN LOVE</li>
            <li>I love these, Francesca was favorite.</li>
            <li>I love dem.</li>
            <li>and I love love love my matte lipsticks, these are totally worth their price.</li>
            <li>True matte color and stays on through dinner!</li>
            <li>But they easy to come off</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d strongly recommend using a lip liner with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Color seems fine</li>
            <li>My favorite is Francesca, which is a bit more purple than red, but as someone who likes bright and bold lipsticks, I like all the colors.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the shades.</li>
            <li>Best lipstick I have ever spent money on in my whole life !</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t love the packaging; it&#x27;s a cheap cases with clear covers, easy to break, and easy to mash the lipstick on the edge of the case.  </li>
            <li>The colors are rich and bold.</li>
            <li>They are good but some of the colors look the same.</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t like these colors, if you&#x27;re looking for a good, cheap matte lipstick, I would recommend this product, as it comes in a range of other colors and groupings, also available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but, all you need is a little lip balm before and your all good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a few before I ordered this pack, through Ipsy and the City Color website, and they are so great for how cheap they are.</li>
            <li>I recommend to put Chapstick first because they aren&#x27;t smooth.</li>
            <li>Each color, so matter how light it looks is DARK and awkwardly bright when applied.</li>
            <li>and I have no problems being able to rub my lips together to help smooth out the color and such.</li>
            <li>These really are good lipsticks, it&#x27;s just that the matte finish is different to apply than a thinner, glossy lip color.  </li>
            <li>They arrived pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>These are indeed the perfect shades of red lipstick, all colors from bright red to a deep brown red.</li>
            <li>, I use a lip brush to line first though.</li>
            <li>My wife loves these, they last all day and the colors are sexy as hell.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had more colors, or the light Reds were a little darker.but</li>
            <li>/&gt;The colors are not exactly as my monitor showed, but there&#x27;s a very nice variety of colors, all in the red family.</li>
            <li>I love the colors but they are a bit too dry for a matte lipstick.</li>
            <li>yes they dont clot up, nothing has changed in the chemicals , just really push and grit teeth to use a couple of them, for the price</li>
            <li>And the shades are very flattering.</li>
            <li>These shades are nice &amp; long lasting.  </li>
            <li>But hands down I love them.</li>
            <li>They were long lasting and very comfortable when paired with a lip primer.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty matte and a bit dry</li>
            <li>Pretty and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Other than that pretty colors</li>
            <li>At first, I thought I&#x27;d gotten a batch of old dried out product, but no;  </li>
            <li>Colors are highly pigmented and need careful &amp; occasional application (smear a bit).</li>
            <li>I am honestly a fan of red lip and with these different shades of red, I can never go wrong</li>
            <li>I think some people might be bothered that they aren&#x27;t soft and moisturizing (they feel matte, if that makes sense), but they don&#x27;t dry out your lips.</li>
            <li>The colors last and is not dry</li>
    </ol>

            <li> some were dry, if you are a woman u know what i mean, the color, service, &amp; shipping was top notch, but unfortunately out of the 6 , 2 maybe 3 were pretty dry, can i still use them?</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re matte, and go on thick and pretty dry.  </li>
            <li> The color was too dark and didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> These go on extremely well</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about this at first</li>

            <li> They were very dry and hard to get on.</li>
            <li> I usually put some lip balm on and let it absorb a few minutes before I apply</li>
            <li> A few of the colors look alike, and the matte formulation is a bit drying, but I&#x27;m a sucker for these shades</li>
            <li> They are also extremely dry and difficult to put on.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find lipstick shades that show up on you</li>
            <li> but I seriously don&#x27;t want that stench under my nose.</li>
            <li> WTF?!</li>
            <li> The color and dryness of these lipsticks were so bad I returned them immediately.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells awful.</li>

            <li> I love the colors but they are a bit too dry for a matte lipstick. You have to moisturize your lips before putting the lipstick on.</li>

            <li> The color and dryness of these lipsticks were so bad I returned them immediately. Each color, so matter how light it looks is DARK and awkwardly bright when applied. They are almost like costume colors of red that you wouldn&#x27;t really wear for everyday. They are also extremely dry and difficult to put on. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love these! They arrived pretty quickly. The colors are rich and bold. They have a bit of scent to them which I don&#x27;t care for. And of course it dries out your lips a bit, but what matte lipstick doesn&#x27;t...? But hands down I love them. And I will be getting more colors!</li>
            <li> this is an ok product. Colors are highly pigmented and need careful &amp; occasional application (smear a bit). It has a matte/dry finish so i can use it as an eyeshadow for a pop of color. Overall, I am happy with the shades.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these, they last all day and the colors are sexy as hell.</li>
            <li> The color was too dark and didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love this product! Being a black girl it&#x27;s hard to find lipstick shades that show up on you Just like it does on the model and these did just that, I love them!</li>
            <li> It last for a long time. Great product!</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about this at first but OMG I love it!! Goes on smooth and is long lasting. And the shades are very flattering. IN LOVE</li>
