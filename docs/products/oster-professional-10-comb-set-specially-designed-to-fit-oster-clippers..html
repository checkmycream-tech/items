            <li>great product...bought it to use on my dog and horses while giving them a trim...works well.</li>

            <li>Also, a very nice bag was included to keep them all together.  </li>
            <li>excellent quality of this purchase, good price perfect fit</li>
            <li>/&gt;incase of # 0 (1/16&#x27;&#x27;) is very useful for summertime,it can avoid skin irrite &amp; cutaneous disease cause doesn&#x27;t cut hair to the skin!!!</li>
            <li>Of course these would be nothing without a clipper, but these are amazing!</li>
            <li>It would have saved a great deal of tears and money! :)</li>
            <li>i gave them a 3 they suck to use for the dog but worked perfect on my sons hair : )</li>
            <li>Love it, perfect, just what i needed</li>
            <li>SO happy i could find these!! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>However, they looked great and the quality was good.  </li>
            <li>If you own Oster clippers, don&#x27;t buy anything but Oster combs!</li>
            <li>They work real good so many to choose from .I</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and work great</li>
            <li>Works great and very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product that easily clips on with spring load design.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Build quality is excellent, as these combs have spring loaded metal clips for easy removal and changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>They are so easy to put on and take off, and fiet to the clippers so perfect.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quick and guards work perfect and were in great condition</li>
            <li>Very good quality, probably better quality than came with my Oster clippers.</li>
            <li>very good product for the detachable clipper fits most blades</li>
            <li>Very easy to use!</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>but when we needed a good dog clipper that would do the job he knew just what to buy.</li>
            <li>so I knew I would have a good experance buying from then again.</li>
            <li>The product does all it should, is as as advertised and was delivered in a fairly prompt manner.</li>
            <li>Snug, yet perfect fit.</li>
            <li>Good purchase</li>
            <li>Works great, nice cut with 10 blade under them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a good deal, too.</li>
            <li>They fit perfect.  </li>
            <li>Takes 2 seconds to figure these things out, but they fit the Oster 76 perfectly.  </li>
            <li>They are snug and good quality</li>
            <li>These guides were the perfect fit for my 76.</li>
            <li>This 10 pack comb set was the perfect fit for our Oster trimmer unit.  </li>
            <li>They fit perfectly on to the clipper, and work well with it.  </li>
            <li>These combs fit perfectly as were described.</li>
            <li>but I think it is a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li>They fit the clippers perfectly.</li>
            <li>I do prefer the metal blades over the plastic ones, but these are a good buy.</li>
            <li>superior quality.</li>
            <li>Definately a good purchase.</li>
            <li>This was exctly what i was looking for and was delighted to find it.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>These fit perfectly on my Oster clippers.  </li>
            <li>Combs fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>Excellent fit.  </li>
            <li>This was a good cheaper alternative though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good combination.  </li>
            <li>I recommend these two items together to give your dog good grooming.</li>
            <li>so I bought them and they are just as good a quality as the factory ones.</li>
            <li>They seem good quality and stayed on the trimmer without popping off.</li>
            <li>These fit perfect.</li>
            <li>these are good quality, name brand clipper attachments.</li>
            <li>I use them for hair and beard and they work equally good for both.</li>
            <li>These are good guards.</li>
            <li>Maybe on dogs with softer hair it would be a good item, but didn&#x27;t work for us on our wire fox terrier.  </li>
            <li>For starters, the spring loaded aspect works well and holds securely to the blade, that is the best feature of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gives you a good array of sizes to choose from.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my Oster 76 Clippers and they fit perfectly !</li>
            <li>Perfect fit</li>
            <li>Good investment, but they need to be handled with care.  </li>
            <li>They fit and work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Good quality product.</li>
            <li>against the grain which does not look as good</li>
            <li>We havent used thexse yet, but they look of good quality, and are Oster brand</li>
            <li>but maybe that was not as good for the blade?  </li>
            <li>Good quality, not like the ones you buy at Walmart .</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly on my Oster cutters.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>These guards snap on very easily and stay in place great.</li>
            <li>The good thing about these is that they&#x27;re real strong and not flimsy.</li>
            <li>Oster needs to go back to the drawing board and make perfect overlapping combs that snap perfectly in place instead of these.</li>
            <li>These are very good quality combs/guards and will probably fit on any _clipper,_ but not _trimmer.</li>
            <li>They fit great and make my buzz cuts nice and even!</li>
            <li>very pleased.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased about those blade.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and service I received.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I use them to trim my Golden Retriever for summer and they are the best I&#x27;ve ever used on her.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>They are spring loaded to they stay in place very securely!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>very nice, wiggle free, noiseless clipper guards/combs!</li>
            <li>I had done my research and this seemed to be the best bang for the buck, as they are certainly durable - not flimsy!</li>
            <li>Well, this is more of an add-on review stating that these combs fit my Fast-Feed clippers perfectly.</li>
            <li>They fit my Andis pet clippers (model 21420) perfectly and are much more substantial than the combs that came with the clippers.</li>
            <li>and they fit beautifully.</li>
            <li>I love these attachments!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have so many sizes!</li>
            <li>very good smooth and strong , it fit very good to oster 76550-100 and thrift 808</li>
            <li>They fit great and snug and do not move around.</li>
            <li>was shipping at amazing speed.  </li>
            <li>The combs fit great, I assume the people who had problems couldn&#x27;t figure out the mechanism -</li>
            <li>Oh and it comes with an amazing bag to hold them.</li>
            <li>The item would be great if it fit them.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>nice products</li>
            <li>and the carrying bag was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I was kind of bummed that the Oster didn&#x27;t come with these, but I&#x27;ve had no problems since buying them.  </li>
            <li>Great item, great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The bag it came with is also handy to hold all those unused combs under the sink.</li>
            <li>comb set is nice and all but the spring loaded clips leave something to be desired.  </li>
            <li>Have a nice day.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to purchase just the shortest 2 or 3.  </li>
            <li>I love I love these clipper guards they work great with my clippers have had no issues with them</li>

            <li>Good fit, good quality.</li>

            <li>No need help from any one to maintain my own hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent fast return &amp; refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I own three sets of clippers: for me, for son, and for our pet.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use any of the attachments longer than the 1/4&amp;#34; because the clipper ends up catching the dog&#x27;s hair and causing pain.  </li>
            <li>kind, which is not mentioned.</li>

            <li>They don&#x27;t get gummed up with fur very easily</li>
            <li>They are pretty good!</li>
            <li>They work great, the fit the clippers great, but my first order had two #5 combs and no #6.</li>

            <li>and I am able to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>

            <li>/&gt;IF they did fit, looks very sturdy, strong springs and variety of sizes, would have been a great buy!</li>
            <li>The additional set is great and easy to clip right on, cut my hair and its</li>
            <li>So far they a very good they work with oster and andis clipper</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and if I lose it I&#x27;ll buy more</li>
            <li>These do not even come close to fitting these clippers.</li>
            <li>I have a 20 year-old Oster razor and was a bit concerned about them fitting.  </li>
            <li>have a Model 274/Series A and these combs DO NOT even come close to fitting this</li>
            <li>make sure you have clippers these will fit!</li>
            <li>Work great, fit my standard clippers great.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for top of the line clippers, you have arrived.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it was a mistake, but it wasn&#x27;t the product we ordered.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find a better deal..</li>
            <li>I have two oster clippes and not one comb fit any of my clippers!</li>
            <li>I ordered these and was pleased with the quality and fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even find attachments more then 1/2 inch for my model??</li>
            <li>I use a #2 on the top, #1 on the sides, and a #0 for my beard.</li>
            <li>My husband is a barber and used the Oster brand clippers in his shop many years ago.</li>
            <li>They work better than the combs that come with the clippers, both because they don&#x27;t vibrate and because there are more (and longer) lengths.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better ...  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product and would recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li>box to store your clippers along with some, most or all of these combs.</li>
            <li>Love theses and the amount you get with the order.</li>
            <li>Now where do I turn so I can cut the top of my head at 3/4\\</li>
            <li>When you put them away, make sure nothing is on top of them or they will bend and not work.</li>
            <li>They work great with the Fast Feeder.</li>
            <li>These are okay</li>
            <li>These are what you need for the longer lengths more often desired for what&#x27;s on top of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i guess there ok.</li>
            <li>These are more like sheep shearing combs, none will shave close.</li>
            <li>Upon using it, the design and angle where it sits on the top of your head is somehow better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You better pop these in the shopping cart.</li>
            <li>I am much better off freehanding the clippers.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they clip onto the clippers to prevent them from coming off.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for their great return policy.</li>
            <li>Way more secure!</li>
            <li>more take off its all technique you will see.</li>
            <li>They will hold up for many years of use.</li>
            <li>I love the spring for securing them on the clippers.</li>
            <li>Much better than just clipping on for the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>I have tried to get it to work better without luck.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>There were many combs included in this set.</li>
            <li>Choice of blades sizes was more than we needed.  </li>
            <li>great and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Better than the ones that came with it, and more durable.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Combs attach nicely with a spring latch, everything fits secure.</li>
            <li>This set provides a lot more options and the combs seem to be a bit more sturdy than the ones which came with the clipper.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they come with a pouch to keep them in.  </li>
            <li>These combs are much more than you need.</li>
            <li>They seem to fit on the blade well, but end up catching in the dogs fur at the ends of the comb, then pull the dogs fur, causing pain.  </li>
            <li>More than I need.</li>
            <li>In the warmer months the #3 if the perfect length for them, short but not scalped and in the cooler months the combs will allow me to keep them a longer.</li>
            <li>The boys love the haircuts and patterns.</li>
            <li>most people wouldn&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe Oster doesn&#x27;t make combs that fit their own clippers.  </li>
            <li>They did, however, and now I have a much more versatile unit.  </li>
            <li>like it taught it was more metal than plastic</li>
            <li>love the package and the bag</li>
            <li>i would recommend it for sure</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>These are definitely better.  </li>
            <li>I love that these clips have both measurements on them.  </li>
            <li>I bought this basically to test and see which size I like best before ordering the proper metal clippers.</li>
            <li>like I did, do it safe and buy this kit if you&#x27;re looking for a plastic slip on set.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>More than one broke just putting them on the clippers.</li>
            <li>If you have ever had the cheap kind fall off</li>
            <li>so I could cut my hair with the Oster clippers I used when I was a practicing veterinarian many years ago.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, durable and just as described!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll br glad you did.</li>
            <li>So many times you get something that has to be replaced and that&#x27;s the case with these</li>
            <li>I did get a #5 and #6 in my package as well since many had mentioned getting two #5s.</li>
            <li>Great product shipped by a very reliable and dependable amazon seller.</li>
            <li>I like that the clippers are angled better and a lot stiffer than the ones that came with the clipper.</li>
            <li>great made grooming my dog much easier than using thinning scissiors.</li>
            <li>ok- would like to see angled combs for over ears included.</li>
            <li>You will be able to perform any type of pet grooming style.</li>
            <li>There is a reason most peoe have them.</li>
            <li>Love the 76, but these combs are bunk.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend love it&lt;</li>
            <li>The mafnetic guides are so much better just as a design concept.</li>
            <li>These are great family clippers and work very well with that use.</li>
            <li>and I should have know better.</li>
            <li>combs are quite a bit better engineered than the combs that came with the machine.</li>
            <li>I hope you are as happy with them as I am and thanks for taking the time to read my review.</li>
            <li>They could have done a better QA check on that one.</li>
            <li>I use it for the top and the beard.  </li>
            <li>They go on by springs, and do not snap on and off the way another brand I had worked, I do like the snap on better</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>For anyone who has to clip their dog or other animals the Oster is one of the best clippers any one could own.</li>
            <li>They are well made and there is quite the variety--many more than I need, but nice to have the full set.</li>
            <li>Great price and if your buying the Oster Classic 76&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My clippers must be 35 years old, but these combs fit perfectly and make it easy to groom my dog.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and a huge variety to choose from.</li>
            <li>they worked pretty good, did the job ...</li>
            <li>perfect  for long hair pets works as  stated fits all oster and stay on</li>
            <li>wife needed new combs for work and they work great</li>
            <li>Fit very snug and seem to work great.  </li>
            <li>The fact that all the sizes are here from 1 to 8 (plus 10) make it easy to blend the sides and the top.  </li>
            <li>These are a good buy for human or k-9 either one, works great and washes clean without worrying about rust.</li>
            <li>These are nice combs and have a good locking mechanism to keep them fixed to the blades.</li>
            <li>These are spring loaded and aren&#x27;t going anywhere, i&#x27;m sure they fit on most clippers.</li>
            <li>They also clean very easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, these combs work great with my animal shaver to protect my dog from nicks and razor burn while allowing for a very professional cut.</li>
            <li>The GREAT thing about these though is that they protect your dog from the clippers getting hot, which happens quickly if you&#x27;ve purchased the Oster A5 Turbo 2 Speed.</li>
            <li>so i decides to try them on my wahl pro&#x27;s and they fit perfectly, The spring action load is great for different size clippers!</li>
            <li>I think the attachments that I got with the Fastfeed worked fine for my use, but these are much more substantial.....</li>
            <li>moGHBNJHTWR2X2]]The combs fit flawlessly to my mother&#x27;s old Oster Golden A5 2 Speed Animal Clipper (78005-500-002) and are sturdy enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided on a set of Oster professional clippers and have been a happy clipper since.  </li>
            <li>is that they fit even better than the originals.</li>
            <li>The combs are attached via a metal clasp that is spring loaded which ensures a sure, continuous fit.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been a problem nor do I see it actually becoming one.</li>
            <li>Great set when paired with the Oster professional.</li>
            <li>Better grip compare to cheap adapter.</li>
            <li>Great set of comb attachments complete with a carrying pouch.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
            <li>It is great for anyone beginner or professional barber.  </li>
            <li>I will get blades for some of the shortest guards because it is more precise.</li>
            <li>I took a chance; I wasn&#x27;t sure that they would fit.  </li>
            <li>I wish they posted a clearer more precise description</li>
            <li>This is a great range of combs, well made and clearly marked in sizes to complement my Oster hair clipper.</li>
            <li>purchased to use with oster a5 turbo 2-speed professional clippers they are great</li>
            <li>They snap on and work great on my old Model 123 Oster dog clippers, even if I now use it to trim my beard and cut my hair.  </li>
            <li>Well I was pleased to see that these have a bit of a metal spring system built into each guard/comb, so that the piece is securely fastened to your clippers.</li>
            <li>Fits much better than the cheap all plastic combs.</li>
            <li>I got the attachments fast and they are of good quality.</li>
            <li>Oster Fast Feed Clipper With Attachments]] was an upgrade for me, and it would have been a fair deal at about $58.00.</li>
            <li>B000LRHWFI Oster 78004-011 Powermax 2-Speed Clippers]], allowed us to groom her much quicker, more effectively and more</li>
            <li>If you cut your own hair (or have your wife do it like me) then it&#x27;s definitely worth investing in quality clippers and this comb set.</li>
            <li>I had not realized when I purchased an Oster hair clipper that this one required special guards!  </li>
            <li>Great combs super fast to put on and off.</li>
            <li>There are many more pieces in this set than I needed (my wife cuts my hair using the #2 or #3 and that&#x27;s all we really need), but for the price I bought the whole set and am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very secure and easy to remove and clean.</li>
            <li>excellent former barber work partime out of my house fits most clippers, secure and easy to remove worth the money</li>
            <li>I ordered this set because it goes able the 1/2\\&quot; that the original set had.  </li>
            <li>I also like that there are more options than what originally came with my clippers.</li>
            <li>After 30 years of using cheaper clippers, I finally decided to spend the money on a good set!</li>
            <li>Much better setup than the original guards.</li>
            <li>The original clipper doesn&#x27;t come with many combs</li>
            <li>as it is, and although their performance is superior when it comes to bringing hair to the blades, the lengths (1/2\\&quot; at most on the 3 ½ blade) which they cut are more appropriate for fades and fine trimming on the sides and back of the head - that&#x27;s where these combs come in.</li>
            <li>They are easy to put on and to take off.</li>
            <li>They are easy to switch on and off.</li>
            <li>They are easy to attach and stay in place.  </li>
            <li>This set easily meets all the length needs you want when trimming your pet.  </li>
            <li>Their add for the clippers was easy to understand and gave me all the details of what was included with the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fits easily onto my Oster Turbo A5 clippers...</li>
            <li>and they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and work well.</li>
            <li>The combs are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m impressed with the cut of the Oster fast feeds.  </li>
            <li>understand Oster wanted to design a metal clip that wouldn&#x27;t break as easily</li>
            <li>These were easy to use with my Oster shaver, or whatever you call it.</li>
            <li>The bag, although useful, is not the best way to store them if you are going to switch between combs on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>This comb set is easy to use, and it seems to be well made.</li>
            <li>it was easy.  </li>
            <li>It is that easy.  </li>
            <li>Attach easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While these things do what they are designed to do, and are easy on and off, for self-cuts</li>
            <li>every so often to make it easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li>They provide easy on easy off application when I need to change lengths.</li>
            <li>They were easy to attach, too.</li>

            <li>easy to attach and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>This set of combs has made it so easy to groom my havanese.</li>
            <li>Yes, having the actual metal blades is a better option, but for the price, these work great.</li>
            <li>Each spring loaded plate slides easily and grabs the Electric Oster Shaver.</li>
            <li>So not as easy to use</li>
            <li>Spring makes it easy to put on and take off the the clippers.</li>
            <li>All needed sizes, Clip on easily to my unit and stays on, Came is good time,  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>liked it very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got to say these things are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I like a shaggy crown and legs but a more trimmed body to keep her cool</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and nice comb set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works pretty nice on his hair</li>
            <li>Fits my Oster Professional Classic 76 Clippers and works great!</li>
            <li>Yes .... the blade was checked to make sure it was clean, oiled and free of hair.  </li>
            <li>Perfect as expected!!</li>
            <li>new year and good luck in 2013 .&lt;br</li>
            <li>they work fine</li>
            <li>But for now these work fine.</li>
            <li>I use about three sizes, and they all fit well, and are easy to change.</li>
            <li>It would be an excellent product for dogs with less hair.</li>
            <li>and they went on just fine.</li>
            <li>They fit the cutters quite well and were easy to attach to the clipper.</li>
            <li>The universal comb attachments all work great on my A5 - easy on, easy off - except for the 1/16th, but</li>
            <li>They work fine.</li>
            <li>They work fine for that.</li>
            <li>Make sure when you are putting these on, you hook the bottom part of the comb first, and then push it to where the top is up over the blade and let it fall into place.  </li>
            <li>if either the clippers or the comb set explained this in their descriptions.&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I can&#x27;t even return the combs b/c I threw out the packaging, assuming they&#x27;d be fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to fit and remove.</li>
            <li>They seem to be sturdy and holding up fine.  </li>
            <li>I use these with the #40 blade and they work fine.  </li>
            <li>Made to specifically fit Oster hair clippers, they are easy to attach and stay in place.</li>
            <li>I have used from #000 to #1 as the clipper blade, and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>this is the best wont slip off or mess up your cut by fallin off</li>
            <li>Easy to attach and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the very cheap price.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit on like the cheap ones that come from wlamart, but they work well and not as easy to break as the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>They fit fine , but the metal plate catches her hair sometimes.</li>
            <li>These work fine and fit my Oster cutter.</li>
            <li>the blade comb attachments fit perfectly on the Oster pet clippers and made our little buddy look super!</li>
            <li>And this was the very first time this product had ever been used!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that cleaning it and oiling it makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Now Amazon is charging me $5.75 to return the combs that I would not have ordered if the product description of the clippers had been accurate.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and don&#x27;t fit Oster clippers at all.  </li>
            <li>The guards for my clippers were losing the teeth and no longer felt secure when attached.</li>
            <li>The Fastfeed did come with a set of attachments that others reviewed as being cheap so that prompted my purchase of these attachements.  </li>
            <li>They have a spring on them that keeps them secure to the blade and wiggle free.</li>
            <li>The product description said the comb set will fit my A5 two-speed Oster clipper...</li>
            <li>yes it did fit but in an imperfectly way.  </li>
            <li>They feature a spring-loaded metal clip for secure attachment, and mine did come with a storage pouch.</li>
            <li>They DO fit on my Oster Fastfeed clippers.  </li>
            <li>that where made to fit the Oster clippers.</li>
            <li>These combs attach securely to the clippers with a spring-loaded mechanism.</li>
            <li>Fit</li>
            <li>The combs stay secure and do not vibrate or rattle in operation.</li>
            <li>They fit snug with my Oster 76.</li>
            <li>and I read reviews that said they do fit.</li>
            <li>The Universal Comb Set works great with the Oster 76 Clippers.</li>
            <li>so they fit all models.</li>
            <li>One great American Made product!</li>
            <li>fit just about any pair of clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>#1,2,3, 4, and 5 wont fit on the Oster 76 blades  thus rendering them</li>
            <li>but when I did they didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>They do fit my clippers but cant use any of them.</li>
            <li>The bag looked of cheap quality when i was looking around at online pictures</li>
            <li>It is a great set that will last.</li>
            <li>They do not seem to fit my clips and the description stated that they can be used with my clippers.</li>
            <li>These BTW did not even fit onto the Oster clipper, I ordered it with, for from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Like everyone else, I was misled on what these combs fit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them lightly for two weeks</li>
            <li>But you would expect these attachments to fit Oster blades,</li>
            <li>Skip Tooth blade and assumed that these would fit.  </li>
            <li>They even fit a pair of Wahl clippers that I have.  </li>
            <li>I had my doubts about whether they would fit, but after reading the reviews I bought the set.  </li>
            <li>Looking to replace the combs on my Andis Dog Clippers, I searched for a durable set that would fit any clippers in my possession.  </li>
            <li>The product description says they fit all Oster clippers but that excludes the &amp;#34;fast feed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great guides overall</li>
            <li>The guards fit well after you under stand how the spring loaded clip works.  </li>
            <li>did not fit perfectly</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t cheap out</li>
            <li>The set of combs do not fit my Oster clipper perfectly.</li>
            <li>There is no way to adjust as the clip on the comb has two tabs which fit into slots on the Oster clipper.  </li>
            <li>&quot; and \\&quot;All comb sizes are designed to fit any Oster</li>
            <li>This product is so cheap.  </li>
            <li>These fit my clippers so well.</li>
            <li>These fit the trimmer as advertised and for the cost of a cheap haircut</li>
            <li>THEY ARE WELL MADE AND FIT SNUGLY ON THE CLIPPER.</li>
            <li>The Yorkie&#x27;s hair is light.  </li>
            <li>These fit my Oster well, no complaints.</li>
            <li>despite what another reviewer had to say, these DO fit the A5.</li>
            <li>These are a cheap solution but don&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li>and based on the design it would probably fit on almost any shaver I used it on.</li>
            <li>Well made can fit detachable blade clippers .</li>
            <li>They fit my Oster 78004-011</li>
            <li>They all fit our Oster clippers well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit on the Oster clipper we bought them with.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
            <li>Specifically it doesn&#x27;t fit the Oster Juice cordless.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the Oster and Andis clippers sold on Amazon often come with #000 and #1 included, so you should have no problem making it work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>This pack of clipper attachments gets used with my Oster 76 and have thus far proven a good buy.  </li>
            <li>I have really been able to be more versitle with my lower blades.</li>
            <li>Good professional quality combs.</li>
            <li>easy to use, don&#x27;t come off till you want them too (held on by a spring loaded clip), AND its a full set of 1-10, not 1-6 like the cheap sets.  </li>
            <li>I virtually had to cut downward to make it cut right as opposed to being able to go in any direction with the Wahl color pro.  </li>
            <li>Attach super easily, has a great grip and stays on throughout the entire job.</li>
            <li>You attach the metal hook side first and push the front over the clipper blades; backwards from most cheap combs.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The spring-action clips make reliable attachment and quick removal incredibly easy: just place the metal clip of the combs under the metal blade on the clippers and then pull forward on the plastic comb until it can drop over the metal blade.</li>
            <li>Hence I own the Oster Classic 76 clippers.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t want to buzz your head in the winter, you can just give it a quick and easy trim without leaving your head fuzzy or spiky, just a uniform cut..</li>
            <li>and i love it very much since im an aspiring groomer.</li>
            <li>When I finally got one on, the fit is far from perfect.</li>
            <li>Once the combs are on the full range of blade adjustment is still available.</li>
            <li>I bought them because the original comb that came with the clippers broke after about 18 months.</li>
            <li>also don&#x27;t replicate the cut of the original</li>
            <li>However the snagging was significantly reduced by using a #30</li>
            <li>I originally gave these things</li>
            <li>Had been using an old cheap model, this is so much better!</li>
            <li>and I got these in the original Oster packaging.</li>
            <li>exactly what hubby needed, his uses often and is satisfied</li>
            <li>I bought these to replace an original comb that broke from my Oster clippers.</li>
            <li>very sturdy, lots of sizes to choose from, fit perfectly on the Oster Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper.  </li>
            <li>With the Fast Feed you get a #1, #2, #3, and #4...all perfectly fine, but I use a number 6 on top and number 5 on  the sides, so I went ahead and got this</li>
            <li>Plastic comb guards are never going to be quite as good as genuine Oster metal blades, but getting 10 metal blades would set you back about $300.  </li>
            <li>I continue to need more and more items to complete my grooming kit.</li>
            <li>Definitely worked perfect for my beat up old unit.</li>
            <li>I bought these for show grooming horses quickly and precisely with Oster A5 Turbo clippers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to cut our dog&#x27;s hair at different lengths without changing blades.  </li>
            <li>I get a really clean cut with these combs.</li>
            <li>I had to keep taking off the guard to clean it which made my dog&#x27;s haircut seem like forever.</li>
            <li>The combs fit perfectly but they are a little tricky getting on the first time</li>
            <li>The quality is excellent and I&#x27;m sure they will last a long time.</li>
            <li>These are functional and do the job but are not the perfect fit, obviously it needs to fit multiple styles...</li>
            <li>Now I just need to get my technique right!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hard plastic construction with the spring loaded mechanism allows for a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The versatility of the set, allows me to cut my dog&#x27;s hair at any length, I choose.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that these combs are strong and have a spring loaded mechanism to very securely snap them in place.</li>
            <li>your hair is clean and damp the combs slid through pretty easily.</li>
            <li>these are cool to hold you over until you can afford all the metal blades for these clippers.</li>
            <li>I truely believe it had something to do with the MADE IN U.S.A thing.</li>
            <li>This complete set allows me to cut my own hair to the length I want.  </li>
            <li>The attachments come with cool bag to store them in.</li>
            <li>I have already used it up to 5 times since I purchased it and got the full value out of it.</li>
            <li>I have never had such a good set.</li>
            <li>Great, cost effective alternative while I am gradually collect the more expensive metal blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve a nice &#x27;fancy&#x27; Pivot Motor Oster Razor that this set is completely incompatible.</li>
            <li>Much better than the clips that came with my fast feed.</li>
            <li>their nothing super special ...</li>
            <li>is usable, but didn&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li>and it fit just right.</li>
            <li>and they fit just right.</li>
            <li>I knew as soon as I took them out of the Amazon box that they weren&#x27;t going to fit on my clippers, and I was right.  </li>
            <li>I was worried they wouldnt fit right</li>
            <li>The 10 comb set is worth the money, but it most certainly doesn&#x27;t trim as close as the metal clippers.</li>
            <li>Other than that I am happy.</li>
            <li>Other than that they work great.</li>
            <li>Fading with the stock metal blade which comes with the Oster Classic 76 works so much better than with the plastic comb set.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy to put them on and off, and they clean up quickly.</li>
            <li>The attachments arrived quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li>A tremendous aid</li>
            <li>The product was quickly delivered and it met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to give my family a decent hair cut.</li>
            <li>quick delivery.</li>
            <li>works ok, but don&#x27;t need most of these, use only two of them..</li>
            <li>There are many different sizes and one that I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>I am a complete Amatuer, and did a fair job , thanks to these combs.  </li>
            <li>i received them quickly...</li>
            <li>came quick, was as described..</li>
            <li>There are many more combs that I can possibly use but the set is inexpensive</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are not the same kind of garbage that come for \\&quot;free\\&quot; with cheap $25 - $50 clippers you buy at Wal-Mart, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>THey say they fit most Oster clippers but apparently the Oster Fast Feed is not one of the most.  </li>
            <li>theses combs seem like they are fairly high quality and are better than the comes i had for my wahl clippers</li>
            <li>(Now the Wahls I had were a pretty cheap pair, so I can&#x27;t speak for all of the attachments.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>Also, the comb attachment doesn&#x27;t fit exact to the clipper.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>first I didn&#x27;t think that these fit at all, but then I discovered that they DO work with the 000 blade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am more than content with my new Oster Comb Replacement Set.</li>
            <li>The quality appears to be the typical great quality of Oster products.</li>
            <li>The combs that came with the fast clipper are easy to up on and take off, however these, which are made by oster, are the biggest hassle of my life.</li>
            <li>I have an oster fast feed and they were easy to put on and use.  </li>
            <li>Overall though, this was a pretty good purchase once I honed by barber skills.</li>
            <li>These are really easy to attach and work really well with the number 40 blade.</li>
            <li>These blades attach easily to a variety of clippers and are fast to switch on and off.  </li>
            <li>but it is very old and huge!</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Fits tight on clipper head and is a great clipper mate.</li>
            <li>The metal spring attachment means a good, tight fit, no rattling.  </li>
            <li>these the,re so tight fitting nice</li>
            <li>I just received my Oster Fast Feed clippers, model 76023-510, and this comb set which is supposed to fit any Oster clippers.</li>
            <li>They fit very well.  </li>
            <li>These combs are sold with the fast feed clipper and claim to fit all Oster clippers.  </li>
            <li>These do fit the Oster Fast Feed--I thought they wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I saw a couple reviews saying these did fit on the Fast Feed version clippers and others stating they did not</li>
            <li>They fit very well on the Oster 76.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and fit snug on my Osters, Wahls, and Andis.</li>
            <li>It does the trick and really does fit everything.</li>
            <li>Fit my bay bliss very well.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Also worth mentioning</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and only use one comb, plus the clippers with no comb at all.</li>
            <li>I used these combs with my Oster A5 Golden</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I bought these comb set guides for trimming up my Golden Retriever from time to time.  </li>
            <li>A 10 piece kit was probably far more than I needed, but that&#x27;s something I learned in the process.  </li>
            <li>Once I applied some (considerable) thumb power to fitting them in place, bingo, all was well.</li>
            <li>kind, which take a completely different type of comb attachment.</li>
            <li>definitely worth taking chances with.</li>
            <li>These are a nice and solid set of combs.  </li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Essential if you own an Oster.</li>
            <li>So glad to have these to fit over my big clippers.  </li>
            <li>For years I cut my own hair weekly - and occasionally my sons&#x27; hair - to save time and get the results I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I bought this set for my Oster 78005-010 Golden A5 Single-Speed Clipper to use on my persian cat.</li>
            <li>, I looked at all of the different options available online and decided to try the Oster brand set figuring that it would be slightly more compatible with Oster brand clippers.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money and it works.</li>
            <li>will worth the price.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, heavy duty plastic with many comb sizes to choose from.  </li>
            <li>The spring loaded attach is very quick and convenient and they fit better than I expected or have experienced with this type of attachment in the past.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for easy trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my oster classic 76 does the job, fast change convenient and very secure spring loaded</li>
            <li>I use them with the 000 blade and it makes cutting very easy as the Oster clippers and design are the absolute best I have ever</li>
            <li>Other than that they are very nice and with the metal clip should last better than the plastic combs/clip that came with this clipper.</li>
            <li>These are very easy to put on the Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed clipper and get the job done.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find the original combs that came with my Oster Fast Feed</li>
            <li>the harder the job ,i think it would be better to buy the metal blade for longer cuts from Oster,i,m not sure which on ,contacting them would be best</li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>It was right there with the Items</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>Have the right size blade for the job is a must.</li>
            <li>The hair would go right up to where the blades are &amp; wouldn&#x27;t do anything after that.  </li>
            <li>price is right and they do their job.</li>
            <li>The allow me to make the right cuts between the blades.</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to get used to them, but I am not liking them right now.</li>
            <li>They clip right on no problem I have no regret</li>
            <li>No matter what your profession you need the right tools.  </li>
            <li>they looks right</li>
            <li>They snap right on.</li>
            <li>Bought these, price was right.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>I know they fit the Classic Pro 76 model, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair left, but the combination of these two things makes it very easy.</li>
            <li>Pushing down on the sliding metal back before latching it on to the clipper works the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Nice to have because I&#x27;m not a professional hair</li>
            <li>Might be good for the hair on your head but is not useful for beards at all.</li>
            <li>They fit nice and tight, so no worries they will move or fall off.  </li>
            <li>They fit my Oster well and snap on nice and tight.</li>
            <li>The guards fit nicely, but there were no instructions on how to get them on the clippers and it did take me a few minutes to figure it out.  </li>
            <li>If you buy this to trim up dogs of various sizes and hair types, this would probably prove to be more useful to you.  </li>
            <li>I home groom our Labradoodle and having several sizes of combs to clip different parts of her body is great.  </li>
            <li>I expected a better fit with the suggested shaver.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use the combs on clean dry combed out dogs, so you don&#x27;t break the teeth off..</li>
            <li>The is a good set but the design needs to be slightly tweaked.</li>
            <li>Probably would fit other brands, but can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li>It states in the product description &amp;#34;All comb sizes are designed to fit any Oster Clipper as well as most other clippers available&amp;#34; is does NOT.</li>
            <li>This unit overheats quickly and I have stopped using it, the Wahl ( human ) unit from costco at $30 has lasted longer, cuts better and doesn&#x27;t get as hot so fast.</li>
            <li>The Famous Classic 76 Professional</li>
            <li>Had a hard time putting them on and taking them off the first week or so, but they work great now.</li>
            <li>They are accurate as far as the length of hair they leave</li>
            <li>Nice metal backing, absolutely no wiggling nor an unsecured fitment.</li>
            <li>Everything arrived promptly, product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>A must have for your Oster Fast Feed!</li>
            <li>So i had to buy these extra ones to make sure i could go to higher numbers,</li>
            <li>too many numbers only use two sizes</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Overall these are much better than the plastic snap on combs that came with the clippers.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t go on the way a plastic comb fits so be aware of that as you put them on and take them off.</li>
            <li>is going to break on the first use, like some others I got before.</li>
            <li>and they are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>they fit, but clippers wouldn&#x27;t cut nearly as well, if it all with the guards on.  </li>
            <li>Just bought my first set of Oster&#x27;s Platinum Spirit clippers and they cut my hair like silk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Because it was a forced separate purchase I deducted a star, not for performance, which is great.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>First off, as was mentioned in another review, the set is metal &amp; spring loaded.  </li>
            <li>They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do but they will pull your dogs hair if there is the slightest tangle in your dogs coat which causes them pretty noticeable discomfort.</li>
            <li>Still, an expensive and good brand, I use it on my dog and it works great, I just needed these combs to do different sizes</li>
            <li>The higher the comb number the longer the cut.  </li>
            <li>so many low end combs can do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the bigger size combs for my yorkies.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely get more of this.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t specify that they don&#x27;t fit all Oster Professional clippers.</li>
            <li>After busting the package open, I found that they don&#x27;t even come close to fitting.</li>
            <li>Well there is one area I trim for someone, but for that I use the Wahl Peanut ;-)</li>
            <li>These fit my Oster Professional 76023-510.  </li>
            <li>Fast ship as well!</li>
            <li>Absolutely did not work with my Oster Golden A5</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Product exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>/ you would be better off buying an additional blade for different cuts /</li>
            <li>The clipper got really hot after 5 minutes</li>
            <li>I actually bought these to go along with the shaver as a gift, but I think I should have just bought more blades.</li>
            <li>The best set ever made and totally worth the few bucks spent.</li>
            <li>I did watch some videos on You Tube, first.</li>
            <li>The cheap off-the-shelf clippers never seemed to last or quite to the job I wanted but were OK - and frequently the combs broke or slipped.  </li>
            <li>You would do better with a different set.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding product with TEN combs that snaps over the 0000 Oster clipper head attachment and expand the use of your clippers exponentially.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so this set is necessary if you need to get more versatility from it.  </li>
            <li>Love having multiple lengths so we can trim to our liking.</li>
            <li>They clip on securely and do not make a loud noise once fastened on.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Looks like a good set but did not fit ours.  </li>
            <li>A waste of good money.</li>
            <li>Much more secure and well made then my previous Wahl.</li>
            <li>They attach firmly to my classic Oster 76 classic clipper and it seems like that&#x27;s the clpper they were designed to fit.  </li>
            <li>A good selection of Combs for different length cuts, a good buy, particularly for those who groom dogs with different type coats and at widely varying lengths.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the combs work nicely in keeping my dog&#x27;s coat lengthy yet trimmed.</li>
            <li>Reviewing the guides independently of the Fast Feed Clipper - these are well worth purchasing for the metal/plastic/spring construction and secure mounting on the right clipper type</li>
            <li>Ofcourse this is the first time that I bought some high cost clippers, but they are well worth the money.</li>
            <li>There is an extremely snug/tight fit and they are easily removed as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally bought a set of these for my Oster 76 Classic, but they also fit the Andis BGRC I purchased later.  </li>
            <li>Product works great for me, the combs stay on the blade and it arrived earlier than expected - yeah.</li>
            <li>It works great but be careful not to force it on the clipper or else you will bend the metal teeth back.</li>
            <li>, I bought the set to have more options, but I&#x27;m only using the #2 guide, based on how much I like the metal Oster #3 3/4</li>
            <li>However, they fit my old Wahl very well.</li>
            <li>will definitely recommend, looks very sturdy, love it</li>
            <li>Maybe a professional would use more, but then a professional would not purchase the clipper that I did.  </li>
            <li>You spent good money for professional clippers, spend some on pro attachments.</li>
            <li>My little dog looks very handsome after his trim.</li>
            <li>thanks very much</li>
            <li>These universal guide combs do not fit exactly you kind of have to engineer them into fitting but taking them off and putting them on</li>
            <li>*ONLY downfall buying these and not the metal ones, is that the #1 metal piece the Oster comes with will heat up pretty dramatically, and can easily burn the skin when touched)</li>
            <li>One thing positive about Wahl clippers and their combs is that they are uncomplicated.  </li>
            <li>I feel that I still get a nice clean cut which is normally hard with plastic guards.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I hoped it would be; quality comb set for my Oster Fast Feed Clipper.</li>
            <li>So I now advise other potential buyers to ignore what the Oster rep told my fellow bamboozled reviewer &amp; press (literally) bravely on.</li>
            <li>First set of clips purchased for my oster fast feed.</li>
            <li>it was exactly how it was described and fast delivery</li>
            <li>Very high quality, worth what I thought of as a high price for clipper combs.</li>
            <li>I owned a few combs of this type prior to purchasing this set and like the fact that they are very secure when attached to my oster clippers, yet very easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this set with the full understanding of what I was actually ordering, and guess what - I got exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li>New to clippers and didn&#x27;t want a scalp job on my golden doodles.</li>
            <li>Lots of different lengths and easy to read.</li>
            <li>I do not ha too much experience but be aware that the # 1 is like a real # 2</li>
            <li>I am a strong male</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t even fit any oster clippers that are only 1 1/2 years old!!!!</li>
            <li>The quality is good and they will probably last me a very long time.</li>
            <li>these are SOOO much better and don&#x27;t come loose.</li>
            <li>Tight good fit but sometimes springs come loose and can be a pain to readjust</li>
            <li>The plastic blades work ok, but I am going to upgrade up to the metal blades in the very near future.  </li>
            <li>but also they are very clean and accurate even in the hands of an amateur.</li>
            <li>They also came with a grey storage bag, which I put the larger ones in and put the smaller combs in my Clipper case!They fit great on my Oster A-5 Professional Clippers.</li>
            <li>I could bend them back and they worked fine but would like to see them a bit heavier.</li>
            <li>They work very well, if not as perfectly as pure blades.</li>
            <li>I clip my own little dog.  </li>
            <li>Only option available is to return the whole package and not replacing it???</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t thing a reasonable person would expect Oster to create a set of attachments that fit ever possible clipper.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;comb&#x27; on these is open all the way through, there is no stopping point to force the hairs to stand on end and get clipped at the accurate length.  </li>
            <li>Delivered fast and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Luckily I don&#x27;t really use #5 much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no problems getting these to work with my Oster Fast Feed Clippers.</li>
            <li>I have the set of Oster fast clippers.</li>
            <li>the guides work very well.  </li>
            <li>However, the combs will not go through matted or tangled hair: they will only work on a smooth, tangle-free coat.</li>
            <li>After trying for days to put the combs on the clipper, I gave up, called Oster, and learned that the \\&quot;Fast Feed\\&quot; model is not a \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; clipper and is incompatible with all 10 of the combs.</li>
            <li>These attacments work very well for my Oster pet clippers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The combs are made of plastic and the spring and hook attachment are from steel (stainless, I think).</li>
            <li>They are very secure--no rattling around.</li>
            <li>I am using these on the oster fast feed clippers.</li>
            <li>The attachments fit as promised and overall</li>
            <li>This comb set is more than what I expected.</li>
            <li>these clipper combs are solid - unlike the cheap ones they give you with the clippers.  </li>
            <li>They have an adjustable spring clip, so they can fit different sizes of clippers.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by Amazon when purchasing the Oster Fast Feed clippers.  </li>
            <li>The fact that Amazon specifically recommended this item to be purchased along with the fast feed is misleading.  </li>
            <li>If you purchase these attachment they are not compatible with the Fast Feed clippers.</li>
            <li>They worked very well</li>
            <li>This works very well with the Oster razor.  </li>
            <li>this is very good&lt;</li>
            <li>We bought this set in additional to our Oster clipper and it works very well, both for the dog and for the men in the family.  </li>
            <li>These are very durable, they seem just like the ones at a barber shop.  </li>
            <li>8 didn&#x27;t care that much.</li>
            <li>It was six dollars vs. the twenty I paid for the whole</li>
            <li>i really like them.</li>
            <li>really* need a size 6 (and can always get one separately if we do)</li>
            <li>These attachments fit all three brands because they have a self tightening spring which adjusts the back of the guide comb to each clipper blade head.</li>
            <li>A must have really</li>
            <li>They all work very well with the Oster electric clippers that I have.</li>
            <li>The plastic does not feel like it can hold too much abuse</li>
            <li>They do fit the standard #10 blade that comes with the A5 Turbo clippers.  </li>
            <li>Instead, they maintain the same language:  &amp;#34;Specially designed to fit Oster Clippers. . .</li>
            <li>I purchased this set of combs to use with the Oster fast feed Clippers.  </li>
            <li>I bought this set of attachments to use with the Fast Feed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this item with Oster Fast Feed clippers.</li>
            <li>I broke one of the plastic guards on my Fast Feed.</li>
            <li>The spring-loaded clip is simple to work with, and holds it securely with no movement.</li>
            <li>The combs stay on very well, even when they get bumped by fidgety horses.</li>
            <li>We have used this item and it works very well with our cutter.  </li>
            <li>These guards work very well.</li>
            <li>High quality product!</li>
            <li>does not work very well</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Has worked very well for me</li>
            <li>I have become an accomplished groomer.</li>
            <li>I still use these guards on a daily basis but I am in the process of finding something better for my Professional Fast Feed Clippers.</li>
            <li>Its very helpful</li>
            <li>I wanted the real thing</li>
            <li>Comb set is described as universal, but doesn&#x27;t fit our Oster electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take any real degree of strength to do</li>
            <li>I really like these, except when I received it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get it</li>
            <li>I figured I didn&#x27;t really have anything to lose.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like these combs.</li>
            <li>These things are the real deal.</li>
            <li>This comb set fits my Oster very well.  </li>
            <li>Very Displeased.</li>
            <li>So much for &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; quality products.</li>
            <li>much else to say...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for haircuts done at home!</li>
            <li>I use these with my Oster Fast Feed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All I need for the whole family.&lt;br /&gt;thanks to Oster and amazon.</li>
            <li>Not too much to say about this set except that it works as advertised on my Oster clipper.  </li>
            <li>I really like the additional sizes that come with it</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t protect them very well either.</li>
            <li>These very affordable comb attachments are a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; with your Oster clippers.  </li>
            <li>real like that .A</li>
            <li>There are no alternative combs for the fast feed clipper (which is a great product otherwise), even on the Oster website, but not happy with the misleading advertising.</li>
            <li>It may take some getting used to, but, my first impression is it&#x27;s ok, but, definetely not worth the pricetag and the headache that comes along with breaking the comb set in.  </li>
            <li>I will save a nice amount of money cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li>The quality of the combs were equal or better than the old combs.</li>
            <li>Liked them well enough that I bought a second set to keep at my home away from home along with the Andis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One example: if you are thinning on the top, you could use a #4 on the sides and the back of the head and then a #2 the top to tame the thinning areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a Oster A5 2 speed clipper about an decade before by a veterinarian&#x27;s recommmend.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very powerful &amp; sufficient clipper than when i used National japanese rechargeable clipper which can adjust  comb by length of pet&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used clppers in the past with a head designed to fit this sort of comb, and it&#x27;s easy as pie.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if other kinds would fit more easily, but I really like the variety of sizes in this kit.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, the attachments are not compatible with the Fast Feed clippers, as many other reviewers have noted.  </li>
            <li>i liked very much everythig is what i expected, the product detail it was the same as it was shown</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s true that it can be jammed onto the fast feed clipper head, it clearly isn&#x27;t made to fit.  </li>
            <li>The original combs that came with my Oster clippers slide on to the end of the clippers and sit on solidly.  </li>
            <li>(Way better than other plastic clipper attachments).  </li>
            <li>With a couple of other items on my purchase I qualified for the free shipping and everything arrived four (4) days before it was projected to be delivered!  </li>
            <li>Found combs pretty useless for clipping my dog&lt;br /&gt;Probably need clipper blades to do the best job  combs attached well enough</li>
            <li>It did not fit even though it is advertised as \\&quot;specially designed to fit oster clippers\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>but they work well and are much better then the few that come with the Fast Feed!</li>
            <li>They come with a bag that is large enough to fit all 10 combs into and a few more, if you have them.  </li>
            <li>I have two large dogs that I groom all year but take off more fur during the summer season and less in fall and winter.  </li>
            <li>Prefect fit with my New Clippers.....did not get caught when trimming little Milo....easy to clean..</li>
            <li>The bag is ok, but in order to find the right comb I usually have to dump them all out.</li>
            <li>Meaning the back of the comb sticks out a good quarter to half an inch where it connects to the clipper.  </li>
            <li>It seemed only reasonable to add the $25.00 \\&quot;Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set Specially Designed to Fit Oster Clippers\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a long time for something to fit my Oster dog grooming clippers and these do the job.</li>
            <li>As a result, I can apply a fair bit of pressure when cutting the back and sides of my head, giving me a nice even cut all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Despite its being called Universal, this comb set doesn&#x27;t fit the Oster Professional Fast Feed Clipper and had to be returned.</li>
            <li>With Oster&#x27;s set, the opposite is true.  </li>
            <li>And of course, like the name says, they&#x27;re universal and fit my other clippers fine.</li>
            <li>The plastic comb set is ok in the interim, but my recommendation would be to save your money and buy the metal blades because eventually you will upgrade and buy them down the road.</li>
            <li>Just put the metal tabs on the back of the blade and press forward, they fit like a dream, and from what I can tell, universal is right, this design should work with any clippers.</li>
            <li>thing I like most about them is they have a few combs that are really large, so</li>
            <li>I called Oster and the explained that since the blade is not flat on top then the combs are designed to sit raised to that the teeth align properly.</li>
            <li>When I got the new clipper,  I saw they no longer include any guide at all!</li>
            <li>If I use a 000 blade and the size 3 plastic comb, it barely clips anything, the comb just doesnt force the hairs into the right position.  </li>
            <li>This comb set is easy to use and has a wide variety of sizes.</li>
            <li>The clippers were sufficient, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li>I use these on my Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li>I purchased the plastic blades/comb set with my Oster Classic 76.  </li>
            <li>Bought these to accompany my Oster 76 classic clippers.</li>
            <li>The only caveat is that because they are universal, you need to make sure that the comb is lined up with the blades correctly when you attach them to the cutter.  </li>
            <li>B003U8BPY4 Oster Classic 76 Clippers]]</li>
            <li>I bought this to use with my Oster Classic</li>
            <li>I bought for the Oster Classic 76</li>
            <li>They work on Oster Classic 76.  </li>
            <li>if you are like me and are using the Oster Classic 76, just get the metal blade(s) that you want your hair cut to, and stick to that.</li>
            <li>Bought these for the Classic 76.  </li>
            <li>I wear my hair very short in the back and a bit longer and curly on the top.</li>
            <li>I just bought oster&#x27;s classic 76.</li>
            <li>The clippers that we have are an older moder but</li>
            <li>I am using these on a classic Oster 76.  </li>
            <li>I picked these up with the Classic 76.  </li>
            <li>the combination of my Oster Classic 76 and these combs does the trick admirably.  </li>
            <li>Once a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a fashion enthusiasts, I love to keep hair style trimmed and well maintained all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Had Panasonic $35 machine which definitely served the purpose, But this little monster, changed the experience and added many options in cut size, experience, performance and definitely an ultimate outcome of each</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re okay with a tight buzz cut, then you&#x27;re probably going to want these to go with your clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are nicer than the ones included with the Fast Feed (seem higher quality) and give me a lot more flexibility with the bigger sizes, plus they come with a little storage sack that I ended up using for my Fast Feed trimmer instead.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone who uses Oster clippers.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>These combs are high quality and durable.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for these suckes.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for these</li>
            <li>Highly recomended.</li>
            <li>comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Even with the 1/4&amp;#34; and shorter attachments, it ends up catching the dog&#x27;s hair maybe two to three times during the entire trim as opposed to every to every other pass.</li>
            <li>Maybe with a little more use they will be easier to put on/take off.  </li>
            <li>There is not much else to say except that these fit fine, they do the job they need to do and there are a wide range of sizes.</li>
            <li>I have a typical story to many other reviewers whom have been using cheap discount clippers.</li>
            <li>Have not used it yet but looking foward to using it with my new Oster Classic 76 clipper.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, we were very pleased with the purchase and though we still need small clippers and scissors to do the detail work, the body, neck and leg grooming went much faster with these combs and the clippers linked above.</li>
            <li>Worked well with My Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clippers.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about them fitting since a few reviews mentioned it.  </li>
            <li>No complaint there.  </li>
            <li>They are made well, and will not break with normal use.  </li>
            <li>This is obviously made for the pro barber and to me worth twice the price.</li>
            <li>Bought the Oster A5 golden 2 speed clippers along with the #3F and #3 blades as well as this universal comb set.</li>
            <li>worth the extra $.</li>
            <li>These plastic combs dont have that, they are basically open all the way through, so no matter what length the hair, if its not already standing pretty much straight up, the comb does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I imagine I&#x27;ll only use 2 or maybe 3 of all of these combs, but it was still worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>only use one or two of the guards, but they were well worth the purchase of the set.</li>
            <li>These were sturdy enough yet I believe the cost was far greater than the actual production cost.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than ones that had came with the a pair of Wahls that I had bought the fast feeds to replace which were loose and were VERY noisy when the clippers were turned on(which caused me to buy the fast feeds) , and the stock ones, which were also better than the Wahls, but still had a slight gap between them and the blade, causing them to slightly move when pressure is applied.</li>
            <li>They might work fine on other models but not mine (76023-510).</li>
            <li>The other combs are ok so far but the stylists will have to check them frequently for cracks.</li>
            <li>so we use these universal combs to cut our hair the right length.</li>
            <li>These combs fit the Oster 111, as well as other brands.</li>
            <li>HOW WELL THEY WOULD WORK OR FIT ON OTHER BRAND CLIPPERS.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t give feedback on fit of other brands/models.</li>
            <li>A little challenging to attach to my professional clippers.</li>
            <li>These are a must have if you buy a new Oster clipper.  </li>
            <li>When i recieved these i had not yet recieved my new oster clippers.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this</li>
            <li>Ordered these blades to go on the new oster groomer I just purchased.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I got it and everything is there,and its a lot cheaper than buying a new one.</li>
            <li>I bought these with a new Oster Power Pro Ultra.  </li>
            <li>You live with them for decades.</li>
            <li>New blades and these combs did the trick.  </li>
            <li>I had a clipper that needed a new set of combs</li>
            <li>These and the new shaver will pay for themselves in a  year of savings from the shop.</li>
            <li>I used one of the combs for the new Oster I purchased.  </li>
            <li>New in the box and ahead of time.  </li>
            <li>I finally broke down and bought better hair clippers: the oster fast feed.  </li>
            <li>The plastic quality could be a bit better and harder, but overall it works well.</li>
            <li>I bought these in conjunction with a pair of Oster Fast Feed clippers because I also cut a couple of friends&#x27;/family&#x27;s hair that require the longer guard length, and the one&#x27;s supplied with the Fast Feeds only go up to a #4 (1/4 in).</li>
            <li>B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]] and these clipper combs</li>
            <li>cat seems much happier without all that fur and the guides allowed me to do a professional looking job without the professional&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>It clearly was not designed for the Classic.</li>
            <li>There are quite a few people claiming these fit the Fast Feed, but I assure you, they do not.  </li>
            <li>It fit properly and the combinaton cut properly.  </li>
            <li>I kept the tapered \\&quot;left ear\\&quot; and \\&quot;right ear\\&quot; combs from my old clipper.</li>
            <li>I decided to spend a little more on a hair clipping set this time around, and ordered the Oster Fast Feed clipper together with these Oster universal combs.</li>
            <li>Only reason for the one star off is they do get little warm but this product for the price was not meant for professional use.</li>
            <li>strong metal spring-clip attaches the combs tightly to your clippers.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly what we had been needing to properly groom our mini schnauzer.</li>
            <li>We had been using a smaller handheld wireless set of clippers that came with two combs, but it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough and the combs didn&#x27;t pick up much hair</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Now I can clip my 3 year old Yorkie poo with ease!</li>
            <li>Saves buying all the different sized blades at higher cost.</li>
            <li>It seems you have to buy the exact brand of these, should be universal</li>
            <li>I am not a professional dog groomer, and my dog looked pretty decent after I shaved off his winter coat with these guards.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rate this good or bad since I never actually had a chance to use it, but I can say that these don&#x27;t fit Oster&#x27;s Fast Feed clippers.</li>
            <li>I have been doing research for a long time looking for the right hair clippers in which to invest.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use these combs on my dogs and just shaved them right down to the razor because the pulling was more than I would subject them to.</li>
            <li>Along with clippers, these produce a nice even cut (even with my thick hair!</li>
            <li>These fit well, but were difficult to get on and off the clippers easily.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s some play/give that allows you to slide the comb over the blade for a tight fit.  </li>
            <li>I had another one that fit so tight (spring loaded), that it broke off while I was trying to remove it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re built nicely enough to where I believe they&#x27;ll last a long time, and the range of sizes makes any reasonable cut-length available at your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But they are a universal comb that fits several different brands, so they are not that easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li>Since blades start out very short and only get so long, I imagine that most people (like myself) will be interested in using the combs to keep their pet&#x27;s fur long.</li>
            <li>These work very well (at least on an Oster Classic 76), and are a true bargain.  </li>
            <li>Price is great considering the metal attachment that keeps the clips on while cutting.  </li>
            <li>They cut the precise length but just seem to fit weird.</li>
            <li>I bought this set to go with an oster clippers (Oster Professional 076023-123 Operation Homefront Desert Camo Fast Feed Adjustable Blade Clipper) that I also purchased at the same time.</li>
            <li>These combs are shaped differently than the blade on my Oster Professional Fast Feed clippers, and no amount of trying will get them to seat on it.  </li>
            <li>can use my 3 1/2 size Oster 76 blade and it will clip a TON of hair on my beard, clearly the hair is longer than 3 1/2.  </li>
            <li>I just received the Fast Feed Clippers and Universal Guide Set.  </li>
            <li>I have 3 dogs I keep up with as far as clipping.  </li>
            <li>The thing is, after we got our clippers we still needed the Oster Professional Comb Set,</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than buying the attachments individually.  </li>
            <li>Probs would be nice to know that they attach through a spring so they should latch on the to back of the blade and stretch up to fit the cutting portion of the 000 guard it comes with.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer noticed the same thing but the review hasn&#x27;t been voted up much</li>
            <li>The only gripe is they seem to have a gap when attached to my Fast Feed.</li>
            <li>My guess is that they are made for the professional Oster models.  </li>
            <li>I use these to cut each of my young boys hair and this pack has proven cost effective:&lt;br /&gt;[($15/per haircut)</li>
            <li>I recently purchased an Oster Fast Feed (Chrome) clipper.  </li>
            <li>I have some 20 year old clippers that my parents had (that still works), and put the spring loaded comb onto the clippers.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you are doing this professionally, well who am I to tell you what to do.</li>
            <li>Plenty of sizes to choose from for professional grooming of my dog.</li>
            <li>My oster is like 40 years old</li>
            <li>These work okay - not spectacular</li>
            <li>I bought this set of combs to go on my old Oster 151-04 Pet Groomer.  </li>
            <li>My dog is old and has warts.  </li>
            <li>Some of the comb sets on the market are knock offs and are not of the complete quality of the factory combs.</li>
            <li>and I use them professionally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using these with my Oster 76er Professional edition</li>
            <li>both times he looks as though he had been professionally cut.</li>
            <li>The Oster professional grade has convinced me that I should have upgraded years ago.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money or time - unless you want to throw your money away.</li>
            <li>The spring-tensioned attachment always assures a snug fit and a firm hold on your clipper.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the Engineering that took place in making these.</li>
            <li>B000LRN31A Oster A5 Turbo 2-Speed Professional Animal Clipper]]</li>
            <li>It took a minute or two to figure them out as far as attaching to the Oster.  </li>
            <li>Buyer beware, does not fit Oster Lucky Dog or the older version</li>
            <li>Get the good ones, you wont&#x27; be sorry.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve never done grooming before), but apparently these clippers require that I buy new BLADES, to the tune of $35-$40 each, to get the length I want.  </li>
            <li>Other reviews on amazon  state that these combs fit on the model I mentioned above which is an outright lie.</li>
            <li>The method to place them on fast feeds doesnt allow them to lay flat.</li>
            <li>When i bought my first oyster clippers they came with crappy combs ,they were so loose barley held on ,now with</li>
            <li>I recently bought a new Oster clipper to replace one I used for about 15 years!  </li>
            <li>So this cause me to have to stop every few mins and take the clip off and clean off the fur.</li>
            <li>Meaning and (understand my entire review is based on the Oster Classic 76)</li>
            <li>you cut hair a lot you NEED the Oster Classic 76 clippers and likely need these guards as well!</li>
            <li>I purchased these at the same time I bought my Oster Classic 76 clippers.</li>
            <li>hand isn&#x27;t steady enough to free-hand my hair cut.</li>
            <li>but I typically do not use guards that size anyhow.</li>
            <li>For those who have the Oster Classic 76 clippers with changeable blades, this comb set can be used ONLY with the Oster 000 blade (the blade with the closest haircut).  </li>
            <li>The latching mechanism is a bit tricky, but easy enough with a little practice.</li>
            <li>so it slides forward, then lift up on the front teeth with your other hand, and it will come right off.</li>
            <li>Never having purchased a high end set of clippers before I was expecting snap-on plastic combs similar to those included with cheaper clipper sets.</li>
            <li>Only reason I did not give it a 5 is because I do not like the way the comd sits high on the bottom of the blade.</li>
            <li>but these combs were easily and frequently snagging using the #10 blade when trying to cut the thick curly fur of my poodle.  </li>
            <li>I use these with a Oster Limited Edition Fast Feed Clipper and they seem to be completely compatable.  </li>
            <li>You need to make a few more passes than if you used blades, but I&#x27;m just cutting my own hair</li>
            <li>I had initially balked at the price when I was pondering purchasing them, but now that I&#x27;ve received them I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t try to save a few dollars by purchasing a lesser set.</li>
            <li>The product is fine, except that of the ten sizes of clips, we received two which were identical, and were missing one.  </li>
            <li>went to a local beautician&#x27;s supply store and purchased the missing size, which works fine.</li>
            <li>However, quiet makes little difference when the product does not satisfy the primary purpose it is marketed for.  </li>
            <li>Hard to use with clippers that have removable blades, and I could not find any videos or instructions on how to take them off easy.</li>
            <li>I eventually had to return these and get a different set of combs, which oddly I couldn&#x27;t find on Amazon (had to google &amp;#34;Oster fast feed comb attachments&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I really love that they snap on so solidly - my other combs would end up falling off half the time</li>
            <li>A little tough to install and detach, but they are very handy and allow for fades etc.  </li>
            <li>I did not open the item for several weeks, and when I did, I discovered that the one size I really wanted had not been included in error.</li>
            <li>Unless you want to go right down to the skin, you need a guide.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t your average cheap ass plastic things that clip on and fit poorly.</li>
            <li>I got these due to the original combs were getting loose and moving on the clippers.</li>
            <li>kit contains sizes 0 through 10 which gives enough small steps that even a non-pro can do a good taper/fade haircut with very little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These comb guides are way large and useless, I mainly needed a 1/4 inch guide to shave my dogs for the summer which is very hot here.</li>
            <li>I was very worried about these combs because of some reviews I&#x27;ve read about them not fitting the Oster Fast feed clipper, which I had purchased.</li>
            <li>They are clearly labeled with the height number and the actual length in inches of the cut.  </li>
            <li>The metal bracket on these combs don&#x27;t fit the blade on the clippers, so they&#x27;re pretty useless on that model.</li>
            <li>Takes too long when you&#x27;re in a hurry, and I even broke the adjustment lever on my Fast Feed because it creates a lot of pressure on the lever when you open and close, so</li>
            <li>B00513G9P6 Oster Professional Care 10-Piece Universal Comb Set]]</li>
            <li>No regrets on the purchase</li>
            <li>For a clipper with a larger gap (my 20 year old Wahl)</li>
            <li>I have no regrets getting these.</li>
            <li>The entire set is complete so no worries in needing any additional guards for my unit.</li>
            <li>I ordered these to trim the wild hair on my border collies back side.</li>
            <li>I bought these guards because I also need to Man-scape once in a while (apparently my head hair fell to my chest and legs?)</li>
            <li>I like the variety of sizes this set offers as it allowed me to cut his coat different lengths.</li>
            <li>It was totally unnecessary, as the attachments that came with the clipper were more than sufficient for my needs.</li>
            <li>When I try to put them on they spring thingy kind of moves out of alignment and make it really difficult for the spring part to move.  </li>
            <li>The combs that came with the Fast Feed allow for a more natural position while cutting hair.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re the wrong kind if you have some difficulty</li>
            <li>Operation Homefront Camo Classic 76 Limited Edition)</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i also use the lower ones for my goatee chin very fast no complaints&lt;br /&gt;dont settle for less</li>
            <li>These snap right on to my Oster Classic 76 Limited Edition clipper and stay firmly in place.  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have clippers with this comb set together, or at least a buy one get one half off.</li>
            <li>After just one use on a customer, the #4 comb cracked right down the middle and split into two pieces when removed from the clippers.</li>
            <li>THEY BREAK WHEN YOU TAKE THEM OFF RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE</li>
            <li>I purchase this item should work Oster fast feed trimmer but not easy to set up easy and not  fit properly.</li>
            <li>and we needed to use the set right away without waiting another few days for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Nice little feature, as I&#x27;ve had guards fall off mid cut in the past...</li>
            <li>With two very hairy dogs, these really save their cost in less than a single visit to the groomer.</li>
            <li>Quiet, fast and durable, they have been cutting my hair for a few months and are working great.</li>
            <li>combs are a little harder to put on any other combs I have used in the past, but are more secure.</li>
            <li>attachment method seems a little cheesy, but they work great.</li>
            <li>My dogs thick long fur needs a 2nd trim in the summer and these me more choices of length.</li>
            <li>Received as always in a timely manner; 1st-the universal comb set made a big difference in the way the clippers performed, must have if your looking for professional results....</li>
            <li>This machine is definitely is a make for commercial use anf therefore has more capability to deliver way above average performance than other personal hair clippers.</li>
            <li>If your clipper blade is too long, it might be too hard to fit the combs onto the blade, because the spring will not extend far enough.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little snug at first and the mechanism isn&#x27;t the smoothest.  </li>
            <li>They were a little tricky to work at first.  </li>
            <li>Guards tend to be a little tricky to put on at first, but they work.</li>
            <li>Assuming this set would fit my recent purchase (Oster fast feed) Wrong.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I was a bit hesitant to buy this product since I have the Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper that several reviewers state these combs do not fit.</li>
            <li>However, they are cheap - not sure how long they will last.</li>
            <li>Not a professional groomer, but with the selection of trimming heads I can maintain my poodle and tibetian spaniel between professional visits.</li>
            <li>These combs DO NOT fit on Oster fast speed model 76023-510!</li>
            <li>but I was willing to give it a go to save a few bucks on my haircuts.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a spring-loaded clip and the springs can be a bit stiff at first.</li>
            <li>I suppose I could have read other reviews to learn about the high quality of this product, but who has the time for that?</li>
            <li>Each one of them individually is good, but it is almost impossible to put the comb on because of the design.</li>
            <li>and I seriously could kick myself for not finding these sooner, they are not the same cheap snap on ones that come with the cheap-o clippers you get at target, you know, the ones that pop off every chance they get, these are the total opposite.......</li>
            <li>When you mount the comb to the clipper, it is not flatly attached.  </li>
            <li>My old plastic guards were loose</li>
            <li>The only advantage I can see for this product over the much cheaper (half the price)</li>
            <li>Very secure - to the point of being difficult to remove from the clipper sometimes.</li>
            <li>These combs do not fit the Oster A-5 properly / at the rear they leave a large gap</li>
            <li>It took me a minute to figure out how to put these on, because it&#x27;s different from the little guards that come with the Fast Feed, but once I realized there is a spring involved</li>
            <li>Finally broke down and bought an Oster classic after the blade from my Cheapo shears came off and buzzed me on the side of my head for the second time.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the money, too bad they don&#x27;t include a carrying bag.</li>

            <li> /&gt;incase of # 0 (1/16&#x27;&#x27;) is very useful for summertime,it can avoid skin irrite &amp; cutaneous disease cause doesn&#x27;t cut hair to the skin!!!</li>
            <li> Of course these would be nothing without a clipper, but these are amazing!</li>
            <li> It would have saved a great deal of tears and money! :)</li>
            <li> i gave them a 3 they suck to use for the dog but worked perfect on my sons hair : )</li>
            <li> Love it, perfect, just what i needed</li>
            <li> SO happy i could find these!! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> However, they looked great and the quality was good.  </li>
            <li> If you own Oster clippers, don&#x27;t buy anything but Oster combs!</li>
            <li> They work real good so many to choose from .I</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly and work great</li>
            <li> Works great and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that easily clips on with spring load design.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Build quality is excellent, as these combs have spring loaded metal clips for easy removal and changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> They are so easy to put on and take off, and fiet to the clippers so perfect.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quick and guards work perfect and were in great condition</li>
            <li> Very good quality, probably better quality than came with my Oster clippers.</li>
            <li> very good product for the detachable clipper fits most blades</li>
            <li> Very easy to use!</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> but when we needed a good dog clipper that would do the job he knew just what to buy.</li>
            <li> so I knew I would have a good experance buying from then again.</li>
            <li> The product does all it should, is as as advertised and was delivered in a fairly prompt manner.</li>
            <li> Snug, yet perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Good purchase</li>
            <li> Works great, nice cut with 10 blade under them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a good deal, too.</li>
            <li> They fit perfect.  </li>
            <li> Takes 2 seconds to figure these things out, but they fit the Oster 76 perfectly.  </li>
            <li> They are snug and good quality</li>
            <li> These guides were the perfect fit for my 76.</li>
            <li> This 10 pack comb set was the perfect fit for our Oster trimmer unit.  </li>
            <li> They fit perfectly on to the clipper, and work well with it.  </li>
            <li> These combs fit perfectly as were described.</li>
            <li> but I think it is a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> They fit the clippers perfectly.</li>
            <li> I do prefer the metal blades over the plastic ones, but these are a good buy.</li>
            <li> superior quality.</li>
            <li> Definately a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This was exctly what i was looking for and was delighted to find it.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly on my Oster clippers.  </li>
            <li> Combs fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Excellent fit.  </li>
            <li> This was a good cheaper alternative though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good combination.  </li>
            <li> I recommend these two items together to give your dog good grooming.</li>
            <li> so I bought them and they are just as good a quality as the factory ones.</li>
            <li> They seem good quality and stayed on the trimmer without popping off.</li>
            <li> These fit perfect.</li>
            <li> these are good quality, name brand clipper attachments.</li>
            <li> I use them for hair and beard and they work equally good for both.</li>
            <li> These are good guards.</li>
            <li> Maybe on dogs with softer hair it would be a good item, but didn&#x27;t work for us on our wire fox terrier.  </li>
            <li> For starters, the spring loaded aspect works well and holds securely to the blade, that is the best feature of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gives you a good array of sizes to choose from.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Oster 76 Clippers and they fit perfectly !</li>
            <li> Perfect fit</li>
            <li> Good investment, but they need to be handled with care.  </li>
            <li> They fit and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> against the grain which does not look as good</li>
            <li> We havent used thexse yet, but they look of good quality, and are Oster brand</li>
            <li> but maybe that was not as good for the blade?  </li>
            <li> Good quality, not like the ones you buy at Walmart .</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly on my Oster cutters.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> These guards snap on very easily and stay in place great.</li>
            <li> The good thing about these is that they&#x27;re real strong and not flimsy.</li>
            <li> Oster needs to go back to the drawing board and make perfect overlapping combs that snap perfectly in place instead of these.</li>
            <li> These are very good quality combs/guards and will probably fit on any _clipper,_ but not _trimmer.</li>
            <li> They fit great and make my buzz cuts nice and even!</li>
            <li> very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the purchase of this product.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I use them to trim my Golden Retriever for summer and they are the best I&#x27;ve ever used on her.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> They are spring loaded to they stay in place very securely!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> very nice, wiggle free, noiseless clipper guards/combs!</li>
            <li> I had done my research and this seemed to be the best bang for the buck, as they are certainly durable - not flimsy!</li>
            <li> Well, this is more of an add-on review stating that these combs fit my Fast-Feed clippers perfectly.</li>
            <li> They fit my Andis pet clippers (model 21420) perfectly and are much more substantial than the combs that came with the clippers.</li>
            <li> and they fit beautifully.</li>
            <li> I love these attachments!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have so many sizes!</li>
            <li> very good smooth and strong , it fit very good to oster 76550-100 and thrift 808</li>
            <li> They fit great and snug and do not move around.</li>
            <li> was shipping at amazing speed.  </li>
            <li> The combs fit great, I assume the people who had problems couldn&#x27;t figure out the mechanism -</li>
            <li> Oh and it comes with an amazing bag to hold them.</li>
            <li> The item would be great if it fit them.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> nice products</li>
            <li> and the carrying bag was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I was kind of bummed that the Oster didn&#x27;t come with these, but I&#x27;ve had no problems since buying them.  </li>
            <li> Great item, great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The bag it came with is also handy to hold all those unused combs under the sink.</li>
            <li> comb set is nice and all but the spring loaded clips leave something to be desired.  </li>
            <li> Have a nice day.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to purchase just the shortest 2 or 3.  </li>
            <li> I love I love these clipper guards they work great with my clippers have had no issues with them</li>
            <li> Best clipping job ever thanks to these combs.</li>
            <li> nice product.</li>
            <li> Good fit, good quality.</li>
            <li> comes with a nice bag also.</li>
            <li> No need help from any one to maintain my own hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent fast return &amp; refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I own three sets of clippers: for me, for son, and for our pet.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any of the attachments longer than the 1/4&amp;#34; because the clipper ends up catching the dog&#x27;s hair and causing pain.  </li>
            <li> kind, which is not mentioned.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely the best clippers out there!!</li>
            <li> Loved attachments and wonderful soft case.</li>

            <li> I own the 3.2mm, 2.4mm and 000 blades for trimming my head.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice</li>
            <li> I bought these with my Oster A5 Turbo clippers, and this is a nice comb set.</li>
            <li> Rather than getting a ton of blades at $30 ea just to cut my own hair, I got these.</li>
            <li> sturdy and  nice variety</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what kind of clippers you own you have to buy these to replace the crappy ones that come with them.</li>
            <li> These are nice...</li>
            <li> do you want to here that they come in a nice plastic package...</li>
            <li> well they did and they shipped in a nice cardboard box too...</li>

            <li> Came quickly and works great</li>
            <li> These clips are really good and strong unlike the Oster battery operated clippers that I bought to go with them.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get gummed up with fur very easily</li>
            <li> They are pretty good!</li>
            <li> They work great, the fit the clippers great, but my first order had two #5 combs and no #6.</li>

            <li> and I am able to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>

            <li> These do not even come close to fitting these clippers.</li>
            <li> I have a 20 year-old Oster razor and was a bit concerned about them fitting.  </li>
            <li> have a Model 274/Series A and these combs DO NOT even come close to fitting this</li>
            <li> make sure you have clippers these will fit!</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for top of the line clippers, you have arrived.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it was a mistake, but it wasn&#x27;t the product we ordered.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find a better deal..</li>
            <li> I have two oster clippes and not one comb fit any of my clippers!</li>
            <li> I ordered these and was pleased with the quality and fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even find attachments more then 1/2 inch for my model??</li>
            <li> I use a #2 on the top, #1 on the sides, and a #0 for my beard.</li>
            <li> My husband is a barber and used the Oster brand clippers in his shop many years ago.</li>
            <li> They work better than the combs that come with the clippers, both because they don&#x27;t vibrate and because there are more (and longer) lengths.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen better ...  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product and would recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li> box to store your clippers along with some, most or all of these combs.</li>
            <li> Love theses and the amount you get with the order.</li>
            <li> Now where do I turn so I can cut the top of my head at 3/4\\</li>
            <li> When you put them away, make sure nothing is on top of them or they will bend and not work.</li>
            <li> They work great with the Fast Feeder.</li>
            <li> These are okay</li>
            <li> These are what you need for the longer lengths more often desired for what&#x27;s on top of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i guess there ok.</li>
            <li> These are more like sheep shearing combs, none will shave close.</li>
            <li> Upon using it, the design and angle where it sits on the top of your head is somehow better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You better pop these in the shopping cart.</li>
            <li> I am much better off freehanding the clippers.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they clip onto the clippers to prevent them from coming off.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for their great return policy.</li>
            <li> Way more secure!</li>
            <li> more take off its all technique you will see.</li>
            <li> They will hold up for many years of use.</li>
            <li> I love the spring for securing them on the clippers.</li>
            <li> Much better than just clipping on for the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> I have tried to get it to work better without luck.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> There were many combs included in this set.</li>
            <li> Choice of blades sizes was more than we needed.  </li>
            <li> great and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Better than the ones that came with it, and more durable.  </li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Combs attach nicely with a spring latch, everything fits secure.</li>
            <li> This set provides a lot more options and the combs seem to be a bit more sturdy than the ones which came with the clipper.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that they come with a pouch to keep them in.  </li>
            <li> These combs are much more than you need.</li>
            <li> They seem to fit on the blade well, but end up catching in the dogs fur at the ends of the comb, then pull the dogs fur, causing pain.  </li>
            <li> More than I need.</li>
            <li> In the warmer months the #3 if the perfect length for them, short but not scalped and in the cooler months the combs will allow me to keep them a longer.</li>
            <li> The boys love the haircuts and patterns.</li>
            <li> most people wouldn&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe Oster doesn&#x27;t make combs that fit their own clippers.  </li>
            <li> They did, however, and now I have a much more versatile unit.  </li>
            <li> like it taught it was more metal than plastic</li>
            <li> love the package and the bag</li>
            <li> i would recommend it for sure</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> These are definitely better.  </li>
            <li> I love that these clips have both measurements on them.  </li>
            <li> I bought this basically to test and see which size I like best before ordering the proper metal clippers.</li>
            <li> like I did, do it safe and buy this kit if you&#x27;re looking for a plastic slip on set.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> More than one broke just putting them on the clippers.</li>
            <li> If you have ever had the cheap kind fall off</li>
            <li> so I could cut my hair with the Oster clippers I used when I was a practicing veterinarian many years ago.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, durable and just as described!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll br glad you did.</li>
            <li> So many times you get something that has to be replaced and that&#x27;s the case with these</li>
            <li> I did get a #5 and #6 in my package as well since many had mentioned getting two #5s.</li>
            <li> Great product shipped by a very reliable and dependable amazon seller.</li>
            <li> I like that the clippers are angled better and a lot stiffer than the ones that came with the clipper.</li>
            <li> great made grooming my dog much easier than using thinning scissiors.</li>
            <li> ok- would like to see angled combs for over ears included.</li>
            <li> You will be able to perform any type of pet grooming style.</li>
            <li> There is a reason most peoe have them.</li>
            <li> Love the 76, but these combs are bunk.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend love it&lt;</li>
            <li> The mafnetic guides are so much better just as a design concept.</li>
            <li> These are great family clippers and work very well with that use.</li>
            <li> and I should have know better.</li>
            <li> combs are quite a bit better engineered than the combs that came with the machine.</li>
            <li> I hope you are as happy with them as I am and thanks for taking the time to read my review.</li>
            <li> They could have done a better QA check on that one.</li>
            <li> I use it for the top and the beard.  </li>
            <li> They go on by springs, and do not snap on and off the way another brand I had worked, I do like the snap on better</li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> For anyone who has to clip their dog or other animals the Oster is one of the best clippers any one could own.</li>
            <li> They are well made and there is quite the variety--many more than I need, but nice to have the full set.</li>
            <li> Great price and if your buying the Oster Classic 76&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My clippers must be 35 years old, but these combs fit perfectly and make it easy to groom my dog.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and a huge variety to choose from.</li>
            <li> they worked pretty good, did the job ...</li>
            <li> perfect  for long hair pets works as  stated fits all oster and stay on</li>
            <li> wife needed new combs for work and they work great</li>
            <li> Fit very snug and seem to work great.  </li>
            <li> The fact that all the sizes are here from 1 to 8 (plus 10) make it easy to blend the sides and the top.  </li>
            <li> These are a good buy for human or k-9 either one, works great and washes clean without worrying about rust.</li>
            <li> These are nice combs and have a good locking mechanism to keep them fixed to the blades.</li>
            <li> These are spring loaded and aren&#x27;t going anywhere, i&#x27;m sure they fit on most clippers.</li>
            <li> They also clean very easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, these combs work great with my animal shaver to protect my dog from nicks and razor burn while allowing for a very professional cut.</li>
            <li> The GREAT thing about these though is that they protect your dog from the clippers getting hot, which happens quickly if you&#x27;ve purchased the Oster A5 Turbo 2 Speed.</li>
            <li> so i decides to try them on my wahl pro&#x27;s and they fit perfectly, The spring action load is great for different size clippers!</li>
            <li> I think the attachments that I got with the Fastfeed worked fine for my use, but these are much more substantial.....</li>
            <li> moGHBNJHTWR2X2]]The combs fit flawlessly to my mother&#x27;s old Oster Golden A5 2 Speed Animal Clipper (78005-500-002) and are sturdy enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided on a set of Oster professional clippers and have been a happy clipper since.  </li>
            <li> is that they fit even better than the originals.</li>
            <li> The combs are attached via a metal clasp that is spring loaded which ensures a sure, continuous fit.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been a problem nor do I see it actually becoming one.</li>
            <li> Great set when paired with the Oster professional.</li>
            <li> Better grip compare to cheap adapter.</li>
            <li> Great set of comb attachments complete with a carrying pouch.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
            <li> It is great for anyone beginner or professional barber.  </li>
            <li> I will get blades for some of the shortest guards because it is more precise.</li>
            <li> I took a chance; I wasn&#x27;t sure that they would fit.  </li>
            <li> I wish they posted a clearer more precise description</li>
            <li> This is a great range of combs, well made and clearly marked in sizes to complement my Oster hair clipper.</li>
            <li> purchased to use with oster a5 turbo 2-speed professional clippers they are great</li>
            <li> They snap on and work great on my old Model 123 Oster dog clippers, even if I now use it to trim my beard and cut my hair.  </li>
            <li> Well I was pleased to see that these have a bit of a metal spring system built into each guard/comb, so that the piece is securely fastened to your clippers.</li>
            <li> Fits much better than the cheap all plastic combs.</li>
            <li> I got the attachments fast and they are of good quality.</li>
            <li> Oster Fast Feed Clipper With Attachments]] was an upgrade for me, and it would have been a fair deal at about $58.00.</li>
            <li> B000LRHWFI Oster 78004-011 Powermax 2-Speed Clippers]], allowed us to groom her much quicker, more effectively and more</li>
            <li> If you cut your own hair (or have your wife do it like me) then it&#x27;s definitely worth investing in quality clippers and this comb set.</li>
            <li> I had not realized when I purchased an Oster hair clipper that this one required special guards!  </li>
            <li> Great combs super fast to put on and off.</li>
            <li> There are many more pieces in this set than I needed (my wife cuts my hair using the #2 or #3 and that&#x27;s all we really need), but for the price I bought the whole set and am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very secure and easy to remove and clean.</li>
            <li> excellent former barber work partime out of my house fits most clippers, secure and easy to remove worth the money</li>
            <li> I ordered this set because it goes able the 1/2\\&quot; that the original set had.  </li>
            <li> I also like that there are more options than what originally came with my clippers.</li>
            <li> After 30 years of using cheaper clippers, I finally decided to spend the money on a good set!</li>
            <li> Much better setup than the original guards.</li>
            <li> The original clipper doesn&#x27;t come with many combs</li>
            <li> as it is, and although their performance is superior when it comes to bringing hair to the blades, the lengths (1/2\\&quot; at most on the 3 ½ blade) which they cut are more appropriate for fades and fine trimming on the sides and back of the head - that&#x27;s where these combs come in.</li>
            <li> They are easy to put on and to take off.</li>
            <li> They are easy to switch on and off.</li>
            <li> They are easy to attach and stay in place.  </li>
            <li> This set easily meets all the length needs you want when trimming your pet.  </li>
            <li> Their add for the clippers was easy to understand and gave me all the details of what was included with the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fits easily onto my Oster Turbo A5 clippers...</li>
            <li> and they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and work well.</li>
            <li> The combs are easy to use.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m impressed with the cut of the Oster fast feeds.  </li>
            <li> understand Oster wanted to design a metal clip that wouldn&#x27;t break as easily</li>
            <li> These were easy to use with my Oster shaver, or whatever you call it.</li>
            <li> The bag, although useful, is not the best way to store them if you are going to switch between combs on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This comb set is easy to use, and it seems to be well made.</li>
            <li> it was easy.  </li>
            <li> It is that easy.  </li>
            <li> Attach easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While these things do what they are designed to do, and are easy on and off, for self-cuts</li>
            <li> every so often to make it easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li> They provide easy on easy off application when I need to change lengths.</li>

            <li> Yes, having the actual metal blades is a better option, but for the price, these work great.</li>
            <li> Each spring loaded plate slides easily and grabs the Electric Oster Shaver.</li>
            <li> So not as easy to use</li>
            <li> Spring makes it easy to put on and take off the the clippers.</li>
            <li> All needed sizes, Clip on easily to my unit and stays on, Came is good time,  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> liked it very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to say these things are pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I like a shaggy crown and legs but a more trimmed body to keep her cool</li>

            <li> Yes .... the blade was checked to make sure it was clean, oiled and free of hair.  </li>
            <li> Perfect as expected!!</li>
            <li> new year and good luck in 2013 .&lt;br</li>
            <li> they work fine</li>
            <li> But for now these work fine.</li>
            <li> I use about three sizes, and they all fit well, and are easy to change.</li>
            <li> It would be an excellent product for dogs with less hair.</li>
            <li> and they went on just fine.</li>
            <li> They fit the cutters quite well and were easy to attach to the clipper.</li>
            <li> The universal comb attachments all work great on my A5 - easy on, easy off - except for the 1/16th, but</li>
            <li> They work fine.</li>
            <li> They work fine for that.</li>
            <li> Make sure when you are putting these on, you hook the bottom part of the comb first, and then push it to where the top is up over the blade and let it fall into place.  </li>
            <li> if either the clippers or the comb set explained this in their descriptions.&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I can&#x27;t even return the combs b/c I threw out the packaging, assuming they&#x27;d be fine.</li>
            <li> Easy to fit and remove.</li>
            <li> They seem to be sturdy and holding up fine.  </li>
            <li> I use these with the #40 blade and they work fine.  </li>
            <li> Made to specifically fit Oster hair clippers, they are easy to attach and stay in place.</li>
            <li> I have used from #000 to #1 as the clipper blade, and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> this is the best wont slip off or mess up your cut by fallin off</li>
            <li> Easy to attach and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the very cheap price.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit on like the cheap ones that come from wlamart, but they work well and not as easy to break as the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> They fit fine , but the metal plate catches her hair sometimes.</li>
            <li> These work fine and fit my Oster cutter.</li>
            <li> the blade comb attachments fit perfectly on the Oster pet clippers and made our little buddy look super!</li>
            <li> And this was the very first time this product had ever been used!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that cleaning it and oiling it makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Now Amazon is charging me $5.75 to return the combs that I would not have ordered if the product description of the clippers had been accurate.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and don&#x27;t fit Oster clippers at all.  </li>
            <li> The guards for my clippers were losing the teeth and no longer felt secure when attached.</li>
            <li> The Fastfeed did come with a set of attachments that others reviewed as being cheap so that prompted my purchase of these attachements.  </li>
            <li> They have a spring on them that keeps them secure to the blade and wiggle free.</li>
            <li> The product description said the comb set will fit my A5 two-speed Oster clipper...</li>
            <li> yes it did fit but in an imperfectly way.  </li>
            <li> They feature a spring-loaded metal clip for secure attachment, and mine did come with a storage pouch.</li>
            <li> They DO fit on my Oster Fastfeed clippers.  </li>
            <li> that where made to fit the Oster clippers.</li>
            <li> These combs attach securely to the clippers with a spring-loaded mechanism.</li>
            <li> Fit</li>
            <li> The combs stay secure and do not vibrate or rattle in operation.</li>
            <li> They fit snug with my Oster 76.</li>
            <li> and I read reviews that said they do fit.</li>
            <li> The Universal Comb Set works great with the Oster 76 Clippers.</li>
            <li> so they fit all models.</li>
            <li> One great American Made product!</li>
            <li> fit just about any pair of clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> #1,2,3, 4, and 5 wont fit on the Oster 76 blades  thus rendering them</li>
            <li> but when I did they didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> They do fit my clippers but cant use any of them.</li>
            <li> The bag looked of cheap quality when i was looking around at online pictures</li>
            <li> It is a great set that will last.</li>
            <li> They do not seem to fit my clips and the description stated that they can be used with my clippers.</li>
            <li> These BTW did not even fit onto the Oster clipper, I ordered it with, for from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I was misled on what these combs fit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them lightly for two weeks</li>
            <li> But you would expect these attachments to fit Oster blades,</li>
            <li> Skip Tooth blade and assumed that these would fit.  </li>
            <li> They even fit a pair of Wahl clippers that I have.  </li>
            <li> I had my doubts about whether they would fit, but after reading the reviews I bought the set.  </li>
            <li> Looking to replace the combs on my Andis Dog Clippers, I searched for a durable set that would fit any clippers in my possession.  </li>
            <li> The product description says they fit all Oster clippers but that excludes the &amp;#34;fast feed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great guides overall</li>
            <li> The guards fit well after you under stand how the spring loaded clip works.  </li>
            <li> did not fit perfectly</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t cheap out</li>
            <li> The set of combs do not fit my Oster clipper perfectly.</li>
            <li> There is no way to adjust as the clip on the comb has two tabs which fit into slots on the Oster clipper.  </li>
            <li> &quot; and \\&quot;All comb sizes are designed to fit any Oster</li>
            <li> This product is so cheap.  </li>
            <li> These fit my clippers so well.</li>
            <li> These fit the trimmer as advertised and for the cost of a cheap haircut</li>
            <li> THEY ARE WELL MADE AND FIT SNUGLY ON THE CLIPPER.</li>
            <li> The Yorkie&#x27;s hair is light.  </li>
            <li> These fit my Oster well, no complaints.</li>
            <li> despite what another reviewer had to say, these DO fit the A5.</li>
            <li> These are a cheap solution but don&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> and based on the design it would probably fit on almost any shaver I used it on.</li>
            <li> Well made can fit detachable blade clippers .</li>
            <li> They fit my Oster 78004-011</li>
            <li> They all fit our Oster clippers well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit on the Oster clipper we bought them with.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
            <li> Specifically it doesn&#x27;t fit the Oster Juice cordless.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the Oster and Andis clippers sold on Amazon often come with #000 and #1 included, so you should have no problem making it work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> and so far so good.</li>
            <li> This pack of clipper attachments gets used with my Oster 76 and have thus far proven a good buy.  </li>
            <li> I have really been able to be more versitle with my lower blades.</li>
            <li> Good professional quality combs.</li>
            <li> easy to use, don&#x27;t come off till you want them too (held on by a spring loaded clip), AND its a full set of 1-10, not 1-6 like the cheap sets.  </li>
            <li> I virtually had to cut downward to make it cut right as opposed to being able to go in any direction with the Wahl color pro.  </li>
            <li> Attach super easily, has a great grip and stays on throughout the entire job.</li>
            <li> You attach the metal hook side first and push the front over the clipper blades; backwards from most cheap combs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The spring-action clips make reliable attachment and quick removal incredibly easy: just place the metal clip of the combs under the metal blade on the clippers and then pull forward on the plastic comb until it can drop over the metal blade.</li>
            <li> Hence I own the Oster Classic 76 clippers.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t want to buzz your head in the winter, you can just give it a quick and easy trim without leaving your head fuzzy or spiky, just a uniform cut..</li>
            <li> and i love it very much since im an aspiring groomer.</li>
            <li> When I finally got one on, the fit is far from perfect.</li>
            <li> Once the combs are on the full range of blade adjustment is still available.</li>
            <li> I bought them because the original comb that came with the clippers broke after about 18 months.</li>
            <li> also don&#x27;t replicate the cut of the original</li>
            <li> However the snagging was significantly reduced by using a #30</li>
            <li> I originally gave these things</li>
            <li> Had been using an old cheap model, this is so much better!</li>
            <li> and I got these in the original Oster packaging.</li>
            <li> exactly what hubby needed, his uses often and is satisfied</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace an original comb that broke from my Oster clippers.</li>
            <li> very sturdy, lots of sizes to choose from, fit perfectly on the Oster Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper.  </li>
            <li> With the Fast Feed you get a #1, #2, #3, and #4...all perfectly fine, but I use a number 6 on top and number 5 on  the sides, so I went ahead and got this</li>
            <li> Plastic comb guards are never going to be quite as good as genuine Oster metal blades, but getting 10 metal blades would set you back about $300.  </li>
            <li> I continue to need more and more items to complete my grooming kit.</li>
            <li> Definitely worked perfect for my beat up old unit.</li>
            <li> I bought these for show grooming horses quickly and precisely with Oster A5 Turbo clippers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to cut our dog&#x27;s hair at different lengths without changing blades.  </li>
            <li> I get a really clean cut with these combs.</li>
            <li> I had to keep taking off the guard to clean it which made my dog&#x27;s haircut seem like forever.</li>
            <li> The combs fit perfectly but they are a little tricky getting on the first time</li>
            <li> The quality is excellent and I&#x27;m sure they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> These are functional and do the job but are not the perfect fit, obviously it needs to fit multiple styles...</li>
            <li> Now I just need to get my technique right!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hard plastic construction with the spring loaded mechanism allows for a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The versatility of the set, allows me to cut my dog&#x27;s hair at any length, I choose.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that these combs are strong and have a spring loaded mechanism to very securely snap them in place.</li>
            <li> your hair is clean and damp the combs slid through pretty easily.</li>
            <li> these are cool to hold you over until you can afford all the metal blades for these clippers.</li>
            <li> I truely believe it had something to do with the MADE IN U.S.A thing.</li>
            <li> This complete set allows me to cut my own hair to the length I want.  </li>
            <li> The attachments come with cool bag to store them in.</li>
            <li> I have already used it up to 5 times since I purchased it and got the full value out of it.</li>
            <li> I have never had such a good set.</li>
            <li> Great, cost effective alternative while I am gradually collect the more expensive metal blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve a nice &#x27;fancy&#x27; Pivot Motor Oster Razor that this set is completely incompatible.</li>
            <li> Much better than the clips that came with my fast feed.</li>
            <li> their nothing super special ...</li>
            <li> is usable, but didn&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li> and it fit just right.</li>
            <li> and they fit just right.</li>
            <li> I knew as soon as I took them out of the Amazon box that they weren&#x27;t going to fit on my clippers, and I was right.  </li>
            <li> I was worried they wouldnt fit right</li>
            <li> The 10 comb set is worth the money, but it most certainly doesn&#x27;t trim as close as the metal clippers.</li>
            <li> Other than that I am happy.</li>
            <li> Other than that they work great.</li>
            <li> Fading with the stock metal blade which comes with the Oster Classic 76 works so much better than with the plastic comb set.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy to put them on and off, and they clean up quickly.</li>
            <li> The attachments arrived quickly and as described.  </li>
            <li> A tremendous aid</li>
            <li> The product was quickly delivered and it met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to give my family a decent hair cut.</li>
            <li> quick delivery.</li>
            <li> works ok, but don&#x27;t need most of these, use only two of them..</li>
            <li> There are many different sizes and one that I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> I am a complete Amatuer, and did a fair job , thanks to these combs.  </li>
            <li> i received them quickly...</li>
            <li> came quick, was as described..</li>
            <li> There are many more combs that I can possibly use but the set is inexpensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are not the same kind of garbage that come for \\&quot;free\\&quot; with cheap $25 - $50 clippers you buy at Wal-Mart, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THey say they fit most Oster clippers but apparently the Oster Fast Feed is not one of the most.  </li>
            <li> theses combs seem like they are fairly high quality and are better than the comes i had for my wahl clippers</li>
            <li> (Now the Wahls I had were a pretty cheap pair, so I can&#x27;t speak for all of the attachments.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> Also, the comb attachment doesn&#x27;t fit exact to the clipper.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> first I didn&#x27;t think that these fit at all, but then I discovered that they DO work with the 000 blade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am more than content with my new Oster Comb Replacement Set.</li>
            <li> The quality appears to be the typical great quality of Oster products.</li>
            <li> The combs that came with the fast clipper are easy to up on and take off, however these, which are made by oster, are the biggest hassle of my life.</li>
            <li> I have an oster fast feed and they were easy to put on and use.  </li>
            <li> Overall though, this was a pretty good purchase once I honed by barber skills.</li>
            <li> These are really easy to attach and work really well with the number 40 blade.</li>
            <li> These blades attach easily to a variety of clippers and are fast to switch on and off.  </li>
            <li> but it is very old and huge!</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Fits tight on clipper head and is a great clipper mate.</li>
            <li> The metal spring attachment means a good, tight fit, no rattling.  </li>
            <li> these the,re so tight fitting nice</li>
            <li> I just received my Oster Fast Feed clippers, model 76023-510, and this comb set which is supposed to fit any Oster clippers.</li>
            <li> They fit very well.  </li>
            <li> These combs are sold with the fast feed clipper and claim to fit all Oster clippers.  </li>
            <li> These do fit the Oster Fast Feed--I thought they wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I saw a couple reviews saying these did fit on the Fast Feed version clippers and others stating they did not</li>
            <li> They fit very well on the Oster 76.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and fit snug on my Osters, Wahls, and Andis.</li>
            <li> It does the trick and really does fit everything.</li>
            <li> Fit my bay bliss very well.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Also worth mentioning</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and only use one comb, plus the clippers with no comb at all.</li>
            <li> I used these combs with my Oster A5 Golden</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought these comb set guides for trimming up my Golden Retriever from time to time.  </li>
            <li> A 10 piece kit was probably far more than I needed, but that&#x27;s something I learned in the process.  </li>
            <li> Once I applied some (considerable) thumb power to fitting them in place, bingo, all was well.</li>
            <li> kind, which take a completely different type of comb attachment.</li>
            <li> definitely worth taking chances with.</li>
            <li> These are a nice and solid set of combs.  </li>
            <li> Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Essential if you own an Oster.</li>
            <li> So glad to have these to fit over my big clippers.  </li>
            <li> For years I cut my own hair weekly - and occasionally my sons&#x27; hair - to save time and get the results I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my Oster 78005-010 Golden A5 Single-Speed Clipper to use on my persian cat.</li>
            <li> , I looked at all of the different options available online and decided to try the Oster brand set figuring that it would be slightly more compatible with Oster brand clippers.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money and it works.</li>
            <li> will worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, heavy duty plastic with many comb sizes to choose from.  </li>
            <li> The spring loaded attach is very quick and convenient and they fit better than I expected or have experienced with this type of attachment in the past.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for easy trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my oster classic 76 does the job, fast change convenient and very secure spring loaded</li>
            <li> I use them with the 000 blade and it makes cutting very easy as the Oster clippers and design are the absolute best I have ever</li>
            <li> Other than that they are very nice and with the metal clip should last better than the plastic combs/clip that came with this clipper.</li>
            <li> These are very easy to put on the Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed clipper and get the job done.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find the original combs that came with my Oster Fast Feed</li>
            <li> the harder the job ,i think it would be better to buy the metal blade for longer cuts from Oster,i,m not sure which on ,contacting them would be best</li>
            <li> Right?</li>
            <li> It was right there with the Items</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> Have the right size blade for the job is a must.</li>
            <li> The hair would go right up to where the blades are &amp; wouldn&#x27;t do anything after that.  </li>
            <li> price is right and they do their job.</li>
            <li> The allow me to make the right cuts between the blades.</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> Maybe I just need to get used to them, but I am not liking them right now.</li>
            <li> They clip right on no problem I have no regret</li>
            <li> No matter what your profession you need the right tools.  </li>
            <li> they looks right</li>
            <li> They snap right on.</li>
            <li> Bought these, price was right.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> I know they fit the Classic Pro 76 model, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair left, but the combination of these two things makes it very easy.</li>
            <li> Pushing down on the sliding metal back before latching it on to the clipper works the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Nice to have because I&#x27;m not a professional hair</li>
            <li> Might be good for the hair on your head but is not useful for beards at all.</li>
            <li> They fit nice and tight, so no worries they will move or fall off.  </li>
            <li> They fit my Oster well and snap on nice and tight.</li>
            <li> The guards fit nicely, but there were no instructions on how to get them on the clippers and it did take me a few minutes to figure it out.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this to trim up dogs of various sizes and hair types, this would probably prove to be more useful to you.  </li>
            <li> I home groom our Labradoodle and having several sizes of combs to clip different parts of her body is great.  </li>
            <li> I expected a better fit with the suggested shaver.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use the combs on clean dry combed out dogs, so you don&#x27;t break the teeth off..</li>
            <li> The is a good set but the design needs to be slightly tweaked.</li>
            <li> Probably would fit other brands, but can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li> It states in the product description &amp;#34;All comb sizes are designed to fit any Oster Clipper as well as most other clippers available&amp;#34; is does NOT.</li>
            <li> This unit overheats quickly and I have stopped using it, the Wahl ( human ) unit from costco at $30 has lasted longer, cuts better and doesn&#x27;t get as hot so fast.</li>
            <li> The Famous Classic 76 Professional</li>
            <li> Had a hard time putting them on and taking them off the first week or so, but they work great now.</li>
            <li> They are accurate as far as the length of hair they leave</li>
            <li> Nice metal backing, absolutely no wiggling nor an unsecured fitment.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived promptly, product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> A must have for your Oster Fast Feed!</li>
            <li> So i had to buy these extra ones to make sure i could go to higher numbers,</li>
            <li> too many numbers only use two sizes</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Overall these are much better than the plastic snap on combs that came with the clippers.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t go on the way a plastic comb fits so be aware of that as you put them on and take them off.</li>
            <li> is going to break on the first use, like some others I got before.</li>
            <li> and they are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> they fit, but clippers wouldn&#x27;t cut nearly as well, if it all with the guards on.  </li>
            <li> Just bought my first set of Oster&#x27;s Platinum Spirit clippers and they cut my hair like silk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Because it was a forced separate purchase I deducted a star, not for performance, which is great.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> First off, as was mentioned in another review, the set is metal &amp; spring loaded.  </li>
            <li> They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do but they will pull your dogs hair if there is the slightest tangle in your dogs coat which causes them pretty noticeable discomfort.</li>
            <li> Still, an expensive and good brand, I use it on my dog and it works great, I just needed these combs to do different sizes</li>
            <li> The higher the comb number the longer the cut.  </li>
            <li> so many low end combs can do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the bigger size combs for my yorkies.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely get more of this.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t specify that they don&#x27;t fit all Oster Professional clippers.</li>
            <li> After busting the package open, I found that they don&#x27;t even come close to fitting.</li>
            <li> Well there is one area I trim for someone, but for that I use the Wahl Peanut ;-)</li>
            <li> These fit my Oster Professional 76023-510.  </li>
            <li> Fast ship as well!</li>
            <li> Absolutely did not work with my Oster Golden A5</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> / you would be better off buying an additional blade for different cuts /</li>
            <li> The clipper got really hot after 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I actually bought these to go along with the shaver as a gift, but I think I should have just bought more blades.</li>
            <li> The best set ever made and totally worth the few bucks spent.</li>
            <li> I did watch some videos on You Tube, first.</li>
            <li> The cheap off-the-shelf clippers never seemed to last or quite to the job I wanted but were OK - and frequently the combs broke or slipped.  </li>
            <li> You would do better with a different set.  </li>
            <li> Outstanding product with TEN combs that snaps over the 0000 Oster clipper head attachment and expand the use of your clippers exponentially.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> so this set is necessary if you need to get more versatility from it.  </li>
            <li> Love having multiple lengths so we can trim to our liking.</li>
            <li> They clip on securely and do not make a loud noise once fastened on.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Looks like a good set but did not fit ours.  </li>
            <li> A waste of good money.</li>
            <li> Much more secure and well made then my previous Wahl.</li>
            <li> They attach firmly to my classic Oster 76 classic clipper and it seems like that&#x27;s the clpper they were designed to fit.  </li>
            <li> A good selection of Combs for different length cuts, a good buy, particularly for those who groom dogs with different type coats and at widely varying lengths.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the combs work nicely in keeping my dog&#x27;s coat lengthy yet trimmed.</li>
            <li> Reviewing the guides independently of the Fast Feed Clipper - these are well worth purchasing for the metal/plastic/spring construction and secure mounting on the right clipper type</li>
            <li> Ofcourse this is the first time that I bought some high cost clippers, but they are well worth the money.</li>
            <li> There is an extremely snug/tight fit and they are easily removed as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally bought a set of these for my Oster 76 Classic, but they also fit the Andis BGRC I purchased later.  </li>
            <li> Product works great for me, the combs stay on the blade and it arrived earlier than expected - yeah.</li>
            <li> It works great but be careful not to force it on the clipper or else you will bend the metal teeth back.</li>
            <li> , I bought the set to have more options, but I&#x27;m only using the #2 guide, based on how much I like the metal Oster #3 3/4</li>
            <li> However, they fit my old Wahl very well.</li>
            <li> will definitely recommend, looks very sturdy, love it</li>
            <li> Maybe a professional would use more, but then a professional would not purchase the clipper that I did.  </li>
            <li> You spent good money for professional clippers, spend some on pro attachments.</li>
            <li> My little dog looks very handsome after his trim.</li>
            <li> thanks very much</li>
            <li> These universal guide combs do not fit exactly you kind of have to engineer them into fitting but taking them off and putting them on</li>
            <li> *ONLY downfall buying these and not the metal ones, is that the #1 metal piece the Oster comes with will heat up pretty dramatically, and can easily burn the skin when touched)</li>
            <li> One thing positive about Wahl clippers and their combs is that they are uncomplicated.  </li>
            <li> I feel that I still get a nice clean cut which is normally hard with plastic guards.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped it would be; quality comb set for my Oster Fast Feed Clipper.</li>
            <li> So I now advise other potential buyers to ignore what the Oster rep told my fellow bamboozled reviewer &amp; press (literally) bravely on.</li>
            <li> First set of clips purchased for my oster fast feed.</li>
            <li> it was exactly how it was described and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Very high quality, worth what I thought of as a high price for clipper combs.</li>
            <li> I owned a few combs of this type prior to purchasing this set and like the fact that they are very secure when attached to my oster clippers, yet very easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this set with the full understanding of what I was actually ordering, and guess what - I got exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li> New to clippers and didn&#x27;t want a scalp job on my golden doodles.</li>
            <li> Lots of different lengths and easy to read.</li>
            <li> I do not ha too much experience but be aware that the # 1 is like a real # 2</li>
            <li> I am a strong male</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even fit any oster clippers that are only 1 1/2 years old!!!!</li>
            <li> The quality is good and they will probably last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> these are SOOO much better and don&#x27;t come loose.</li>
            <li> Tight good fit but sometimes springs come loose and can be a pain to readjust</li>
            <li> The plastic blades work ok, but I am going to upgrade up to the metal blades in the very near future.  </li>
            <li> but also they are very clean and accurate even in the hands of an amateur.</li>
            <li> They also came with a grey storage bag, which I put the larger ones in and put the smaller combs in my Clipper case!They fit great on my Oster A-5 Professional Clippers.</li>
            <li> I could bend them back and they worked fine but would like to see them a bit heavier.</li>
            <li> They work very well, if not as perfectly as pure blades.</li>
            <li> I clip my own little dog.  </li>
            <li> Only option available is to return the whole package and not replacing it???</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t thing a reasonable person would expect Oster to create a set of attachments that fit ever possible clipper.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;comb&#x27; on these is open all the way through, there is no stopping point to force the hairs to stand on end and get clipped at the accurate length.  </li>
            <li> Delivered fast and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Luckily I don&#x27;t really use #5 much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems getting these to work with my Oster Fast Feed Clippers.</li>
            <li> I have the set of Oster fast clippers.</li>
            <li> the guides work very well.  </li>
            <li> However, the combs will not go through matted or tangled hair: they will only work on a smooth, tangle-free coat.</li>
            <li> After trying for days to put the combs on the clipper, I gave up, called Oster, and learned that the \\&quot;Fast Feed\\&quot; model is not a \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; clipper and is incompatible with all 10 of the combs.</li>
            <li> These attacments work very well for my Oster pet clippers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The combs are made of plastic and the spring and hook attachment are from steel (stainless, I think).</li>
            <li> They are very secure--no rattling around.</li>
            <li> I am using these on the oster fast feed clippers.</li>
            <li> The attachments fit as promised and overall</li>
            <li> This comb set is more than what I expected.</li>
            <li> these clipper combs are solid - unlike the cheap ones they give you with the clippers.  </li>
            <li> They have an adjustable spring clip, so they can fit different sizes of clippers.</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by Amazon when purchasing the Oster Fast Feed clippers.  </li>
            <li> The fact that Amazon specifically recommended this item to be purchased along with the fast feed is misleading.  </li>
            <li> If you purchase these attachment they are not compatible with the Fast Feed clippers.</li>
            <li> They worked very well</li>
            <li> This works very well with the Oster razor.  </li>
            <li> this is very good&lt;</li>
            <li> We bought this set in additional to our Oster clipper and it works very well, both for the dog and for the men in the family.  </li>
            <li> These are very durable, they seem just like the ones at a barber shop.  </li>
            <li> 8 didn&#x27;t care that much.</li>
            <li> It was six dollars vs. the twenty I paid for the whole</li>
            <li> i really like them.</li>
            <li> really* need a size 6 (and can always get one separately if we do)</li>
            <li> These attachments fit all three brands because they have a self tightening spring which adjusts the back of the guide comb to each clipper blade head.</li>
            <li> A must have really</li>
            <li> They all work very well with the Oster electric clippers that I have.</li>
            <li> The plastic does not feel like it can hold too much abuse</li>
            <li> They do fit the standard #10 blade that comes with the A5 Turbo clippers.  </li>
            <li> Instead, they maintain the same language:  &amp;#34;Specially designed to fit Oster Clippers. . .</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of combs to use with the Oster fast feed Clippers.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set of attachments to use with the Fast Feed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this item with Oster Fast Feed clippers.</li>
            <li> I broke one of the plastic guards on my Fast Feed.</li>
            <li> The spring-loaded clip is simple to work with, and holds it securely with no movement.</li>
            <li> The combs stay on very well, even when they get bumped by fidgety horses.</li>
            <li> We have used this item and it works very well with our cutter.  </li>
            <li> These guards work very well.</li>
            <li> High quality product!</li>
            <li> does not work very well</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Has worked very well for me</li>
            <li> I have become an accomplished groomer.</li>
            <li> I still use these guards on a daily basis but I am in the process of finding something better for my Professional Fast Feed Clippers.</li>
            <li> Its very helpful</li>
            <li> I wanted the real thing</li>
            <li> Comb set is described as universal, but doesn&#x27;t fit our Oster electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take any real degree of strength to do</li>
            <li> I really like these, except when I received it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get it</li>
            <li> I figured I didn&#x27;t really have anything to lose.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like these combs.</li>
            <li> These things are the real deal.</li>
            <li> This comb set fits my Oster very well.  </li>
            <li> Very Displeased.</li>
            <li> So much for &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; quality products.</li>
            <li> much else to say...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for haircuts done at home!</li>
            <li> I use these with my Oster Fast Feed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All I need for the whole family.&lt;br /&gt;thanks to Oster and amazon.</li>
            <li> Not too much to say about this set except that it works as advertised on my Oster clipper.  </li>
            <li> I really like the additional sizes that come with it</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t protect them very well either.</li>
            <li> These very affordable comb attachments are a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; with your Oster clippers.  </li>
            <li> real like that .A</li>
            <li> There are no alternative combs for the fast feed clipper (which is a great product otherwise), even on the Oster website, but not happy with the misleading advertising.</li>
            <li> It may take some getting used to, but, my first impression is it&#x27;s ok, but, definetely not worth the pricetag and the headache that comes along with breaking the comb set in.  </li>
            <li> I will save a nice amount of money cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> The quality of the combs were equal or better than the old combs.</li>
            <li> Liked them well enough that I bought a second set to keep at my home away from home along with the Andis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One example: if you are thinning on the top, you could use a #4 on the sides and the back of the head and then a #2 the top to tame the thinning areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a Oster A5 2 speed clipper about an decade before by a veterinarian&#x27;s recommmend.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very powerful &amp; sufficient clipper than when i used National japanese rechargeable clipper which can adjust  comb by length of pet&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used clppers in the past with a head designed to fit this sort of comb, and it&#x27;s easy as pie.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if other kinds would fit more easily, but I really like the variety of sizes in this kit.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, the attachments are not compatible with the Fast Feed clippers, as many other reviewers have noted.  </li>
            <li> i liked very much everythig is what i expected, the product detail it was the same as it was shown</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s true that it can be jammed onto the fast feed clipper head, it clearly isn&#x27;t made to fit.  </li>
            <li> The original combs that came with my Oster clippers slide on to the end of the clippers and sit on solidly.  </li>
            <li> (Way better than other plastic clipper attachments).  </li>
            <li> With a couple of other items on my purchase I qualified for the free shipping and everything arrived four (4) days before it was projected to be delivered!  </li>
            <li> Found combs pretty useless for clipping my dog&lt;br /&gt;Probably need clipper blades to do the best job  combs attached well enough</li>
            <li> It did not fit even though it is advertised as \\&quot;specially designed to fit oster clippers\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> but they work well and are much better then the few that come with the Fast Feed!</li>
            <li> They come with a bag that is large enough to fit all 10 combs into and a few more, if you have them.  </li>
            <li> I have two large dogs that I groom all year but take off more fur during the summer season and less in fall and winter.  </li>
            <li> Prefect fit with my New Clippers.....did not get caught when trimming little Milo....easy to clean..</li>
            <li> The bag is ok, but in order to find the right comb I usually have to dump them all out.</li>
            <li> Meaning the back of the comb sticks out a good quarter to half an inch where it connects to the clipper.  </li>
            <li> It seemed only reasonable to add the $25.00 \\&quot;Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set Specially Designed to Fit Oster Clippers\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a long time for something to fit my Oster dog grooming clippers and these do the job.</li>
            <li> As a result, I can apply a fair bit of pressure when cutting the back and sides of my head, giving me a nice even cut all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Despite its being called Universal, this comb set doesn&#x27;t fit the Oster Professional Fast Feed Clipper and had to be returned.</li>
            <li> With Oster&#x27;s set, the opposite is true.  </li>
            <li> And of course, like the name says, they&#x27;re universal and fit my other clippers fine.</li>
            <li> The plastic comb set is ok in the interim, but my recommendation would be to save your money and buy the metal blades because eventually you will upgrade and buy them down the road.</li>
            <li> Just put the metal tabs on the back of the blade and press forward, they fit like a dream, and from what I can tell, universal is right, this design should work with any clippers.</li>
            <li> thing I like most about them is they have a few combs that are really large, so</li>
            <li> I called Oster and the explained that since the blade is not flat on top then the combs are designed to sit raised to that the teeth align properly.</li>
            <li> When I got the new clipper,  I saw they no longer include any guide at all!</li>
            <li> If I use a 000 blade and the size 3 plastic comb, it barely clips anything, the comb just doesnt force the hairs into the right position.  </li>
            <li> This comb set is easy to use and has a wide variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> The clippers were sufficient, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li> I use these on my Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li> I purchased the plastic blades/comb set with my Oster Classic 76.  </li>
            <li> Bought these to accompany my Oster 76 classic clippers.</li>
            <li> The only caveat is that because they are universal, you need to make sure that the comb is lined up with the blades correctly when you attach them to the cutter.  </li>
            <li> B003U8BPY4 Oster Classic 76 Clippers]]</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Oster Classic</li>
            <li> I bought for the Oster Classic 76</li>
            <li> They work on Oster Classic 76.  </li>
            <li> if you are like me and are using the Oster Classic 76, just get the metal blade(s) that you want your hair cut to, and stick to that.</li>
            <li> Bought these for the Classic 76.  </li>
            <li> I wear my hair very short in the back and a bit longer and curly on the top.</li>
            <li> I just bought oster&#x27;s classic 76.</li>
            <li> The clippers that we have are an older moder but</li>
            <li> I am using these on a classic Oster 76.  </li>
            <li> I picked these up with the Classic 76.  </li>
            <li> the combination of my Oster Classic 76 and these combs does the trick admirably.  </li>
            <li> Once a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a fashion enthusiasts, I love to keep hair style trimmed and well maintained all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Had Panasonic $35 machine which definitely served the purpose, But this little monster, changed the experience and added many options in cut size, experience, performance and definitely an ultimate outcome of each</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re okay with a tight buzz cut, then you&#x27;re probably going to want these to go with your clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are nicer than the ones included with the Fast Feed (seem higher quality) and give me a lot more flexibility with the bigger sizes, plus they come with a little storage sack that I ended up using for my Fast Feed trimmer instead.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone who uses Oster clippers.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the brand.</li>
            <li> High quality item.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> These combs are high quality and durable.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these suckes.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these</li>
            <li> Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Even with the 1/4&amp;#34; and shorter attachments, it ends up catching the dog&#x27;s hair maybe two to three times during the entire trim as opposed to every to every other pass.</li>
            <li> Maybe with a little more use they will be easier to put on/take off.  </li>
            <li> There is not much else to say except that these fit fine, they do the job they need to do and there are a wide range of sizes.</li>
            <li> I have a typical story to many other reviewers whom have been using cheap discount clippers.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet but looking foward to using it with my new Oster Classic 76 clipper.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, we were very pleased with the purchase and though we still need small clippers and scissors to do the detail work, the body, neck and leg grooming went much faster with these combs and the clippers linked above.</li>
            <li> Worked well with My Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clippers.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about them fitting since a few reviews mentioned it.  </li>
            <li> No complaint there.  </li>
            <li> They are made well, and will not break with normal use.  </li>
            <li> This is obviously made for the pro barber and to me worth twice the price.</li>
            <li> Bought the Oster A5 golden 2 speed clippers along with the #3F and #3 blades as well as this universal comb set.</li>
            <li> worth the extra $.</li>
            <li> These plastic combs dont have that, they are basically open all the way through, so no matter what length the hair, if its not already standing pretty much straight up, the comb does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I imagine I&#x27;ll only use 2 or maybe 3 of all of these combs, but it was still worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> only use one or two of the guards, but they were well worth the purchase of the set.</li>
            <li> These were sturdy enough yet I believe the cost was far greater than the actual production cost.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than ones that had came with the a pair of Wahls that I had bought the fast feeds to replace which were loose and were VERY noisy when the clippers were turned on(which caused me to buy the fast feeds) , and the stock ones, which were also better than the Wahls, but still had a slight gap between them and the blade, causing them to slightly move when pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> They might work fine on other models but not mine (76023-510).</li>
            <li> The other combs are ok so far but the stylists will have to check them frequently for cracks.</li>
            <li> so we use these universal combs to cut our hair the right length.</li>
            <li> These combs fit the Oster 111, as well as other brands.</li>
            <li> HOW WELL THEY WOULD WORK OR FIT ON OTHER BRAND CLIPPERS.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t give feedback on fit of other brands/models.</li>
            <li> A little challenging to attach to my professional clippers.</li>
            <li> These are a must have if you buy a new Oster clipper.  </li>
            <li> When i recieved these i had not yet recieved my new oster clippers.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this</li>
            <li> Ordered these blades to go on the new oster groomer I just purchased.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I got it and everything is there,and its a lot cheaper than buying a new one.</li>
            <li> I bought these with a new Oster Power Pro Ultra.  </li>
            <li> You live with them for decades.</li>
            <li> New blades and these combs did the trick.  </li>
            <li> I had a clipper that needed a new set of combs</li>
            <li> These and the new shaver will pay for themselves in a  year of savings from the shop.</li>
            <li> I used one of the combs for the new Oster I purchased.  </li>
            <li> New in the box and ahead of time.  </li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought better hair clippers: the oster fast feed.  </li>
            <li> The plastic quality could be a bit better and harder, but overall it works well.</li>
            <li> I bought these in conjunction with a pair of Oster Fast Feed clippers because I also cut a couple of friends&#x27;/family&#x27;s hair that require the longer guard length, and the one&#x27;s supplied with the Fast Feeds only go up to a #4 (1/4 in).</li>
            <li> B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]] and these clipper combs</li>
            <li> cat seems much happier without all that fur and the guides allowed me to do a professional looking job without the professional&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> It clearly was not designed for the Classic.</li>
            <li> There are quite a few people claiming these fit the Fast Feed, but I assure you, they do not.  </li>
            <li> It fit properly and the combinaton cut properly.  </li>
            <li> I kept the tapered \\&quot;left ear\\&quot; and \\&quot;right ear\\&quot; combs from my old clipper.</li>
            <li> I decided to spend a little more on a hair clipping set this time around, and ordered the Oster Fast Feed clipper together with these Oster universal combs.</li>
            <li> Only reason for the one star off is they do get little warm but this product for the price was not meant for professional use.</li>
            <li> strong metal spring-clip attaches the combs tightly to your clippers.  </li>
            <li> These are exactly what we had been needing to properly groom our mini schnauzer.</li>
            <li> We had been using a smaller handheld wireless set of clippers that came with two combs, but it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough and the combs didn&#x27;t pick up much hair</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Now I can clip my 3 year old Yorkie poo with ease!</li>
            <li> Saves buying all the different sized blades at higher cost.</li>
            <li> It seems you have to buy the exact brand of these, should be universal</li>
            <li> I am not a professional dog groomer, and my dog looked pretty decent after I shaved off his winter coat with these guards.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate this good or bad since I never actually had a chance to use it, but I can say that these don&#x27;t fit Oster&#x27;s Fast Feed clippers.</li>
            <li> I have been doing research for a long time looking for the right hair clippers in which to invest.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use these combs on my dogs and just shaved them right down to the razor because the pulling was more than I would subject them to.</li>
            <li> Along with clippers, these produce a nice even cut (even with my thick hair!</li>
            <li> These fit well, but were difficult to get on and off the clippers easily.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some play/give that allows you to slide the comb over the blade for a tight fit.  </li>
            <li> I had another one that fit so tight (spring loaded), that it broke off while I was trying to remove it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re built nicely enough to where I believe they&#x27;ll last a long time, and the range of sizes makes any reasonable cut-length available at your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But they are a universal comb that fits several different brands, so they are not that easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li> Since blades start out very short and only get so long, I imagine that most people (like myself) will be interested in using the combs to keep their pet&#x27;s fur long.</li>
            <li> These work very well (at least on an Oster Classic 76), and are a true bargain.  </li>
            <li> Price is great considering the metal attachment that keeps the clips on while cutting.  </li>
            <li> They cut the precise length but just seem to fit weird.</li>
            <li> I bought this set to go with an oster clippers (Oster Professional 076023-123 Operation Homefront Desert Camo Fast Feed Adjustable Blade Clipper) that I also purchased at the same time.</li>
            <li> These combs are shaped differently than the blade on my Oster Professional Fast Feed clippers, and no amount of trying will get them to seat on it.  </li>
            <li> can use my 3 1/2 size Oster 76 blade and it will clip a TON of hair on my beard, clearly the hair is longer than 3 1/2.  </li>
            <li> I just received the Fast Feed Clippers and Universal Guide Set.  </li>
            <li> I have 3 dogs I keep up with as far as clipping.  </li>
            <li> The thing is, after we got our clippers we still needed the Oster Professional Comb Set,</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than buying the attachments individually.  </li>
            <li> Probs would be nice to know that they attach through a spring so they should latch on the to back of the blade and stretch up to fit the cutting portion of the 000 guard it comes with.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer noticed the same thing but the review hasn&#x27;t been voted up much</li>
            <li> The only gripe is they seem to have a gap when attached to my Fast Feed.</li>
            <li> My guess is that they are made for the professional Oster models.  </li>
            <li> I use these to cut each of my young boys hair and this pack has proven cost effective:&lt;br /&gt;[($15/per haircut)</li>
            <li> I recently purchased an Oster Fast Feed (Chrome) clipper.  </li>
            <li> I have some 20 year old clippers that my parents had (that still works), and put the spring loaded comb onto the clippers.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you are doing this professionally, well who am I to tell you what to do.</li>
            <li> Plenty of sizes to choose from for professional grooming of my dog.</li>
            <li> My oster is like 40 years old</li>
            <li> These work okay - not spectacular</li>
            <li> I bought this set of combs to go on my old Oster 151-04 Pet Groomer.  </li>
            <li> My dog is old and has warts.  </li>
            <li> Some of the comb sets on the market are knock offs and are not of the complete quality of the factory combs.</li>
            <li> and I use them professionally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these with my Oster 76er Professional edition</li>
            <li> both times he looks as though he had been professionally cut.</li>
            <li> The Oster professional grade has convinced me that I should have upgraded years ago.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money or time - unless you want to throw your money away.</li>
            <li> The spring-tensioned attachment always assures a snug fit and a firm hold on your clipper.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the Engineering that took place in making these.</li>
            <li> B000LRN31A Oster A5 Turbo 2-Speed Professional Animal Clipper]]</li>
            <li> It took a minute or two to figure them out as far as attaching to the Oster.  </li>
            <li> Buyer beware, does not fit Oster Lucky Dog or the older version</li>
            <li> Get the good ones, you wont&#x27; be sorry.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve never done grooming before), but apparently these clippers require that I buy new BLADES, to the tune of $35-$40 each, to get the length I want.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews on amazon  state that these combs fit on the model I mentioned above which is an outright lie.</li>
            <li> The method to place them on fast feeds doesnt allow them to lay flat.</li>
            <li> When i bought my first oyster clippers they came with crappy combs ,they were so loose barley held on ,now with</li>
            <li> I recently bought a new Oster clipper to replace one I used for about 15 years!  </li>
            <li> So this cause me to have to stop every few mins and take the clip off and clean off the fur.</li>
            <li> Meaning and (understand my entire review is based on the Oster Classic 76)</li>
            <li> you cut hair a lot you NEED the Oster Classic 76 clippers and likely need these guards as well!</li>
            <li> I purchased these at the same time I bought my Oster Classic 76 clippers.</li>
            <li> hand isn&#x27;t steady enough to free-hand my hair cut.</li>
            <li> but I typically do not use guards that size anyhow.</li>
            <li> For those who have the Oster Classic 76 clippers with changeable blades, this comb set can be used ONLY with the Oster 000 blade (the blade with the closest haircut).  </li>
            <li> The latching mechanism is a bit tricky, but easy enough with a little practice.</li>
            <li> so it slides forward, then lift up on the front teeth with your other hand, and it will come right off.</li>
            <li> Never having purchased a high end set of clippers before I was expecting snap-on plastic combs similar to those included with cheaper clipper sets.</li>
            <li> Only reason I did not give it a 5 is because I do not like the way the comd sits high on the bottom of the blade.</li>
            <li> but these combs were easily and frequently snagging using the #10 blade when trying to cut the thick curly fur of my poodle.  </li>
            <li> I use these with a Oster Limited Edition Fast Feed Clipper and they seem to be completely compatable.  </li>
            <li> You need to make a few more passes than if you used blades, but I&#x27;m just cutting my own hair</li>
            <li> I had initially balked at the price when I was pondering purchasing them, but now that I&#x27;ve received them I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t try to save a few dollars by purchasing a lesser set.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, except that of the ten sizes of clips, we received two which were identical, and were missing one.  </li>
            <li> went to a local beautician&#x27;s supply store and purchased the missing size, which works fine.</li>
            <li> However, quiet makes little difference when the product does not satisfy the primary purpose it is marketed for.  </li>
            <li> Hard to use with clippers that have removable blades, and I could not find any videos or instructions on how to take them off easy.</li>
            <li> I eventually had to return these and get a different set of combs, which oddly I couldn&#x27;t find on Amazon (had to google &amp;#34;Oster fast feed comb attachments&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I really love that they snap on so solidly - my other combs would end up falling off half the time</li>
            <li> A little tough to install and detach, but they are very handy and allow for fades etc.  </li>
            <li> I did not open the item for several weeks, and when I did, I discovered that the one size I really wanted had not been included in error.</li>
            <li> Unless you want to go right down to the skin, you need a guide.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t your average cheap ass plastic things that clip on and fit poorly.</li>
            <li> I got these due to the original combs were getting loose and moving on the clippers.</li>
            <li> kit contains sizes 0 through 10 which gives enough small steps that even a non-pro can do a good taper/fade haircut with very little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These comb guides are way large and useless, I mainly needed a 1/4 inch guide to shave my dogs for the summer which is very hot here.</li>
            <li> I was very worried about these combs because of some reviews I&#x27;ve read about them not fitting the Oster Fast feed clipper, which I had purchased.</li>
            <li> They are clearly labeled with the height number and the actual length in inches of the cut.  </li>
            <li> The metal bracket on these combs don&#x27;t fit the blade on the clippers, so they&#x27;re pretty useless on that model.</li>
            <li> Takes too long when you&#x27;re in a hurry, and I even broke the adjustment lever on my Fast Feed because it creates a lot of pressure on the lever when you open and close, so</li>
            <li> B00513G9P6 Oster Professional Care 10-Piece Universal Comb Set]]</li>
            <li> No regrets on the purchase</li>
            <li> For a clipper with a larger gap (my 20 year old Wahl)</li>
            <li> I have no regrets getting these.</li>
            <li> The entire set is complete so no worries in needing any additional guards for my unit.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to trim the wild hair on my border collies back side.</li>
            <li> I bought these guards because I also need to Man-scape once in a while (apparently my head hair fell to my chest and legs?)</li>
            <li> I like the variety of sizes this set offers as it allowed me to cut his coat different lengths.</li>
            <li> It was totally unnecessary, as the attachments that came with the clipper were more than sufficient for my needs.</li>
            <li> When I try to put them on they spring thingy kind of moves out of alignment and make it really difficult for the spring part to move.  </li>
            <li> The combs that came with the Fast Feed allow for a more natural position while cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re the wrong kind if you have some difficulty</li>
            <li> Operation Homefront Camo Classic 76 Limited Edition)</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i also use the lower ones for my goatee chin very fast no complaints&lt;br /&gt;dont settle for less</li>
            <li> These snap right on to my Oster Classic 76 Limited Edition clipper and stay firmly in place.  </li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have clippers with this comb set together, or at least a buy one get one half off.</li>
            <li> After just one use on a customer, the #4 comb cracked right down the middle and split into two pieces when removed from the clippers.</li>
            <li> THEY BREAK WHEN YOU TAKE THEM OFF RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE</li>
            <li> I purchase this item should work Oster fast feed trimmer but not easy to set up easy and not  fit properly.</li>
            <li> and we needed to use the set right away without waiting another few days for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Nice little feature, as I&#x27;ve had guards fall off mid cut in the past...</li>
            <li> With two very hairy dogs, these really save their cost in less than a single visit to the groomer.</li>
            <li> Quiet, fast and durable, they have been cutting my hair for a few months and are working great.</li>
            <li> combs are a little harder to put on any other combs I have used in the past, but are more secure.</li>
            <li> attachment method seems a little cheesy, but they work great.</li>
            <li> My dogs thick long fur needs a 2nd trim in the summer and these me more choices of length.</li>
            <li> Received as always in a timely manner; 1st-the universal comb set made a big difference in the way the clippers performed, must have if your looking for professional results....</li>
            <li> This machine is definitely is a make for commercial use anf therefore has more capability to deliver way above average performance than other personal hair clippers.</li>
            <li> If your clipper blade is too long, it might be too hard to fit the combs onto the blade, because the spring will not extend far enough.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little snug at first and the mechanism isn&#x27;t the smoothest.  </li>
            <li> They were a little tricky to work at first.  </li>
            <li> Guards tend to be a little tricky to put on at first, but they work.</li>
            <li> Assuming this set would fit my recent purchase (Oster fast feed) Wrong.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was a bit hesitant to buy this product since I have the Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper that several reviewers state these combs do not fit.</li>
            <li> However, they are cheap - not sure how long they will last.</li>
            <li> Not a professional groomer, but with the selection of trimming heads I can maintain my poodle and tibetian spaniel between professional visits.</li>
            <li> These combs DO NOT fit on Oster fast speed model 76023-510!</li>
            <li> but I was willing to give it a go to save a few bucks on my haircuts.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a spring-loaded clip and the springs can be a bit stiff at first.</li>
            <li> I suppose I could have read other reviews to learn about the high quality of this product, but who has the time for that?</li>
            <li> Each one of them individually is good, but it is almost impossible to put the comb on because of the design.</li>
            <li> and I seriously could kick myself for not finding these sooner, they are not the same cheap snap on ones that come with the cheap-o clippers you get at target, you know, the ones that pop off every chance they get, these are the total opposite.......</li>
            <li> When you mount the comb to the clipper, it is not flatly attached.  </li>
            <li> My old plastic guards were loose</li>
            <li> The only advantage I can see for this product over the much cheaper (half the price)</li>
            <li> Very secure - to the point of being difficult to remove from the clipper sometimes.</li>
            <li> These combs do not fit the Oster A-5 properly / at the rear they leave a large gap</li>
            <li> It took me a minute to figure out how to put these on, because it&#x27;s different from the little guards that come with the Fast Feed, but once I realized there is a spring involved</li>
            <li> Finally broke down and bought an Oster classic after the blade from my Cheapo shears came off and buzzed me on the side of my head for the second time.  </li>
            <li> Good value for the money, too bad they don&#x27;t include a carrying bag.</li>
            <li> but I only need half of them; not a complaint juts must grow my hair longer in the winter and shorter in the summer.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars but the combs don&#x27;t fit the blade flush and a little difficult at first to place on clipper.</li>
            <li> I have complete confidence that will never happen with these due to that spring mechanism.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to a wiser and doubtless more patient reviewer than me, my earlier complaint that these combs do not fit the Oster Fast Feed trimmer proved to be completely wrong.</li>
            <li> On my Classic 76 they snap in firmly with a spring loaded clamp.</li>
            <li> They are too big fit loosely and very clumsy to use.</li>
            <li> They are professional quality, and snap on to my Oster Pro Fast Feed clipper firmly with a little effort.  </li>
            <li> Bought the cheaper kind previous to this purchase, returned due to broken pieces, rusted spring mechanisms etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this 10 piece set for my Oster Fast Feed clippers and it does not fit at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest them but hope they last me for as long as I need to groom.</li>
            <li> The guards appear well made and should last a long time for at-home use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair short for a long time now.  </li>
            <li> Although I have not had them for long, I expect that they will last 10-20+ years.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully they last a long time, but if I loose ones would buy the same again</li>
            <li> The attachments are well made and should last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> When attaching them, you need to start from the metal back end of the guide, then push forward until the black plastic teeth extend past the metal ones, and it&#x27;ll snap right on.</li>
            <li> had read the previous reviews about how hard it is to put these on (it&#x27;s true).  </li>
            <li> I like the blade sizes but the fit to the base unit is not quite right.  </li>
            <li> I quit using after they got stuck in my poodles hair several times to the point where I needed to remove to get loose.</li>
            <li> This was clearly an upgrade, compared to what I had been using, it&#x27;s just that they are tight and a challenge to switch sizes.</li>
            <li> construction seems quite sturdy, but you would likely break them if they were attached to the clippers and you drop the clippers down hard on the counter (not good for your clippers, but it can happen when trying to cut your own hair!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t use these much, My dogs are very long haired ( one retriever mix and  two Pyrenees) and it is so difficult to comb through their hair, even after a thorough brushing.</li>
            <li> glides through very thick golden retriever hair like its nothin</li>
            <li> When first starting to use them they were a bit tough to get on</li>
            <li> After using Wahl clippers for 3 or 4 years, I wanted to see if there were better quality cutting clippers.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad to be saving the money that a groomer would have charged me for cutting him.</li>
            <li> Not quite wide enough.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not nearly as close as a cut as it should be, and it&#x27;s not nearly as clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I took so long to get one.  </li>
            <li> I have been clipper-cutting my husband&#x27;s hair and my 2 sons hair for years (though I am not a professional hair stylist).  </li>
            <li> The Oser Universal Comb Set was everything  that we wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> This is not quite what UI expected although they work ,  they are on the low end of a quality scale..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not owned it long</li>
            <li> these will hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> I first bought some generic clipper combs for my oster, but when they came in some of them were chipped or broken already.  </li>
            <li> However, the thing I really don&#x27;t like about them is the angle you are forced to use with them.  </li>
            <li> major qualm with these is that they have a major design flaw that is subtle enough that no one would notice until they tried to use them.  </li>
            <li> I have previously used my trimmer to groom my dog, but now I wanted to try cutting my own hair to save money.</li>
            <li> minor downside is that the teeth on these combs can be somewhat sharp around the corners, especially on the shorter attachments, so I inadvertently elicited some minor cringes until I learned how to angle these things.  </li>
            <li> I understand from some other posts that  these combs are NOT completely universal on all Oster combs.</li>
            <li> they are about 2cm above the rear of the blade due to the design of the spring loaded mechanism.</li>
            <li> I can only hope that other purchasers read these reviews before wasting their time and money on this product.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous when I received these because they were completely different than the guards I have for my clippers now, but the spring loaded guards are definitely the way to go!</li>
            <li> I am just a self-cut veteran, I don&#x27;t cut other peoples hair.</li>
            <li> I have a little 4.5 lb Yorkie - very tiny - with fairly short hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s commonly known that the Oster Classic 76 cuts closer than any clipper out there</li>
            <li> I have only used a few sizes and have removed the combs multiple times.</li>
            <li> I did some research, and it seemed like people&#x27;s main complaint was that the combs that came with the machine weren&#x27;t sufficient for their needs.</li>
            <li> Bought an Oster clipper which came with a limited selection of combs.</li>
            <li> I have a had an Oster clipper for years with a limited set of clips.  </li>
            <li> I like to keep my hair shaved down very low and</li>
            <li> set does not contain the two tapered combs for cutting above the right and left ear.  </li>
            <li> The only thing missing is the tapered attachment seen in many other less expensive hair clippers.</li>
            <li> Makes cutting even, easy.</li>
            <li> The prices were almost half of what local beauty supply place was selling them for.</li>
            <li> if you serious about cutting your own hair (especially a buzz cut which is what i style my hair to) EXCEPT NO SUBSTITUTE!</li>
            <li> Having looked around on-line to replace a comb that was broken, I finally broke down and bought this whole set.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissappointed in that they are very hard to attach to the clippers.</li>
            <li> These are not good guard combs, I cut with the oster classic</li>
            <li> only gripe with this product is that it can be a little troublesome attaching it to the clipper.</li>
            <li> I wish my Oster had a little indent or something on the back of the blade to ensure alignment, but...  </li>
            <li> With the #1 you definitely have to push a little harder.  </li>
            <li> They are spring loaded and fit onto the blade by hooking over the cutting end and then grasping the back of the blade with a little spring-loaded metal plate with a clasping shape to it.  </li>
            <li> The spring-loaded mechanism is extremely hard to use because of the poor fit.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure how long they&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> The one that is missing is one we would have regularly used.  </li>
            <li> solid metal connector, heavy duty plastic...  </li>
            <li> Be careful and do your research.  </li>
            <li> I tried universal comb sets, but it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> heavy springs seem like they will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only had them for a few days but no problems yet.</li>
            <li> Theres not really much to say.</li>
            <li> it does an uneven job and don,t even think of using the larger combs ,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it until I had to actually use the #7 which was a few weeks after I received them.</li>
            <li> Worked as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> -10 are represented, (minus a 9 guard) and that gives the option of just about every buzzing length one could ask for.  </li>
            <li> but a wide variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> I bought the cheaper version that you find in stores and they flex and bend and make things harder.  </li>
            <li> The combs are slighly off center.  </li>
            <li> they are a total waste of money for my application /</li>
            <li> These are NOT Universal, and do NOT fit all Oster clippers.  </li>
            <li> Minus 1</li>
            <li> Minus 1/2 star.</li>
            <li> would have done 4 1/2 if I could because I think there is a need for a few sizes smaller as well.</li>
            <li> They came in just when i expected them.</li>
            <li> expected these to just be plastic guards you slip onto the clippers,</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mind having a few extra.  </li>
            <li> These say universal but do not fit my Oster clippers.</li>
            <li> Product was as described delivered a few days later than expected date.</li>
            <li> They are a little harder to put on, due to the spring loading, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> These do not work plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped them multiple times, but not a single tooth has broken yet.</li>
            <li> I say a little warm after cutting hair for 30 minutes and 2 boys with thick hair.</li>
            <li> This is mainly due to the fact that I am not worried about whether or not the guard will slip off.</li>
            <li> ALSO Bought by other bamboozled Customers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why these combs didn&#x27;t come with the unit as they do with other clippers.  </li>
            <li> The combs do occasionally catch in the fur when there&#x27;s a small mat or pin knot.</li>
            <li> These things work extremely well and are a fraction of the price you&#x27;d oay for a set of blades.</li>
            <li> KINDA SHARP ON THE END</li>
            <li> But they do work on the other one.</li>
            <li> They will NOT work with other blades, for example</li>
            <li> They arrived quicker than expected which worked out well for me!</li>
            <li> The lower two guards do not match up to the other Oster guards.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they will brake, but I have a hard time removing them (maybe because I&#x27;m being extra careful not to break another comb like it happened with the other brand of combs I had).</li>
            <li> The comb set is very stiff and the spring loaded mechanism is difficult to use especially the first time.  </li>
            <li> Oster, overall, is definitely a notch above the less expensive competitor&#x27;s products that I&#x27;ve used over the years.  </li>
            <li> Its like this, if you look at a regular metal clipper blade, say a 3 1/2 size, the empty spaces in the comb part STOP closer to the blade which means that when the hairs &#x27;hit&#x27; this point, they are forced upright and thus get clipped at the height of the blade.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the point at the end are too sharp, and scrap your head.  </li>
            <li> and I found these online for waaaaayyyy less than the other places</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that said these attachment guards to not fit other Oster clippers</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is I thought these would be the metal combs</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that hair can get stuck between the outside edge of the clippers and the inside edge of the comb leading to it being pulled.  </li>
            <li> Not worth returning it,</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, I found it difficult to match the fast feed to the required combs...  </li>
            <li> These clipper guards will work with the Fast Feed however, they are obviously not made for it and are very difficult to get on and off.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The only way to avoid this seems to be to move the clippers quite slowly.  </li>
            <li> Be careful it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> My poodle&#x27;s hair would get tangled in it and it would pull, plus the cut was uneven since the spacing between the plastic teeth is too wide.</li>
            <li> Not terrible but slightly annoying.</li>
            <li> Use on the shedders to cut down on the amount shedded and the Schnauzer needs monthly clipping.  </li>
            <li> But was let down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only problem with this set is that it fits so tightly against the blade, that it&#x27;s extremely hard to remove the combs.</li>
            <li> , I can let other people know that there are two little clips on every guard and those little clips slide backwards to attach them onto the blade, so you can ignore the little hole/screw type area in the center of each guard.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use the original ones, i have bad experiences when they pop off</li>
            <li> However once I adjusted the blade height lever from the short cutting setting to the long cutting setting the comb easily snapped on like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> their made of black plastic with spring loaded kinda ...</li>
            <li> This is all Oster offers for this clipper to control different cutting lengths.</li>
            <li> It comes with every comb guide you may need for cutting an adult male&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I ended up being a set there for half the price</li>
            <li> Previously I bought a Wahl 9590-210 Pro-series Clipper Kit [[ASIN:B0031MPW5W</li>
            <li> Preferred having my hair slightly longer than 000 length, so I got this.</li>
            <li> THE LESS</li>
            <li> I stiffer less flexible plastic than I had hoped for, but well constructed.</li>
            <li> These is a replacement comb set for a clippers that have been used for a couple decades to cut a black mans hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a previous set, but lot the No. 1 attachment.  </li>
            <li> Far outperforms other less expensive shavers that I have owned,</li>
            <li> So, the height of the cutting actually is higher than that comb size indicated.</li>
            <li> Hair got stuck; blade didn&#x27;t cut, it was a mess.</li>
            <li> Holds tight and does not move on the clipper head.</li>
            <li> These combs come equiped with spring loaded locking mechanisms that keep the comb snug and tight.</li>
            <li> I took out one star because the springs in the combs are too tight.</li>
            <li> Combs stay tight to clipper head.  </li>
            <li> but you push the back on first at the base of the clipper and then push it forward to click in.  </li>
            <li> The Wahl blade and combs in the kit are slightly narrower than the Oster, so the combs in the Wahl kit will not fit my Oster.</li>
            <li> It also helps keep my little dog from feeling the heat of the blade.</li>
            <li> A little diagram or something may have been helpful just to save me that couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li> but with just a little bit of use the clip mechanism eases up and they clip on with no problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Performance: Can&#x27;t compare with the other two Panasonic machines, I used in past.</li>
            <li> .a little tricky to put on and</li>
            <li> and I feel a little ripped off.</li>
            <li> They are spring loaded and \\&quot;clamp\\&quot; on, takes a little force to clamp on.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if they work well with other Oster models (do some research).</li>
            <li> Mine got bent a little.  </li>
            <li> they even came with a little carrying bag.</li>
            <li> However, I feel a little uneasy that it is on correctly.</li>
            <li> Conairs is that it is a little quieter.  </li>
            <li> I thought they might be a little flimsy but their not.</li>
            <li> Unlike the cheap plastic crap that came with my previous set of Walmart clippers, these have a metal attachment mechanism that seems like it will never break.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of the performance and short life of the typical hair clippers you can purchase in the chain stores.  </li>
            <li> The poodle/maltese is curly and a little on the heavy side.  </li>
            <li> They can be forced to &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on the blade, but they don&#x27;t lie flat against the blade, and the position causes a very messy cut with no precision.  </li>
            <li> Make cutting hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> These are heavy duty attachments.  </li>
            <li> So wasted my money on these.</li>
            <li> But after using them a few times I got the feel for it.  </li>
            <li> And after a few months we&#x27;ve offset the price of me paying for my hair cuts.</li>
            <li> This does not fit the Oster salon pro well.</li>
            <li> I only wish that oster would have given me these combs instead of the poorly crafted plastic ones that came with it</li>
            <li> The combs can be attached but do not fit correctly.</li>
            <li> Package is missing comb #5, and I couldn&#x27;t reach anyone for sending it.</li>
            <li> never fit as well as purpose made clipper heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this is heavy duty for the price</li>
            <li> The combs do not fit snugly on the clipper (there is space between them and the clipper).  </li>
            <li> They DO NOT FIT the Oster T-Finisher model 59-01H.  </li>
            <li> These spring-loaded combs give you a firm hold to the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I found out by looking at a video I had purchased last year that you need a #40 blade ($25.00 approximate) to use with these combs.  </li>
            <li> I found these combs I purchased for the oster professional 76023-510 to be a bit difficult to get on and off of the device.</li>
            <li> Zero trouble for me.</li>
            <li> This is the case with everyone of them not just a few.  </li>
            <li> Clips on blades and fits firmly in place in use.</li>
            <li> This was basically wasted money.</li>
            <li> They have metal spring clips to hold firmly to the clipper blade on the unit.  </li>
            <li> I had to return them because they did not fit my Andis clipper.  </li>
            <li> the set was missing comb #4 and #7, instead it had a duplicate #5 and #6.</li>
            <li> They attach firmly to the clippers with no slippage.  </li>
            <li> They did not fit my oster clippers.</li>
            <li> Wasted $20 for my Oster.</li>
            <li> If you are having trouble figuring out how to put them on for some reason, just look at the video on the product page.</li>
            <li> Guess i wasted 23.00.  </li>
            <li> And missing the #5.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy these guards after reading a few reviews</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t they know these do not fit the Oster?</li>
            <li> The set came in with two number 6 combs and missing the number 5 comb.</li>
            <li> The clippers were a pile os shit unlike the clips that went with them</li>
            <li> A little stiff to get on and off the clippers</li>
            <li> Before I got half way through cutting her hair (Oster Professional 076076-123</li>
            <li> We are retired and on a very tight  budget</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very tight and has a lot of tension but that ensures it does not fall off in mid-haircutting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably going to have to Play with it a little to get it working correctly.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended buy!</li>
            <li> little hard to get off and on tho .</li>
            <li> Hard to use if you have not had the experience, and the combs do not fit on the 3.75 detachable blade.</li>
            <li> The receiving gap on the clipper is too small to work as designed.  </li>
            <li> a Oster Taler trimmer and the trimmer&#x27;s head is too small for the latching system built into these combs.  </li>
            <li> I have an Oster clipper set, have had them for years, this set DOES NOT fit!</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of fairly expensive Oster clippers and this universal comb set together in one of those Amazon combo packages that appear towards the bottom of the screen.</li>
            <li> Had to return to Amazon because these do not fit all Oster clippers!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to buy expensive replacement blades in different sizes.</li>
            <li> They are spring loaded so to speak, and unlike the clipper combs I have used in the past and had to fight to keep them on, these aren&#x27;t going anywhere until you take them off.</li>
            <li> So it make it difficult for blending, because the 1/16 is the same size as the 1/8 guard that came with the clippers</li>
            <li> The manufacture recommends using no more than a #1 clipper blade.  </li>
            <li> The unit performs well but is very heavy to manipulate by oneself.  </li>
            <li> 57 1- and 2-star reviews on Amazon, how hard could it be to modify the product description to at least explain what the comb set will NOT fit.  </li>
            <li> I keep them in a small sectioned hard plastic case now.</li>
            <li> The spring tension makes it really hard to put on and take off the combs.</li>
            <li> They work, they clamp on hard...  </li>
            <li> Hard to explain, but works well.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting another metal cutting head for different lengths.</li>
            <li> By that time, it was too late to return the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Allows for cutting around ears and gives you a choice of different lengths of cuts.</li>
            <li> Use these in our hair salon , that does at least 50</li>
            <li> They are spring loaded and wont come off no matter how thick the hair is.</li>
            <li> but it wouldn&#x27;t get through the thick fur.</li>
            <li> The metal retaining clips keep the combs on even with thick course hair.</li>
            <li> &quot; doesn&#x27;t mean it fits every Oster clipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professionally licensed barber, however I&#x27;ve been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for 23 years.</li>
            <li> These force an odd angle that makes it difficult to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A quality control issue (typical of North America, unfortunately).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I learned from experience that the combs can break if shoved to tightly into a bag/carrying case.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to get them on but no fear that they will come off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not often and all you have to do is turn off the clippers and work the knot out from around the base of the comb, but it&#x27;s something to be wary of if your dog isn&#x27;t as tolerant of grooming - one little pull from a stuck knot could set off a sensitive or grooming-averse</li>
            <li> i dont know why the professional hair stores around me are so stupid about barbering tools.</li>
            <li> I tried turning them on right out of the box and the clippers started smoking with this HORRIBLE SMELL coming out of the clippers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are also awkwardly shaped and a little hard to work with, but what else is there to use?</li>
            <li> Seriously, my hair is very thick).</li>
            <li> When you are cutting with them the hair collected between blade on shears and black plastic.</li>
            <li> use them for the past 3 years, well built!!</li>
            <li> No worries about these bad boys slipping off the clipper and leaving bald spots on your dome piece.</li>
            <li> It wasnt the seller it is the poor quality.  </li>
            <li> You have to poor out all the attachments to find the one you want</li>
            <li> Some people seem confused by this.  </li>
            <li> they are almost impossible to return as you have to destroy the package to get them out</li>
            <li> A little frustrated.</li>
            <li> Some have very thick hair and some have very thin hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I spent money on JUNK!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These ones clip on with a spring loaded clamp, which makes it a bit difficult at times, and they just don&#x27;t seem to be on as sturdy.  </li>
            <li> so the advertisement is wrong.</li>
            <li> but i was wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I went ahead and bought this item as well.  </li>
            <li> I returned this product, as the Oster clippers, I had ordered with it, were useless.</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY I PURCHASED THESE TO GO ON THE PIECE OF JUNK PET HAIR TRIMMERS</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I should not have done so.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy or you will be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was completely wrong.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it would be unfair to rate this product...</li>
            <li> (The worst part is this was a christmas present I gave to someone.)</li>
            <li> It is expensive to return</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> I am 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; and unfortunately bald</li>
            <li> They can be a bit difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> The problem with the unit is the heat; when you want to shave around the face without a comb it is uncomfortable for the dog.</li>
            <li> they were just snap ons, but they have some sort of weird metal spring mechanism where it latches onto the bottom of your blades</li>
            <li> both do a terrible job at cutting afro textured hair low and with the grain (at about a 2 length)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to put on and incredibly difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> That design is very flawed and makes it very frustrating to attach if you are in a hurry to get to it and cut hair.  </li>
            <li> So, I decided to purchase this set as a replacement and does it make a world of difference in cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> It has been inconvenient to the point</li>
            <li> Terribly disappointing.</li>
            <li> extremely disappointing  </li>
            <li> so you can keep cutting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trying to set any records for hair cutting....</li>
            <li> the unit was binding and/or pulling hair rather than cutting the hair.  </li>
            <li> These combs allow you to set the cutting length that you desire.</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> The spring loaded mechanism on these combs is very difficult to use as well.</li>
            <li> its just too bad</li>
            <li> The bad news?</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY TO SAY THE LEAST!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> For instance,  using the 1/2&amp;#34; guard on the 1/16&amp;#34; blade( one that comes with the oster) is painful compared to using the 1/2&amp;#34; dedicated blade.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the Wahl combs in the kit have wider teeth on the ends that the blades recess into so that the Wahl combs protect the fur from snagging: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I got two #2 guards and not a #1 guard. :(  </li>
            <li> Now i have to go and purchase a #6 gaurd separately.. very inconvenient for me.</li>
            <li> I am MAD!</li>
            <li> Just put the clip on from the base as it states</li>
            <li> I hate returning items.</li>
            <li> These are horrible!</li>
            <li> I tested it on myself - and the hair pulling was awful!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works okay, I bought the set to have more options, but I&#x27;m only using the #2 guide, based on how much I like the metal Oster #3 3/4 I bought, I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll be purchasing the #2 in the Oster metal as well</li>
            <li> Very good quality, probably better quality than came with my Oster clippers.</li>
            <li> very good product for the detachable clipper fits most blades i prefer the 5 00000 blade underneath the combs gives a cleaner cut</li>
            <li> Well-made set does the job!  Delivered fast and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and don&#x27;t fit Oster clippers at all.  I should have returned them, but didn&#x27;t have time to go through the hassle at the time.</li>
            <li> I got the attachments fast and they are of good quality. Just got two number 4&#x27;s and no number 5. Luckily I don&#x27;t really use #5 much. Other than that I am happy.</li>
            <li> Placed my order and was no time and guides were on their way!!! These guides are of high quality are very easy to install!!</li>
            <li> Great comb set for clippers! Fastens well with no problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this comb set to use with my Oster 76. I attach them onto a 000 blade and it fits like a champ. The plastic quality could be a bit better and harder, but overall it works well. It also works with Wahl&#x27;s Seniors clippers.</li>
            <li> They fit great and snug and do not move around. They are easy to put on and to take off. I like that they are not a snap om comb set. They also came with a grey storage bag, which I put the larger ones in and put the smaller combs in my Clipper case!They fit great on my Oster A-5 Professional Clippers. [[ASIN:B00513G9P6 Oster Professional Care 10-Piece Universal Comb Set]]</li>
            <li> I use these on my Oster Classic 76. They work very well, if not as perfectly as pure blades. I use them when I want my beard longer than the largest blade will accommodate.</li>
            <li> These guards fit perfectly on my oster classic 86!! Nice metal backing, absolutely no wiggling nor an unsecured fitment. Nice.</li>
            <li> nice products, I just needed one clip but yeah they work fine, i like it and if I lose it I&#x27;ll buy more</li>
            <li> I just received my Oster Fast Feed clippers, model 76023-510, and this comb set which is supposed to fit any Oster clippers. These do not even come close to fitting these clippers. The two metal guides are farther apart than the slots in the clippers.  I know they fit the Classic Pro 76 model, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> i liked very much everythig is what i expected, the product detail it was the same as it was shown</li>
            <li> A little challenging to attach to my professional clippers.</li>
            <li> The guards for my clippers were losing the teeth and no longer felt secure when attached. So, I decided to purchase this set as a replacement and does it make a world of difference in cutting my hair. This is mainly due to the fact that I am not worried about whether or not the guard will slip off. As a result, I can apply a fair bit of pressure when cutting the back and sides of my head, giving me a nice even cut all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe with this product is that it can be a little troublesome attaching it to the clipper. Pushing down on the sliding metal back before latching it on to the clipper works the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived promptly, product is exactly as described.  It paid for itself after one use (we have 3 schnauzers).</li>
            <li> I bought these to attach to a Oster Fastfeed clipper.  These are heavy duty attachments.  The Fastfeed did come with a set of attachments that others reviewed as being cheap so that prompted my purchase of these attachements.  I think the attachments that I got with the Fastfeed worked fine for my use, but these are much more substantial.....and the carrying bag was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> A must have for your Oster Fast Feed! A little stiff to get on and off the clippers but they work well and are much better then the few that come with the Fast Feed!</li>
            <li> Finally broke down and bought an Oster classic after the blade from my Cheapo shears came off and buzzed me on the side of my head for the second time.  I was kind of bummed that the Oster didn&#x27;t come with these, but I&#x27;ve had no problems since buying them.  These babies stay on til you take them off.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems getting these to work with my Oster Fast Feed Clippers. The attachment is part metal, so there is some durability and quality in the items.</li>
            <li> It was unclear to me when I read the product description just how this set of combs managed to be \\&quot;universal\\&quot;.  They manage this by providing a sliding clasp connected to a spring to accommodate varying lengths of blades.  I have a 20 year-old Oster razor and was a bit concerned about them fitting.  They fit very well.  The collection of attachments for the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine was shipping at amazing speed.  Very nice quality!</li>
            <li> I have the set of Oster fast clippers. They came with a standard set of combs up to #4. So i had to buy these extra ones to make sure i could go to higher numbers, The combs that came with the fast clipper are easy to up on and take off, however these, which are made by oster, are the biggest hassle of my life. It is nearly impossible to put on and incredibly difficult to take off. They just are not convenient. I would recommend something different.</li>
            <li> Four stars because I think they&#x27;re overpriced.  That said, they are quality combs.  The metal spring attachment means a good, tight fit, no rattling.  You attach the metal hook side first and push the front over the clipper blades; backwards from most cheap combs.  No regrets on the purchase</li>
            <li> Got these to go with the Oster clipper but could not get them through my (Aussie mix&#x27;s) hair.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they would work with another type of hair but not his. So wasted my money on these.</li>
            <li> I just received the Fast Feed Clippers and Universal Guide Set.  The receiving gap on the clipper is too small to work as designed.  I can force these to mount on the clipper, but it still does not work properly.  For a clipper with a larger gap (my 20 year old Wahl) the guides work very well.  Reviewing the guides independently of the Fast Feed Clipper - these are well worth purchasing for the metal/plastic/spring construction and secure mounting on the right clipper type and they come with larger size (1.25\\&quot;) guides.</li>
            <li> I purchased the plastic blades/comb set with my Oster Classic 76.  The plastic blades work ok, but I am going to upgrade up to the metal blades in the very near future.  Fading with the stock metal blade which comes with the Oster Classic 76 works so much better than with the plastic comb set.  The plastic comb set is ok in the interim, but my recommendation would be to save your money and buy the metal blades because eventually you will upgrade and buy them down the road.</li>
            <li> too many numbers only use two sizes</li>
            <li> I bought this set of clipper adapters to go with my Oster clippers.  Unlike the cheap plastic crap that came with my previous set of Walmart clippers, these have a metal attachment mechanism that seems like it will never break.  There are many more pieces in this set than I needed (my wife cuts my hair using the #2 or #3 and that&#x27;s all we really need), but for the price I bought the whole set and am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great job , thank you</li>
            <li> These combs will allow you to determine the length of your pet&#x27;s fur without needing to switch blades. Since blades start out very short and only get so long, I imagine that most people (like myself) will be interested in using the combs to keep their pet&#x27;s fur long. However, the combs will not go through matted or tangled hair: they will only work on a smooth, tangle-free coat. Other than that, the combs work nicely in keeping my dog&#x27;s coat lengthy yet trimmed. They are easy to switch on and off.</li>
            <li> I bought these in conjunction with a pair of Oster Fast Feed clippers because I also cut a couple of friends&#x27;/family&#x27;s hair that require the longer guard length, and the one&#x27;s supplied with the Fast Feeds only go up to a #4 (1/4 in). I&#x27;ve got to say these things are pretty amazing. They have a spring on them that keeps them secure to the blade and wiggle free. Much better quality than ones that had came with the a pair of Wahls that I had bought the fast feeds to replace which were loose and were VERY noisy when the clippers were turned on(which caused me to buy the fast feeds) , and the stock ones, which were also better than the Wahls, but still had a slight gap between them and the blade, causing them to slightly move when pressure is applied. (Now the Wahls I had were a pretty cheap pair, so I can&#x27;t speak for all of the attachments.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very nice, wiggle free, noiseless clipper guards/combs!</li>
            <li> I ordered these because the description claimed they fill ALL Oster clippers, including the 274.&lt;br /&gt;I have a Model 274/Series A and these combs DO NOT even come close to fitting this clippers.&lt;br /&gt;It is a totally different configuration.&lt;br /&gt;I had to send them back (Amazon refunded my money in one day) and called the Oster company to get what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;So make sure you have clippers these will fit!</li>
            <li> Brought this Oster comb set for my Oster clipper.  The product description said the comb set will fit my A5 two-speed Oster clipper...yes it did fit but in an imperfectly way.  When you mount the comb to the clipper, it is not flatly attached.  So, the height of the cutting actually is higher than that comb size indicated.</li>
            <li> The Oster clipper [[ASIN:B000B76T52 Oster Fast Feed Clipper With Attachments]] was an upgrade for me, and it would have been a fair deal at about $58.00. It seemed only reasonable to add the $25.00 \\&quot;Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set Specially Designed to Fit Oster Clippers\\&quot;...Right? It was right there with the Items ALSO Bought by other bamboozled Customers. After trying for days to put the combs on the clipper, I gave up, called Oster, and learned that the \\&quot;Fast Feed\\&quot; model is not a \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; clipper and is incompatible with all 10 of the combs. Maybe I&#x27;ll get around to sending the comb-set back.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets getting these. Now I can cut hair from short to not so short.  It also helps keep my little dog from feeling the heat of the blade.</li>
            <li> Work great, fit my standard clippers great. Would recommend. Been using for over a year.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for top of the line clippers, you have arrived.  These are a pleasure to cut with, especially larger animals.  They do the job with any hair accumulation, or motor bog-down. Great item, great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> These attacments work very well for my Oster pet clippers.  The price was the best I could find on the web.</li>
            <li> Plastic comb guards are never going to be quite as good as genuine Oster metal blades, but getting 10 metal blades would set you back about $300.  These work very well (at least on an Oster Classic 76), and are a true bargain.  They feature a spring-loaded metal clip for secure attachment, and mine did come with a storage pouch.</li>
            <li> I think these combs are great.  They DO fit on my Oster Fastfeed clippers.  They&#x27;re a little snug at first and the mechanism isn&#x27;t the smoothest.  But after using them a few times I got the feel for it.  Much more secure and well made then my previous Wahl.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, except that of the ten sizes of clips, we received two which were identical, and were missing one.  The one that is missing is one we would have regularly used.  I&#x27;m sure it was a mistake, but it wasn&#x27;t the product we ordered.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moGHBNJHTWR2X2]]The combs fit flawlessly to my mother&#x27;s old Oster Golden A5 2 Speed Animal Clipper (78005-500-002) and are sturdy enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combs are made of plastic and the spring and hook attachment are from steel (stainless, I think).</li>
            <li> I bought the [[ASIN:B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]] and these clipper combs so my wife could give me regular haircuts. I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair left, but the combination of these two things makes it very easy. I have no problem with the clips. Although I wonder if I should have bought just a different cutter head instead as we only use the #2 or #3 comb. But for now these work fine. And after a few months we&#x27;ve offset the price of me paying for my hair cuts. I&#x27;ve offered to do the same for my wife but it&#x27;s a no go! I guess the buzz cut is only for guys. The bag it came with is also handy to hold all those unused combs under the sink.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Oster 76 and they fit beautifully. I understand from some other posts that  these combs are NOT completely universal on all Oster combs. These are Oster brand, and they are Made in USA!&lt;br /&gt;A great buy and well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;They also come with a carrying pouch.</li>
            <li> The combs work great.  They are easy to attach and stay in place.  I like the spring attachment that helps keep it in place.  The price is right. Can&#x27;t find a better deal..I would recommend item.</li>
            <li> These are horrible! They don&#x27;t even fit any oster clippers that are only 1 1/2 years old!!!! I have two oster clippes and not one comb fit any of my clippers! I even have an andis and it didn&#x27;t fit that either!!!! I am MAD! I spent money on JUNK!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have a Persian-Himalayan cat that was in dire need of a trim. I had been looking all over for a comb set to go with my clippers. I ordered these and was pleased with the quality and fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cat seems much happier without all that fur and the guides allowed me to do a professional looking job without the professional&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone who uses Oster clippers.  Fit very snug and seem to work great.  Have had no problems at all.</li>
            <li> I have 3 dogs I keep up with as far as clipping.  Border Collie, Mini Schnauzer, and Chihuahua.  2 are shredders and one is a clip only.  Use on the shedders to cut down on the amount shedded and the Schnauzer needs monthly clipping.  Have the right size blade for the job is a must.</li>
            <li> This set easily meets all the length needs you want when trimming your pet.  It&#x27;s fast and easy to put them on and off, and they clean up quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought an Oster clipper that came with several attachments. I added this set to the order. It was totally unnecessary, as the attachments that came with the clipper were more than sufficient for my needs.</li>
            <li> I received two #7 guards but not a #8. Which is the most popular. A little frustrated.</li>
            <li> These things work great.  They firming attach to our Oster A5 clippers.  I would definately buy them again.</li>
            <li> I bought this 10 piece set for my Oster Fast Feed clippers and it does not fit at all! It says universal for Oster, but it does not fit the Fast Feed model. I can&#x27;t even find attachments more then 1/2 inch for my model?? I wanted 3/4 or 1 inch.</li>
            <li> They fit great and make my buzz cuts nice and even! I use a #2 on the top, #1 on the sides, and a #0 for my beard.</li>
            <li> This does not fit the Oster salon pro well.</li>
            <li> For anyone who has to clip their dog or other animals the Oster is one of the best clippers any one could own. My husband is a barber and used the Oster brand clippers in his shop many years ago. His father used them as well. My husband no longer cuts hair for a living but when we needed a good dog clipper that would do the job he knew just what to buy. The thing is, after we got our clippers we still needed the Oster Professional Comb Set, that where made to fit the Oster clippers. That was when I turned to Amazon for the best buy I could find on the internet. I have bought from Amazon before so I knew I would have a good experance buying from then again. Their add for the clippers was easy to understand and gave me all the details of what was included with the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy from Amazon again? You Bet I will. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I decided to spend a little more on a hair clipping set this time around, and ordered the Oster Fast Feed clipper together with these Oster universal combs. I&#x27;m very dissappointed in that they are very hard to attach to the clippers. When I finally got one on, the fit is far from perfect. However, they fit my old Wahl very well. Don&#x27;t know just how I&#x27;ll remedy the problem.</li>
            <li> These combs attach securely to the clippers with a spring-loaded mechanism. They are very secure--no rattling around. They work better than the combs that come with the clippers, both because they don&#x27;t vibrate and because there are more (and longer) lengths.</li>
            <li> Bought these to accompany my Oster 76 classic clippers. They are spring loaded and wont come off no matter how thick the hair is.</li>
            <li> their made of black plastic with spring loaded kinda ... their nothing super special ... I&#x27;ve seen better ...  they worked pretty good, did the job ...</li>
            <li> Combs work great. Make cutting hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;They Fit Snugly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Hard to get on&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m worried they my break my clippers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;This comb set is nice and all but the spring loaded clips leave something to be desired.  When I try to put them on they spring thingy kind of moves out of alignment and make it really difficult for the spring part to move.  Maybe with a little more use they will be easier to put on/take off.  If I had to do over I would not have made this purchase.  I am using these on the oster fast feed clippers.</li>
            <li> I am more than content with my new Oster Comb Replacement Set. The product does all it should, is as as advertised and was delivered in a fairly prompt manner. Be assured that I shall come to Amazon.com for any future needs I may have.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You&lt;br /&gt;Frenchie</li>
            <li> I am not a hairdresser by trade, but I do cut the majority of men&#x27;s hair in our family.  I have been doing research for a long time looking for the right hair clippers in which to invest.  I was tired of the performance and short life of the typical hair clippers you can purchase in the chain stores.  I decided on a set of Oster professional clippers and have been a happy clipper since.  The attachments fit as promised and overall is well worth the investment. I am pleased with the product and would recommend it to others.  I would buy from the seller again.</li>
            <li> Fits easily onto my Oster Turbo A5 clippers...you&#x27;ll want to make a custom cardboard? box to store your clippers along with some, most or all of these combs.</li>
            <li> This comb set is more than what I expected. Never having purchased a high end set of clippers before I was expecting snap-on plastic combs similar to those included with cheaper clipper sets. I was pleasantly surprised to find that these combs are strong and have a spring loaded mechanism to very securely snap them in place. I suppose I could have read other reviews to learn about the high quality of this product, but who has the time for that? ;)</li>
            <li> these clipper combs are solid - unlike the cheap ones they give you with the clippers.  solid metal connector, heavy duty plastic...  these will probably be the last set I ever buy.  very pleased.</li>
            <li> Did not cut my standard poodles hair at all.  I even combed him out b4 I started.  The hair would go right up to where the blades are &amp; wouldn&#x27;t do anything after that.  &amp; yes, I did check my blades &amp; they cut perfectly without the combs attached.  I had 2 different blades &amp; tr5ies them both without results.</li>
            <li> I like the combs so I can keep the depth of the cut the same all over the dog coat.</li>
            <li> Love theses and the amount you get with the order.I would buy them again if and when I may need them.</li>
            <li> Well, this is more of an add-on review stating that these combs fit my Fast-Feed clippers perfectly. Also worth mentioning is that they fit even better than the originals. All that is needed is to pull back the spring mechanism and voila! Snug, yet perfect fit. That is all. Have a nice day.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was a bit hesitant to buy this product since I have the Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper that several reviewers state these combs do not fit. Once I received them I initially could not get the combs on the clipper. However once I adjusted the blade height lever from the short cutting setting to the long cutting setting the comb easily snapped on like it is supposed to. Once the combs are on the full range of blade adjustment is still available. The combs stay secure and do not vibrate or rattle in operation. Overall these are much better than the plastic snap on combs that came with the clippers.</li>
            <li> I find these clipper attachements to be good quality and easy to use.  They fit snug with my Oster 76. Be careful and do your research.  I read other reviews that said these attachment guards to not fit other Oster clippers and I read reviews that said they do fit. The product says universal in the title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To speak on behalf of these guards with a Oster 76, I reccomend this set.  It is much cheaper than buying the attachments individually.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I have only used the guards twice. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the purchase of this product. The Universal Comb Set works great with the Oster 76 Clippers. Would do business with again</li>
            <li> Came on time! What I needed!</li>
            <li> These combs are sold with the fast feed clipper and claim to fit all Oster clippers.  While it&#x27;s true that it can be jammed onto the fast feed clipper head, it clearly isn&#x27;t made to fit.  The spring-loaded mechanism is extremely hard to use because of the poor fit. I&#x27;ve used clppers in the past with a head designed to fit this sort of comb, and it&#x27;s easy as pie.  There are no alternative combs for the fast feed clipper (which is a great product otherwise), even on the Oster website, but not happy with the misleading advertising.</li>
            <li> These are a must have if you buy a new Oster clipper.  I recently bought a new Oster clipper to replace one I used for about 15 years!  Back then, clippers came with 2 different length guides,  so that was all I needed.  When I got the new clipper,  I saw they no longer include any guide at all! Unless you want to go right down to the skin, you need a guide. So before I could even use the clipper,  I had to order these.  They work great, and you can adjust the length of the hair you want,  but I just can&#x27;t see needing the longest combs.  I would have liked to purchase just the shortest 2 or 3.  I rated these just 3 stars because I don&#x27;t think all the combs are necessary.</li>
            <li> This universal comb set works like a charm.  I have an oster fast feed and they were easy to put on and use.  The only caveat is that because they are universal, you need to make sure that the comb is lined up with the blades correctly when you attach them to the cutter.  I only wish that oster would have given me these combs instead of the poorly crafted plastic ones that came with it (they broke after 1 month).</li>
            <li> Received as always in a timely manner; 1st-the universal comb set made a big difference in the way the clippers performed, must have if your looking for professional results....and they stay in place...Excellent!</li>
            <li> I have to say that these are the best clippers that I ever owned. Ofcourse this is the first time that I bought some high cost clippers, but they are well worth the money. We have a family of 4 boys. Some have very thick hair and some have very thin hair. These clippers can handle any job. I&#x27;m very impressed, and wish I had bought them years ago.</li>
            <li> I was very worried about these combs because of some reviews I&#x27;ve read about them not fitting the Oster Fast feed clipper, which I had purchased. The combs fit great, I assume the people who had problems couldn&#x27;t figure out the mechanism - it&#x27;s a spring-loaded clip and the springs can be a bit stiff at first. Just put the metal tabs on the back of the blade and press forward, they fit like a dream, and from what I can tell, universal is right, this design should work with any clippers. Very high quality, worth what I thought of as a high price for clipper combs.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! The combs are attached via a metal clasp that is spring loaded which ensures a sure, continuous fit. They also clean very easily. Oster has done a great job with this.</li>
            <li> Assuming this set would fit my recent purchase (Oster fast feed) Wrong. The combs can be attached but do not fit correctly. This is all Oster offers for this clipper to control different cutting lengths. Now where do I turn so I can cut the top of my head at 3/4\\&quot; length??????????</li>
            <li> I love these attachments! I feel that I still get a nice clean cut which is normally hard with plastic guards. They&#x27;re very secure and easy to remove and clean. Good purchase if you&#x27;re thinking about it.</li>
            <li> Works great, nice cut with 10 blade under them.</li>
            <li> attachment method seems a little cheesy, but they work great.</li>
            <li> These are nice combs and have a good locking mechanism to keep them fixed to the blades. The only complaint I have is I thought these would be the metal combs but the body is plastic and only the locking mechanism is metal. It hasn&#x27;t been a problem nor do I see it actually becoming one. Otherwise, they do what they should and are a big step up from the combs found on the cheaper razors.</li>
            <li> glides through very thick golden retriever hair like its nothin</li>
            <li> The original combs that came with my Oster clippers slide on to the end of the clippers and sit on solidly.  I ordered this set because it goes able the 1/2\\&quot; that the original set had.  These ones clip on with a spring loaded clamp, which makes it a bit difficult at times, and they just don&#x27;t seem to be on as sturdy.  I guess they make them that way so they fit all models.</li>
            <li> When you put them away, make sure nothing is on top of them or they will bend and not work.</li>
            <li> I took the advice of a couples of people in here. They work great with the Fast Feeder. You just have to put the bottom of the combs with the clips against the bottom of the clipper and push the comb up over the teeth of the clipper. One great American Made product!</li>
            <li> I did not receive all the combs. The package had 2x#5 combs but NO #4.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to return the product or receive a #4 comb.</li>
            <li> Great guards. They work perfect with My Oster Classic 76. They have an adjustable spring clip, so they can fit different sizes of clippers.</li>
            <li> these are cool to hold you over until you can afford all the metal blades for these clippers. Probs would be nice to know that they attach through a spring so they should latch on the to back of the blade and stretch up to fit the cutting portion of the 000 guard it comes with. Best purchase I ever made for my career. Worth every penny</li>
            <li> These combs DO NOT fit on Oster fast speed model 76023-510! The spring loaded mechanism on these combs is very difficult to use as well. Other reviews on amazon  state that these combs fit on the model I mentioned above which is an outright lie. The combs do not sit flush on the blade they are about 2cm above the rear of the blade due to the design of the spring loaded mechanism. They might work fine on other models but not mine (76023-510).</li>
            <li> These are a good deal, good quality and will fit on most clippers.</li>
            <li> These do fit the Oster Fast Feed--I thought they wouldn&#x27;t but you push the back on first at the base of the clipper and then push it forward to click in.  There&#x27;s some play/give that allows you to slide the comb over the blade for a tight fit.  They don&#x27;t go on the way a plastic comb fits so be aware of that as you put them on and take them off.</li>
            <li> The set is very nice. It comes with every comb guide you may need for cutting an adult male&#x27;s hair. They are very sturdy. the plastic is very good quality and it does not look like is going to break on the first use, like some others I got before. I bought them because the original comb that came with the clippers broke after about 18 months. I tried universal comb sets, but it was a waste of money. I had one that the teeth of the combs would make contact with the moving blade as they got in between the teeth of the stationary blade. I had another one that fit so tight (spring loaded), that it broke off while I was trying to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with this set is that it fits so tightly against the blade, that it&#x27;s extremely hard to remove the combs. The spring tension makes it really hard to put on and take off the combs. I don&#x27;t think they will brake, but I have a hard time removing them (maybe because I&#x27;m being extra careful not to break another comb like it happened with the other brand of combs I had). I cut my own hair and only use one comb, plus the clippers with no comb at all. It might be a pain if you have to continuously remove and replace combs during one cut. I wish I could find the original combs that came with my Oster Fast Feed clippers.&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any problems with the vendor. It shipped to an FPO address in Japan.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for.  I checked the model number of the clipper and found the combs.  I have since used them and they are exactly what I wanted.  They are accurate as far as the length of hair they leave and they are easy to use. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford the individual blades. These are okay - they&#x27;re doing the trick but I&#x27;m not sure how long they&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> I like the blade sizes but the fit to the base unit is not quite right.  Not quite wide enough.</li>
            <li> a nice set of comb, really love it, cant wait to use it....will definitely recommend, looks very sturdy, love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a Oster A5 2 speed clipper about an decade before by a veterinarian&#x27;s recommmend.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s very powerful &amp; sufficient clipper than when i used National japanese rechargeable clipper which can adjust  comb by length of pet&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;incase of # 0 (1/16&#x27;&#x27;) is very useful for summertime,it can avoid skin irrite &amp; cutaneous disease cause doesn&#x27;t cut hair to the skin!!! even more doesn&#x27;t make pet nervous to overheat of clipper blade!!!</li>
            <li> Does a great job.  Wish we had bought it sooner</li>
            <li> they fit, but clippers wouldn&#x27;t cut nearly as well, if it all with the guards on.  tested on dog, and cat. I recommend getting another metal cutting head for different lengths.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work for me - after trying and trying to get them to go through my dogs hair using three different ones I ditched them and just shaved the dog.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re okay with a tight buzz cut, then you&#x27;re probably going to want these to go with your clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got six different sizes of the AgION metal blades for my [[ASIN:B003U8BPY4 Oster Classic 76 Clippers]] as it is, and although their performance is superior when it comes to bringing hair to the blades, the lengths (1/2\\&quot; at most on the 3 ½ blade) which they cut are more appropriate for fades and fine trimming on the sides and back of the head - that&#x27;s where these combs come in. These are what you need for the longer lengths more often desired for what&#x27;s on top of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spring-action clips make reliable attachment and quick removal incredibly easy: just place the metal clip of the combs under the metal blade on the clippers and then pull forward on the plastic comb until it can drop over the metal blade. They&#x27;re built nicely enough to where I believe they&#x27;ll last a long time, and the range of sizes makes any reasonable cut-length available at your convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are what you need. They&#x27;re a good deal, too.</li>
            <li> was a gift.receipient liked it very much.</li>
            <li> I love I love these clipper guards they work great with my clippers have had no issues with them I get a great haircut that is neat</li>
            <li> Package is missing comb #5, and I couldn&#x27;t reach anyone for sending it. Only option available is to return the whole package and not replacing it???</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Will fit just about any pair of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Durable plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Tough heavy springs seem like they will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Will never fit as well as purpose made clipper heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;The price is right and they do their job. In hindsight I wish I had bought a set with the taper combs.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and work well.</li>
            <li> #1,2,3, 4, and 5 wont fit on the Oster 76 blades  thus rendering them useless.&lt;br /&gt;otherwise i guess there ok.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by Amazon when purchasing the Oster Fast Feed clippers.  To my surprise, the attachments are not compatible with the Fast Feed clippers, as many other reviewers have noted.  The fact that Amazon specifically recommended this item to be purchased along with the fast feed is misleading.  I can only hope that other purchasers read these reviews before wasting their time and money on this product.</li>
            <li> Great value. The aren&#x27;t as snug on my clippers as the guards that came with my clipper but they get the job done. I also like that there are more options than what originally came with my clippers.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my oster classic 76 does the job, fast change convenient and very secure spring loaded&lt;br /&gt;i also use the lower ones for my goatee chin very fast no complaints&lt;br /&gt;dont settle for less this is the best wont slip off or mess up your cut by fallin off</li>
            <li> I bought this item because it was suppose to work with my Oster 76 classics. I was in no rush to use the but when I did they didn&#x27;t fit. My 30 return window had close so now I stuck with some trash. If you buy this open it immediately and test it.</li>
            <li> These comb guides are way large and useless, I mainly needed a 1/4 inch guide to shave my dogs for the summer which is very hot here. None of these combs are that short or even close so the advertisement is wrong. These are more like sheep shearing combs, none will shave close. They do fit my clippers but cant use any of them.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on these after I had hastely ordered.  I was worried about them fitting since a few reviews mentioned it.  They fit perfect.  A spring metal clip ensures they stay in place too.  My old plastic guards were loose so I always had to hold them with one finger but these are great.  Only had them for a few days but no problems yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this and \\&quot;Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade\\&quot;. Each one of them individually is good, but it is almost impossible to put the comb on because of the design. This defeats \\&quot;universal\\&quot; part of the claim.</li>
            <li> Having looked around on-line to replace a comb that was broken, I finally broke down and bought this whole set.&lt;br /&gt;I had read the previous reviews about how hard it is to put these on (it&#x27;s true).  However, the thing I really don&#x27;t like about them is the angle you are forced to use with them.  The combs that came with the Fast Feed allow for a more natural position while cutting hair.  These force an odd angle that makes it difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;They also don&#x27;t replicate the cut of the original combs.&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like the fact that they have metal on them.  I like to wash them after each use and am worried that they will eventually rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had checked the local Sally Beauty Supply before ordering these.  I ended up being a set there for half the price and they were the same as the originals.</li>
            <li> I have a typical story to many other reviewers whom have been using cheap discount clippers. Just bought my first set of Oster&#x27;s Platinum Spirit clippers and they cut my hair like silk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this Comb Set fits the Platinum Spirit is metal and spring loaded. The obvious different when comparing to the cheapy sets is the quality. Upon using it, the design and angle where it sits on the top of your head is somehow better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m sticking with Oster brand of clippers!</li>
            <li> Totally happy. They fit my Andis pet clippers (model 21420) perfectly and are much more substantial than the combs that came with the clippers. My little dog looks very handsome after his trim. Best clipping job ever thanks to these combs.</li>
            <li> When i recieved these i had not yet recieved my new oster clippers. so i decides to try them on my wahl pro&#x27;s and they fit perfectly, The spring action load is great for different size clippers!</li>
            <li> I tried turning them on right out of the box and the clippers started smoking with this HORRIBLE SMELL coming out of the clippers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will erase this review when NORTHEAST BEAUTY decides to take this matter seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDWARD</li>
            <li> This is another grooming essential that I needed to add to my tool box.  I continue to need more and more items to complete my grooming kit.</li>
            <li> Theres not really much to say. Great price and if your buying the Oster Classic 76&#x27;s. You better pop these in the shopping cart. Oh and it comes with an amazing bag to hold them. The bag looked of cheap quality when i was looking around at online pictures but i was wrong. I truely believe it had something to do with the MADE IN U.S.A thing.</li>
            <li> The standard.  Every size you would need.</li>
            <li> Great for trimming dogs each summer.</li>
            <li> I used these combs with my Oster A5 Golden but these combs were easily and frequently snagging using the #10 blade when trying to cut the thick curly fur of my poodle.  However the snagging was significantly reduced by using a #30 [[ASIN:B003VMB8ZA Oster A-5 Cryogen-X Blade Set #30]] or #40 [[ASIN:B000UE4YNA Oster Cryogen-x Animal Blade 919-01* Size 40]] blade instead.  Another reviewer noticed the same thing but the review hasn&#x27;t been voted up much so I didn&#x27;t see her review until now.  Previously I bought a Wahl 9590-210 Pro-series Clipper Kit [[ASIN:B0031MPW5W Wahl Premium Series Cord/Cordless Pet Clipper Kit]] but it wouldn&#x27;t get through the thick fur. I noticed that the Wahl combs in the kit have wider teeth on the ends that the blades recess into so that the Wahl combs protect the fur from snagging: [[ASIN:B000FJ17WG 3114-001 - #1 ATTACHMENT COMB 1/8\\&quot;]] or [[ASIN:B002E00ZMC Wahl 3114 Attachment Comb 1/8in]] The Wahl blade and combs in the kit are slightly narrower than the Oster, so the combs in the Wahl kit will not fit my Oster.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.  Takes 2 seconds to figure these things out, but they fit the Oster 76 perfectly.  They are snug and good quality (Way better than other plastic clipper attachments).  Do not hesitate to buy this for the Oster 76 (all I tried it on).</li>
            <li> is usable, but didn&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li> I like that the Comb set is Universal but the spring on the set sometimes feels like its not working.&lt;br /&gt;Probably going to have to Play with it a little to get it working correctly.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended buy!</li>
            <li> THey say they fit most Oster clippers but apparently the Oster Fast Feed is not one of the most.  If you purchase these attachment they are not compatible with the Fast Feed clippers.</li>
            <li> These are very easy to put on the Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed clipper and get the job done. They worked very well and I did not have any issues at all with this product. Shipping was on time.</li>
            <li> Order the comb set when you get the trimmer. I only use 3 of the combs myself but buying the set of ten is about the same price as ordering three individual ones.</li>
            <li> This works very well with the Oster razor.  I have a standard poodle, and groom her myself.  I use about three sizes, and they all fit well, and are easy to change.</li>
            <li> it does an uneven job and don,t even think of using the larger combs ,that will not work,i am a hairdresser and the same goes for human clippers,the larger the combs the harder the job ,i think it would be better to buy the metal blade for longer cuts from Oster,i,m not sure which on ,contacting them would be best</li>
            <li> Absolutely necessary for the cordless Oster clippers.  I don&#x27;t understand why these combs didn&#x27;t come with the unit as they do with other clippers.  Because it was a forced separate purchase I deducted a star, not for performance, which is great.</li>
            <li> Makes it possible to customize my clippers.</li>
            <li> nice product. delivered on time.</li>
            <li> this is very good&lt;br /&gt;fits perfect and its great for the different sizes of hair cut and the dogs dont get burn if ur clipper get too hot</li>
            <li> These guides were the perfect fit for my 76. The allow me to make the right cuts between the blades. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> excellent former barber work partime out of my house fits most clippers, secure and easy to remove worth the money</li>
            <li> These clips have a spring adjustment system that allows them to accommodate several different size shaver heads. Definitely worked perfect for my beat up old unit. Probably would fit other brands, but can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li> Despite its being called Universal, this comb set doesn&#x27;t fit the Oster Professional Fast Feed Clipper and had to be returned.</li>
            <li> This product was linked with the clippers I purchased.  Unfortunately, I went ahead and bought this item as well.  Should not have done that.  The clippers I purchased are for clipping my horses&#x27; ears and muzzle.  These items are not needed for that.</li>
            <li> The combs are easy to use.  They are professional quality, and snap on to my Oster Pro Fast Feed clipper firmly with a little effort.  This complete set allows me to cut my own hair to the length I want.  The fact that all the sizes are here from 1 to 8 (plus 10) make it easy to blend the sides and the top.  I kept the tapered \\&quot;left ear\\&quot; and \\&quot;right ear\\&quot; combs from my old clipper.</li>
            <li> The guards fit nicely, but there were no instructions on how to get them on the clippers and it did take me a few minutes to figure it out.  A little diagram or something may have been helpful just to save me that couple of minutes.  Now that I know how to do it, I can let other people know that there are two little clips on every guard and those little clips slide backwards to attach them onto the blade, so you can ignore the little hole/screw type area in the center of each guard.  It has nothing to do with putting the guards on or taking them off.</li>
            <li> We bought this set in additional to our Oster clipper and it works very well, both for the dog and for the men in the family.  It is a great set that will last.</li>
            <li> These are very durable, they seem just like the ones at a barber shop.  I use these with a Oster Limited Edition Fast Feed Clipper and they seem to be completely compatable.  When first starting to use them they were a bit tough to get on but with just a little bit of use the clip mechanism eases up and they clip on with no problem.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly and made well.  The entire set is complete so no worries in needing any additional guards for my unit.</li>
            <li> Not a professional groomer, but with the selection of trimming heads I can maintain my poodle and tibetian spaniel between professional visits.</li>
            <li> They are pretty good! Shipping was fast! They don&#x27;t fall off and keep attached well. The only gripe is they seem to have a gap when attached to my Fast Feed. They cut the precise length but just seem to fit weird.</li>
            <li> I received (2) #6 combs and did not receive a #7 comb. I didn&#x27;t realize it until I had to actually use the #7 which was a few weeks after I received them.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t use these much, My dogs are very long haired ( one retriever mix and  two Pyrenees) and it is so difficult to comb through their hair, even after a thorough brushing. I am much better off freehanding the clippers. It would be an excellent product for dogs with less hair.</li>
            <li> Would be 5 star if it was totally zeroed in. It&#x27;s still close but a we bit longer than I&#x27;m used to. It is very quiet.  Very quiet. I&#x27;ve noticed that cleaning it and oiling it makes a huge difference.  I didn&#x27;t do it with the cheaper ones cause 8 didn&#x27;t care that much. But this is heavy duty for the price and I want it to last.</li>
            <li> Great set when paired with the Oster professional. I love the fact that they clip onto the clippers to prevent them from coming off.</li>
            <li> Looks like a good set but did not fit ours.  Thanks to Amazon for their great return policy.</li>
            <li> An excellent addition to my dog clippers. With two very hairy dogs, these really save their cost in less than a single visit to the groomer. Good fit, good quality. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Easiest guards I have ever used. I don&#x27;t know how I managed in the salon without them or the clippers I bought them for.</li>
            <li> I did not open the item for several weeks, and when I did, I discovered that the one size I really wanted had not been included in error. Instead, there were two of the next size. By that time, it was too late to return the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to a local beautician&#x27;s supply store and purchased the missing size, which works fine. It was six dollars vs. the twenty I paid for the whole bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you go to a beautician&#x27;s supply store, too, unless you want various sizes.</li>
            <li> the gaurds themselves are great. However, they sent me two #5 gaurds and did not give me a #6 gaurd. Now i have to go and purchase a #6 gaurd separately.. very inconvenient for me.</li>
            <li> Great combs super fast to put on and off. i really like them. comes with a nice bag also. will suggest to barber friends</li>
            <li> Good value for the money, too bad they don&#x27;t include a carrying bag. I don&#x27;t why they don&#x27;t include a blending attachment .</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous when I received these because they were completely different than the guards I have for my clippers now, but the spring loaded guards are definitely the way to go! Way more secure!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: Personal&lt;br /&gt;Frequency: Once a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a fashion enthusiasts, I love to keep hair style trimmed and well maintained all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Had Panasonic $35 machine which definitely served the purpose, But this little monster, changed the experience and added many options in cut size, experience, performance and definitely an ultimate outcome of each exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair myself for 10 years and yes, I am a well trained barber for myself and I am proud of it. No need help from any one to maintain my own hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance: Can&#x27;t compare with the other two Panasonic machines, I used in past. This machine is definitely is a make for commercial use anf therefore has more capability to deliver way above average performance than other personal hair clippers.</li>
            <li> They do not seem to fit my clips and the description stated that they can be used with my clippers.</li>
            <li> I returned this product, as the Oster clippers, I had ordered with it, were useless. These BTW did not even fit onto the Oster clipper, I ordered it with, for from Amazon.  Excellent fast return &amp; refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li> After 30 years of using cheaper clippers, I finally decided to spend the money on a good set! What a difference!!!! I wish I had just done this from the beginning!!! It would have saved a great deal of tears and money! :)</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY I PURCHASED THESE TO GO ON THE PIECE OF JUNK PET HAIR TRIMMERS THAT I RETURNED AND I AM STUCK WITH THEM!!!!!!!!!!!  NOT HAPPY TO SAY THE LEAST!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> it works great for my hubby oster machine!</li>
            <li> The spring loaded attach is very quick and convenient and they fit better than I expected or have experienced with this type of attachment in the past.  My one complaint is that hair can get stuck between the outside edge of the clippers and the inside edge of the comb leading to it being pulled.  The only way to avoid this seems to be to move the clippers quite slowly.  Otherwise they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Worked as well as I expected. Worth the price. Nothing else to say but, I&#x27;m happy! And that is all to me.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought better hair clippers: the oster fast feed.  After using Wahl clippers for 3 or 4 years, I wanted to see if there were better quality cutting clippers.  So far, I&#x27;m impressed with the cut of the Oster fast feeds.  No complaint there.  The comb set, however, isn&#x27;t all it&#x27;s claimed to be.  First off, as was mentioned in another review, the set is metal &amp; spring loaded.  Plastic on the outside and metal inside where the combs actually attach to the clippers.  One thing positive about Wahl clippers and their combs is that they are uncomplicated.  With Oster&#x27;s set, the opposite is true.  The comb set is very stiff and the spring loaded mechanism is difficult to use especially the first time.  I literally scuffed and scrapped my knuckles trying to connect the damn thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand Oster wanted to design a metal clip that wouldn&#x27;t break as easily and I commend them for that.  That design is very flawed and makes it very frustrating to attach if you are in a hurry to get to it and cut hair.  Also, the comb attachment doesn&#x27;t fit exact to the clipper.  Meaning the back of the comb sticks out a good quarter to half an inch where it connects to the clipper.  I virtually had to cut downward to make it cut right as opposed to being able to go in any direction with the Wahl color pro.  It may take some getting used to, but, my first impression is it&#x27;s ok, but, definetely not worth the pricetag and the headache that comes along with breaking the comb set in.  Oster needs to go back to the drawing board and make perfect overlapping combs that snap perfectly in place instead of these.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what we had been needing to properly groom our mini schnauzer. We had been using a smaller handheld wireless set of clippers that came with two combs, but it wasn&#x27;t powerful enough and the combs didn&#x27;t pick up much hair so we were constantly lifting up sections, then having to even it all out later. This set of combs, along with the Oster Powermax clippers [[ASIN:B000LRHWFI Oster 78004-011 Powermax 2-Speed Clippers]], allowed us to groom her much quicker, more effectively and more evenly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m holding back from a five star recommendation for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The set came with two size 5 combs and no size 6. Not worth returning it, since they are so close, we didn&#x27;t *really* need a size 6 (and can always get one separately if we do) and we needed to use the set right away without waiting another few days for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;2. The combs do occasionally catch in the fur when there&#x27;s a small mat or pin knot. It&#x27;s not often and all you have to do is turn off the clippers and work the knot out from around the base of the comb, but it&#x27;s something to be wary of if your dog isn&#x27;t as tolerant of grooming - one little pull from a stuck knot could set off a sensitive or grooming-averse dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we were very pleased with the purchase and though we still need small clippers and scissors to do the detail work, the body, neck and leg grooming went much faster with these combs and the clippers linked above.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to get them on but no fear that they will come off</li>
            <li> Lots of choices here for any length you could possibly need. I would definitely recommend this comb set for your pet grooming.</li>
            <li> I own three sets of clippers: for me, for son, and for our pet. These attachments fit all three brands because they have a self tightening spring which adjusts the back of the guide comb to each clipper blade head. This unit also have the bag included which holds all the guide combs. This is a must buy for any Oster clipper owner. I wish it had the tapered attachments as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Oster Classic but unfortunately I should not have done so.  It clearly was not designed for the Classic.</li>
            <li> When i bought my first oyster clippers they came with crappy combs ,they were so loose barley held on ,now with these the,re so tight fitting nice .a little tricky to put on and more take off its all technique you will see.A must have really</li>
            <li> They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do but they will pull your dogs hair if there is the slightest tangle in your dogs coat which causes them pretty noticeable discomfort. Enough to want to run away from the clippers. The GREAT thing about these though is that they protect your dog from the clippers getting hot, which happens quickly if you&#x27;ve purchased the Oster A5 Turbo 2 Speed.</li>
            <li> These do not work plain and simple.  A complete waste of money.  Do not buy or you will be sorry.</li>
            <li> One of the things we do to save $ at home is cut hair.  My wife cuts my, and my son&#x27;s hair when needed.  This 10 pack comb set was the perfect fit for our Oster trimmer unit.  They fit perfectly on to the clipper, and work well with it.  It also comes with a storage pouch to keep them in one place.  They are made well, and will not break with normal use.  A great buy, and I would do it again if I had to.</li>
            <li> They work great, the fit the clippers great, but my first order had two #5 combs and no #6. My replacement had two #7 combs and STILL no #6.</li>
            <li> The combs do not fit snugly on the clipper (there is space between them and the clipper).  It is obvious they are not made for the FastFeed clipper.  My guess is that they are made for the professional Oster models.  However, I can still attach them and cut hair with my FastFeed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased about those blade. I bought for the Oster Classic 76 and it fit just right. Better grip compare to cheap adapter. The longuer size (10) also give you great result and is pretty handy for my type of hair cut. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I saw a couple reviews saying these did fit on the Fast Feed version clippers and others stating they did not so I took a chance. Just put the clip on from the base as it states and they went on just fine. I got these due to the original combs were getting loose and moving on the clippers.</li>
            <li> I bought these comb set guides for trimming up my Golden Retriever from time to time.  A 10 piece kit was probably far more than I needed, but that&#x27;s something I learned in the process.  If you buy this to trim up dogs of various sizes and hair types, this would probably prove to be more useful to you.  They all work very well with the Oster electric clippers that I have.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I hoped it would be; quality comb set for my Oster Fast Feed Clipper. Finally some combs that once attached won&#x27;t ever come off unless you want them to.</li>
            <li> These combs fit perfectly as were described. The variation in depth gives a great variety in grooming, They are easy to use and easy to clean. Great product.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else, I was misled on what these combs fit.  They DO NOT FIT the Oster T-Finisher model 59-01H.  You can see the correct combs for this unit at osterstyle.com/Options.aspx?link&#x3D;22&amp;line&#x3D;CLASSIC#</li>
            <li> These are spring loaded not magnetic. The plastic does not feel like it can hold too much abuse but I think it is a good buy for the money. I&#x27;ve been using them lightly for two weeks and so far so good.</li>
            <li> The attachments arrived quickly and as described.  They fit the clippers perfectly. I am very pleased with the product and service I received.  I would definitely use Beauty Exchange LLC again.</li>
            <li> The arrogance of corporations astounds me sometimes.  I don&#x27;t thing a reasonable person would expect Oster to create a set of attachments that fit ever possible clipper.  But you would expect these attachments to fit Oster blades, right?  I bought the Oster Size # 3 Skip Tooth blade and assumed that these would fit.  They do not.  If the spring clip would slide another 1/8&amp;#34; they probably would.  They do fit the standard #10 blade that comes with the A5 Turbo clippers.  I&#x27;m assuming the #3 blade (1/2&amp;#34; cut) is intended to use without attachments.  And. . . how would I learn this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s where the arrogance comes in.  With 57 1- and 2-star reviews on Amazon, how hard could it be to modify the product description to at least explain what the comb set will NOT fit.  Instead, they maintain the same language:  &amp;#34;Specially designed to fit Oster Clippers. . . &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of combs to use with the Oster fast feed Clippers.  I&#x27;ve never cut hair before but I was willing to give it a go to save a few bucks on my haircuts.  No one can tell the difference between my haircut and my barber&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> These were easy to use with my Oster shaver, or whatever you call it. I am not a professional dog groomer, and my dog looked pretty decent after I shaved off his winter coat with these guards.</li>
            <li> Good comb set that attaches and removes easy.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, will last a lifetime!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  They even fit a pair of Wahl clippers that I have.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great set of comb attachments complete with a carrying pouch.  I home groom our Labradoodle and having several sizes of combs to clip different parts of her body is great.  I like a shaggy crown and legs but a more trimmed body to keep her cool and I can accomplish all of this with these combs.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great price</li>
            <li> This pack of clipper attachments gets used with my Oster 76 and have thus far proven a good buy.  They are made of a durable plastic and attach to a 0 (zero) series blade via a spring loaded metal clamp.  Sizes 0-10 are represented, (minus a 9 guard) and that gives the option of just about every buzzing length one could ask for.  A drawstring plastic case is also included for storage.  I use these to cut each of my young boys hair and this pack has proven cost effective:&lt;br /&gt;[($15/per haircut) x (12 haircuts/year) x (3 boys)] + $5 tip/each &#x3D; $720/year saved after the initial investment.&lt;br /&gt;A minor downside is that the teeth on these combs can be somewhat sharp around the corners, especially on the shorter attachments, so I inadvertently elicited some minor cringes until I learned how to angle these things.  Overall though, this was a pretty good purchase once I honed by barber skills.</li>
            <li> These are a good buy for human or k-9 either one, works great and washes clean without worrying about rust.</li>
            <li> Hard to use if you have not had the experience, and the combs do not fit on the 3.75 detachable blade.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased an Oster Fast Feed (Chrome) clipper.  It&#x27;s been great so far. I bought this set of attachments to use with the Fast Feed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb set does NOT fit the Oster Fast Feed.  I sent them back for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frustrating.</li>
            <li> These are what I ordered. The combs just don&#x27;t work as well as the blade... Would not recommend purchase. Spend you money on the blades..</li>
            <li> I bought this item with Oster Fast Feed clippers. The item would be great if it fit them. Universal Comb Set it is not.</li>
            <li> Ordered these blades to go on the new oster groomer I just purchased.  The groomer only came with one blade.  I have two large dogs that I groom all year but take off more fur during the summer season and less in fall and winter.  I needed different size blades.  They seem to work well but you must experiment to see how to turn them with the direction of the fur.  I&#x27;d suggest them but hope they last me for as long as I need to groom.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like them when I ordered them. I was completely wrong. These things work extremely well and are a fraction of the price you&#x27;d oay for a set of blades. WOW!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time. Have not used it yet but looking foward to using it with my new Oster Classic 76 clipper. No complaints.</li>
            <li> clamps on to the OSTER, Tight good fit but sometimes springs come loose and can be a pain to readjust</li>
            <li> its just too bad it didnt come with those taper combs (but then again I am not a pro barber as I can see why a pro barber wouldnt use those)</li>
            <li> These spring-loaded combs give you a firm hold to the trimmer. However getting them off of the trimmer is more difficult than it needs to be for the same reason. They will hold up for many years of use. The bag, although useful, is not the best way to store them if you are going to switch between combs on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I love the spring for securing them on the clippers. Much better than just clipping on for the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> Yes, I admit... I am using a horse groomer on the husband.  Hey, it&#x27;s a clipper, right?  He didn&#x27;t want to look like a &amp;#34;Jarhead&amp;#34; so wanted the combs.  I had my doubts about whether they would fit, but after reading the reviews I bought the set.  Work like a charm!  You slide the metal clips under the back of the blade, then pull it forward until it will clip over the front of the blade.  They fit nice and tight, so no worries they will move or fall off.  Bye, bye barbershop!</li>
            <li> I use them to trim my Golden Retriever for summer and they are the best I&#x27;ve ever used on her.</li>
            <li> I broke one of the plastic guards on my Fast Feed. Preferred having my hair slightly longer than 000 length, so I got this. Much better setup than the original guards. The spring-loaded clip is simple to work with, and holds it securely with no movement. Used it for a couple of months now, zero complaints, perfect performance.</li>
            <li> I got an Oster clipper from a friend but it is very old and huge! Still, an expensive and good brand, I use it on my dog and it works great, I just needed these combs to do different sizes and they fit just right.</li>
            <li> I bought these for show grooming horses quickly and precisely with Oster A5 Turbo clippers. Very easy to use and a huge variety to choose from. The combs stay on very well, even when they get bumped by fidgety horses. The bag is ok, but in order to find the right comb I usually have to dump them all out. I keep them in a small sectioned hard plastic case now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to cut our dog&#x27;s hair at different lengths without changing blades.  This comb set is easy to use, and it seems to be well made.</li>
            <li> It took me a minute to figure out how to put these on, because it&#x27;s different from the little guards that come with the Fast Feed, but once I realized there is a spring involved it was easy.  With the Fast Feed you get a #1, #2, #3, and #4...all perfectly fine, but I use a number 6 on top and number 5 on  the sides, so I went ahead and got this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are nicer than the ones included with the Fast Feed (seem higher quality) and give me a lot more flexibility with the bigger sizes, plus they come with a little storage sack that I ended up using for my Fast Feed trimmer instead.</li>
            <li> This unit overheats quickly and I have stopped using it, the Wahl ( human ) unit from costco at $30 has lasted longer, cuts better and doesn&#x27;t get as hot so fast. I have tried to get it to work better without luck.</li>
            <li> These are very good quality combs/guards and will probably fit on any _clipper,_ but not _trimmer._  I purchased these along with a Oster Taler trimmer and the trimmer&#x27;s head is too small for the latching system built into these combs.  I should have known the difference between clippers and trimmers.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works great</li>
            <li> These combs fit my Oster Classic 76 clipper perfectly.  A tremendous aid so you are not having to freehand everything.  The higher the comb number the longer the cut.  Snap the comb on and then follow the contour of the head.  It is that easy.  And you can mix things --- use different combs for different areas of the head if you want longer or shorter areas.  One example: if you are thinning on the top, you could use a #4 on the sides and the back of the head and then a #2 the top to tame the thinning areas.</li>
            <li> Hard to use with clippers that have removable blades, and I could not find any videos or instructions on how to take them off easy. They are also awkwardly shaped and a little hard to work with, but what else is there to use?</li>
            <li> I owned a few combs of this type prior to purchasing this set and like the fact that they are very secure when attached to my oster clippers, yet very easy to remove.  I expect them to outlast my clippers.</li>
            <li> Thanks to a wiser and doubtless more patient reviewer than me, my earlier complaint that these combs do not fit the Oster Fast Feed trimmer proved to be completely wrong. Once I applied some (considerable) thumb power to fitting them in place, bingo, all was well. So I now advise other potential buyers to ignore what the Oster rep told my fellow bamboozled reviewer &amp; press (literally) bravely on.</li>
            <li> I have an Oster clipper set, have had them for years, this set DOES NOT fit! Of course, I threw out the packaging as soon as I opened it and cannot return it. So I&#x27;m stuck with it, probably put it in a garage sale, LOL. Buyer beware, does not fit Oster Lucky Dog or the older version I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF they did fit, looks very sturdy, strong springs and variety of sizes, would have been a great buy!</li>
            <li> Looking to replace the combs on my Andis Dog Clippers, I searched for a durable set that would fit any clippers in my possession.  I have some 20 year old clippers that my parents had (that still works), and put the spring loaded comb onto the clippers.  The fit was perfect and the durability of the combs was exactly what I was searching for to cut my Bichon Frise&#x27;s hair.  He enjoys getting his hair cut and the comb passed through his short hair with ease and without flexing like so many low end combs can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hard plastic construction with the spring loaded mechanism allows for a perfect fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The versatility of the set, allows me to cut my dog&#x27;s hair at any length, I choose.  I keep my Bichon&#x27;s hair short for the puppy cut style that limits him from matting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years...........and I seriously could kick myself for not finding these sooner, they are not the same cheap snap on ones that come with the cheap-o clippers you get at target, you know, the ones that pop off every chance they get, these are the total opposite.......easy to use, don&#x27;t come off till you want them too (held on by a spring loaded clip), AND its a full set of 1-10, not 1-6 like the cheap sets.  This is obviously made for the pro barber and to me worth twice the price.</li>
            <li> I expected a better fit with the suggested shaver. It has been inconvenient to the point I can&#x27;t use these combs on my dogs and just shaved them right down to the razor because the pulling was more than I would subject them to.</li>
            <li> Great clipper guards. Holds tight and does not move on the clipper head. Lots of different lengths and easy to read.</li>
            <li> excellent quality of this purchase, good price perfect fit</li>
            <li> Attach easily. Not necessary if you want a close 1 or 0 just using the blade provided with the clippers.</li>
            <li> Love these. I&#x27;ve heard complaints that they don&#x27;t stay on but I didn&#x27;t have that issue.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any of the attachments longer than the 1/4&amp;#34; because the clipper ends up catching the dog&#x27;s hair and causing pain.  Even with the 1/4&amp;#34; and shorter attachments, it ends up catching the dog&#x27;s hair maybe two to three times during the entire trim as opposed to every to every other pass.</li>
            <li> There are quite a few people claiming these fit the Fast Feed, but I assure you, they do not.  They can be forced to &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on the blade, but they don&#x27;t lie flat against the blade, and the position causes a very messy cut with no precision.  Since they are advertised as &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; for Oster clippers, this is quite a problem.  Returning for refund.</li>
            <li> Of course these would be nothing without a clipper, but these are amazing! Along with clippers, these produce a nice even cut (even with my thick hair! Seriously, my hair is very thick).</li>
            <li> Met all our requirements to date for horses and cat. Appears to be well made and hope it will last</li>
            <li> They work on Oster Classic 76.  Nuff said.</li>
            <li> There were many combs included in this set. They fit the cutters quite well and were easy to attach to the clipper.</li>
            <li> Love the bigger size combs for my yorkies.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We have used this item and it works very well with our cutter.  Choice of blades sizes was more than we needed.  Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> These guards work very well. I do prefer the metal blades over the plastic ones, but these are a good buy.</li>
            <li> Comb sets are needed especially if you apply different cuts and if you only had one you would not be challenged</li>
            <li> Great set for Oster clippers. Makes giving haircuts easier. Allows for cutting around ears and gives you a choice of different lengths of cuts.</li>
            <li> These combs are simple devices for getting a different length of hair/fur.  I found out by looking at a video I had purchased last year that you need a #40 blade ($25.00 approximate) to use with these combs.  That&#x27;s another cost if you&#x27;re going to try grooming your pet yourself.  The Oster clipper that I purchased came with a #10 blade which isn&#x27;t designed to be used with the plastic combs.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set with the full understanding of what I was actually ordering, and guess what - I got exactly what I ordered! The universal comb attachments all work great on my A5 - easy on, easy off - except for the 1/16th, but once I figured it out, no problem....  With a couple of other items on my purchase I qualified for the free shipping and everything arrived four (4) days before it was projected to be delivered!  Product works great for me, the combs stay on the blade and it arrived earlier than expected - yeah.</li>
            <li> I had to return these because the Oster clippers I had bought were the &amp;#34;fast feed&amp;#34; kind, which take a completely different type of comb attachment. The product description says they fit all Oster clippers but that excludes the &amp;#34;fast feed&amp;#34; kind, which is not mentioned. I eventually had to return these and get a different set of combs, which oddly I couldn&#x27;t find on Amazon (had to google &amp;#34;Oster fast feed comb attachments&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> They are absolutely the best clippers out there!! The attachments come with cool bag to store them in. The prices were almost half of what local beauty supply place was selling them for.</li>
            <li> This is a great combination of cut size and angle. Fits tight on clipper head and is a great clipper mate.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t opened the set as yet. Therefore, it would be unfair to rate this product...</li>
            <li> Excelentes!... Recomendados!...</li>
            <li> These work great on an oster 76 with a #1 blade.</li>
            <li> Great guides overall but I didn&#x27;t realize their is no taper guide.  That&#x27;s my fault though</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction and product</li>
            <li> These combs come equiped with spring loaded locking mechanisms that keep the comb snug and tight. No worries about these bad boys slipping off the clipper and leaving bald spots on your dome piece. (which has happend to me before with my Wahl clippers). only beef i have is there is no taper combs. but a wide variety of sizes. A bit pricey giving i already dropped like 170$ on the clippers themselves. but after about a year of cutting my own hair they pay for them selves. if you serious about cutting your own hair (especially a buzz cut which is what i style my hair to) EXCEPT NO SUBSTITUTE!</li>
            <li> superior quality. definitely worth taking chances with. it is an incredible product and of great quality. I would definitely get more of this.</li>
            <li> Great, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> great and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;And its all there..&lt;br /&gt;I got it and everything is there,and its a lot cheaper than buying a new one.</li>
            <li> I quit using after they got stuck in my poodles hair several times to the point where I needed to remove to get loose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and convenient to use. It is great for anyone beginner or professional barber.  Saves money, though.</li>
            <li> Loved attachments and wonderful soft case. I have really been able to be more versitle with my lower blades. Great product.</li>
            <li> The comb set works perfectly.  I would definitely recommend them.  My dogs thick long fur needs a 2nd trim in the summer and these me more choices of length.</li>
            <li> We have used the guards on an Oster FastFeed clipper we purchased on Amazon.  The guards fit well after you under stand how the spring loaded clip works.  Place the metal retaining tabs of the guard on the heel of the clipper blade, then push the guard up and over the edge of the blade.  Simple.  The guards appear well made and should last a long time for at-home use.  They are clearly labeled with the height number and the actual length in inches of the cut.  They work as they should and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these. They don&#x27;t specify that they don&#x27;t fit all Oster Professional clippers. I bought a pair of fairly expensive Oster clippers and this universal comb set together in one of those Amazon combo packages that appear towards the bottom of the screen. After busting the package open, I found that they don&#x27;t even come close to fitting. Terribly disappointing.</li>
            <li> I found these combs I purchased for the oster professional 76023-510 to be a bit difficult to get on and off of the device. There is a metal spring attached to them that is cumbersome. Maybe I just need to get used to them, but I am not liking them right now.</li>
            <li> These fit well, but were difficult to get on and off the clippers easily. The hooks on them also affected my clippers.</li>
            <li> I originally gave these things 5-stars and years later I realize that was a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do NOT cut as close as using the blade lengths for Oster 76. Meaning and (understand my entire review is based on the Oster Classic 76) if you take a #3 guide and attach it to the clipper with a 000 Blade I still get those stranded hairs, lines at times, and so on. Then take a #3 blade for the clipper (no guide), and it&#x27;s a completely different cut and closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s commonly known that the Oster Classic 76 cuts closer than any clipper out there but also they are very clean and accurate even in the hands of an amateur. When I was using the plastic guides (I have used others besides the #3) it&#x27;s just not nearly as close as a cut as it should be, and it&#x27;s not nearly as clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I now know that metal guides are the way to go which I only see on my clippers of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these things do what they are designed to do, and are easy on and off, for self-cuts I don&#x27;t recommend it. I can see a barber using them if they are planning to do clean-up after with a comb and scissors to get those stragglers that these things don&#x27;t seem to get even after several passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are like me and are using the Oster Classic 76, just get the metal blade(s) that you want your hair cut to, and stick to that. Also, if you are doing this professionally, well who am I to tell you what to do. I am just a self-cut veteran, I don&#x27;t cut other peoples hair. Well there is one area I trim for someone, but for that I use the Wahl Peanut ;-)</li>
            <li> very good product, shipping fast!</li>
            <li> Received on time and works wonderfully with my Oster Professional Clipper. Plenty of sizes to choose from for professional grooming of my dog. Definately a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Love them. Had a hard time putting them on and taking them off the first week or so, but they work great now.</li>
            <li> i gave them a 3 they suck to use for the dog but worked perfect on my sons hair : )</li>
            <li> These fit my Oster Professional 76023-510.  For whatever reason, I found it difficult to match the fast feed to the required combs...  These have a spring loaded clamp.  They were a little tricky to work at first.  I wish my Oster had a little indent or something on the back of the blade to ensure alignment, but...  They work, they clamp on hard...  Zero trouble for me.</li>
            <li> Works great on Babyliss Pro clipper without having to spend a fortune.  A great purchase for the price. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> very good smooth and strong , it fit very good to oster 76550-100 and thrift 808 ,I wish it com with nice bag</li>
            <li> Better than the ones that came with it, and more durable.  A must buy for anyone that needs a larger selection, or replacements.</li>
            <li> KINDA SHARP ON THE END BUT GREAT PRODUCT NON THE LESS</li>
            <li> A good selection of Combs for different length cuts, a good buy, particularly for those who groom dogs with different type coats and at widely varying lengths.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!  High quality product!</li>
            <li> Great set. Love them.</li>
            <li> I purchase this item should work Oster fast feed trimmer but not easy to set up easy and not  fit properly.</li>
            <li> Only reason I did not give it a 5 is because I do not like the way the comd sits high on the bottom of the blade. I called Oster and the explained that since the blade is not flat on top then the combs are designed to sit raised to that the teeth align properly.</li>
            <li> Ahh, it did work for me. My oster is like 40 years old and I had some doughts, but I am good to go!</li>
            <li> Combs attach nicely with a spring latch, everything fits secure.</li>
            <li> They work great on my Oster 76 clippers. I would definitely buy thees again, they came with a bag for storing the clips.</li>
            <li> Bought an Oster clipper which came with a limited selection of combs. This set provides a lot more options and the combs seem to be a bit more sturdy than the ones which came with the clipper. Very secure - to the point of being difficult to remove from the clipper sometimes.</li>
            <li> I bought this set to go with an oster clippers (Oster Professional 076023-123 Operation Homefront Desert Camo Fast Feed Adjustable Blade Clipper) that I also purchased at the same time. It did not fit even though it is advertised as \\&quot;specially designed to fit oster clippers\\&quot;.  Be careful it was a waste of my money. (The worst part is this was a christmas present I gave to someone.)</li>
            <li> These clips are excellent and just what I needed.  I love the fact that they come with a pouch to keep them in.  I will save a nice amount of money cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> Amazon made it appear that a standard set of combs and oil would not be included in the order. It is. These combs are much more than you need. It is expensive to return and I feel a little ripped off. I will avoid online retailing in the future because of this.</li>
            <li> Fits my clippers well. Had to oil the hinges on them. But not a big deal. They don&#x27;t fit on like the cheap ones that come from wlamart, but they work well and not as easy to break as the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Now I can clip my 3 year old Yorkie poo with ease! Had been using an old cheap model, this is so much better!</li>
            <li> I bought these with a new Oster Power Pro Ultra.  They seem to fit on the blade well, but end up catching in the dogs fur at the ends of the comb, then pull the dogs fur, causing pain.  I tried reattaching, shifting the comb on the clippers, but still snagged the fur.  I&#x27;m buying clipper blades before my dogs develop a fear of the clipper.  Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> perfect addition to my grooming supplies</li>
            <li> These work okay - not spectacular</li>
            <li> This was exctly what i was looking for and was delighted to find it. Now my pooch has an even haircut</li>
            <li> They fit very well on the Oster 76. They are spring loaded and \\&quot;clamp\\&quot; on, takes a little force to clamp on. The larger ones are a bit cumbersome when you try to cut the back of your hair by yourself. Again, I use these with the Oster 76. I am not sure if they work well with other Oster models (do some research).</li>
            <li> The product was quickly delivered and it met my expectations. Very happy with this buy. The Oster clippers have been working great for me too. I highly recommend the brand.</li>
            <li> Had to return to Amazon because these do not fit all Oster clippers!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my &amp;#34;Oster A5 Turbo 2-Speed Professional Animal Clipper&amp;#34; and there perfect. More than I need.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate this good or bad since I never actually had a chance to use it, but I can say that these don&#x27;t fit Oster&#x27;s Fast Feed clippers. The metal bracket on these combs don&#x27;t fit the blade on the clippers, so they&#x27;re pretty useless on that model.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Perfect tools for the task. They make me more efficient and effective and this allows me to work in more customers and make more money.</li>
            <li> Awesome product fits all sorta of clippers. I personally bought it for my andis clippers but I know it fits on whal also</li>
            <li> New to clippers and didn&#x27;t want a scalp job on my golden doodles. Bought the Oster A5 golden 2 speed clippers along with the #3F and #3 blades as well as this universal comb set. These combs slip on and off easily and work great. In the warmer months the #3 if the perfect length for them, short but not scalped and in the cooler months the combs will allow me to keep them a longer. Just make sure you use the combs on clean dry combed out dogs, so you don&#x27;t break the teeth off.. Saves buying all the different sized blades at higher cost.</li>
            <li> does not work very well</li>
            <li> Good product. Unfortunately, I learned from experience that the combs can break if shoved to tightly into a bag/carrying case.</li>
            <li> Springs feel like junk to me.  I went back to my Andis magnetic combs</li>
            <li> A little tough to install and detach, but they are very handy and allow for fades etc.  The boys love the haircuts and patterns.</li>
            <li> Good product. fast shipping.</li>
            <li> very sturdy, lots of sizes to choose from, fit perfectly on the Oster Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper.  Each piece is supported by a steel support and works very good.</li>
            <li> use them for the past 3 years, well built!!</li>
            <li> I opted to use just blades without guides. Has worked very well for me I have become an accomplished groomer. Were I to have used combs I would have selected these.</li>
            <li> First set of clips purchased for my oster fast feed. Works great, I oil the springs every so often to make it easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Everything you need to cut hair. Works perfectly on my Oster 76.  I will get blades for some of the shortest guards because it is more precise. But that is me being OCD most people wouldn&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> They are too big fit loosely and very clumsy to use. Ive actually stopped using them&lt;br /&gt;on the oster trimmer I have</li>
            <li> So far they a very good they work with oster and andis clipper They clip right on no problem I have no regret I recommend them</li>
            <li> Nice to have because I&#x27;m not a professional hair dresser.but I&#x27;m able to give my family a decent hair cut.</li>
            <li> Fits my Oster Professional Classic 76 Clippers and works great! Very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Best guards I&#x27;ve ever bought! Fast ship as well!</li>
            <li> These clipper guards will work with the Fast Feed however, they are obviously not made for it and are very difficult to get on and off.  I am a strong male so strength is not the issue.  The spring loaded sliding metal part that grips to the clipper torques outwards when trying to put them on the clippers and causes it to stick.  This is the case with everyone of them not just a few.  I can&#x27;t believe Oster doesn&#x27;t make combs that fit their own clippers.  Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Love it, perfect, just what i needed i dont know why the professional hair stores around me are so stupid about barbering tools. SO happy i could find these!! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Absolutely did not work with my Oster Golden A5 2-speed clippers.  I put the combs on my clipper and my pet&#x27;s hair was caught in the metal brackets used to connect to the clipper.  All the sizes I tried did the same.  I will not use again.  A waste of good money.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. They work fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this set of combs to go on my old Oster 151-04 Pet Groomer.  I took a chance; I wasn&#x27;t sure that they would fit.  They did, however, and now I have a much more versatile unit.  They are spring loaded and fit onto the blade by hooking over the cutting end and then grasping the back of the blade with a little spring-loaded metal plate with a clasping shape to it.  Hard to explain, but works well.</li>
            <li> like it taught it was more metal than plastic love the package and the bag i would recommend it for sure</li>
            <li> The ten clipper combs gave me enough choices to let me cut the different length of hair on the Dog.</li>
            <li> I still use these guards on a daily basis but I am in the process of finding something better for my Professional Fast Feed Clippers. These universal guide combs do not fit exactly you kind of have to engineer them into fitting but taking them off and putting them on becomes a hassle sometimes. They do work, but you can tell that they aren&#x27;t made specifically with your clippers in mind although they are supposed to be \\&quot;Universal.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Product was as described and was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Works fine,no problems</li>
            <li> quick delivery. great product.</li>
            <li> I stiffer less flexible plastic than I had hoped for, but well constructed.</li>
            <li> These are really easy to attach and work really well with the number 40 blade. My dog is old and has warts.  Now I don&#x27;t cut the warts.</li>
            <li> i love this product. Its very helpful and i love it very much since im an aspiring groomer. Thank you</li>
            <li> But what can I do here....combs go with my earlier purchase of an Oster Clipper...but I only need half of them; not a complaint juts must grow my hair longer in the winter and shorter in the summer.</li>
            <li> did not fit perfectly</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair, my sons hair and my grandsons hair. We all get it cut to different lengths so we use these universal combs to cut our hair the right length. They work fine for that.</li>
            <li> These are a nice and solid set of combs.  I have a couple of Bichons with dense curly hair and have had to fight to get them trimmed.  These combs are a nice addition to the Oster clippers.  I bought the cheaper version that you find in stores and they flex and bend and make things harder.  These are definitely better.  My only criticism is the metal tabs that hook over one side of the blade could be a bit stronger.  Mine got bent a little.  I could bend them back and they worked fine but would like to see them a bit heavier.</li>
            <li> works ok, but don&#x27;t need most of these, use only two of them..</li>
            <li> These is a replacement comb set for a clippers that have been used for a couple decades to cut a black mans hair.  .If your hair is clean and damp the combs slid through pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I wanted the real thing and I got these in the original Oster packaging. Some of the comb sets on the market are knock offs and are not of the complete quality of the factory combs. You only buy them once. You live with them for decades. Get the good ones, you wont&#x27; be sorry.</li>
            <li> I have a previous set, but lot the No. 1 attachment.  This is an excellent product that easily clips on with spring load design.</li>
            <li> I get a really clean cut with these combs. Very precise and nice. It goes with my cordless clippers and I use them professionally.</li>
            <li> I have a Cocker Spaniel and they need grooming quite often.  I had an Oster clipper from having horses and clipping them years ago.  I purchased the changeable comb sets to clip the dog.  They provide easy on easy off application when I need to change lengths.</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly on my Oster clippers.  I cut all my boy&#x27;s hair and save a ton of money.  I love that these clips have both measurements on them.  I no longer have to puzzle and figure out the 1/2&amp;#34; is the same as the #4.  I also like the drawstring bag that came with them for storage.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to trim the wild hair on my border collies back side. There are many different sizes and one that I&#x27;m sure will meet your needs. The quality is excellent and I&#x27;m sure they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Another great product from oster. Works great and very satisfied. Clips on blades and fits firmly in place in use.</li>
            <li> Found combs pretty useless for clipping my dog&lt;br /&gt;Probably need clipper blades to do the best job  combs attached well enough</li>
            <li> I bought this basically to test and see which size I like best before ordering the proper metal clippers. The 10 comb set is worth the money, but it most certainly doesn&#x27;t trim as close as the metal clippers.</li>
            <li> works like a charm no prob, but i have to write 14 words so... works like a charm again and again</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and nice comb set. I would&#x27;ve given 5 stars if only it was easier to attach and detach from the clipper. I have already used it up to 5 times since I purchased it and got the full value out of it. You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> High quality item. I think, is good to have the full kit if you have Oster Hair Clipper The Famous Classic 76 Professional</li>
            <li> Great product. Works great on any clipper. Use them on my own wahls.</li>
            <li> perfecttttt. I highly recommend. they even came with a little carrying bag. ive had these now for over a year and theyre perfect</li>
            <li> Worked well with My Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clippers.  I am a complete Amatuer, and did a fair job , thanks to these combs.  They were easy to attach, too.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as promised.  Package set contains every length needed for dog grooming. I purchased for use with Oster A5 Animal Clipper.</li>
            <li> Works well with the Turbo Clippers that I got at the same time. Dog doesn&#x27;t object to being sheared. Makes cutting even, easy.</li>
            <li> Bought the cheaper kind previous to this purchase, returned due to broken pieces, rusted spring mechanisms etc.&lt;br /&gt;THESE ARE PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;much much much better quality! worth the extra $. Don&#x27;t cheap out like I did, do it safe and buy this kit if you&#x27;re looking for a plastic slip on set. I&#x27;m using these with my Oster 76er Professional edition and they work perfectly! (*ONLY downfall buying these and not the metal ones, is that the #1 metal piece the Oster comes with will heat up pretty dramatically, and can easily burn the skin when touched)</li>
            <li> Great!!! Highly Recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Love these. I especially like that they aren&#x27;t just clipped on like the wahl combs i had for that clipper. They are spring loaded to they stay in place very securely!</li>
            <li> I wish they posted a clearer more precise description</li>
            <li> Fits my Oster perfectly and does not gouge my head.</li>
            <li> Comb set is described as universal, but doesn&#x27;t fit our Oster electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I only used one out of all.  Maybe a professional would use more, but then a professional would not purchase the clipper that I did.  I am only doing one dog, a mini Schnauzer.</li>
            <li> I initially believed the guides did not fit the Oster Fast Feed clippers, but they do. When attaching them, you need to start from the metal back end of the guide, then push forward until the black plastic teeth extend past the metal ones, and it&#x27;ll snap right on. To remove, just push on the back of the guide with your thumb so it slides forward, then lift up on the front teeth with your other hand, and it will come right off. It doesn&#x27;t take any real degree of strength to do this- it&#x27;s all in the technique.</li>
            <li> I always wanted one.  Don&#x27;t know why I took so long to get one.  I will never be without it !</li>
            <li> The set of combs do not fit my Oster clipper perfectly. The combs are slighly off center.  There is no way to adjust as the clip on the comb has two tabs which fit into slots on the Oster clipper.  Other than that they are very nice and with the metal clip should last better than the plastic combs/clip that came with this clipper.</li>
            <li> Combs fit perfectly. However, they are cheap - not sure how long they will last. It does the trick for now.</li>
            <li> Perfect as expected!!</li>
            <li> I knew as soon as I took them out of the Amazon box that they weren&#x27;t going to fit on my clippers, and I was right.  These combs are shaped differently than the blade on my Oster Professional Fast Feed clippers, and no amount of trying will get them to seat on it.  I&#x27;m going to send them back, and wanted to warn others that \\&quot;Universal\\&quot; and \\&quot;All comb sizes are designed to fit any Oster Clipper\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean it fits every Oster clipper.</li>
            <li> I really like these, except when I received it I got two #2 guards and not a #1 guard. :(  I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is so cheap.  More than one broke just putting them on the clippers.</li>
            <li> These spring attachments are way better than the snap on kind. Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> They fit fine , but the metal plate catches her hair sometimes. Manufacturer issue, not the seller</li>
            <li> I first bought some generic clipper combs for my oster, but when they came in some of them were chipped or broken already.  The Oster clipper combs are the only way to go.</li>
            <li> The oster comps are so easy to work with and you have 10 comps to choose from so giving any one a styled hair cut is simple.</li>
            <li> These combs do not fit the Oster A-5 properly / at the rear they leave a large gap / they are a total waste of money for my application / extremely disappointing  / you would be better off buying an additional blade for different cuts / they are almost impossible to return as you have to destroy the package to get them out</li>
            <li> This comb set works just like it should .</li>
            <li> These snap right on to my Oster Classic 76 Limited Edition clipper and stay firmly in place.  They are well made and there is quite the variety--many more than I need, but nice to have the full set.</li>
            <li> This was basically wasted money. My poodle&#x27;s hair would get tangled in it and it would pull, plus the cut was uneven since the spacing between the plastic teeth is too wide. I basically gave up using these. I do not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> These combs fit the Oster 111, as well as other brands. Included are all sizes for longer to shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality is excellent, as these combs have spring loaded metal clips for easy removal and changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I will recommend this set of combs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with storage bag&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy</li>
            <li> Price is great considering the metal attachment that keeps the clips on while cutting.  If you have ever had the cheap kind fall off these are SOOO much better and don&#x27;t come loose.</li>
            <li> Works great when switching from my husbands to my sons hair.</li>
            <li> Bought these for the Classic 76.  Excellent fit.  Now I just need a case to organize these instead of throwing them in the bag that this comes with...</li>
            <li> exactly what hubby needed, his uses often and is satisfied</li>
            <li> What a great purchase. They work on all lengths of hair.</li>
            <li> The clipper got really hot after 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;My cat started to scream  cause the clippers were burning her&lt;br /&gt;  I would not buy these clippers</li>
            <li> I really love that they snap on so solidly - my other combs would end up falling off half the time and I&#x27;d have gouges in my dogs&#x27; fur - thankfully not in my dogs!  So great accessory for the Oster clippers!</li>
            <li> I bought these so I could cut my hair with the Oster clippers I used when I was a practicing veterinarian many years ago. New blades and these combs did the trick.  Have been using them for several months with no problems.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on my Oster. Make sure when you are putting these on, you hook the bottom part of the comb first, and then push it to where the top is up over the blade and let it fall into place.  (if that makes sense lol) Watched a review on youtube about it and he showed the best way to replace the combs.</li>
            <li> I actually bought these to go along with the shaver as a gift, but I think I should have just bought more blades. This was a good cheaper alternative though.</li>
            <li> No matter what your profession you need the right tools.  This comb set works great with the Oster 76.  I wish I had purchased it sooner</li>
            <li> I have an oster clipper and needed just one of the gaurds, but at the price I couldn&#x27;t pass them up and I got them in no time at all. easy to attach and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> These will help you decide what size blades you&#x27;ll eventually buy.  For instance,  using the 1/2&amp;#34; guard on the 1/16&amp;#34; blade( one that comes with the oster) is painful compared to using the 1/2&amp;#34; dedicated blade.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly and work great so I don&#x27;t have to buy expensive replacement blades in different sizes. Well made with a metal clip so I don&#x27;t have to worry about any plastic breaking.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, durable and just as described!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work on the Oster clippers for which I purchase them. But they do work on the other one.</li>
            <li> These fit my clippers so well. I have never had such a good set. They have metal spring clips to hold firmly to the clipper blade on the unit.  The best set ever made and totally worth the few bucks spent.</li>
            <li> I bought these attachements by mistake.  I had to return them because they did not fit my Andis clipper.  However, they looked great and the quality was good.  I just could not use them for my clipper and had to return them.  Would be a great buy for anyone that has the Oster Pet Clipper.</li>
            <li> Order this set after reading some reviews for the Oster clippers that I also purchased.  Turns out that the clippers came with enough combs to meet my needs.  Did not need to purchase this set</li>
            <li> I am 6&#x27;4&amp;#34; and unfortunately bald so I shave my head on a weekly basis! Hence I own the Oster Classic 76 clippers. I own the 3.2mm, 2.4mm and 000 blades for trimming my head. I bought these guards because I also need to Man-scape once in a while (apparently my head hair fell to my chest and legs?) These guards snap on very easily and stay in place great. I use them with the 000 blade and it makes cutting very easy as the Oster clippers and design are the absolute best I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you cut hair a lot you NEED the Oster Classic 76 clippers and likely need these guards as well!</li>
            <li> I bought these to go with my Oster A5 turbo dog clipper.  It&#x27;s a good combination.  I recommend these two items together to give your dog good grooming.</li>
            <li> This set of combs has made it so easy to groom my havanese. I have already performed his puppy cut two times using them and both times he looks as though he had been professionally cut. I am so glad to be saving the money that a groomer would have charged me for cutting him.</li>
            <li> These are NOT Universal, and do NOT fit all Oster clippers.  I bought the Powermax 2 speed clippers that come with a size 10 blade.  I just assumed that with this collection of combs I could get the length I needed.  I don&#x27;t really get it (I&#x27;ve never done grooming before), but apparently these clippers require that I buy new BLADES, to the tune of $35-$40 each, to get the length I want.  It would have been nice if either the clippers or the comb set explained this in their descriptions.&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I can&#x27;t even return the combs b/c I threw out the packaging, assuming they&#x27;d be fine.</li>
            <li> Great item attachment</li>
            <li> These worked great.  I was worried they wouldnt fit right but there were no problems.</li>
            <li> I bought these with my Oster A5 Turbo clippers, and this is a nice comb set. They are spring loaded so to speak, and unlike the clipper combs I have used in the past and had to fight to keep them on, these aren&#x27;t going anywhere until you take them off. The really nice thing is I believe you can use these on many types of clippers, although I haven&#x27;t tried. but when the clippers go, I&#x27;m keeping these.</li>
            <li> All needed sizes, Clip on easily to my unit and stays on, Came is good time,  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great range of combs, well made and clearly marked in sizes to complement my Oster hair clipper. Easy to fit and remove. Perfectly happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am a middle-aged woman and I bought these for myself.  I have been clipper-cutting my husband&#x27;s hair and my 2 sons hair for years (though I am not a professional hair stylist).  I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair short for a long time now.  We are retired and on a very tight  budget so I decided to purchase this set and give it a try.  I use the largest clipper attachment from the set and I am able to cut my own hair.  This is saving us lots of money and my family and friends can&#x27;t believe how great my hair looks!</li>
            <li> This was the almost perfect clipper comb attachment. It is installed on the clipper by pulling the comb attachment forward over the edge of the clipper tip. I took out one star because the springs in the combs are too tight.</li>
            <li> purchased to use with oster a5 turbo 2-speed professional clippers they are great but i don&#x27;t know what else to say</li>
            <li> I do not ha too much experience but be aware that the # 1 is like a real # 2</li>
            <li> You spent good money for professional clippers, spend some on pro attachments. You&#x27;ll br glad you did. One note of caution though, these Pro combs cut longer than cheapo combs. I use a 3/8&amp;#34; pro comb where I was using a 1/2&amp;#34; cheapo.</li>
            <li> Compared to prices in store in Australia, buying this product was a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with how they attach to the clippers and for the purpose of clipping my spoodle at home I have had no issues with this product.</li>
            <li> Combs stay tight to clipper head.  They can be a bit difficult to remove. They don&#x27;t get gummed up with fur very easily so you can keep cutting.</li>
            <li> I needed replacement combs for my clippers and this was perfect. The quality of the combs were equal or better than the old combs. A pleasure to work with.</li>
            <li> I clip my own little dog.  I can not afford to take him to a groomer.  Nor can afford to run him over to a vet from cuts.&lt;br /&gt;So, these combs work great with my animal shaver to protect my dog from nicks and razor burn while allowing for a very professional cut.</li>
            <li> I bought extra guards for this Oster clipped set and they are suppose to work on all orders. WRONG! I have done hair for 18 years and have never seen anything like this! No one at work can figure out how they go on either. I even googled it to see if I can see how to attach them. Ugh.</li>
            <li> they do what they are supposed to. theses combs seem like they are fairly high quality and are better than the comes i had for my wahl clippers</li>
            <li> So many times you get something that has to be replaced and that&#x27;s the case with these I had a clipper that needed a new set of combs and I found these online for waaaaayyyy less than the other places so I bought them and they are just as good a quality as the factory ones.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use with my Oster trimmer. I have previously used my trimmer to groom my dog, but now I wanted to try cutting my own hair to save money. I wear my hair very short in the back and a bit longer and curly on the top. These fit the trimmer as advertised and for the cost of a cheap haircut I figured I didn&#x27;t really have anything to lose. They seem good quality and stayed on the trimmer without popping off. Now I just need to get my technique right! I did watch some videos on You Tube, first. That gave me the confidence to try it myself. I recommend these attachments.</li>
            <li> They snap on and work great on my old Model 123 Oster dog clippers, even if I now use it to trim my beard and cut my hair.  I did get a #5 and #6 in my package as well since many had mentioned getting two #5s.</li>
            <li> My clippers must be 35 years old, but these combs fit perfectly and make it easy to groom my dog.</li>
            <li> Essential if you own an Oster.</li>
            <li> So glad to have these to fit over my big clippers.  &amp;#34;Pet&amp;#34; clippers just don&#x27;t cut it for me, so I have a set of Andis for body clipping horses and our dogs.  These fit perfect.</li>
            <li> Works great with the Oster clipper I bought #76023510.  Had to buy it since it didn&#x27;t come with size that I need.</li>
            <li> Fits my Oster perfectly...</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS COMB SET FOR MY OSTER CLIPPER, SO I CAN NOT COMMENT HOW WELL THEY WOULD WORK OR FIT ON OTHER BRAND CLIPPERS. THESE CLIPPERS ARE GREAT. THEY ARE WELL MADE AND FIT SNUGLY ON THE CLIPPER. THEY EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS.</li>
            <li> I just bought oster&#x27;s classic 76. The blades for that are $30 a piece. Rather than getting a ton of blades at $30 ea just to cut my own hair, I got these. You need to make a few more passes than if you used blades, but I&#x27;m just cutting my own hair here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great quality. On my Classic 76 they snap in firmly with a spring loaded clamp. They don&#x27;t fall off, or slide off, or pop off, so you don&#x27;t risk making a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I like most about them is they have a few combs that are really large, so if you don&#x27;t want to buzz your head in the winter, you can just give it a quick and easy trim without leaving your head fuzzy or spiky, just a uniform cut.. that you may want to have a spouse or friend spruce up just a touch when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to put on and take off, and fiet to the clippers so perfect.  I think these are the best combs we have used on a clippers.</li>
            <li> the set was missing comb #4 and #7, instead it had a duplicate #5 and #6. A quality control issue (typical of North America, unfortunately).  Minus 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combs are a little harder to put on any other combs I have used in the past, but are more secure. However, I feel a little uneasy that it is on correctly. Minus 1/2 star.</li>
            <li> I purchased these at the same time I bought my Oster Classic 76 clippers. For years I cut my own hair weekly - and occasionally my sons&#x27; hair - to save time and get the results I wanted.  The cheap off-the-shelf clippers never seemed to last or quite to the job I wanted but were OK - and frequently the combs broke or slipped.  The Oster clippers changed all that.  (See my separate reviews for the clippers and 00000 blade.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hand isn&#x27;t steady enough to free-hand my hair cut. These combs were a must-have for me.  They seem to be sturdy and holding up fine.  They attach firmly to the clippers with no slippage.  Of the ten, I routinely use only three or four.  The Oster professional grade has convinced me that I should have upgraded years ago.</li>
            <li> They are a little harder to put on, due to the spring loading, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  I&#x27;m not trying to set any records for hair cutting....</li>
            <li> sturdy and  nice variety</li>
            <li> Great, cost effective alternative while I am gradually collect the more expensive metal blades. It&#x27;s nice to have so many sizes!</li>
            <li> Have two dogs, Yorkie and a poodle/maltese type.  The Yorkie&#x27;s hair is light.  The poodle/maltese is curly and a little on the heavy side.  The Oster shave handled both well.  The problem with the unit is the heat; when you want to shave around the face without a comb it is uncomfortable for the dog.</li>
            <li> these are good quality, name brand clipper attachments. They are spring loaded with metal attachment points. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> These fit my Oster well, no complaints. I use them for hair and beard and they work equally good for both.</li>
            <li> Great product shipped by a very reliable and dependable amazon seller. the blade comb attachments fit perfectly on the Oster pet clippers and made our little buddy look super!</li>
            <li> i think they should take the word universal out of description. They did not fit my oster clippers. they looks right but it just didnt work out.</li>
            <li> The Oser Universal Comb Set was everything  that we wanted and expected. Fast delivery. The clippers that we have are an older moder but the spring loaded method worked well.</li>
            <li> I have a little 4.5 lb Yorkie - very tiny - with fairly short hair.  Before I got half way through cutting her hair (Oster Professional 076076-123 Operation Homefront Camo Classic 76 Limited Edition) the unit was binding and/or pulling hair rather than cutting the hair.  Not knowing why she was struggling to get away I tested it on myself - and the hair pulling was awful!  Yes .... the blade was checked to make sure it was clean, oiled and free of hair.  And this was the very first time this product had ever been used!  The only advantage I can see for this product over the much cheaper (half the price) Conairs is that it is a little quieter.  However, quiet makes little difference when the product does not satisfy the primary purpose it is marketed for.  Do not waste your money or time - unless you want to throw your money away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve a nice &#x27;fancy&#x27; Pivot Motor Oster Razor that this set is completely incompatible. It does not mate flush. Wasted $20 for my Oster.</li>
            <li> Yes, having the actual metal blades is a better option, but for the price, these work great. They do not make the larger sizes anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And despite what another reviewer had to say, these DO fit the A5. They snap right on. If you are having trouble figuring out how to put them on for some reason, just look at the video on the product page. It could not be simpler.</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly and shipped fast! Would highly recommend them. I like that the clippers are angled better and a lot stiffer than the ones that came with the clipper.</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my Oster 78005-010 Golden A5 Single-Speed Clipper to use on my persian cat. I like the variety of sizes this set offers as it allowed me to cut his coat different lengths. The combs fit perfectly but they are a little tricky getting on the first time so don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re the wrong kind if you have some difficulty, there&#x27;s something you have to slide that allows for it to clip on.</li>
            <li> This is not quite what UI expected although they work ,  they are on the low end of a quality scale..</li>
            <li> I really like these combs. I just have to say that they are a challenge to put on/change. I&#x27;m not a professionally licensed barber, however I&#x27;ve been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for 23 years. This was clearly an upgrade, compared to what I had been using, it&#x27;s just that they are tight and a challenge to switch sizes. I&#x27;m not sure if other kinds would fit more easily, but I really like the variety of sizes in this kit. I had done my research and this seemed to be the best bang for the buck, as they are certainly durable - not flimsy!</li>
            <li> The is a good set but the design needs to be slightly tweaked. When you are cutting with them the hair collected between blade on shears and black plastic. So this cause me to have to stop every few mins and take the clip off and clean off the fur. Not terrible but slightly annoying.</li>
            <li> These things are the real deal. I&#x27;m using them on an Oster 76...There is an extremely snug/tight fit and they are easily removed as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have done 4 1/2 if I could because I think there is a need for a few sizes smaller as well. They&#x27;re definitely closer to 5 than 4 though...</li>
            <li> This comb set fits my Oster very well.  The spring-tensioned attachment always assures a snug fit and a firm hold on your clipper.  Oster, overall, is definitely a notch above the less expensive competitor&#x27;s products that I&#x27;ve used over the years.  These combs are high quality and durable.  They come with a bag that is large enough to fit all 10 combs into and a few more, if you have them.  Although I have not had them for long, I expect that they will last 10-20+ years.  They may outlive me.  I had initially balked at the price when I was pondering purchasing them, but now that I&#x27;ve received them I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t try to save a few dollars by purchasing a lesser set.</li>
            <li> Now I have the options I need for haircuts.  These and the new shaver will pay for themselves in a  year of savings from the shop.</li>
            <li> These are good guards. They don&#x27;t come with a #9 - but I typically do not use guards that size anyhow.</li>
            <li> These are a cheap solution but don&#x27;t work well.  Just buy the metal blades for the size you need.  Costs more but works!!</li>
            <li> These came in today and I tested them immediately. These all have the steel inside plates that are spring loaded. All the spring look very good. I have years of experience and training on mechanical things. this one looks well built. Each spring loaded plate slides easily and grabs the Electric Oster Shaver. and based on the design it would probably fit on almost any shaver I used it on. Very nice combs. I was surprised at the Engineering that took place in making these.</li>
            <li> great made grooming my dog much easier than using thinning scissiors. have used several combs different lengths. thanks very much</li>
            <li> ok- would like to see angled combs for over ears included.</li>
            <li> For those who have the Oster Classic 76 clippers with changeable blades, this comb set can be used ONLY with the Oster 000 blade (the blade with the closest haircut).  They will NOT work with other blades, for example the \\&quot;1\\&quot; or the \\&quot;3-1/2\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I didn&#x27;t think that these fit at all, but then I discovered that they DO work with the 000 blade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The largest comb included will cut hair to a 1-1/4\\&quot; length, great for my beard! ---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are quite well made, will probably last forever.  Price was way reasonable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wavered between a 4 and a 5 rating --  I&#x27;d give them either a 4+ or a 5-! --</li>
            <li> This set of depth guides is a must if you are to use your Oster clippers. You will be able to perform any type of pet grooming style. Well worth the very cheap price.</li>
            <li> The unit performs well but is very heavy to manipulate by oneself.  Far outperforms other less expensive shavers that I have owned,</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t your average cheap ass plastic things that clip on and fit poorly. These have metal plates and springs that clip onto your clippers and hold tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the guards your barber uses. Buy these.</li>
            <li> They work great on all Oster Clippers. Very nice.</li>
            <li> The springs in these will not slide. The method to place them on fast feeds doesnt allow them to lay flat. I had high hopes for these suckes. But was let down. Guess i wasted 23.00.  It wasnt the seller it is the poor quality.  I have decided to just ditch oster and these blades and do the masters and the magnetic combs. There is a reason most peoe have them. Very Displeased. Take care People.</li>
            <li> I was given two #6 guards. And missing the #5.</li>
            <li> These are anything but universal!</li>
            <li> Maybe on dogs with softer hair it would be a good item, but didn&#x27;t work for us on our wire fox terrier.  We ended up buying the steel blades.</li>
            <li> I am using these on a classic Oster 76.  I had high hopes for these, I looked at all of the different options available online and decided to try the Oster brand set figuring that it would be slightly more compatible with Oster brand clippers.  For starters, the spring loaded aspect works well and holds securely to the blade, that is the best feature of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My major qualm with these is that they have a major design flaw that is subtle enough that no one would notice until they tried to use them.  The &#x27;comb&#x27; on these is open all the way through, there is no stopping point to force the hairs to stand on end and get clipped at the accurate length.  Its like this, if you look at a regular metal clipper blade, say a 3 1/2 size, the empty spaces in the comb part STOP closer to the blade which means that when the hairs &#x27;hit&#x27; this point, they are forced upright and thus get clipped at the height of the blade.  These plastic combs dont have that, they are basically open all the way through, so no matter what length the hair, if its not already standing pretty much straight up, the comb does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use my 3 1/2 size Oster 76 blade and it will clip a TON of hair on my beard, clearly the hair is longer than 3 1/2.  If I use a 000 blade and the size 3 plastic comb, it barely clips anything, the comb just doesnt force the hairs into the right position.  Im a DIYer, so Im going to try to salvage these by adding some material in the &#x27;back&#x27; of each blade, but dont spend the money on these.  You would do better with a different set.  Love the 76, but these combs are bunk.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what kind of clippers you own you have to buy these to replace the crappy ones that come with them. Even the oster clippers i bought i don&#x27;t use the original ones, i have bad experiences when they pop off and i shave my head. These are spring loaded and aren&#x27;t going anywhere, i&#x27;m sure they fit on most clippers.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend love it&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty nice on his hair</li>
            <li> The additional set is great and easy to clip right on, cut my hair and its just like i wanted it and I cut it myself!</li>
            <li> Bought these, price was right. They fit my Oster well and snap on nice and tight. Gives you a good array of sizes to choose from.</li>
            <li> They came in just when i expected them. Very sturdy and fit snug on my Osters, Wahls, and Andis. It&#x27;s very tight and has a lot of tension but that ensures it does not fall off in mid-haircutting.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Oster 76 Clippers and they fit perfectly ! No complaints and I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Nice selection of all the most popular lengths.  Also, a very nice bag was included to keep them all together.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> These are nice...but they will not make you a dog groomer.  If you want your dog to look like he/she has been to the dog groomers, take them to the groomers.</li>
            <li> Prefect fit with my New Clippers.....did not get caught when trimming little Milo....easy to clean..Highly recommended for easy trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I used one of the combs for the new Oster I purchased.  It fit properly and the combinaton cut properly.  Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they were just snap ons, but they have some sort of weird metal spring mechanism where it latches onto the bottom of your blades and then you have to apply a bit of pressure and pull them to snap on...Takes too long when you&#x27;re in a hurry, and I even broke the adjustment lever on my Fast Feed because it creates a lot of pressure on the lever when you open and close, so now I&#x27;m just going to use the Andis purple magnetic guards, they&#x27;re a lot simpler...The good thing about these is that they&#x27;re real strong and not flimsy. I&#x27;ve dropped them multiple times, but not a single tooth has broken yet. And of course, like the name says, they&#x27;re universal and fit my other clippers fine.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a long time for something to fit my Oster dog grooming clippers and these do the job.</li>
            <li> Very good combs . Use these in our hair salon , that does at least 50 + clipper cuts a day . Well made can fit detachable blade clippers . Oster and andis .</li>
            <li> Arrived in great condition, and did the job.  New in the box and ahead of time.  I think I will get some grooming done now.</li>
            <li> what can i say about a set of clipper guards...they ar clipper guards...do you want to here that they come in a nice plastic package...well they did and they shipped in a nice cardboard box too...i received them quickly...want to make note mine came with a hundred dollar bill in the box...Buy these clipper attachments...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOL about the 100 spot...thats what i paid for the clippers...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the point at the end are too sharp, and scrap your head.  Other than that they work great.</li>
            <li> perfect  for long hair pets works as  stated fits all oster and stay on</li>
            <li> wife needed new combs for work and they work great</li>
            <li> Outstanding product with TEN combs that snaps over the 0000 Oster clipper head attachment and expand the use of your clippers exponentially. The bad news? I&#x27;m now the designated hair cutter for our 3 boys!!</li>
            <li> it was exactly how it was described and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Works Great. I have a had an Oster clipper for years with a limited set of clips.  Now I have tons of options.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and they loved it! Good quality and works great!!!! I would recommend this to any barber!!!</li>
            <li> Bought 2 sets of these for use in my salon. After just one use on a customer, the #4 comb cracked right down the middle and split into two pieces when removed from the clippers. The other combs are ok so far but the stylists will have to check them frequently for cracks. So much for &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; quality products.</li>
            <li> The set covers enough lengths to cover all seasons.  The attachments are well made and should last a very long time.  I am extremely happy with the purchase and speed of delivery.</li>
            <li> It does the trick and really does fit everything. I didn&#x27;t buy the trimmer with this but it fits the trimmer so very happy!</li>
            <li> came quick, was as described..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not much else to say...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy new year and good luck in 2013 .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of the combs yet.  The quality appears to be the typical great quality of Oster products.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and they work great with the Oster 76.  I&#x27;ve not owned it long but so far I&#x27;m impressed. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use these with the #40 blade and they work fine.  They fit my Oster 78004-011 Powermax 2-Speed Clippers without any problems.</li>
            <li> Good investment, but they need to be handled with care.  My 1/4 broke and needed to be replaced. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Might be good for the hair on your head but is not useful for beards at all. The mafnetic guides are so much better just as a design concept.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have clippers with this comb set together, or at least a buy one get one half off. Only needed one comb and had to buy a set.</li>
            <li> Guards tend to be a little tricky to put on at first, but they work.</li>
            <li> These attachments add excellent versatility.  Made to specifically fit Oster hair clippers, they are easy to attach and stay in place.</li>
            <li> I picked these up with the Classic 76.  They are of good quality and work perfectly with the Classic 76.  If you cut your own hair (or have your wife do it like me) then it&#x27;s definitely worth investing in quality clippers and this comb set.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for haircuts done at home!</li>
            <li> If you bought the Oster Hair Clipper, you should get this comb set.  Includes clipper size from 1/16 to 1&amp;#34;.  Easy to attach and easy to clean.  The only thing missing is the tapered attachment seen in many other less expensive hair clippers.</li>
            <li> The set of combs is great. They all fit our Oster clippers well. I would recommend them to anyone looking for this type of product!</li>
            <li> Barber used: Perfect use with your detachable blade clippers. I use with the newest Oster Model 10&#x27;s and they are rock solid. Can&#x27;t give feedback on fit of other brands/models. Good professional quality combs.</li>
            <li> The clippers are a great product. Quiet, fast and durable, they have been cutting my hair for a few months and are working great. Only reason for the one star off is they do get little warm but this product for the price was not meant for professional use. These are great family clippers and work very well with that use. I say a little warm after cutting hair for 30 minutes and 2 boys with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Fits and works With throated clippers I bought! Hopefully they last a long time, but if I loose ones would buy the same again</li>
            <li> Product was as described delivered a few days later than expected date.</li>
            <li> Two words &amp;#34;High Quality&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit on the Oster clipper we bought them with.  Don&#x27;t stay on.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Fit my bay bliss very well. Great product.</li>
            <li> 09/2014 Update: They haven&#x27;t broke yet.</li>
            <li> If you own Oster clippers, don&#x27;t buy anything but Oster combs!</li>
            <li> Great for grooming my two Yorkies at home.</li>
            <li> This comb set is easy to use and has a wide variety of sizes. I have only used a few sizes and have removed the combs multiple times. It appears to be of great quality.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy these guards after reading a few reviews but I still bought them. I received them today and will be returning them today. I have a Yorshire Terrier and with each pass his hair would get caught between the clipper blade and the guard. I had to keep taking off the guard to clean it which made my dog&#x27;s haircut seem like forever. I bought these for the Oster A5 because they were cheaper than buying the blades and I should have know better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set the with Oster Animal clippers. They don&#x27;t fit at all. Where is the product control personnel in this regard. Why don&#x27;t they know these do not fit the Oster? I hate returning items. I wish I could give it a Zero star. I feel used and bambuzled...is that a word? It is now!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It works great but be careful not to force it on the clipper or else you will bend the metal teeth back.</li>
            <li> Great product on time</li>
            <li> I recently bought a fast-feed Oster clipper. Before I bought it I did some research, and it seemed like people&#x27;s main complaint was that the combs that came with the machine weren&#x27;t sufficient for their needs. So I picked up this pack in the same shopping cart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These combs are quite a bit better engineered than the combs that came with the machine. The latching mechanism is a bit tricky, but easy enough with a little practice. I imagine I&#x27;ll only use 2 or maybe 3 of all of these combs, but it was still worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I use these with my Oster Fast Feed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected these to just be plastic guards you slip onto the clippers, nothing fancy, right? Well I was pleased to see that these have a bit of a metal spring system built into each guard/comb, so that the piece is securely fastened to your clippers. Nice little feature, as I&#x27;ve had guards fall off mid cut in the past...I have complete confidence that will never happen with these due to that spring mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use one or two of the guards, but they were well worth the purchase of the set.</li>
            <li> These were sturdy enough yet I believe the cost was far greater than the actual production cost. The clippers were sufficient, nothing more, nothing less.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my hair shaved down very low and the combination of my Oster Classic 76 and these combs does the trick admirably.  They work well and don&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34;.  They are made sturdy and I expect to get years of flawless use out of them.  If  you buy I hope you are as happy with them as I am and thanks for taking the time to read my review.</li>
            <li> solid construction.......... made to last a lifetime. comes highly recommended. All I need for the whole family.&lt;br /&gt;thanks to Oster and amazon.</li>
            <li> Not too much to say about this set except that it works as advertised on my Oster clipper.  There are many more combs that I can possibly use but the set is inexpensive so I don&#x27;t mind having a few extra.  The original clipper doesn&#x27;t come with many combs so this set is necessary if you need to get more versatility from it.  Buy it...it&#x27;s worth the money and it works.</li>
            <li> We use these on our [[ASIN:B000LRN31A Oster A5 Turbo 2-Speed Professional Animal Clipper]] and they work perfectly. Attach super easily, has a great grip and stays on throughout the entire job. Love having multiple lengths so we can trim to our liking. Comes with a nice carrying bag. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace an original comb that broke from my Oster clippers. I really like the additional sizes that come with it but they are not the easiest to put on the clippers. Instead of just sliding over the blades like the originals these need to be &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34; onto the blades with a spring mechanism. So not as easy to use but they do the job.</li>
            <li> I had not realized when I purchased an Oster hair clipper that this one required special guards!  They fit and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars but the combs don&#x27;t fit the blade flush and a little difficult at first to place on clipper. Good quality product.</li>
            <li> will worth the price.</li>
            <li> The set came in with two number 6 combs and missing the number 5 comb. They could have done a better QA check on that one.</li>
            <li> Great Deal!!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Bought these to clip my doodle and poodle but didn&#x27;t work. Hair got stuck; blade didn&#x27;t cut, it was a mess. Bought regular blades to try next time.</li>
            <li> This Oster comb set also fits my Forfex Babyliss clippers.</li>
            <li> It states in the product description &amp;#34;All comb sizes are designed to fit any Oster Clipper as well as most other clippers available&amp;#34; is does NOT. Specifically it doesn&#x27;t fit the Oster Juice cordless.</li>
            <li> It took a minute or two to figure them out as far as attaching to the Oster.  But I figured it out.  Nice quality, heavy duty plastic with many comb sizes to choose from.  Great price. I use it for the top and the beard.  Nice drawstring bag for storage.</li>
            <li> These work fine and fit my Oster cutter. There is not much else to say except that these fit fine, they do the job they need to do and there are a wide range of sizes.</li>
            <li> Works great! I thought they might be a little flimsy but their not. You just have to put them on and off correctly. Although I don&#x27;t like the storage bag... You have to poor out all the attachments to find the one you want and it doesn&#x27;t protect them very well either.</li>
            <li> Awesome set, not a barber just a dad that cuts his own and sons hair.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Fits much better than the cheap all plastic combs. The metal retaining clips keep the combs on even with thick course hair.</li>
            <li> These are not good guard combs, I cut with the oster classic 76&lt;br /&gt;and both do a terrible job at cutting afro textured hair low and with the grain (at about a 2 length)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the 1/16 guard because those are the only ones that can even touch my hair&lt;br /&gt;and even still they cannot cut with the grain&lt;br /&gt;Only against the grain which does not look as good</li>
            <li> Much better than the clips that came with my fast feed. They clip on securely and do not make a loud noise once fastened on. They arrived quicker than expected which worked out well for me!</li>
            <li> We havent used thexse yet, but they look of good quality, and are Oster brand so your know your getting a top notch product!</li>
            <li> I wish they were sold separately though, I only needed one.  They go on by springs, and do not snap on and off the way another brand I had worked, I do like the snap on better but maybe that was not as good for the blade?  I&#x27;m not a hairdresser.  I probably should have just bought the blade.  It seems you have to buy the exact brand of these, should be universal I think.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about every comb now and I love them.  They attach firmly to my classic Oster 76 classic clipper and it seems like that&#x27;s the clpper they were designed to fit.  I&#x27;ve recommended the clipper and combs to several friends and they all rave about them.  One guy bought a set to groom his dogs and loves it.</li>
            <li> great product...bought it to use on my dog and horses while giving them a trim...works well.</li>
            <li> The lower two guards do not match up to the other Oster guards. So it make it difficult for blending, because the 1/16 is the same size as the 1/8 guard that came with the clippers</li>
            <li> works well with clippers</li>
            <li> These are functional and do the job but are not the perfect fit, obviously it needs to fit multiple styles...they do the job.</li>
            <li> THEY BREAK WHEN YOU TAKE THEM OFF RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE</li>
            <li> These say universal but do not fit my Oster clippers.</li>
            <li> These very affordable comb attachments are a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; with your Oster clippers.  A comprehensive set of sizes make every hair style effortless. Give them a try and save yourself alot of time and money while gaining the self-confidence that comes along with doing something for yourself!!</li>
            <li> Good quality, not like the ones you buy at Walmart .</li>
            <li> If you own/purchase a set of Oster Clippers, you need to purchase this comb set. These combs allow you to set the cutting length that you desire. A must have for any pet owner. Well made. these will hold up for a long time.</li>
            <li> I thought these were designed for the Oster clipper. But they are a universal comb that fits several different brands, so they are not that easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly on my Oster cutters.</li>
            <li> These clips are really good and strong unlike the Oster battery operated clippers that I bought to go with them. The clippers were a pile os shit unlike the clips that went with them</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for. works well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I order an Oster 76023-510 clipper from Amazon.  There was nothing in the product discription or the image of the clipper to suggest that it came as a kit with 4 combs.  So I ordered this comb set to go with it, which I didn&#x27;t need.  Now Amazon is charging me $5.75 to return the combs that I would not have ordered if the product description of the clippers had been accurate.</li>
            <li> These blades attach easily to a variety of clippers and are fast to switch on and off.  The quality is good and they will probably last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I originally bought a set of these for my Oster 76 Classic, but they also fit the Andis BGRC I purchased later.  Liked them well enough that I bought a second set to keep at my home away from home along with the Andis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit contains sizes 0 through 10 which gives enough small steps that even a non-pro can do a good taper/fade haircut with very little practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not the same kind of garbage that come for \\&quot;free\\&quot; with cheap $25 - $50 clippers you buy at Wal-Mart, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A strong metal spring-clip attaches the combs tightly to your clippers.  Some people seem confused by this.  If your clipper blade is too long, it might be too hard to fit the combs onto the blade, because the spring will not extend far enough.  The manufacture recommends using no more than a #1 clipper blade.  I have used from #000 to #1 as the clipper blade, and it works fine.  With the #1 you definitely have to push a little harder.  Fortunately, the Oster and Andis clippers sold on Amazon often come with #000 and #1 included, so you should have no problem making it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction seems quite sturdy, but you would likely break them if they were attached to the clippers and you drop the clippers down hard on the counter (not good for your clippers, but it can happen when trying to cut your own hair!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set does not contain the two tapered combs for cutting above the right and left ear.  No problem for me; I never use them.</li>
            <li> They work real good so many to choose from .I real like that .A little hard to get off and on tho .</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly with my Oster Professional trimmer I just bought.  Spring makes it easy to put on and take off the the clippers.</li>
            <li> These fit my Oster Fast feed perfectly. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and guards work perfect and were in great condition and I love the way they are labeled! Very easy to use!</li>
            <li> I find these to attach and detach from the razor well.  I did not find them gliding through the hair that well.  The size assortment is wonderful.</li>
