            <li>and I love it!!</li>
            <li>The quality was pretty good and the color is excellent - just perfect for my Hatsune Miku cosplay.</li>
            <li>and they kept on tangling easily besides that everything was perfect!!</li>
            <li>(Of course it&#x27;s still a good idea to keep a comb around and brush it out every once in awhile.)</li>
            <li>but all you gotta do is take good care of it</li>
            <li>had problems but still loved it</li>
            <li>It fits well and the shipping was good.</li>
            <li>The hair is a beautiful color and is so smooth!</li>
            <li>I was very happy to get this so quick.</li>
            <li>Over all great buy buy, and very cheap too.</li>
            <li>The pigtails do get tangled and frizzy real easy</li>
            <li>Amazing and very fast shipping looks wonderful.</li>
            <li>It is a great product but it is so easy for the wig to get tangled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this was a nice wig</li>
            <li>it came on time which was nice</li>
            <li>the wig is so nice and</li>
            <li>Nice color and quality.</li>
            <li>When it first came it was perfect till I started touching it</li>
            <li>You could desing your own clips with a 12$ wig that is better material and looking.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a wonderful wig to own for a cosplayer into just such dress up.</li>
            <li>The color was absolutely perfect, just as shown in the picture, the pigtails were the prefect length, and it wasn&#x27;t heavy at all~ So comfortable~~!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing wig I give 5 stars but it tangles to easily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll defiantly be buying more wigs from here again.</li>
            <li>and I do recommend it. :)</li>
            <li>Would look and feel better and lst longer than this wig.</li>
            <li>Messed it up even more by combing it....</li>
            <li>If you want top quality, do not get this.</li>
            <li>and I will be getting more wigs from this seller.</li>
            <li>I suggest making sure the top is tightened otherwise</li>
            <li>I Would respectfully disagree.</li>
            <li>Warmcos customer service was fantastic!  </li>
            <li>, just make sure to keep it braided and always use a comb not a brush.</li>
            <li>This just came in today and as soon as I tried it on I was in love~~~~~~</li>
            <li>so the netting kept on showing it would look ok if u wore a hat with it</li>
            <li>I love this wig</li>
            <li>:)  Character: SasukKun Cosplayer: CrownedPersonas Photography: CrownedPersonas, Fatima</li>
            <li>Just have some patience while styling. :)</li>
            <li>This is an adorable wig.</li>
            <li>I love the pigtails.</li>
            <li>Most wigs when you get them needs to be cut and style to the way you want it to look.</li>
            <li>I loved that out was just the right color</li>
            <li>, this is a pretty good</li>
            <li>My package came with 2 wig caps too, which was super handy.</li>
            <li>Though this wig was a hassle to style, I still got so many compliments and was comfortable in it.</li>
            <li>So I would reccomend it to anybody who wants a wig at a good price and WON&#x27;T TANGLE IT BECAUSE ONCE YOU TANGLE IT</li>
            <li>Otherwise the wig itself was a great style, and the fibers were soft; Also easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>I do mind you that it tangles easily.</li>
            <li>so it falls out easily</li>
            <li>something easily found in a CVS or Walgreens-- and give both of those pigtails a thorough spray-down with the stuff.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t tangled at all (although it does get tangled easily...</li>
            <li>Pigtails tangle REALLY easily.</li>
            <li>It does tangle easily, but is easily managed.</li>
            <li>Does tangle easily, but I&#x27;ll use the oil sheen tip from somewhere in these reviews c:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to brush though.  </li>
            <li>They did tangle easily</li>
            <li>Pretty nice quality.</li>
            <li>ug hair is way to cheap and easy to knot</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll stay fine)</li>
            <li>If you have some experience with wigs, then this may work for you just fine.</li>
            <li>the color of the wig is exactly like you see it in the pictures,&lt;br /&gt;it fits great and is very comfortable!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it was fine for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap plastic</li>
            <li>A fantastic purchase all in all!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brush them out so that they&#x27;re smooth, and then leave them alone for 48 hours, or about 2 days.</li>
            <li>And the wig hits really comfortably, even the pigtails!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They were the perfect thickness and weren&#x27;t to heavy either.</li>
            <li>It also came with a nice wig cap which I really like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light aqua.</li>
            <li>The short wig is great, just like in the picture.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a free wig cap which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>Better to get a full Teal wig from china wait a month for it to come and just clip up the full wig.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The fibers were incredibly shiny and not realistic looking at all!</li>
            <li>The wig came quickly, with two wig caps, and in great condition, but for people saying the pigtails tangle easily (which they do) spray them with a little bit of fabric softener and brush through them, they wont tangle anymore, and since that problem is fixed easily, all cons are eliminated, great purchase, would do it again.</li>
            <li>The wig was good and everything, but as soon as I wore it for the first time one of the pigtails got really messed up</li>
            <li>It is of high quality, feels nice to the touch and is manageable.  </li>
            <li>though the pony tails tangle easy, this wig is defiantly worth what you payed for.</li>
            <li>I hope that ours was defective and considering the many positive reviews, I think that is likely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shipping on it was really fast and the wig overall is just beautiful.</li>
            <li>Although it looks like a bright baby blue in pictures, in real life it&#x27;s more of a darker teal.  </li>
            <li>Some also recommend fabric softener (which I have never tried) which is good for combing out tangled Barbie doll hair, and this is made of the same material as Barbie hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely true to the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this as a birthday present for a friend and he loved it.</li>
            <li>Then, brush them out one more time, and they&#x27;ll stay pretty much untangled while you&#x27;re wearing them at a con!</li>
            <li>The bangs are perfect if you push them off to the side, also, and the back is short</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the quality for such an affordable cost.</li>
            <li>it is so easy to brush and came fast.</li>
            <li>It got here in less then a week, fits perfectly, doesn&#x27;t itch, feels so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>When I got it, it was so well sealed up that I had trouble getting it out of the packaging, but when I put it on it was great.</li>
            <li>they are worth 100</li>
            <li>brushing so far is absolutely magical.</li>
            <li>Both pony clips are a nice thickness and around same length.</li>
            <li>It came with a wig cap which was pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I really like how soft this wig is and the length and amount of hair is really nice.</li>
            <li>real, aside from the bright, turquoise color, in other words, there&#x27;s no fake-looking &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; that you&#x27;d see on a cheap,  Halloween store wig.&lt;br</li>
            <li>super fast delivery and its freaking adoreable!</li>
            <li>All in all if you need a good Miku wig at a decent price or on short notice</li>
            <li>It got here right on time</li>
            <li>I had received this wig as a gift right before Christmas</li>
            <li>I tried it on right away</li>
            <li>most reviewers stated, it tangles easily, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s the perfect color, the main wig is nice and thick and made very well.</li>
            <li>Wigs are high maintenance, and this is just about the most high maintenance wig you can get.  </li>
            <li>But it was nice and smooth and a little frizzy.</li>
            <li>The hairs are very fine and soft and very vivid.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and silky, nearly tangle free, but sheds fairly easily.</li>
            <li>The fibers are SUPER SOFT!!!</li>
            <li>the wig was very nice except the clips that are supposed to hold on the pony tails just could not possibly attach properly to the wig.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that they tangle super easy.</li>
            <li>It is not for first time wig owners.</li>
            <li>and I never even wore this wig but for 5 mins to take pictures when I first got it.</li>
            <li>This is the first wig that came.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would fit a 5 year old.  </li>
            <li>It looks exactly like Miku&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>the one seems very fine, loved it, its long and the pony tails aren&#x27;t heavy</li>
            <li>Great product, but I order blues and green and only two green arrived so be aware, the cuality is 100% great for price.</li>
            <li>ok the first time it got extremely tangled (because it was my very first wig, i didn&#x27;t know how to take care of them)</li>
            <li>so the wig is pretty long, but that&#x27;s ok ^^&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>I would give this product three stars if it was not for the fact that the second wig I ordered to replace the first did not even come with the full set!</li>
            <li>The only problem is maintenance since it tangles easily.</li>
            <li>The wig will stay in great condition as long as you aren&#x27;t to rough with it.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s about it for the negative aspects of the wig, so that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a very high quality wig.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s ok though as i was wise and waited until it got here to purchase the complimenting fabric for my cosplay, with ponytails are a little heavy</li>
            <li>Hair tangles extremely fast, within minutes of messing with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much  longer  </li>
            <li>Overall it is great for such a low price.</li>
            <li>-Very</li>
            <li>The tails were a bit thin but they still looked great.</li>
            <li>I was hoping I could pass up as real hair</li>
            <li>However, I really like it.</li>
            <li>I went with this wig based on other reviews and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>but these wigs aren&#x27;t exactly ready to wear wigs if you want a particular look.</li>
            <li>I said above, the color is true to the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Every once in a while, take them out and give them a wash in the sink with baby shampoo, comb them out with conditioner until they are smooth, then let them air dry for about a week.  </li>
            <li>You have to be careful with the pony tails because it does tangle easy.</li>
            <li>The wig is decent for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>After using this wig 4 times, the clips stopped clipping to the wig cap, but i&#x27;m okay with it because i really only planned to use it 2 times ( Halloween , a party, and a convention, however i actually only used it for Halloween and a party )</li>
            <li>The pigtails were pretty decently made, but really the back of the main wig kills it.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more money and get something quality.</li>
            <li>The bace wig also good thickness, but is a little long on the sides in turms of the character Miku.</li>
            <li>The wig came in three parts and its much easier to maintain that my old wig.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love that the pony tails are detachable because they were extremely heavy.  </li>
            <li>photo below shows the inside of the MapofBeauty Miku wig on the left and another vendor&#x27;s Kaito&#x27;s wig on the right for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the bangs were super long, had to cut them.</li>
            <li>Color was nice, a little bit of shine but not too obvious like party wigs from Halloween stores.</li>
            <li>and so i had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>Tangles very easily and hard to brush out.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;ll make it more comfortable and less heavy.</li>
            <li>I received the wig earlier then expected , it fit well, defiantly wasn&#x27;t  made for a kid!</li>
            <li>They may be resistant to heated water, but don&#x27;t wash in hot water; and they are not durable enough to withstand a tumble in the washing machine.  </li>
            <li>My first one got tangled by the second time I wore it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soooo soft!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s really nifty is that the pigtails are clip ons, so you can remove them and use the main hair part to cosplay Mikuo(the male version of Miku).</li>
            <li>The hair is a nice color blue, but length of clips were not the same, one was about an inch longer than the other.</li>
            <li>heavy, the pony tails are easy to clip on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe worth half the price...gets tangled from just the air moving it, really shiny and</li>
            <li>but if you get a straightener and put it at the lowest setting possible it goes right back to normal.  </li>
            <li>They tangled really easily which was a major downside (one of them became a mess because of this).</li>
            <li>The thickness of the pig tails can very as well as the length of the actual wig.</li>
            <li>This wig was purchased in order too complete a Hatsune Miku costume.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to cosplay Miku or Mikou.</li>
            <li>and, although the pigtails aren&#x27;t as thick as in the picture (it makes me happy because their&#x27; heavy xD)</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come down very far in the back, which is fine for most people and will keep it pleasantly cool for others (hence the five stars), but my hair forms a dark &#x27;W&#x27; shape that takes up half my neck!</li>
            <li>The actual base was not frizzy or tangle and it fit nicely.</li>
            <li>And on top of that they are thin, unlike the picture -.-&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It does not fit any of the kids; whereas, the other 3 wigs fit all the kids.  </li>
            <li>The color looks almost exactly like the picture and the hair is not that heavy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously those crazy-long pigtails get pretty tangled, but if you want to keep from tangles in this and other long wigs, here&#x27;s a tip!</li>
            <li>Then buys another wig and add your own made clips to the wig all for 24$ the same price as this or just buy a teal wig use pony tails to make piggy tails and use the other 12$ to buy another long thick and realistic looking and feeling wig for half the price as this one.</li>

            <li> and they kept on tangling easily besides that everything was perfect!!</li>
            <li> (Of course it&#x27;s still a good idea to keep a comb around and brush it out every once in awhile.)</li>
            <li> but all you gotta do is take good care of it</li>
            <li> had problems but still loved it</li>
            <li> It fits well and the shipping was good.</li>
            <li> The hair is a beautiful color and is so smooth!</li>
            <li> I was very happy to get this so quick.</li>
            <li> Over all great buy buy, and very cheap too.</li>
            <li> The pigtails do get tangled and frizzy real easy</li>
            <li> Amazing and very fast shipping looks wonderful.</li>
            <li> It is a great product but it is so easy for the wig to get tangled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this was a nice wig</li>
            <li> it came on time which was nice</li>
            <li> the wig is so nice and</li>
            <li> Nice color and quality.</li>
            <li> When it first came it was perfect till I started touching it</li>
            <li> You could desing your own clips with a 12$ wig that is better material and looking.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s a wonderful wig to own for a cosplayer into just such dress up.</li>
            <li> The color was absolutely perfect, just as shown in the picture, the pigtails were the prefect length, and it wasn&#x27;t heavy at all~ So comfortable~~!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing wig I give 5 stars but it tangles to easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll defiantly be buying more wigs from here again.</li>
            <li> and I do recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> Would look and feel better and lst longer than this wig.</li>
            <li> Messed it up even more by combing it....</li>
            <li> If you want top quality, do not get this.</li>
            <li> and I will be getting more wigs from this seller.</li>
            <li> I suggest making sure the top is tightened otherwise</li>
            <li> I Would respectfully disagree.</li>
            <li> Warmcos customer service was fantastic!  </li>
            <li> , just make sure to keep it braided and always use a comb not a brush.</li>
            <li> This just came in today and as soon as I tried it on I was in love~~~~~~</li>
            <li> so the netting kept on showing it would look ok if u wore a hat with it</li>
            <li> I love this wig</li>
            <li> :)  Character: SasukKun Cosplayer: CrownedPersonas Photography: CrownedPersonas, Fatima</li>
            <li> Just have some patience while styling. :)</li>
            <li> This is an adorable wig.</li>
            <li> I love the pigtails.</li>
            <li> Most wigs when you get them needs to be cut and style to the way you want it to look.</li>
            <li> I loved that out was just the right color</li>
            <li> , this is a pretty good</li>
            <li> My package came with 2 wig caps too, which was super handy.</li>
            <li> Though this wig was a hassle to style, I still got so many compliments and was comfortable in it.</li>
            <li> So I would reccomend it to anybody who wants a wig at a good price and WON&#x27;T TANGLE IT BECAUSE ONCE YOU TANGLE IT</li>
            <li> Otherwise the wig itself was a great style, and the fibers were soft; Also easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> I do mind you that it tangles easily.</li>
            <li> so it falls out easily</li>
            <li> something easily found in a CVS or Walgreens-- and give both of those pigtails a thorough spray-down with the stuff.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t tangled at all (although it does get tangled easily...</li>
            <li> Pigtails tangle REALLY easily.</li>
            <li> It does tangle easily, but is easily managed.</li>
            <li> Does tangle easily, but I&#x27;ll use the oil sheen tip from somewhere in these reviews c:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to brush though.  </li>
            <li> They did tangle easily</li>
            <li> Pretty nice quality.</li>
            <li> ug hair is way to cheap and easy to knot</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll stay fine)</li>
            <li> If you have some experience with wigs, then this may work for you just fine.</li>
            <li> the color of the wig is exactly like you see it in the pictures,&lt;br /&gt;it fits great and is very comfortable!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was fine for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap plastic</li>
            <li> A fantastic purchase all in all!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brush them out so that they&#x27;re smooth, and then leave them alone for 48 hours, or about 2 days.</li>
            <li> And the wig hits really comfortably, even the pigtails!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They were the perfect thickness and weren&#x27;t to heavy either.</li>
            <li> It also came with a nice wig cap which I really like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light aqua.</li>
            <li> The short wig is great, just like in the picture.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a free wig cap which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> Better to get a full Teal wig from china wait a month for it to come and just clip up the full wig.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The fibers were incredibly shiny and not realistic looking at all!</li>
            <li> The wig came quickly, with two wig caps, and in great condition, but for people saying the pigtails tangle easily (which they do) spray them with a little bit of fabric softener and brush through them, they wont tangle anymore, and since that problem is fixed easily, all cons are eliminated, great purchase, would do it again.</li>
            <li> The wig was good and everything, but as soon as I wore it for the first time one of the pigtails got really messed up</li>
            <li> It is of high quality, feels nice to the touch and is manageable.  </li>
            <li> though the pony tails tangle easy, this wig is defiantly worth what you payed for.</li>
            <li> I hope that ours was defective and considering the many positive reviews, I think that is likely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shipping on it was really fast and the wig overall is just beautiful.</li>
            <li> Although it looks like a bright baby blue in pictures, in real life it&#x27;s more of a darker teal.  </li>
            <li> Some also recommend fabric softener (which I have never tried) which is good for combing out tangled Barbie doll hair, and this is made of the same material as Barbie hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely true to the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this as a birthday present for a friend and he loved it.</li>
            <li> Then, brush them out one more time, and they&#x27;ll stay pretty much untangled while you&#x27;re wearing them at a con!</li>
            <li> The bangs are perfect if you push them off to the side, also, and the back is short</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quality for such an affordable cost.</li>
            <li> it is so easy to brush and came fast.</li>
            <li> It got here in less then a week, fits perfectly, doesn&#x27;t itch, feels so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> When I got it, it was so well sealed up that I had trouble getting it out of the packaging, but when I put it on it was great.</li>
            <li> they are worth 100</li>
            <li> brushing so far is absolutely magical.</li>
            <li> Both pony clips are a nice thickness and around same length.</li>
            <li> It came with a wig cap which was pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I really like how soft this wig is and the length and amount of hair is really nice.</li>
            <li> real, aside from the bright, turquoise color, in other words, there&#x27;s no fake-looking &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; that you&#x27;d see on a cheap,  Halloween store wig.&lt;br</li>
            <li> super fast delivery and its freaking adoreable!</li>
            <li> All in all if you need a good Miku wig at a decent price or on short notice</li>
            <li> It got here right on time</li>
            <li> I had received this wig as a gift right before Christmas</li>
            <li> I tried it on right away</li>
            <li> most reviewers stated, it tangles easily, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s the perfect color, the main wig is nice and thick and made very well.</li>
            <li> Wigs are high maintenance, and this is just about the most high maintenance wig you can get.  </li>
            <li> But it was nice and smooth and a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> The hairs are very fine and soft and very vivid.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft and silky, nearly tangle free, but sheds fairly easily.</li>
            <li> The fibers are SUPER SOFT!!!</li>
            <li> the wig was very nice except the clips that are supposed to hold on the pony tails just could not possibly attach properly to the wig.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that they tangle super easy.</li>
            <li> It is not for first time wig owners.</li>
            <li> and I never even wore this wig but for 5 mins to take pictures when I first got it.</li>
            <li> This is the first wig that came.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would fit a 5 year old.  </li>
            <li> It looks exactly like Miku&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> the one seems very fine, loved it, its long and the pony tails aren&#x27;t heavy</li>
            <li> Great product, but I order blues and green and only two green arrived so be aware, the cuality is 100% great for price.</li>
            <li> ok the first time it got extremely tangled (because it was my very first wig, i didn&#x27;t know how to take care of them)</li>
            <li> so the wig is pretty long, but that&#x27;s ok ^^&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I would give this product three stars if it was not for the fact that the second wig I ordered to replace the first did not even come with the full set!</li>
            <li> The only problem is maintenance since it tangles easily.</li>
            <li> The wig will stay in great condition as long as you aren&#x27;t to rough with it.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s about it for the negative aspects of the wig, so that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a very high quality wig.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s ok though as i was wise and waited until it got here to purchase the complimenting fabric for my cosplay, with ponytails are a little heavy</li>
            <li> Hair tangles extremely fast, within minutes of messing with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much  longer  </li>
            <li> Overall it is great for such a low price.</li>
            <li> -Very</li>
            <li> The tails were a bit thin but they still looked great.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I could pass up as real hair</li>
            <li> However, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I went with this wig based on other reviews and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> but these wigs aren&#x27;t exactly ready to wear wigs if you want a particular look.</li>
            <li> I said above, the color is true to the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Every once in a while, take them out and give them a wash in the sink with baby shampoo, comb them out with conditioner until they are smooth, then let them air dry for about a week.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful with the pony tails because it does tangle easy.</li>
            <li> The wig is decent for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> After using this wig 4 times, the clips stopped clipping to the wig cap, but i&#x27;m okay with it because i really only planned to use it 2 times ( Halloween , a party, and a convention, however i actually only used it for Halloween and a party )</li>
            <li> The pigtails were pretty decently made, but really the back of the main wig kills it.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more money and get something quality.</li>
            <li> The bace wig also good thickness, but is a little long on the sides in turms of the character Miku.</li>
            <li> The wig came in three parts and its much easier to maintain that my old wig.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love that the pony tails are detachable because they were extremely heavy.  </li>
            <li> photo below shows the inside of the MapofBeauty Miku wig on the left and another vendor&#x27;s Kaito&#x27;s wig on the right for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the bangs were super long, had to cut them.</li>
            <li> Color was nice, a little bit of shine but not too obvious like party wigs from Halloween stores.</li>
            <li> and so i had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Tangles very easily and hard to brush out.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;ll make it more comfortable and less heavy.</li>
            <li> I received the wig earlier then expected , it fit well, defiantly wasn&#x27;t  made for a kid!</li>
            <li> They may be resistant to heated water, but don&#x27;t wash in hot water; and they are not durable enough to withstand a tumble in the washing machine.  </li>
            <li> My first one got tangled by the second time I wore it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soooo soft!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s really nifty is that the pigtails are clip ons, so you can remove them and use the main hair part to cosplay Mikuo(the male version of Miku).</li>
            <li> The hair is a nice color blue, but length of clips were not the same, one was about an inch longer than the other.</li>
            <li> heavy, the pony tails are easy to clip on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe worth half the price...gets tangled from just the air moving it, really shiny and</li>
            <li> but if you get a straightener and put it at the lowest setting possible it goes right back to normal.  </li>
            <li> They tangled really easily which was a major downside (one of them became a mess because of this).</li>
            <li> The thickness of the pig tails can very as well as the length of the actual wig.</li>
            <li> This wig was purchased in order too complete a Hatsune Miku costume.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to cosplay Miku or Mikou.</li>
            <li> and, although the pigtails aren&#x27;t as thick as in the picture (it makes me happy because their&#x27; heavy xD)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come down very far in the back, which is fine for most people and will keep it pleasantly cool for others (hence the five stars), but my hair forms a dark &#x27;W&#x27; shape that takes up half my neck!</li>
            <li> The actual base was not frizzy or tangle and it fit nicely.</li>
            <li> And on top of that they are thin, unlike the picture -.-&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It does not fit any of the kids; whereas, the other 3 wigs fit all the kids.  </li>
            <li> The color looks almost exactly like the picture and the hair is not that heavy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously those crazy-long pigtails get pretty tangled, but if you want to keep from tangles in this and other long wigs, here&#x27;s a tip!</li>
            <li> Then buys another wig and add your own made clips to the wig all for 24$ the same price as this or just buy a teal wig use pony tails to make piggy tails and use the other 12$ to buy another long thick and realistic looking and feeling wig for half the price as this one.</li>
            <li> This is very blue, I love the color and the base wig is thick and nice.</li>
            <li> and you end up with blue hair strands all over the house and clogging up the vacuum.</li>
            <li> I got this wig as a gift and the base is cute, however, the mesh cap on the inside to hold the structure of the wig prevents me from clamping the pigtails in!!</li>
            <li> I think some people had trouble clipping the pigtails onto the main wig</li>
            <li> Some words of caution: if you are an inexperienced cosplayer (and that means that those who have never had a wig before), this wig is HIGH MAINTENANCE due to the length of the ponytails.  </li>
            <li> The color I orderd was green and secound blue but only arrived two green hair wigs so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> It is really easy to tangle up and it looks really fake .</li>
            <li> If you want them to dry quicker than a 4-5 day air dry, mount it next to a fan or use your hair dryer set to the cool/cold air setting, otherwise the heat from the blow dryer will melt the hair.  </li>
            <li> The ponytails where a little too long for my 12 year old daughter</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the wig 5 minutes out of the box the pigtails got tangle to no return not even repairable and the main part in the back was really thin and barely even hair</li>
            <li> It makes since because it is extremely long.</li>
            <li> long pig-tails&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-bangs are long</li>
            <li> I sprayed it with hair oil sheen to prevent tangling of the long lengths.</li>
            <li> It got tangled a lot, but then again the tails are 3 feet long...</li>
            <li> This wig does not have the same depth or elasticity as the three wigs purchased from other vendors on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Other than that, definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> It is very long.</li>
            <li> and it is still VERY long.</li>
            <li> the pony tails were way to heavy and there was not enough hair on the wig for the clips to grab enough to hold.</li>
            <li> Now, you have to be careful handling the ponytails because of how long they are.</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected since they are so long.</li>
            <li> After it became hopelessly tangled and no amount of combing out possibly get the mess of knots out, I bought this one.  </li>
            <li> I think the ponytails could have been a little easier to attach or maybe the clips could have been smaller?</li>
            <li> Usually these things are a hit and miss since sometimes they&#x27;re not made the same due to possible manufacturing errors.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a wigstand, carefully roll up the ponytails into balls and keep them in a bag.  </li>
            <li> As expected for price.</li>
            <li> wig does not fit any of my children ages 9, 11, 13, and 15...including two boys (9, and 13) that have very short hair.</li>
            <li> This was partially my fault, however.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected with a wig of this length</li>
            <li> DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES think that you can throw it in a box with your other costume stuff then pull it out for a costume party the day of.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, i would recommend this wig to any cosplayer out there in need of a Miku wig.</li>
            <li> but other than that it was crappy (￣^￣)ゞ</li>
            <li> If it gets to that point I usually hang it up somewhere then split it into sections and comb it starting from the bottom.</li>
            <li> so I was expected at least around the same quality on my item.</li>
            <li> so I expected it to be a bit of a mess.</li>
            <li> Really not worth getting a refund.</li>
            <li> It was not fun...</li>
            <li> It was a little tangles and did tangle easily due to length.</li>
            <li> I had it in a few weeks when it got extremely tangled.</li>
            <li> Their heads are all measured at less than 21&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> it was a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> I hope that helps some of the people who were saying how badly this wig knots up! :)</li>
            <li> I  was a little worried that it would be tangled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a clip on wig before, so I was a little nervous.</li>
            <li> But nothing a little trim can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> but it was a little greener than i was expecting</li>
            <li> Got this for my little sister&#x27;s birthday.</li>
            <li> The side hair pieces are veyr heavy and don&#x27;t seem to grip that well...</li>
            <li> If you expect your kid to tare it up within a few days, then get this.</li>
            <li> The wig is extremely thin in the back, the netting shows no matter how I move the hairs around.</li>
            <li> The clips wouldn&#x27;t stay on the wig at all since there&#x27;s nothing there for them to grab onto, plus they&#x27;re heavy, so I ended up clipping it to the headband.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my money and space.</li>
            <li> I also had a hard time just trying to keep it maintained for the few hours I wore it.</li>
            <li> The clips with the hair on it is thin and not as thick or much hair as shown on the pictures and the hair has a fake look to it.</li>
            <li> The color and length are dead on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and the wig reaches all the way past my knees.</li>
            <li> Worst wig you can buy, Halloween store wigs are better quality than this.</li>
            <li> you go to clip on the pig tails, tie up small pigtails on the base wig first.</li>
            <li> I have a few long wigs and these tangled the worst, by far!</li>
            <li> The weight on it sucks though.</li>

            <li> no it has the fake wig shine and its impossible to keep it straight</li>
            <li> at least is a bit thin (if you want a thick wig then maybe not get this</li>
            <li> The pig tails where too heavy for the main base wig (which was VERY thin) to hold onto, the packaging they used leaves you with two knotted-beyond-repair pig tails.</li>
            <li> The second one didn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> The wig is a bit thin sadly (at least it is for me) but its nothing you cant work around.</li>
            <li> Small amount of thin hair, thus it does not cover the cap!</li>

            <li> I had bought another cosplay wig similar to this one from EBay.  After it became hopelessly tangled and no amount of combing out possibly get the mess of knots out, I bought this one.  It is of high quality, feels nice to the touch and is manageable.  Some words of caution: if you are an inexperienced cosplayer (and that means that those who have never had a wig before), this wig is HIGH MAINTENANCE due to the length of the ponytails.  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES think that you can throw it in a box with your other costume stuff then pull it out for a costume party the day of.  If you don&#x27;t have a wigstand, carefully roll up the ponytails into balls and keep them in a bag.  Every once in a while, take them out and give them a wash in the sink with baby shampoo, comb them out with conditioner until they are smooth, then let them air dry for about a week.  Some also recommend fabric softener (which I have never tried) which is good for combing out tangled Barbie doll hair, and this is made of the same material as Barbie hair.  This is a heat resistant wig, but that applies to the temperature of the water you wash them in.  They may be resistant to heated water, but don&#x27;t wash in hot water; and they are not durable enough to withstand a tumble in the washing machine.  If you want them to dry quicker than a 4-5 day air dry, mount it next to a fan or use your hair dryer set to the cool/cold air setting, otherwise the heat from the blow dryer will melt the hair.  Wigs are high maintenance, and this is just about the most high maintenance wig you can get.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a wonderful wig to own for a cosplayer into just such dress up.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a very high quality wig. I do mind you that it tangles easily. It makes since because it is extremely long. It goes to my knees. It is not for first time wig owners. My first one got tangled by the second time I wore it. The second one didn&#x27;t as bad. It was an easier fix. The thickness of the pig tails can very as well as the length of the actual wig. The clips show through big time, but it won&#x27;t be a problem if you use bows or Miku&#x27;s hair… things…</li>
            <li> Disappointed due to the lack of quality. I order from here last time so I was expected at least around the same quality on my item. The wig came damaged and thinner than the last one. Really not worth getting a refund.</li>
            <li> Maybe worth half the price...gets tangled from just the air moving it, really shiny and the bangs were super long, had to cut them. The side hair pieces are veyr heavy and don&#x27;t seem to grip that well...</li>
            <li> It got here in less then a week, fits perfectly, doesn&#x27;t itch, feels so soft and silky. I can even straighten it and curl it with my straightener. I&#x27;m 4&amp;#34;9 so the wig is pretty long, but that&#x27;s ok ^^&lt;br /&gt;Even though the pony tails tangle easy, this wig is defiantly worth what you payed for. Great purchase! I&#x27;ll defiantly be buying more wigs from here again.</li>
            <li> What I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;-super long pig-tails&lt;br /&gt;-bright colors&lt;br /&gt;-bangs are long&lt;br /&gt;-pig-tails can come off&lt;br /&gt;-didn&#x27;t come knotted up when delivered&lt;br /&gt;-packaged nicely&lt;br /&gt;-easy to get out of the box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;-the back of the wig was a bit short&lt;br /&gt;-the bangs are weird (parting the bangs)&lt;br /&gt;-the pig tails aren&#x27;t as thick as the picture showed&lt;br /&gt;-no wig cap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a nice wig and I do recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quality for the price, the pigtails are a liiiittle bit thin but I think it&#x27;ll make it more comfortable and less heavy. This is very blue, I love the color and the base wig is thick and nice. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come down very far in the back, which is fine for most people and will keep it pleasantly cool for others (hence the five stars), but my hair forms a dark &#x27;W&#x27; shape that takes up half my neck! With some powdering and styling it&#x27;ll look righteous though. It&#x27;s a great steal!</li>
            <li> The wig came quickly, with two wig caps, and in great condition, but for people saying the pigtails tangle easily (which they do) spray them with a little bit of fabric softener and brush through them, they wont tangle anymore, and since that problem is fixed easily, all cons are eliminated, great purchase, would do it again.</li>
            <li> ug hair is way to cheap and easy to knot but then the knots do not come out it with the best wig products you can buy. Way over priced and the clips are not sturdy and when clipping onto wig which it really short short hair, it brings the wig off your head unless your constantly re adjusting it. The clips with the hair on it is thin and not as thick or much hair as shown on the pictures and the hair has a fake look to it. Better to get a full Teal wig from china wait a month for it to come and just clip up the full wig.Would look and feel better and lst longer than this wig. One clip got so tangles just from falling that i had to throw it out and I never even wore this wig but for 5 mins to take pictures when I first got it. I think going out with this wig on would not work at all. You could desing your own clips with a 12$ wig that is better material and looking. Then buys another wig and add your own made clips to the wig all for 24$ the same price as this or just buy a teal wig use pony tails to make piggy tails and use the other 12$ to buy another long thick and realistic looking and feeling wig for half the price as this one. Just look up wigs here on amazon and see the ones that are from china that go for 15$ they are worth 100$ i swear.</li>
            <li> The wig arrived with one of the ponytail tangled.......Messed it up even more by combing it....</li>
            <li> As expected for price. Hair tangles extremely fast, within minutes of messing with it. It&#x27;s cheap plastic so it falls out easily and you end up with blue hair strands all over the house and clogging up the vacuum. However, what fake Halloween hair doesn&#x27;t? If you want top quality, do not get this. If you expect your kid to tare it up within a few days, then get this.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a day now and I love it!! It was a little tangles and did tangle easily due to length. It&#x27;s much  longer  than thought Im  5&#x27;6 and it goes almost to my feet!! I would suggest braiding it.</li>
            <li> Excellent as description!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it. Keep it braided when not in use. Tangles very easily and hard to brush out.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 wigs for a Vocaloid cosplay party for my kids ages 9, 11, 13, and 15. This is the first wig that came.  It does not fit any of the kids; whereas, the other 3 wigs fit all the kids.  This wig does not have the same depth or elasticity as the three wigs purchased from other vendors on Amazon. It does not have the elastic on the inside of the crown that would allow it to stretch.  I don&#x27;t think it would fit a 5 year old.  I hope that ours was defective and considering the many positive reviews, I think that is likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photo below shows the inside of the MapofBeauty Miku wig on the left and another vendor&#x27;s Kaito&#x27;s wig on the right for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;The color is spot on for Miku.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived promptly and in separate netting to keep the 3 pieces separate.&lt;br /&gt;While heavy, the pony tails are easy to clip on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The wig does not fit any of my children ages 9, 11, 13, and 15...including two boys (9, and 13) that have very short hair. Their heads are all measured at less than 21&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Like most reviewers stated, it tangles easily, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> The color and length are dead on! The only problem is maintenance since it tangles easily. Other than that, definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this wig for my Matryoshka!Miku cosplay. It got here right on time and it&#x27;s soooo soft! Came unstyled, which allows me to trim and style it to my liking. A fantastic purchase all in all!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously those crazy-long pigtails get pretty tangled, but if you want to keep from tangles in this and other long wigs, here&#x27;s a tip! Get yourself some oil sheen spray-- something easily found in a CVS or Walgreens-- and give both of those pigtails a thorough spray-down with the stuff. Brush them out so that they&#x27;re smooth, and then leave them alone for 48 hours, or about 2 days. Then, brush them out one more time, and they&#x27;ll stay pretty much untangled while you&#x27;re wearing them at a con! (Of course it&#x27;s still a good idea to keep a comb around and brush it out every once in awhile.) I hope that helps some of the people who were saying how badly this wig knots up! :)</li>
            <li> It is a great product but it is so easy for the wig to get tangled. I had it in a few weeks when it got extremely tangled. Overall it is great for such a low price. I was just disappointed to find the difficulty it was to deal with it.</li>
            <li> the pony tails were tangled.</li>
            <li> I got this wig a/two week/s earlier than I was suppose to and it&#x27;s gorgeous! It wasn&#x27;t tangled at all (although it does get tangled easily... but all you gotta do is take good care of it and it&#x27;ll stay fine) and, although the pigtails aren&#x27;t as thick as in the picture (it makes me happy because their&#x27; heavy xD) their really nice and detachable!! The hair is a beautiful color and is so smooth! The bangs are perfect if you push them off to the side, also, and the back is short but it&#x27;s suppose to be like that c: It&#x27;s so nice, I love it!!! I even got a wig cap! :D And the wig hits really comfortably, even the pigtails!&lt;br /&gt;I loooove it!!!</li>
            <li> had problems but still loved it</li>
            <li> The ponytails where a little too long for my 12 year old daughter and they kept on tangling easily besides that everything was perfect!!</li>
            <li> Great product, but I order blues and green and only two green arrived so be aware, the cuality is 100% great for price. The color I orderd was green and secound blue but only arrived two green hair wigs so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> Amazing and very fast shipping looks wonderful. The wig came in three parts and its much easier to maintain that my old wig. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I  was a little worried that it would be tangled. But it was nice and smooth and a little frizzy. You have to be careful with the pony tails because it does tangle easy. The actual base was not frizzy or tangle and it fit nicely. I have big curly hair so it was a struggle to get it on, but the base is adjustable  witch helped. I&#x27;m happy with it and I will be getting more wigs from this seller.</li>
            <li> The wig was good and everything, but as soon as I wore it for the first time one of the pigtails got really messed up</li>
            <li> This is one of the best wigs I own. It&#x27;s definitely true to the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: -Very thick, the netting isn&#x27;t visible at all, usually.&lt;br /&gt;  -Looks real, aside from the bright, turquoise color, in other words, there&#x27;s no fake-looking &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; that you&#x27;d see on a cheap,  Halloween store wig.&lt;br /&gt;  -It fits well, and also has straps to adjust the size.&lt;br /&gt;  -As I said above, the color is true to the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: -The Pigtails tangle REALLY easily. It got to the point where I&#x27;d just brush em out, aggressively. This caused a lot of shedding. This was partially my fault, however.&lt;br /&gt;  I guess that&#x27;s about it for the negative aspects of the wig, so that&#x27;s pretty good. This was one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. Great product.</li>
            <li> I went with this wig based on other reviews and am glad I did. The quality was pretty good and the color is excellent - just perfect for my Hatsune Miku cosplay. The tails were a bit thin but they still looked great. The only problem is that they tangle super easy. I have a few long wigs and these tangled the worst, by far! I suggest making sure the top is tightened otherwise the tails will make it shift with their weight (I had this problem as well as my hair showing at the bottom - tightened it and everything was perfect). My package came with 2 wig caps too, which was super handy.</li>
            <li> My kid loves it but the quality wasn&#x27;t the best</li>
            <li> ok the first time it got extremely tangled (because it was my very first wig, i didn&#x27;t know how to take care of them) and so i had to buy a new one. the one seems very fine, loved it, its long and the pony tails aren&#x27;t heavy</li>
            <li> I had received this wig as a gift right before Christmas and I have no complaints with it! The shipping on it was really fast and the wig overall is just beautiful. Now, you have to be careful handling the ponytails because of how long they are. (me being 5&#x27;2 the came to about where my knees are). Other than that, i would recommend this wig to any cosplayer out there in need of a Miku wig.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing wig I give 5 stars but it tangles to easily</li>
            <li> I got this wig on time. The hair is a nice color blue, but length of clips were not the same, one was about an inch longer than the other. Otherwise the wig itself was a great style, and the fibers were soft; Also easy to comb through. Over all great buy buy, and very cheap too.</li>
            <li> I bought two wigs from them, and the wigs themselves were not too bad. They tangled really easily which was a major downside (one of them became a mess because of this). I would give this product three stars if it was not for the fact that the second wig I ordered to replace the first did not even come with the full set! I only got the ponytails, which is rendered useless without the base wig. I posted a question regarding this, and saw that they removed my question! I am planning on contacting Amazon about this. I am very disappointed by these turn of events. You have been warned.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy! It arrived on time. It does tangle easily, but is easily managed. The wig will stay in great condition as long as you aren&#x27;t to rough with it. The color is spot on for a Hatsune Miku cosplay! I was very pleased with the quality for such an affordable cost. Before buying this product I reviewed the reviews and a lot of people said that the ponytail clip ons were way to thin. I Would respectfully disagree. They were the perfect thickness and weren&#x27;t to heavy either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a clip on wig before, so I was a little nervous. When I got it, it was so well sealed up that I had trouble getting it out of the packaging, but when I put it on it was great. Does tangle easily, but I&#x27;ll use the oil sheen tip from somewhere in these reviews c:</li>
            <li> The wig is decent for the price you pay. The wig is a bit thin sadly (at least it is for me) but its nothing you cant work around. The fibers are SUPER SOFT!!! brushing so far is absolutely magical. It arrived on time with no issues. All in all if you need a good Miku wig at a decent price or on short notice, this is a pretty good buy.&lt;br /&gt;  Pros:&lt;br /&gt;~super soft&lt;br /&gt;~easy to work with&lt;br /&gt;~punctual shipping&lt;br /&gt;~decently priced&lt;br /&gt;  Cons:&lt;br /&gt;~mine at least is a bit thin (if you want a thick wig then maybe not get this one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just a tip:&lt;br /&gt;When you go to clip on the pig tails, tie up small pigtails on the base wig first. This way the clips have something to grab onto.</li>
            <li> IGNORE EVERY SINGLE REVIEW THAT SAYS IT&#x27;S A BAD WIG BECAUSE IT GOT TANGLED NO.NO.NO IF YOU MOVE A WIG OF THIS LENGTH DRAMATICALLY ( run a lot, whip your head a lot ) IT WILL GET TANGLED NO MATTER WHAT BRAND NO MATTER WHAT COLOR. After using this wig 4 times, the clips stopped clipping to the wig cap, but i&#x27;m okay with it because i really only planned to use it 2 times ( Halloween , a party, and a convention, however i actually only used it for Halloween and a party ) So I would reccomend it to anybody who wants a wig at a good price and WON&#x27;T TANGLE IT BECAUSE ONCE YOU TANGLE IT, YOU CAN NEVER EVER GO BACK.8/10 review</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig for a cosplay and I was extremely disappointed. The wig was thin, and the pigtails were thin too. I guess you get what you pay for! The fibers were incredibly shiny and not realistic looking at all! Spend a little more money and get something quality.</li>
            <li> wonderful wig!!!!  Warmcos customer service was fantastic!  The wig is beautiful and the seller was so helpful!  Thank you!!!!!</li>
            <li> the wig was very nice except the clips that are supposed to hold on the pony tails just could not possibly attach properly to the wig.  the pony tails were way to heavy and there was not enough hair on the wig for the clips to grab enough to hold.</li>
            <li> Daughter likes her cosplay wig, but the pigtails are a bit difficult to maintain.</li>
            <li> The wig is extremely thin in the back, the netting shows no matter how I move the hairs around. The pigtails were pretty decently made, but really the back of the main wig kills it. I&#x27;ll try to move the hairs around again, but it probably won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It fits well and the shipping was good. It also came with a nice wig cap which I really like. I was so happy when it was shipped. I tried it on right away and it was the perfect length for me! :D</li>
            <li> Wonderful wig! I received the wig earlier then expected , it fit well, defiantly wasn&#x27;t  made for a kid! Color is perfect for the cosplay of Hatsune Miku I was doing. It&#x27;s a light aqua. The picture did show it darker from my screen, but it&#x27;s a beautiful color. Both pony clips are a nice thickness and around same length. The bace wig also good thickness, but is a little long on the sides in turms of the character Miku. But nothing a little trim can&#x27;t fix. Yes the wigs pony tails do tangle but that is to be expected with a wig of this length, just make sure to keep it braided and always use a comb not a brush.</li>
            <li> This just came in today and as soon as I tried it on I was in love~~~~~~ The color was absolutely perfect, just as shown in the picture, the pigtails were the prefect length, and it wasn&#x27;t heavy at all~ So comfortable~~!!! It came with a wig cap which was pretty cool. The pigtails do get tangled and frizzy real easy but that is to be expected since they are so long. All in all it was perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the wig 5 minutes out of the box the pigtails got tangle to no return not even repairable and the main part in the back was really thin and barely even hair so the netting kept on showing it would look ok if u wore a hat with it but other than that it was crappy (￣^￣)ゞ</li>
            <li> I love this wig it is so easy to brush and came fast.The color looks almost exactly like the picture and the hair is not that heavy so I am happpy about that.</li>
            <li> The short wig is great, just like in the picture. But the ponytails tangle like crazy and frizz up after one brush through them. I&#x27;ve had it for a day and it&#x27;s already wrecked. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> it came on time which was nice but it was a little greener than i was expecting, that&#x27;s ok though as i was wise and waited until it got here to purchase the complimenting fabric for my cosplay, with ponytails are a little heavy but i&#x27;ll adjust over all great quality very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I got this wig as a gift and the base is cute, however, the mesh cap on the inside to hold the structure of the wig prevents me from clamping the pigtails in!! And on top of that they are thin, unlike the picture -.-&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t return this thing but I wish I could. I will have to go in and cut the cap and replace the terrible, bulky clips that the pigtails are attached to. Thank god I never bought it and I don&#x27;t see anyone else having this issue so what the hell?!</li>
            <li> It is very long. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; and the wig reaches all the way past my knees. When it first came it was perfect till I started touching it and it got a bit tangled. It&#x27;s really easy to brush though.  Brush often though! Because if you leave it unbrushed after wearing it for a while, it gets tangled to the point where it takes up to 4 hours to just brush it. It was not fun... If it gets to that point I usually hang it up somewhere then split it into sections and comb it starting from the bottom. it will frizz and feel disgusting but if you get a straightener and put it at the lowest setting possible it goes right back to normal.  The hairs are very fine and soft and very vivid. Although it looks like a bright baby blue in pictures, in real life it&#x27;s more of a darker teal.  The clips wouldn&#x27;t stay on the wig at all since there&#x27;s nothing there for them to grab onto, plus they&#x27;re heavy, so I ended up clipping it to the headband.  I cut the wig all the time and it is still VERY long. :)  Character: SasukKun Cosplayer: CrownedPersonas Photography: CrownedPersonas, Fatima</li>
            <li> This wig was purchased in order too complete a Hatsune Miku costume.  I loved that out was just the right color and it had a LOT of hair, but I didn&#x27;t love that the pony tails are detachable because they were extremely heavy.  I&#x27;m a novice to wigs, though.  If you have some experience with wigs, then this may work for you just fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect for cosplay. Netting doesn&#x27;t show. Pony tails attach well. I sprayed it with hair oil sheen to prevent tangling of the long lengths. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to get this so quick. I think the ponytails could have been a little easier to attach or maybe the clips could have been smaller? I also had a hard time just trying to keep it maintained for the few hours I wore it. It got tangled a lot, but then again the tails are 3 feet long...so I expected it to be a bit of a mess. Overall, it&#x27;s the perfect color, the main wig is nice and thick and made very well.</li>
            <li> It is really easy to tangle up and it looks really fake . I was hoping I could pass up as real hair no it has the fake wig shine and its impossible to keep it straight</li>
            <li> Though this wig was a hassle to style, I still got so many compliments and was comfortable in it. It looked perfect with my Miku cosplay and I definitely recommend it. Just have some patience while styling. :)</li>
            <li> This is an adorable wig. I love the pigtails. But the main part of the wig is terrible! Small amount of thin hair, thus it does not cover the cap! It&#x27;s almost see through. And there&#x27;s supposed to be some bang-like part but I could not find it!! If I were to buy a product like this again, it would only be for the pigtails. They&#x27;re very soft and silky, nearly tangle free, but sheds fairly easily. I don&#x27;t recommend this wig unless you have a use for the pigtails!</li>
            <li> Got this for my little sister&#x27;s birthday. 5 mins after it was out the box it was a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful. Went great with my costume. They did tangle easily but I figured I was never gonna dress up like Miku again so I just let it happen. The weight on it sucks though.</li>
            <li> Worst wig you can buy, Halloween store wigs are better quality than this. The pig tails where too heavy for the main base wig (which was VERY thin) to hold onto, the packaging they used leaves you with two knotted-beyond-repair pig tails. Waste of my money and space. Poor miku doesn&#x27;t deserve having hair this crappy</li>
            <li> super fast delivery and its freaking adoreable! perfect wig.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the hair! It is a bit difficult to brush out after cosplay. It just takes a bit of time and patience.</li>
            <li> the wig is so nice and soft!!&lt;br /&gt;and the color of the wig is exactly like you see it in the pictures,&lt;br /&gt;it fits great and is very comfortable!&lt;br /&gt;Im really happy with this purchase,&lt;br /&gt;and i recommend this to anyone who is looking for an affordable miku wig.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice quality. I was worried about how thin it was when I was reading the reviews. Usually these things are a hit and miss since sometimes they&#x27;re not made the same due to possible manufacturing errors. However, I really like it. Nice color and quality. Most wigs when you get them needs to be cut and style to the way you want it to look. I&#x27;ve seen people complain about bangs and stuff but these wigs aren&#x27;t exactly ready to wear wigs if you want a particular look. They do need some styling. I really like how soft this wig is and the length and amount of hair is really nice. I might be too short so I will give the pigtails a trim. I think some people had trouble clipping the pigtails onto the main wig but it was fine for me. Color was nice, a little bit of shine but not too obvious like party wigs from Halloween stores. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this as a birthday present for a friend and he loved it. It looks exactly like Miku&#x27;s hair. What&#x27;s really nifty is that the pigtails are clip ons, so you can remove them and use the main hair part to cosplay Mikuo(the male version of Miku). It also comes with a free wig cap which is always a plus. I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to cosplay Miku or Mikou.</li>
