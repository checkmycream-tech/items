            <li>WORKS GREAT!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The tweezers work great!  </li>
            <li>but I do have to say it did a great job at removing the hair!  </li>
            <li>Not the best, but I didn&#x27;t buy this for the brush.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend these items with no qualms.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>This is the best.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!!</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li>I have been using Epilady products for over 25 years and up until now I have loved them!</li>
            <li>What a difference, it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>Works great on the face as well.</li>
            <li>Does a great job.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy to no longer use a razor.  </li>
            <li>The legend 4th generation is great.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t begin to tell you how happy I am.</li>
            <li>Still it is a great improvement on previuos epilady models.  </li>
            <li>It works beautifully and effectively.</li>
            <li>Good quality for the money.  </li>
            <li>The Coil Tweezer sounded like it might be good too, so I bought the package deal.</li>
            <li>This one is good</li>
            <li>and it is good for nothing ,the machine it self is fair  </li>
            <li>And the price is good.</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>The Epilady is 100% better!  </li>
            <li>Legs look good - but don&#x27;t FEEL good, like that nice smooth feeling with shaving.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an epilator of one kind or another for 25 years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay - removes hair fairly well if you keep at it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li>This is a nicely constructed device.  </li>
            <li>As a man honestly I wanted the tweezers for nose and ear hairs but discovered that it wasn&#x27;t much more to get the kit that includes both items.  </li>
            <li>I have seen this product advertised for years &amp; assumed it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>And it can be very precise.</li>
            <li>This device could be used corded or cordless, which I liked and did a good job of pulling out the hairs, however after the first use (and fully charging it as recommended in the instructions), the device would not power on.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s ok since I&#x27;m not in tank tops, but come summer</li>
            <li>Love the concept...love the convenience.  </li>
            <li>But then again - it does take a while to grow back, which is great!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I have always waxed but was recommended this andi  am pleased.  </li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with my purchase of the Epilady Epilator.</li>
            <li>I love the results.</li>
            <li>Epilady, I love.</li>
            <li>I am trying it one more tme.  </li>
            <li>I followed directions and charged it for many more than the recommended hours</li>
            <li>So many times I shell out monney on a mechanical beauty product and</li>
            <li>My review is more for the coil tweezers than the epilady itself.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s reassuring to know that I&#x27;ve found a tool that will let me stay on top of that.  </li>
            <li>Epilady Hair Remover is ok, is not for heavy-duty</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>They do keep getting better each time I use it</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work out for me at all</li>
            <li>I am so glad I saw the ad on Amazon and did not miss it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much more for now.  </li>
            <li>I love the epilady legend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bikini Area: again, just didn&#x27;t pull out more than 1/3 of the hair from this</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I was able to get the underarms and legs done in no time.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to give the product some time so that I would like it better</li>
            <li>and I decided to give it a try even though My first is in good condition.</li>
            <li>I was one of the first to buy the original Epilady 25 years ago, which I used and loved ever since.</li>
            <li>The seller was very quick in sending my order</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>The guide is easy to snap on and off.  </li>
            <li>Works well and easy to use</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so easy,</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and all.....</li>
            <li>Easy to use, travel with &amp; store.</li>
            <li>Fast service, received product in good condition, and smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coil tweezer worked okay on the peach-fuzz type hairs, but it was much too time consuming (and the risk of permanently scarring your face by getting it caught in between the coils was too great) for it to be of any real use.</li>
            <li>, it works fine</li>
            <li>This product does a fine job of eliminating any hair on the legs.</li>
            <li>She plans on giving it another go in about a month or so as she was very happy with how that half leg turned out..</li>
            <li>It is so light and easy to carry.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate the free items.  </li>
            <li>I used a Finally Free electronic tweezer for years, and it did help, but it was so tedius taht</li>
            <li>Then, when I got my laser hair removal sessions, I tossed the Finally Free in the trash, thinking I would never use it again.</li>
            <li>Enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>I figured my gf might enjoy the epilady unit</li>
            <li>It pulls out the hair from the follicles and my legs and underarms are hair free for weeks.</li>
            <li>this worth the money you pay for it and in my opinion is better option than shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I finally bought one.</li>
            <li>and you will be as smooth as a baby</li>
            <li>Both the Epilady Legend 4th Generation and the free item work extemely well.</li>
            <li>I used both devices the free one on my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t get all of my stubble on first using, but it got most of it.</li>
            <li>this is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Purchase one which needs to be plugged in the whole time, as you will get more power!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old Epilady worked but it was no longer as effective.</li>
            <li>I am using the epilady for the most intimate areas.</li>
            <li>how cool Epiladys are.  </li>
            <li>The new product line is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The results are great but the first time you use it it leaves your arms all red and they feel very hot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The little coil tweezer is a nice addition, and it comes in handy sometimes for lips and nose.</li>
            <li>I had to keep from grimacing at the pain from the one quick use</li>
            <li>I thought that the coil device might be an effective nose-hair tweezer, and decided to sacrifice my nose hair and dignity for the sake of this review, but it did not really even pull out many hairs from my nares.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend purchasing from this seller-stays on top of customer service.</li>
            <li>Like the product I have used previous epilady products and have been happy with them.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve finally licked a problem I&#x27;ve had for more than 25 years!</li>
            <li>The actual Legend itself is ok, but I can never get it to grab the fine hair on my legs.</li>
            <li>: the hair on my face is actually quite fine, barely more than peach fuzz, which the Epilady either chopped off at the skin - leaving me with blond shiny stubble - or didn&#x27;t pull out at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is comparable to using tweezers only more accurate and quicker to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few Epilady over the years and this one by far works the best!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product, it is more convinient than wax because you can get even very short hair</li>
            <li>and I feel that it did not do as good a job as, I expected.  </li>
            <li>Thought for the price it would be effective but was definitely not.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, the Epilady Legend 4th Generation is well worth the money all by itself.</li>
            <li>The old ones would work a lot faster but they hurt a lot more.  </li>
            <li>The pain is very quick and fast if you use it on the higher speed.</li>
            <li>I was able to return it to amazon for a complete refund, which was great, and I&#x27;m going to take a chance and order another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small coil tweezer was pretty effective for the face too, but i sent that back with everything else.</li>
            <li>The new one works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I also had the old original model, which worked fairly well for me.  </li>
            <li>I had the original Epilady (with a coil) for at least 25 years and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The Epilady Hair Remover is good, but makes me a little nervous to use because it can &amp;#34;pinch&amp;#34; the skin.</li>
            <li>Little manual coil tweezer works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>Thanks guys!</li>
            <li>First the coil tweezer is a joke.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the first one for my daughter, she had never tried this type of hair removal.  </li>
            <li>The Epilady really works!</li>
            <li>This was my first epilady product.</li>
            <li>it hurts a lot the first three to five uses</li>
            <li>I bought the first generation of Epilady 25 years ago</li>
            <li>I read on the internet that you have to put hot water on the place</li>
            <li>It REALLY HURT!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It even grabs and removes the fine peach fuzz that is starting to grow from my ears as well!  </li>
            <li>but i kept  keep having to put water on my arms but make sure you dry it off!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not horrible and only lasts a quick second.  </li>
            <li>I have really tried to like this.  </li>
            <li>I will be much easier for travel too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>i used the epilator one time, plugged it in to recharge-----i could smell plastic in the room, the epilator was very hot------this was after 10 hours</li>
            <li>the thing that bothers me is that I have to spend to much time</li>
            <li>Not liking it much.   </li>
            <li>The Epilady Legent does remove hair as it says it will, and it really does not hurt.  </li>
            <li>Really like the coil tweezers</li>
            <li>it hurt to much.</li>
            <li>To me a few seconds of pain once or twice a month is way more than worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Armpits: this epilator is concave in the middle, which I suppose most epilators have to be to get the correct tweezing action, however, this one is so concave that some portions of my armpit were not even touched, leaving me with patchy hair that I had to pluck out after epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was some slight discomfort at first, which has gotten better with use.  </li>
            <li>I would have given the Epilady 5 big stars because it works so well, truly an improved product over the original.</li>
            <li>Much improvement over older style.</li>
            <li>As an older woman my skin has changed and the extreme exfoliation that comes along with waxing has become more of a problem.</li>
            <li>With the Epilady, there is NO sticky after mess, no other items to coordinate, and the pain is quick and even more tolerable than waxing...</li>
            <li>if I want a quick retouch, it&#x27;s very simple and FAST...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not fast, easy, convenient.</li>
            <li>Alot cheaper and less messier than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t grip the hair quite as well as I had hoped - so it takes a couple more passes to get all the hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for an older Braun model.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to all who have used one.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin very smooth and little to no irritation!</li>
            <li>This new one doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>This new model seems to break the hairs off versus pulling them out.  </li>
            <li>I even tried it with my old charger (which I know is working) but the new product would not work at all!  </li>
            <li>Want to see how much hair grows back and how fast.</li>
            <li>I think the springs get loose and therefore less effective over time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried wax kits with very limited success.  </li>
            <li>Bought it for a friend..was very painful..sent it back.</li>
            <li>I tried everything to get rid of it--dipalatory creams, home waxing (too embarassed to go to a salon for professional waxing), laser hair removal</li>
            <li>and they leave very short hairs in place that make my nose very itchy inside for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>far the epilady goes..</li>
            <li>The tweezers are the bomb my husband loves it for those wild hairs......</li>
            <li>I also sometimes use it on my lower legs, near my ankles, but the thicker the hair, the more one would risk having the hair broken rather than lifted out by its root, so I don&#x27;t do much else with this item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After she had tried the waxing kit, I told her this would be a better choice since she has problems with thick hair.  </li>
            <li>You are pulling only one or a few hairs at a time as the surface tweezers roll along and quickly without skin contact more or less.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already gone back to using the old Emjoi though and will search out a new tweezer roll for it.</li>
            <li>It hurts too much and takes way too long...</li>
            <li>: I would say my leg hair is \\&quot;normal\\&quot;, meaning it is not especially thick or dense.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to the next 25 years with my new Epilady.</li>
            <li>When it finally died, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>no set up, no other items needed.</li>
            <li>I learned at an early age that I need to constantly manage my body hair.</li>
            <li>My legs had a red raised rash for days, but I do have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and I see barely any skin aggravation.</li>
            <li>so I can get rid of the hair completely but overall</li>
            <li>the old college try 2 times but in the end I went back to my razor to get</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend it for ladies tired of shaving.  </li>
            <li>Rather than having to pull an entire strip of hair off at a time, you can barely navigate it into the hair line and only pull as many as you want if the pain/feeling is uncomfortable you just stop.</li>
            <li>I can even bulldoze through large projects, like legs, in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>where has this been alll my life, it works fast and does not hurt at all just a little prickly but</li>
            <li>I was prepared to be in pain, however I really had little to no pain at all.</li>
            <li>It still sucks up your skin if it&#x27;s not pulled tight enough (ouch), though I still don&#x27;t know of a better one.  </li>

            <li> Love the concept...love the convenience.  </li>
            <li> But then again - it does take a while to grow back, which is great!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I have always waxed but was recommended this andi  am pleased.  </li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with my purchase of the Epilady Epilator.</li>
            <li> I love the results.</li>
            <li> Epilady, I love.</li>
            <li> I am trying it one more tme.  </li>
            <li> I followed directions and charged it for many more than the recommended hours</li>
            <li> So many times I shell out monney on a mechanical beauty product and</li>
            <li> My review is more for the coil tweezers than the epilady itself.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s reassuring to know that I&#x27;ve found a tool that will let me stay on top of that.  </li>
            <li> Epilady Hair Remover is ok, is not for heavy-duty</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> They do keep getting better each time I use it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work out for me at all</li>
            <li> I am so glad I saw the ad on Amazon and did not miss it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much more for now.  </li>
            <li> I love the epilady legend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bikini Area: again, just didn&#x27;t pull out more than 1/3 of the hair from this</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I was able to get the underarms and legs done in no time.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to give the product some time so that I would like it better</li>
            <li> and I decided to give it a try even though My first is in good condition.</li>
            <li> I was one of the first to buy the original Epilady 25 years ago, which I used and loved ever since.</li>
            <li> The seller was very quick in sending my order</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> The guide is easy to snap on and off.  </li>
            <li> Works well and easy to use</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so easy,</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and all.....</li>
            <li> Easy to use, travel with &amp; store.</li>
            <li> Fast service, received product in good condition, and smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coil tweezer worked okay on the peach-fuzz type hairs, but it was much too time consuming (and the risk of permanently scarring your face by getting it caught in between the coils was too great) for it to be of any real use.</li>
            <li> , it works fine</li>
            <li> This product does a fine job of eliminating any hair on the legs.</li>
            <li> She plans on giving it another go in about a month or so as she was very happy with how that half leg turned out..</li>
            <li> It is so light and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate the free items.  </li>
            <li> I used a Finally Free electronic tweezer for years, and it did help, but it was so tedius taht</li>
            <li> Then, when I got my laser hair removal sessions, I tossed the Finally Free in the trash, thinking I would never use it again.</li>
            <li> Enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I figured my gf might enjoy the epilady unit</li>
            <li> It pulls out the hair from the follicles and my legs and underarms are hair free for weeks.</li>
            <li> this worth the money you pay for it and in my opinion is better option than shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I finally bought one.</li>
            <li> and you will be as smooth as a baby</li>
            <li> Both the Epilady Legend 4th Generation and the free item work extemely well.</li>
            <li> I used both devices the free one on my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t get all of my stubble on first using, but it got most of it.</li>
            <li> this is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Purchase one which needs to be plugged in the whole time, as you will get more power!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old Epilady worked but it was no longer as effective.</li>
            <li> I am using the epilady for the most intimate areas.</li>
            <li> how cool Epiladys are.  </li>
            <li> The new product line is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The results are great but the first time you use it it leaves your arms all red and they feel very hot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little coil tweezer is a nice addition, and it comes in handy sometimes for lips and nose.</li>
            <li> I had to keep from grimacing at the pain from the one quick use</li>
            <li> I thought that the coil device might be an effective nose-hair tweezer, and decided to sacrifice my nose hair and dignity for the sake of this review, but it did not really even pull out many hairs from my nares.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend purchasing from this seller-stays on top of customer service.</li>
            <li> Like the product I have used previous epilady products and have been happy with them.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve finally licked a problem I&#x27;ve had for more than 25 years!</li>
            <li> The actual Legend itself is ok, but I can never get it to grab the fine hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> : the hair on my face is actually quite fine, barely more than peach fuzz, which the Epilady either chopped off at the skin - leaving me with blond shiny stubble - or didn&#x27;t pull out at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is comparable to using tweezers only more accurate and quicker to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few Epilady over the years and this one by far works the best!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, it is more convinient than wax because you can get even very short hair</li>
            <li> and I feel that it did not do as good a job as, I expected.  </li>
            <li> Thought for the price it would be effective but was definitely not.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, the Epilady Legend 4th Generation is well worth the money all by itself.</li>
            <li> The old ones would work a lot faster but they hurt a lot more.  </li>
            <li> The pain is very quick and fast if you use it on the higher speed.</li>
            <li> I was able to return it to amazon for a complete refund, which was great, and I&#x27;m going to take a chance and order another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small coil tweezer was pretty effective for the face too, but i sent that back with everything else.</li>
            <li> The new one works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I also had the old original model, which worked fairly well for me.  </li>
            <li> I had the original Epilady (with a coil) for at least 25 years and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The Epilady Hair Remover is good, but makes me a little nervous to use because it can &amp;#34;pinch&amp;#34; the skin.</li>
            <li> Little manual coil tweezer works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> First the coil tweezer is a joke.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the first one for my daughter, she had never tried this type of hair removal.  </li>
            <li> The Epilady really works!</li>
            <li> This was my first epilady product.</li>
            <li> it hurts a lot the first three to five uses</li>
            <li> I bought the first generation of Epilady 25 years ago</li>
            <li> I read on the internet that you have to put hot water on the place</li>
            <li> It REALLY HURT!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It even grabs and removes the fine peach fuzz that is starting to grow from my ears as well!  </li>
            <li> but i kept  keep having to put water on my arms but make sure you dry it off!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not horrible and only lasts a quick second.  </li>
            <li> I have really tried to like this.  </li>
            <li> I will be much easier for travel too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> i used the epilator one time, plugged it in to recharge-----i could smell plastic in the room, the epilator was very hot------this was after 10 hours</li>
            <li> the thing that bothers me is that I have to spend to much time</li>
            <li> Not liking it much.   </li>
            <li> The Epilady Legent does remove hair as it says it will, and it really does not hurt.  </li>
            <li> Really like the coil tweezers</li>
            <li> it hurt to much.</li>
            <li> To me a few seconds of pain once or twice a month is way more than worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Armpits: this epilator is concave in the middle, which I suppose most epilators have to be to get the correct tweezing action, however, this one is so concave that some portions of my armpit were not even touched, leaving me with patchy hair that I had to pluck out after epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was some slight discomfort at first, which has gotten better with use.  </li>
            <li> I would have given the Epilady 5 big stars because it works so well, truly an improved product over the original.</li>
            <li> Much improvement over older style.</li>
            <li> As an older woman my skin has changed and the extreme exfoliation that comes along with waxing has become more of a problem.</li>
            <li> With the Epilady, there is NO sticky after mess, no other items to coordinate, and the pain is quick and even more tolerable than waxing...</li>
            <li> if I want a quick retouch, it&#x27;s very simple and FAST...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not fast, easy, convenient.</li>
            <li> Alot cheaper and less messier than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t grip the hair quite as well as I had hoped - so it takes a couple more passes to get all the hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older Braun model.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to all who have used one.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin very smooth and little to no irritation!</li>
            <li> This new one doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> This new model seems to break the hairs off versus pulling them out.  </li>
            <li> I even tried it with my old charger (which I know is working) but the new product would not work at all!  </li>
            <li> Want to see how much hair grows back and how fast.</li>
            <li> I think the springs get loose and therefore less effective over time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried wax kits with very limited success.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend..was very painful..sent it back.</li>
            <li> I tried everything to get rid of it--dipalatory creams, home waxing (too embarassed to go to a salon for professional waxing), laser hair removal</li>
            <li> and they leave very short hairs in place that make my nose very itchy inside for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> far the epilady goes..</li>
            <li> The tweezers are the bomb my husband loves it for those wild hairs......</li>
            <li> I also sometimes use it on my lower legs, near my ankles, but the thicker the hair, the more one would risk having the hair broken rather than lifted out by its root, so I don&#x27;t do much else with this item.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After she had tried the waxing kit, I told her this would be a better choice since she has problems with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> You are pulling only one or a few hairs at a time as the surface tweezers roll along and quickly without skin contact more or less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already gone back to using the old Emjoi though and will search out a new tweezer roll for it.</li>
            <li> It hurts too much and takes way too long...</li>
            <li> : I would say my leg hair is \\&quot;normal\\&quot;, meaning it is not especially thick or dense.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to the next 25 years with my new Epilady.</li>
            <li> When it finally died, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> no set up, no other items needed.</li>
            <li> I learned at an early age that I need to constantly manage my body hair.</li>
            <li> My legs had a red raised rash for days, but I do have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and I see barely any skin aggravation.</li>
            <li> so I can get rid of the hair completely but overall</li>
            <li> the old college try 2 times but in the end I went back to my razor to get</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend it for ladies tired of shaving.  </li>
            <li> Rather than having to pull an entire strip of hair off at a time, you can barely navigate it into the hair line and only pull as many as you want if the pain/feeling is uncomfortable you just stop.</li>
            <li> I can even bulldoze through large projects, like legs, in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> where has this been alll my life, it works fast and does not hurt at all just a little prickly but</li>
            <li> I was prepared to be in pain, however I really had little to no pain at all.</li>
            <li> It still sucks up your skin if it&#x27;s not pulled tight enough (ouch), though I still don&#x27;t know of a better one.  </li>
            <li> I thought that a new model of epilator than the 15 year old Emjoi I&#x27;ve got would be worlds better, but I am a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - Just not good or worth the money</li>
            <li> My hair also got caught in the spinning blades and the unit completely shut down.  </li>
            <li> Electric trimmers do work but don&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> My legs definitely aren&#x27;t as smooth as when I shave, but I think that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m still not perfect at it.  </li>
            <li> Free item is useless.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t overcharge it, then it should keep it&#x27;s charge.</li>
            <li> had this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> areas epilated left me with a minimal amount of ingrown hairs, nothing that I haven&#x27;t had before from</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not really any more painful than laser hair removal and a whole lot less</li>
            <li> It is great but very painful.</li>
            <li> tiny little raised red spots everywhere</li>
            <li> I thought this item would come with other heads for different areas of the body like I saw in the store.</li>
            <li> Epilady has come a long way!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need to use it longer to determine if it performs over the long term as expected.</li>
            <li> It is a vast improvement on the ones of 20 odd years ago.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a HUGE disappointment.</li>
            <li> Have not tried &amp;#34;free epilady&amp;#34; yet sounds and looks more painful to use.</li>
            <li> This was the most painful way to remove hair.  </li>
            <li> Minimal pain once you get going!</li>
            <li> Keep your skin pulled taut with your other hand (like two fingers)</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t takes all the hair from the roots but is somehow efficient because as you uses it the hair growth slow,I use to shave every day and now I just do the epilation every other week,</li>
            <li> I used the other to do my underarms and legs</li>
            <li> (only worked for a year, then the hair came back worse than ever.)</li>
            <li> Seriously, you will never have your hair grow back so thin and soft as it will after using an Epilady!!  </li>
            <li> Sound painful?  </li>
            <li> This works well on hair which is not so thick, so I have no problem with the above areas.</li>
            <li> I know that eventually that fuzz will turn into thick, coarse hairs</li>
            <li> You better get a cheaper one without The Coil Tweester as it is a pice of crap</li>
            <li> Just buy this one and forgo all the other ones!</li>
            <li> I would end up just doing half the hair and then shaving the rest.</li>
            <li> She got about half done with one leg and just couldn&#x27;t take the pain anymore.  </li>
            <li> I had previously gotten my legs waxed, as well as my armpits.</li>
            <li> I did not give 5 stars because it seems like the motor is slowing a little compare to beginning</li>
            <li> I pushed the little roller in it manually</li>
            <li> I bought my Epilady a little over a month ago.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken me a little while to get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this epilator, but ended my experience with disappointment.  </li>
            <li> but it does fade within a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I will wait a few days for the soreness to abate and then I will get the rest.</li>
            <li> and it has a narrow &amp;#34;path&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> has decreased the amount of hair that has grown back on my legs, and my arm pits too!  </li>
            <li> well I convinced my gf to try it by using it myself on a small hidden patch of hair on my leg.  </li>
            <li> I am super disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The ladies in my family ALL have thick dark hair, and I am no exception.</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t do anything and is difficult to even get to grab any hair.  </li>
            <li> If a person simply reads and follows the instructions, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Then if, I am still not pleased</li>
            <li> Comes with a small brush.</li>
            <li> and then it let go, leaving a bruise and small tear in my skin.</li>
            <li> so I felt that it should not have a hard time grasping the hair</li>
            <li> You still have to shave slowly to pick up all the hair</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Other implement for brows is totally useless.</li>
            <li> No More Shaving for me!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Epilady IS painful--in a few places it even drew blood when it pulled out my chin hair.</li>
            <li> If you have very thick hair shafts, don&#x27;t go with a rechargeable.</li>
            <li> and then it reluctantly started spinning at a very slow rate.  </li>
            <li> The epilady is less painful.  </li>
            <li> I find it difficult to use and doesn&#x27;t do what I thought it would.</li>
            <li> and it just randomly stopped working.</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but i was so wrong.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m sorry to say, the Coil Tweezer is worthless.</li>
            <li> This said, I don&#x27;t think it is that painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as painful as the one I bought 25 years ago &amp; cuts skin.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> I HATE nose and ear hair.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely hate it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> recharging--- it smelled terrible and wouldn&#x27;t work------then i had to pay for return shipping for&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was especially horrible arount the knees.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased an Epilady. Fast service, received product in good condition, and smooth transaction. It arrived before Christmas and my daughter loves it! Thanks guys! Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> I have really tried to like this.  First the coil tweezer is a joke.  It simply doesn&#x27;t do anything and is difficult to even get to grab any hair.  The actual Legend itself is ok, but I can never get it to grab the fine hair on my legs. It takes forever to use and there&#x27;s always still a ton of hair.  I am super disappointed.  The only place that I have found this to be acceptable is my armpits, but again there&#x27;s still always a bit of hair.  It&#x27;s winter so that&#x27;s ok since I&#x27;m not in tank tops, but come summer it won&#x27;t be usable for that either.</li>
            <li> Love the concept...love the convenience.  However, I do have several in-grown hairs as a result of using this that I had to dig out.  Leaves tiny little raised red spots everywhere it pulls the hair out - but it does fade within a few hours.  Legs look good - but don&#x27;t FEEL good, like that nice smooth feeling with shaving.  But then again - it does take a while to grow back, which is great!</li>
            <li> I do not like this product. I find it difficult to use and doesn&#x27;t do what I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I ordered the first one for my daughter, she had never tried this type of hair removal.  After she had tried the waxing kit, I told her this would be a better choice since she has problems with thick hair.  I asked if I could try her product to see if I would like the same.  I ordered mine the same day and I absolutely love it.  I would highly recommend this product to all who have used one.  The seller was very quick in sending my order and I had it within 3 days-thank you and I appreciate the free items.  I would highly recommend purchasing from this seller-stays on top of customer service.</li>
            <li> The epilady is quite painless and efficient.  I have always waxed but was recommended this andi  am pleased.  It is a vast improvement on the ones of 20 odd years ago.  I will be much easier for travel too.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great!  I got the product promptly after ordering.  It works great and I love it!  I would strongly recommend it for ladies tired of shaving.  Works great on the face as well.</li>
            <li> I like that I can use it cordless, it works fine however had to do it again after a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few Epilady over the years and this one by far works the best! Minimal pain once you get going! Leaves your skin very smooth and little to no irritation!</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend..was very painful..sent it back.</li>
            <li> I really like it. easy to use. Only problem is that the hair growth increased after its use so i have to use it every week.</li>
            <li> I had always used an electric shaver and used it often.  The Epilady is 100% better!  I especially like using the position guide to keep the Epilady in the correct position.  The guide is easy to snap on and off.  If a person simply reads and follows the instructions, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  There was some slight discomfort at first, which has gotten better with use.  If you want to know how it feels, simply take a pair of tweezers and pull out individual hairs with it.  I would recommend this product to anyone thinking of getting an epilator.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilady in March. It is now June and it just randomly stopped working. I&#x27;ve contacted epilady and they are working to help resolve the issue.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with my purchase of the Epilady Epilator. This product does a fine job of eliminating any hair on the legs.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to use</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Takes some getting used to in terms of removing the hair... not a one pass &amp; gone.  Need to work at it a bit, patience.  Good quality for the money.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I hate it. I have returned it back.</li>
            <li> My friend had recommneded this product because she had used it for years and finally got rid of the hair growth all together. I really enjoy this product, it is more convinient than wax because you can get even very short hair and it is so inexpensive. I did not give 5 stars because it seems like the motor is slowing a little compare to beginning and it is only been month since I bought it. I hope it is going to last.</li>
            <li> This product does not provide the same quality as the 1st generation I had bought and just recently died.  Have not tried &amp;#34;free epilady&amp;#34; yet sounds and looks more painful to use.</li>
            <li> I was replacing an Epilady that I broke.  The new one works just fine.  I&#x27;ve been using an epilator of one kind or another for 25 years.  Take heart if you&#x27;re just starting--if you use it regularly, it quits hurting.  I love the results.</li>
            <li> As a rechargeable epilator, this is one of the best you can buy. I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them out there, so take it from me. If you have very thick hair shafts, don&#x27;t go with a rechargeable. Purchase one which needs to be plugged in the whole time, as you will get more power!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Epilady, I love. I use it on my arms and my face. The ladies in my family ALL have thick dark hair, and I am no exception. I learned at an early age that I need to constantly manage my body hair. This works well on hair which is not so thick, so I have no problem with the above areas. I also sometimes use it on my lower legs, near my ankles, but the thicker the hair, the more one would risk having the hair broken rather than lifted out by its root, so I don&#x27;t do much else with this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little coil tweezer is a nice addition, and it comes in handy sometimes for lips and nose.</li>
            <li> I only used it once and I feel that it did not do as good a job as, I expected.  I am trying it one more tme.  Then if, I am still not pleased will be returning this for a refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had embarassing facial hair since my mid-20s (now in my 50s.) I tried everything to get rid of it--dipalatory creams, home waxing (too embarassed to go to a salon for professional waxing), laser hair removal (only worked for a year, then the hair came back worse than ever.) I used a Finally Free electronic tweezer for years, and it did help, but it was so tedius taht I would end up just doing half the hair and then shaving the rest.Then, when I got my laser hair removal sessions, I tossed the Finally Free in the trash, thinking I would never use it again. Well, I was wrong. The laser hair removal wasn&#x27;t permanent and I had to return to shaving, which fooled no one and I would always develop embarassing stubble by the end of the day. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now. The Epilady really works! I was amazed that I could use it on my short stubble, so I didn&#x27;t have to wait for the hair to grow out over several embarassing days before I could use it. Unfortunately, the Epilady IS painful--in a few places it even drew blood when it pulled out my chin hair. However, it&#x27;s not really any more painful than laser hair removal and a whole lot less expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t get all of my stubble on first using, but it got most of it. I will wait a few days for the soreness to abate and then I will get the rest. I think I&#x27;ve finally licked a problem I&#x27;ve had for more than 25 years! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using Epilady products for over 25 years and up until now I have loved them! I took a chance by ordering online but will be returning this product. My old Epilady worked but it was no longer as effective. I think the springs get loose and therefore less effective over time.  This new one doesn&#x27;t work at all. I followed directions and charged it for many more than the recommended hours but it would not turn on. I even tried it with my old charger (which I know is working) but the new product would not work at all!  I am VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I thought that a new model of epilator than the 15 year old Emjoi I&#x27;ve got would be worlds better, but I am a bit disappointed. I don&#x27;t feel like it removes all of the hair as well as my Emjoi. It&#x27;s okay - removes hair fairly well if you keep at it. I&#x27;ve already gone back to using the old Emjoi though and will search out a new tweezer roll for it.</li>
            <li> Much improvement over older style. Only tiny sting if used in the lip area. Enjoy using it. Does a great job. Other implement for brows is totally useless. Do not spend the extra money. Just purchase the Epilady alone.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Epilady, not the seller.  This was the most painful way to remove hair.  My legs had a red raised rash for days, but I do have sensitive skin.  Gave it to my friend who recommended it to me.  She has been using one for years and loves it.</li>
            <li> Works great, saves money!</li>
            <li> Had this product for about a year no longer works would not recommend</li>
            <li> Did not work. Very disappointed. Thought for the price it would be effective but was definitely not. Back to using razors again.</li>
            <li> I have waxed for years. For years I&#x27;ve put off buying an epilator. I so regret those years. So many times I shell out monney on a mechanical beauty product and it&#x27;s a HUGE disappointment. THIS THING WORKS! WORKS GREAT!!  I am using the epilady for the most intimate areas. As an older woman my skin has changed and the extreme exfoliation that comes along with waxing has become more of a problem. With the Epilady, there is NO sticky after mess, no other items to coordinate, and the pain is quick and even more tolerable than waxing...I think because the pulling of the entire skin surface is eliminated. You are pulling only one or a few hairs at a time as the surface tweezers roll along and quickly without skin contact more or less. And it can be very precise. Rather than having to pull an entire strip of hair off at a time, you can barely navigate it into the hair line and only pull as many as you want if the pain/feeling is uncomfortable you just stop. And it&#x27;s so easy, if I want a quick retouch, it&#x27;s very simple and FAST...no set up, no other items needed. I just can&#x27;t say enough. I&#x27;m thrilled. Keep your skin pulled taut with your other hand (like two fingers) and I see barely any skin aggravation.</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised.  I&#x27;ll need to use it longer to determine if it performs over the long term as expected.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I also had the old original model, which worked fairly well for me.  This device could be used corded or cordless, which I liked and did a good job of pulling out the hairs, however after the first use (and fully charging it as recommended in the instructions), the device would not power on.  I pushed the little roller in it manually and then it reluctantly started spinning at a very slow rate.  I was able to return it to amazon for a complete refund, which was great, and I&#x27;m going to take a chance and order another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small coil tweezer was pretty effective for the face too, but i sent that back with everything else.</li>
            <li> I was one of the first to buy the original Epilady 25 years ago, which I used and loved ever since. So when it finally gave up the ghost, I went online to find a replacement and found the Epilady Legend 4th Generation. The Coil Tweezer sounded like it might be good too, so I bought the package deal. I would have given the Epilady 5 big stars because it works so well, truly an improved product over the original. However, I&#x27;m sorry to say, the Coil Tweezer is worthless. Now I understand why they were giving it away. They were probably wondering what to do with a warehouse of these things and thought it might boost sales of the Epilady by offering it as a bonus. Nonetheless, the Epilady Legend 4th Generation is well worth the money all by itself. I&#x27;m looking forward to the next 25 years with my new Epilady.</li>
            <li> i used the epilator one time, plugged it in to recharge-----i could smell plastic in the room, the epilator was very hot------this was after 10 hours recharging--- it smelled terrible and wouldn&#x27;t work------then i had to pay for return shipping for&lt;br /&gt;$8.50----they will NOT reimburse even though the device is defective-----NEVER again will i buy from Rush!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My review is more for the coil tweezers than the epilady itself.  As a man honestly I wanted the tweezers for nose and ear hairs but discovered that it wasn&#x27;t much more to get the kit that includes both items.  I figured my gf might enjoy the epilady unit itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers work great!  They grab handfulls of hair out of my nose and yank them out with almost no effort at all.  Sound painful?  Yeah it is but it&#x27;s not horrible and only lasts a quick second.  After about a minute you&#x27;re done for a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It even grabs and removes the fine peach fuzz that is starting to grow from my ears as well!  I know that eventually that fuzz will turn into thick, coarse hairs and it&#x27;s reassuring to know that I&#x27;ve found a tool that will let me stay on top of that.  I HATE nose and ear hair.  I absolutely hate it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried wax kits with very limited success.  Electric trimmers do work but don&#x27;t last very long and they leave very short hairs in place that make my nose very itchy inside for a couple of days.  To me a few seconds of pain once or twice a month is way more than worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far the epilady goes.. well I convinced my gf to try it by using it myself on a small hidden patch of hair on my leg.  I had to keep from grimacing at the pain from the one quick use but I do have to say it did a great job at removing the hair!  And the pain (the burn.. OH THE BURN!) actually disappeared after about five seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But despite this product being the result of a joint effort between Hitler and Satan himself of developing a torture device she tried it anyway.  She got about half done with one leg and just couldn&#x27;t take the pain anymore.  She&#x27;s such a trooper!  She plans on giving it another go in about a month or so as she was very happy with how that half leg turned out.. once the pain subsided anyway!</li>
            <li> Tweazer has a lot to be desired...do not like or use..&lt;br /&gt;The Epilady Hair Remover is ok, is not for heavy-duty</li>
            <li> I love this product. This was my first epilady product. I had previously gotten my legs waxed, as well as my armpits. I suppose the pain that others felt didn&#x27;t bother me because I was expecting it. This said, I don&#x27;t think it is that painful. It pulls out the hair from the follicles and my legs and underarms are hair free for weeks. No problems with it losing power (I had it in a drawer for over a month and it still had enough power for my legs and underarms). As long as you don&#x27;t overcharge it, then it should keep it&#x27;s charge. Comes with a small brush. Not the best, but I didn&#x27;t buy this for the brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for an older Braun model.  The epilady is less painful.  You still have to shave slowly to pick up all the hair and it has a narrow &amp;#34;path&amp;#34;. It still sucks up your skin if it&#x27;s not pulled tight enough (ouch), though I still don&#x27;t know of a better one.  I do like the tweezers that came with it.</li>
            <li> The new product line is very easy to use.  The old ones would work a lot faster but they hurt a lot more.  This one is good I&#x27;ve even used on my face.  The tweezers are the bomb my husband loves it for those wild hairs......&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> You better get a cheaper one without The Coil Tweester as it is a pice of crap and it is good for nothing ,the machine it self is fair  it hurts a lot the first three to five uses but as you get confidence using it you don&#x27;t feel a thing , it doesn&#x27;t takes all the hair from the roots but is somehow efficient because as you uses it the hair growth slow,I use to shave every day and now I just do the epilation every other week, the thing that bothers me is that I have to spend to much time so I can get rid of the hair completely but overall this worth the money you pay for it and in my opinion is better option than shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> I bought my Epilady a little over a month ago.  It&#x27;s taken me a little while to get the hang of it.  My legs definitely aren&#x27;t as smooth as when I shave, but I think that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m still not perfect at it.  They do keep getting better each time I use it and I&#x27;m so happy to no longer use a razor.  (I only use the Epilady on my underarms to touch up from laser treatments so I can&#x27;t speak to using them on underarms that haven&#x27;t been lasered.)  I&#x27;m so happy I finally bought one.</li>
            <li> Tweazer has a lot to be desired...doo not like or use..&lt;br /&gt;The Epilady Hair Remover is good, but makes me a little nervous to use because it can &amp;#34;pinch&amp;#34; the skin.</li>
            <li> Free item is useless. I thought this item would come with other heads for different areas of the body like I saw in the store.</li>
            <li> Epilady has come a long way!  This is a nicely constructed device.  If used correctly it does remove hair with the &#x27;follicle bulb&#x27;.  As for pain...there is no such thing as painless hair removal imho :-{  I have been using it for several months now and do notice a decrease in &#x27;regrowth&#x27; of hair.  And the price is good.</li>
            <li> where has this been alll my life, it works fast and does not hurt at all just a little prickly but nothing that i would consider pain. I wish I had  had this a long time ago. Just follow directions and you will be as smooth as a baby</li>
            <li> This Epilady is the third one I&#x27;ve owned. I will never again shave my legs!!It has decreased the amount of hair that has grown back on my legs, and my arm pits too!  Seriously, you will never have your hair grow back so thin and soft as it will after using an Epilady!!  I cant express enough to all my friends how cool Epiladys are.  No More Shaving for me! Thank goodness for Epilady!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked. I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work out for me at all but i was so wrong. I will definately tell my family and friends about this.</li>
            <li> I bought the first generation of Epilady 25 years ago and I have been using it unti now. I saw the ad for the 4th generatin and I decided to give it a try even though My first is in good condition. What a difference, it works beautifully. I am so glad I saw the ad on Amazon and did not miss it.</li>
            <li> It  hurts to use this...you get used to it, but it is not painless. I&#x27;ve never used one of these things before.  It was easy to use and all.....I can&#x27;t say much more for now.  Want to see how much hair grows back and how fast. *UPDATE it&#x27;s been several months since purchase and I just quit using it.  It hurts too much and takes way too long...then I notice I&#x27;ve missed hairs and have to go back and repeat.  Not liking it much.   Would not purchase again.  It does WORK but it&#x27;s not fast, easy, convenient.</li>
            <li> The Epilady Legent does remove hair as it says it will, and it really does not hurt.  The spring I have not gotten used to yet, but only tried it a couple of times.</li>
            <li> I love the epilady legend. It works beautifully and effectively. It does not cause any pain or cause pinching of the skin.  It is so light and easy to carry. I wish I had bought this before I bought the regular Epilady. this is definitely worth the money! Just buy this one and forgo all the other ones!</li>
            <li> Like the product I have used previous epilady products and have been happy with them. Really like the coil tweezers</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  It did not grasp and pull all the hairs on my legs so I would end up shaving.  It was especially horrible arount the knees.  I did give it the old college try 2 times but in the end I went back to my razor to get all the missed hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have course hair on my legs so I felt that it should not have a hard time grasping the hair but I was wrong.  My hair also got caught in the spinning blades and the unit completely shut down.  Now, sometimes when I turn it on nothing happens and I have to hit it a couple of times to get the blades spinning again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - Just not good or worth the money</li>
            <li> The legend 4th generation is great. the Epilady coil tweezer was junk. Should have bought just the legend.</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this epilator, but ended my experience with disappointment.  It simply doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.  Aside from the pain factor (which is moderate), this epilator pulls out only about 1/3 to 1/2 of the hair for which it is intended.  Body area by body area review below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs: I would say my leg hair is \\&quot;normal\\&quot;, meaning it is not especially thick or dense.  It seemed no matter what length my hair was, or how often I went over the same spot with this epilator, my legs were left with strips of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armpits: this epilator is concave in the middle, which I suppose most epilators have to be to get the correct tweezing action, however, this one is so concave that some portions of my armpit were not even touched, leaving me with patchy hair that I had to pluck out after epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face: the hair on my face is actually quite fine, barely more than peach fuzz, which the Epilady either chopped off at the skin - leaving me with blond shiny stubble - or didn&#x27;t pull out at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini Area: again, just didn&#x27;t pull out more than 1/3 of the hair from this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All areas epilated left me with a minimal amount of ingrown hairs, nothing that I haven&#x27;t had before from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coil tweezer worked okay on the peach-fuzz type hairs, but it was much too time consuming (and the risk of permanently scarring your face by getting it caught in between the coils was too great) for it to be of any real use. I thought that the coil device might be an effective nose-hair tweezer, and decided to sacrifice my nose hair and dignity for the sake of this review, but it did not really even pull out many hairs from my nares.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used smaller machines for years. I can even bulldoze through large projects, like legs, in just a few minutes. Love it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t begin to tell you how happy I am. Both the Epilady Legend 4th Generation and the free item work extemely well. I was prepared to be in pain, however I really had little to no pain at all. I used both devices the free one on my face and it is comparable to using tweezers only more accurate and quicker to do. I used the other to do my underarms and legs I was able to get the underarms and legs done in no time. I cannot believe how well the products work and I only wished I had bought one sooner. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend these items with no qualms.</li>
            <li> I have seen this product advertised for years &amp; assumed it was too good to be true.  But it was recommended by a friend so I decided to give it a try.  I love it.  Doesn&#x27;t shave quite as closely as a razor but does the trick.  Easy to use, travel with &amp; store.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Alot cheaper and less messier than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t grip the hair quite as well as I had hoped - so it takes a couple more passes to get all the hair.  Still it is a great improvement on previuos epilady models.  Little manual coil tweezer works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> Nothing 4th generation about this product! It&#x27;s as painful as the one I bought 25 years ago &amp; cuts skin. Pass on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to give the product some time so that I would like it better but it hasn&#x27;t worked.  I had the original Epilady (with a coil) for at least 25 years and LOVED it.  When it finally died, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get a new one.  This new model seems to break the hairs off versus pulling them out.  I&#x27;m going to keep trying my usage but I&#x27;m not very happy with it.  The coil Epilady worked like it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> It is great but very painful. I used it on my arms and i had to keep on taking breaks brcause it hurt to much. The results are great but the first time you use it it leaves your arms all red and they feel very hot. I think you should buy this for you unwanted hair but I just want you to know that it hurts because it pulls the hair from the roots. The pain is very quick and fast if you use it on the higher speed. I read on the internet that you have to put hot water on the place were you want to remove your hair so it will open up were your hair is. I did but i kept  keep having to put water on my arms but make sure you dry it off! I suggest that you buy the epilady cream so you can put it on were ever you take off the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m editing my prior review from 5 stars to one, and none if I could, because this product grabbed the skin on my knee and kept rolling and sucking my flesh into the blades until I turned it off and then it let go, leaving a bruise and small tear in my skin. It REALLY HURT! There was no user error, I&#x27;ve used it before, it simply malfunctioned.</li>
            <li> This is the best.  No substitute. I recommend&lt;br /&gt; It any time</li>
    </ol>
