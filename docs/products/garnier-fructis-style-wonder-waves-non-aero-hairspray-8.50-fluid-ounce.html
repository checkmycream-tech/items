            <li>Garnier Fructis Wonder Waves is amazing.  </li>
            <li>great price and makes curly/wavy hair look nice and smooth and defines curls.</li>
            <li>Garnier Fructic have nice products for curly / wavy hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair without frizz but with nice waves.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents in existence, and I am so glad I can still get it somewhere!</li>
            <li>Great product and delivery was right on time.</li>
            <li>Ordered more than one so that the problem would be solved.</li>
            <li>Better than any salon brands I have tried</li>
            <li>Love wonder waves, helps keep my curls looking better than any \\&quot;professional\\&quot; styling spray I ever used.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Nothing more too it</li>
            <li>Seems to work best on next day hair.</li>
            <li>I love this spray to use before styling with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t find in the store any more.</li>
            <li>and I tell you there is nothing better than the Wonder Waves product.  </li>
            <li>and sometimes it makes great, soft waves.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, it didnt cut it for my fine hair (with some volume).</li>
            <li>Wonder Waves leaves my hair soft, and the fragrance is really light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It gives me very nice waves that last all day.</li>
            <li>I have been experimenting with different products and am thrilled I got this!  </li>
            <li>Then sprayed Wonder Waves pretty liberally into my damp hair, making sure to get the underneath pieces too.</li>
            <li>First off, let me just say I really do love this product.</li>
            <li>It was &lt;$4 &amp; much cheaper than Fekkai&#x27;s $25 product, so I figured I had nothing to lose, plus I love Garnier&#x27;s hairsprays</li>
            <li>I do some scrunching &amp; blow dry with a diffuser &amp; my hair comes out soft with great waves!</li>
            <li>The curls became less defined, but instead more elongated and manageable, which is also good.</li>
            <li>This was my &#x27;must&#x27; super spray gel in college, about 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>and I go through it too quickly).</li>
            <li>It is a perfect gel to keep soft slight waves on my hair.</li>
            <li>leaves hair a little crispy, but once you run your fingers through it, they soften up and look great.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft and frizz free!</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>The frizzy flyaways seem more tamed too, I think maybe just some light hair spray once its dry might help to hold it all day.</li>
            <li>This product works great for my natural loose curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it smells great and works when used properly.  </li>
            <li>If i run some finishing creme just on the roots and then spray this all over my hair while still damp, it will let my hair dry  without any frizz and with  nice waves all over.  </li>
            <li>To anyone who has fine, dry, and slightly wavy hair complete with flyaways to start with, this product is the best there is.</li>
            <li>I try to scrunch my hair as much as possible since heat can just damage it more then it already is.  </li>
            <li>I put a leave in conditioner in first to help my hair stay hydrated.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried a lot of stuff because who wants friz!</li>
            <li>I cannot find GF Woner Waves in the stores any more, and I only hope they will keep making it.</li>
            <li>But with proper brushing following application, I can get a good look going on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really works for me, I put it on wet, run my fingers through the waves as they dry and am good for one sometimes 2 days!</li>
            <li>For once, a pretty style for our hair type that doesnt require a blow dryer, straight iron, and tons of product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other, more expensive products, but this stuff is the best!  </li>
            <li>It even works on dry hair if I want more curls.  </li>
            <li>I twist my curls as they dry to give them more definition.</li>
            <li>No result, except once when I sprayed it on damp and then more on dry.</li>
            <li>After much research, we found this spray.  </li>
            <li>I have wavy/curly hair that is very susceptible to friz.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it on wet hair, for sure.</li>
            <li>But it did leave a very sticky finish</li>
            <li>and I didnt really like how it looks either.</li>
            <li>doesnt work that much from straight hair.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery-Great Product</li>
            <li>actually have naturally curly hair, and I had thought this would make the curls come out more.</li>
            <li>Other product is too strong, and makes my hair stiff, and it does not look good at all.</li>
            <li>Now we are being price gouged for the remaining supply available out there, which is usually sold at 3-4 times the original drugstore price.</li>
            <li>Wonder waves is better than any other product I have ever tried!  </li>
            <li>I have coarse curly hair that tends to be super frizzy.</li>
            <li>Weirdly enough this works great on some days and less well on others, even if I use it in the same way.</li>
            <li>Most products weigh down my hair and make it look greasy - not this!  </li>
            <li>The next morning though I have to wash it out right away</li>
            <li>This is my favorite haircare product, but it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair from looking frizzy and wild.</li>
            <li>Holds hair but hair is still moveable and soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend it for people with thick curly hair, because my mom is in love with it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only way I can wear my hair &amp;#34;wash and go&amp;#34; and have it look decent.</li>
            <li>It gives me loose sort of beachy waves and if any are a little bit crunchy when my hair dries, it smooths out really easily.  </li>
            <li>What I do is shower right before bed and then put my hair up in a messy bun and sleep on it all night.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to age, hormones, or now living in Florida, but my once straight and manageable hair is wavy and frizzy in the Florida summers.  </li>
            <li>:) I have naturally long, thin curly hair that looks thicker than it really is when dry.</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair for a few minutes then spray a little bit more for a wavier look.  </li>
            <li>Are you envious of people who actually have straight or curly hair but not this in between mess that you have?</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>

            <li> :) I have naturally long, thin curly hair that looks thicker than it really is when dry.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair for a few minutes then spray a little bit more for a wavier look.  </li>
            <li> Are you envious of people who actually have straight or curly hair but not this in between mess that you have?</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> My hair tends to get dry, especially at the ends after every hair appointment.  </li>
            <li> but if I spray too much, it can look a little too wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> I am determined to grow long...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s to my shoulders now in long layers.  </li>
            <li> so finally I have waves that are identifiable as waves not just a failed straight hair project.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands since then, such as Pantene, Dove, Suave etc.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long &amp; medium in thickness</li>
            <li> Every time I get out of the shower, I towel dry my hair and spray it from root to tip with this product.  </li>
            <li> Please take note that if this product is not giving you the results you want.. BLOW DRY WITH A DIFFUSER.</li>
            <li> After my shower I spray this into my damp hair and allow to air dry.  </li>
            <li> then just let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I tried putting it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I can spray and scrunch my hair when it&#x27;s still damp and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> When you can find it, it retails for less than $4 per bottle (same size).</li>
            <li> Three stars because it does work again, just really not on me.</li>
            <li> This was not the case, as my hair just became a bit harder.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair with a little bit of wave &amp; a lotta bit of frizz when I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> sticky and just not very nice overall.</li>
            <li> My routine is I put my hair in a t-shirt to dry it after the shower, (less frizz then with a towel) and combed through some John Freida Frizzease.</li>
            <li> I have medium long, thick platinum blonde hair that has been color treated for almost 9 years now.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it as a last step after a leave in cream conditioning product made by another manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and am so disappointed that they no longer make it.</li>
            <li> When using this product I shower, let it air dry a little &amp; spray all over.</li>
            <li> I use just a little bit of this stuff with my hair damp, scrunch it in and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> She had a hard time finding it locally, so I ordered a bunch on Amazon.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This item gave us some concern.  Was not available in stores.  After much research, we found this spray.  Ordered more than one so that the problem would be solved.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the price of Garnier products so I am always will to try them.  I have medium long, thick platinum blonde hair that has been color treated for almost 9 years now.  My hair tends to get dry, especially at the ends after every hair appointment.  I try to scrunch my hair as much as possible since heat can just damage it more then it already is.  Every time I get out of the shower, I towel dry my hair and spray it from root to tip with this product.  I put a leave in conditioner in first to help my hair stay hydrated.  I blow dry my hair for a few minutes then spray a little bit more for a wavier look.  My hair does turn out to be wavy but if I spray too much, it can look a little too wet and dry.  If applied right, the result is perfect.  Overall, it smells great and works when used properly.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> After reading tons of reviews &amp; looking for wave enhancing products, I was on a hunt for Fekkai&#x27;s marine beach spray. On my search at Target, I just happened to come across Garnier&#x27;s wave enhancing spray. It was &lt;$4 &amp; much cheaper than Fekkai&#x27;s $25 product, so I figured I had nothing to lose, plus I love Garnier&#x27;s hairsprays so I had some faith in this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy to say that I love this product! I have really long hair with a little bit of wave &amp; a lotta bit of frizz when I let it air dry. I have NEVER worn my hair wavy in public because the frizz is just not cute! When using this product I shower, let it air dry a little &amp; spray all over. I do some scrunching &amp; blow dry with a diffuser &amp; my hair comes out soft with great waves! Please take note that if this product is not giving you the results you want.. BLOW DRY WITH A DIFFUSER. My hair is very long &amp; medium in thickness so I&#x27;m sure the weight of my hair doesn&#x27;t allow it to wave ideally with all the product in it, but the diffuser makes a world of a difference! I&#x27;m so happy about this product. I can finally save my hair from all the heat damage it usually gets every day!</li>
            <li> I ordered this online for my mother - as we could not find in the stores.  She has used it for a while and loves it.</li>
            <li> Wonder waves is better than any other product I have ever tried!  I have wavy/curly hair that is very susceptible to friz.  After my shower I spray this into my damp hair and allow to air dry.  My hair forms into beautiful friz free curls and waves.  If they ever stop making this product I don&#x27;t know what I will do.  Better than any salon brands I have tried and I have tried a lot of stuff because who wants friz!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair I am determined to grow long...it&#x27;s to my shoulders now in long layers.  I have been experimenting with different products and am thrilled I got this!  I roll my hair in big rollers.  I take it down while it is still damp and spray Wonder Waves in it and scrunch.  I have waves that stay all day and my hair looks fuller!  It even works on dry hair if I want more curls.  Most products weigh down my hair and make it look greasy - not this!  I&#x27;m stocking up..can&#x27;t beat the price...I&#x27;d pay double for it!</li>
            <li> sticky and just not very nice overall.</li>
            <li> This was my &#x27;must&#x27; super spray gel in college, about 4 years ago. I have tried other brands since then, such as Pantene, Dove, Suave etc. and they are all OK, but this stuff is the best of them all (followed by the Dove curl creme- that stuff is great too but my hair soaks it up and I go through it too quickly). I use just a little bit of this stuff with my hair damp, scrunch it in and let it air dry. I twist my curls as they dry to give them more definition. :) I have naturally long, thin curly hair that looks thicker than it really is when dry.</li>
            <li> Love wonder waves, helps keep my curls looking better than any \\&quot;professional\\&quot; styling spray I ever used. Great to refresh your curls too.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wonder Waves for quite a while and can no longer find it in the stores for some reason. I have thick curly hair and Wonder Waves really helps define my curls without making them stiff or making my hair feel icky. And my hair looks good without a lot of styling. I am glad I found it online!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely unfortunate that I am unable to find this product on the shelves at any store around me. It&#x27;s my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; daily product. I have naturally wavy hair so this is perfect for me. Come back to the stores!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great! I have coarse curly hair that tends to be super frizzy. This product gives me frizz free beautifully defined curls. I typically use really expensive products on my hair, which really have been disappointing lately, so I tried this on a whim and I am glad I did. When I am done with this one I might try the one for curly hair and see how that one works. My routine is I put my hair in a t-shirt to dry it after the shower, (less frizz then with a towel) and combed through some John Freida Frizzease. Then I applied the wonder waves and scrunched it in. Then I diffused it till it was slightly damp and then I scrunched in some Garnier leave in conditioning cream, curl&amp;shine. My hair was soft and frizz free! I hghly recommend this product![[ASIN:B004ZWH3WC Garnier Fructis Style Wonder Waves Non Aero Hairspray, 8.50-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the brand, and the product does encourage waves, but it dries hard, and that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Are you envious of people who actually have straight or curly hair but not this in between mess that you have? To anyone who has fine, dry, and slightly wavy hair complete with flyaways to start with, this product is the best there is. If I could give it 6 stars I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I t-shirt (or towel) dried my hair for about 10-15 minutes.  Sprayed in some leave in conditioner and combed it out.  Then sprayed Wonder Waves pretty liberally into my damp hair, making sure to get the underneath pieces too. Then just began scrunching my hair allover with my hands, starting from the tips.  I didnt bother to twist it or put it up in a bun as it says in the instructions.  If you have thicker hair you might have to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then just let it air dry.  Nothing more too it, it wound up looking great. The girls at the office asked if I had gotten a wave perm. Seriously... so finally I have waves that are identifiable as waves not just a failed straight hair project. The frizzy flyaways seem more tamed too, I think maybe just some light hair spray once its dry might help to hold it all day. For once, a pretty style for our hair type that doesnt require a blow dryer, straight iron, and tons of product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite haircare product, but it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find. When you can find it, it retails for less than $4 per bottle (same size). Keeps my hair from looking frizzy and wild. I keep a bottle at home and my car. Has been a life saver and I pray they never stop making it! I usually use it as a last step after a leave in cream conditioning product made by another manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair curly all day but doesn&#x27;t make it stiff.  They aren&#x27;t carrying it at stores anymore here so I&#x27;m so glad I found it!</li>
            <li> works great.  leaves hair a little crispy, but once you run your fingers through it, they soften up and look great.  curls also last longer than with no product.  i would definitely recommend this.  great price and makes curly/wavy hair look nice and smooth and defines curls.</li>
            <li> Weirdly enough this works great on some days and less well on others, even if I use it in the same way. Sometimes it makes my hair crunchy and sometimes it makes great, soft waves. Don&#x27;t use it on wet hair, for sure. Seems to work best on next day hair.</li>
            <li> My wife likes using this product while putting waves in her hair.  She had a hard time finding it locally, so I ordered a bunch on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I tried everything with this product! I sprayed it on damp hair. I scrunched. I tried putting it on dry hair. Then scrunching. I tried putting a little on. I tried putting alot on. No result, except once when I sprayed it on damp and then more on dry. It added SOME wave to my hair that already has a slight wave. But it did leave a very sticky finish and I didnt really like how it looks either. I decided to give it to my mom, who has curly hair and was stealing this alot. She seems to like it. Bottom line, it didnt cut it for my fine hair (with some volume). I would reccomend it for people with thick curly hair, because my mom is in love with it lol. Three stars because it does work again, just really not on me.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out why Wonder Waves wasn&#x27;t on Garnier&#x27;s web site, so I asked the company.  Beginning next month (October 2012), they are phasing it out, and they \\&quot;can&#x27;t recommend anything in its place\\&quot; (their words).  This is extremely disappointing, as I have finally found a product that enhances my waves without my hair feeling sticky or crunchy (as it does when I use Garnier&#x27;s curl sculpting spray gel).  Wonder Waves leaves my hair soft, and the fragrance is really light and pleasant.  I guess the search begins for something comparable, while I buy up all the bottles I can afford!</li>
            <li> First off, let me just say I really do love this product. However, I only get one days use out of it. What I do is shower right before bed and then put my hair up in a messy bun and sleep on it all night. When I wake up in the morning I take my still slightly damp hair out of the bun and then scrunch it with the spray. It gives me very nice waves that last all day. The next morning though I have to wash it out right away other wise it is just to sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents in existence, and I am so glad I can still get it somewhere!</li>
            <li> I love this spray to use before styling with a curling iron. It holds the curls and the style lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF, PLEASE MAKE MORE, FRUCTIS!! A WAVY HAIRED GIRL IS BEGGING YOU.</li>
            <li> good but I will not buy this again.. doesnt work that much from straight hair.</li>
            <li> This product works great for my natural loose curly hair.  Keeps the curls and waves under control without being stiff.  Can&#x27;t be refreshed with just damp hands and scrunches in the hair.  This product give me &#x27;good hair&#x27; days!</li>
            <li> Garnier Fructic have nice products for curly / wavy hair. This is one of them.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find in the store any more. It&#x27;s the . Best hairstyles I&#x27;ve ever used. Holds hair but hair is still moveable and soft and bouncy. Great product and delivery was right on time.</li>
            <li> Works well, and gives great results when used in moderation. It does leave my hair a little wet looking, and hard to the touch, and I like that less. But with proper brushing following application, I can get a good look going on.&lt;br /&gt;I actually have naturally curly hair, and I had thought this would make the curls come out more. This was not the case, as my hair just became a bit harder. The curls became less defined, but instead more elongated and manageable, which is also good.</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my waves/curls activated when it&#x27;s wearing out after a perm.  It not only keeps the waves but holds and styles you hair in place.</li>
            <li> Does wavy curls well, smells good. Cannot find this at my local Target anymore, so had to buy online.  Good deal too</li>
            <li> It is a perfect gel to keep soft slight waves on my hair. Other product is too strong, and makes my hair stiff, and it does not look good at all. I cannot find GF Woner Waves in the stores any more, and I only hope they will keep making it. I will be very sorry if they stop making GD Wonder Waves flexible.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and am so disappointed that they no longer make it. Now we are being price gouged for the remaining supply available out there, which is usually sold at 3-4 times the original drugstore price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to age, hormones, or now living in Florida, but my once straight and manageable hair is wavy and frizzy in the Florida summers.  I&#x27;ve tried other, more expensive products, but this stuff is the best!  I can spray and scrunch my hair when it&#x27;s still damp and let it air dry. It gives me loose sort of beachy waves and if any are a little bit crunchy when my hair dries, it smooths out really easily.  It leaves my hair without frizz but with nice waves.  It&#x27;s the only way I can wear my hair &amp;#34;wash and go&amp;#34; and have it look decent.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery-Great Product</li>
            <li> So sorry they discontinued this product.  It really works for me, I put it on wet, run my fingers through the waves as they dry and am good for one sometimes 2 days!</li>
            <li> I have used other \\&quot;beach sprays\\&quot; in the past and they make my hair frizzy or  hard and sticky  Garnier Fructis Wonder Waves is amazing.  I have thick wavy hair.  Usually if I let it air dry, it goes completley frizzy.  If i run some finishing creme just on the roots and then spray this all over my hair while still damp, it will let my hair dry  without any frizz and with  nice waves all over.  I do not even have to scrunch it (but my hair is already wavy, this just controls it)  Recently my grocery store stopped carrying this and i had to buy something else and I tell you there is nothing better than the Wonder Waves product.  It is not sticky or hard in my hair.  It is literally just amazing! I am so happy to see I can buy it on amazon.</li>
