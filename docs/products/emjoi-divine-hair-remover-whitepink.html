            <li>I am in love with my Divine Hair Remover!!  </li>
            <li>i love this thing!!</li>
            <li>Comes very handy.</li>
            <li>it works OKAY at best.</li>
            <li>This is a great one to start with if you want to try it out without spending a good chunk of money.</li>
            <li>And best part of it is that it&#x27;s cheap as well!</li>
            <li>I read so many great reviews, it was affordable!</li>
            <li>product does what it says it is made for I love it :D</li>
            <li>Good product and great service</li>
            <li>Okay so this product is awesome!</li>
            <li>I searched for all the epilating products for the best reviews within my price range and this was at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>EASY TO USE WORKS GREAT!!</li>
            <li>I feel like this does a good job removing hair</li>
            <li>so this is a good solution.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie - it doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li>and I was good to go again.</li>
            <li>It was still bearable though and went fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li>I got this because I read some good review out of this, and this one is battery operated, so I can function it well in Asia, which run in 210-230 voltage, and when I tried this</li>
            <li>I went on you tube and saw some good reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>Battery life seems good.    </li>
            <li>I bought this because it had good reviews and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  </li>
            <li>SO that was GOOD...</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you want good results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good in removing hair with the roots.</li>
            <li>Good luck if you want to try,</li>
            <li>There is also the option of getting a chord, which is good too.</li>
            <li>I have owned others with cord, they were good, but a pain in the butt.</li>
            <li>It is a good fix between waxing.  </li>
            <li>Delivered on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Good but also time consuming&lt;</li>
            <li>well keep it its good deal .</li>
            <li>which is good.</li>
            <li>I think this was a good deal</li>
            <li>was looking for a good hair removal method.</li>
            <li>It did a good job at picking up the hairs.</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, this is not a shitty/cheap-o epilator, so you&#x27;re getting a good introduction without it costing a bundle.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on if they stay smooth for the 6 weeks quoted on the box, but if they prevent stubble for longer than 2 days, then it&#x27;s a great product in my book!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Good wish it plugged in the wall</li>
            <li>For me it doesn&#x27;t seem to grab the hairs as good as the emjoi slim.</li>
            <li>Good product to me</li>
            <li>I thought the multi blades would be good</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews were great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for underarms, but if you think you&#x27;ll be able to use it on your legs without getting ingrown hairs, think again.</li>
            <li>Works great for armpit and top of bikini line for me.</li>
            <li>Personally, I really love it on my armpits, bikini area, happy trail and arms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it all the time all throughout the year, but I&#x27;m very glad I bought it for the occasions when I opt for this strategy.  </li>
            <li>This hair remover works great and the price makes it even better.</li>
            <li>I find that it is best right after my shower, when the pores are &amp;#34;relaxed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I bought this item because I read so many great reviews on it but honestly, it does not work at all.</li>
            <li>Excellent service, I very highly recommend both the product and the seller!</li>
            <li>(many of the rechargeable epilators on the market can&#x27;t be used while plugged in!)</li>
            <li>(many of the rechargeable epilators on the market can&#x27;t be used while plugged in!)</li>
            <li>love this device!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to get easier with practice!</li>
            <li>Make sure you have AAA batteries!</li>
            <li>THIS EPILATOR WORKS FANTASTIC!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this, except it doesn&#x27;t come with a plug, and tells you to use as a batteries !  </li>
            <li>Way better than shaving though, no prickly armpits anymore!</li>
            <li>One of my girlfriends has an epilator with 74 tweezer heads and worked so much better!</li>
            <li>Works wonderful :) worth every penny!</li>
            <li>love my Emjoi!</li>
            <li>Otherwise I am pleased with it!</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was cheaper then most and would let me try this technique without breaking my bank!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love to use it and it keeps me hairfree for weeks!</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this I had already purchased the emjoi slim which I love, and still do!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t even been able to get on the computer to check their response to me and it was at my door!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed &amp; have since replaced this with a laser one which is clearly better, but for the money, not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>it works great its cheap without having compromised quality.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I have re-chargable batteries and also just happened to have a 100-240V AC Adapter that works great with it.  </li>
            <li>I liked this epilator when it worked but after a couple of months the heads stopped spinning.</li>
            <li>This product is effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ripping hairs out at the root and honestly</li>
            <li>I used the epilator according to the instruction, I also used it considering the tips of one of the reviewers on here, and tried my own methods.</li>
            <li>and it has held up nicely.    </li>
            <li>I skipped the part where I should have let my legs and stuff soak in warm water before use.</li>
            <li>Just went ahead and bought myself my own.</li>
            <li>it would work nicely for</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good price for it as well :)</li>
            <li>, It works fast and, the best, It is cordless.  </li>
            <li>I liked this, but for some reason it gives me a lot of ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>and I liked what it did.</li>
            <li>Nice quality.</li>
            <li>This removes those nicely as well the increasing amount of peach fuzz I seem to be getting.</li>
            <li>It was really effective once I figured out that I needed to hold it in the counter-intuitive way -- with the logo away from the body.</li>
            <li>I loved the price, but the quality was okay.</li>
            <li>This product works better then any that I have ever tried and the price is good too</li>
            <li>This item came nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>It kind of numbs out the area you are working on.</li>
            <li>nice item to buy</li>
            <li>I own two at the moment.</li>
            <li>The feel of the product is nice and well built.</li>
            <li>to each its own tho.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this method of hair removal for about 25 years now, and the improvements in home tools is remarkable, but this tool has a curvature that does not allow the tool reach the skin easily.  </li>
            <li>My husband thinks it&#x27;s cute, but I don&#x27;t! : ).  </li>
            <li>This item received good reviews after spending about 30 minutes researching a great epilator for a decent price.  </li>
            <li>Would have liked it to work plugged in better.</li>
            <li>Good, cheap starter.</li>
            <li>and I found that using the slower speed was more effective in removing hair instead of just breaking it off.</li>
            <li>i bought this  one because the advertising made sound good.  </li>
            <li>It worked great, but I noticed to get the best (as in quickest and less pain) results, I had to replace the batteries</li>
            <li>So now it as easy as brushing my teeth!</li>
            <li>but I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure glad I did! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure glad I did! :)</li>
            <li>Try to get one that is rechargeable (this one is not) because it is amazing how nice it is to sit in a comfortable chair and watch a show while doing this</li>
            <li>this point I was feeling pretty brave and decided to tackle my underarms.</li>
            <li>can use this epilator anytime pretty much lol.</li>
            <li>It was a great choice, for a my first epilator.</li>
            <li>So I started with a very light tap.</li>
            <li>Also, very cheap.</li>
            <li>When it does, the results are great, but I have to wonder if there are others out there that would get more hair on the first pass.      </li>
            <li>That is how you get it.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I have very smooth skin using the very affordable Emjoi.</li>
            <li>Waxing was much better.</li>
            <li>I am not even sure if it even grabs the longest hair at all.</li>
            <li>I figured if the process was something I couldn&#x27;t go through more than once than I&#x27;d better not break the bank.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it on my underarms and my bikini line and it does well in those areas.</li>
            <li>This hurt slightly more than my legs, even with trimming the hairs to an appropriate length beforehand.</li>
            <li>but I chalk this up to my inexperience more than the fault of the epilator.</li>
            <li>but for the most part the contoured shape is not</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get it to grab just about every</li>
            <li>things considered I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get it to grab just about every</li>
            <li>things considered I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>ok purchase</li>
            <li>On top of that, sometimes I&#x27;d forget to shave in the shower</li>
            <li>Letting hair grow out then using it hurts way more.</li>
            <li>It would have just been nicer and more hygienic to be able to get all the hair out of the device somehow.</li>
            <li>The pain was bearable, but I think that&#x27;s because most of the hair wasn&#x27;t being pulled from the root.</li>
            <li>I *love</li>
            <li>And then reward myself with ice cream :)</li>
            <li>Tho of course, I&#x27;ll have to wait a month to be able to do it again ^_____^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I know what real pain is lol</li>
            <li>so I was not quite sure what the felling would be like</li>
            <li>I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to jump on top of the line while I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>It turned out I got more than I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad it gives you the time to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t push the head downward, it won&#x27;t make the tweezers grab more hair but the direction and the angle of it will.</li>
            <li>Most of the time the tweezers catch the hair</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it.</li>
            <li>but I can say I&#x27;m glad I got this.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll upgrade to a pricier one and hope for slightly better results.</li>
            <li>Give your armpits time to adjust and the end results are lovely and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Now, even after the battery was replaced, it doesn&#x27;t work for more than 5 seconds.</li>
            <li>painless\\&quot; well that is comical.</li>
            <li>the curved style in the best, and may try my next model a \\&quot;straight\\&quot; head model.</li>
            <li>in a cute box like you bought it from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to do my bikini line and it just brought tears to my eyes</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was scared but that hurts more so if you are like me</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Cheap!</li>
            <li>So much more affordable than I would have thought.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I got this</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>More like a bite or pinch.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I dropped it so many times that I thought it was indistructable.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this thing.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be able to tolerate the pain since tweezing has never hurt me...</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it since i did pay for it 8)</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t let there be any more than a week of razor stubble, or it will hurt worse.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>but i went through so many batteries</li>
            <li>would do a better job, but i bought the cheapest one i found just to try it out.</li>
            <li>It missed SO many hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about getting a numbing cream just so I can use it more.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It will hurt, it will take forever, the batteries used will be many.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>it delivers more pain than results.  </li>
            <li>I could tolerate the pain if I got good results, but these results are far from good.</li>
            <li>This will be more \\&quot;painful\\&quot; in areas with thicker hair as well.)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li>However, even if you have to go over an area more than once, you have to be sure to hold your skin taught in the area you are removing hair.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>But it could be better.</li>
            <li>After repeated use, it does make my leg hairs grow in softer and much more sparsely.</li>
            <li>More stingy than anything.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, it does pull out the roots, but it also just pulls out the hair instead of the roots.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be able to notice that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not go over the area more than 2-3 times because it will irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>Warning: Stings 3x more than the legs!&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>I let it grow out so it would work better.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this product, but it isn&#x27;t the best out there.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>The longer the hair, the more pain.  </li>
            <li>And I love the color, cute</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m actually pleased w/the product.</li>
            <li>I wasin&#x27;t even sure would work)</li>
            <li>so if you don&#x27;t you may have better results.</li>
            <li>Most of the hair was still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>If you want to know more about it just wikipedia it.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the epilator and recommend it to anyone with body</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>Body scrub - Helps some of the ingrown hairs and it does leave your skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>After this one dies on me, I will probably invest in a better quality epilator.</li>
            <li>so I figured it would be safe in case</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m definitely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>and I was pinching more than plucking.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that it didn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li>I have nothing to compare this to, but I am pleased.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>any day I want at ok</li>
            <li>needs stronger energy source of power maybe an electronic one would be better than this battery powered one.</li>
            <li>But Most Of My Hairs Were Cut Off.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>It does not get better with time.</li>
            <li>I had one years ago that was OK but just never removed all the hair.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>i would have been better shaving my arms.</li>
            <li>these seem to work okay, but eat batteries like no tomorrow.  </li>
            <li>which I trust and have been using for many years.</li>
            <li>but I still love this product.</li>
            <li>dots aren&#x27;t that cute IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve learned that when you hear it starting to run slower, it&#x27;s best to change the batteries.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I think she paid more for hers, and it did a better job than this one does.</li>
            <li>i do this every night after my shower and my legs have been smooth ever since!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see how much better that gets with time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2/9/13: I purchased a Braun Epilator that was stronger/better according to reviews and was going to relegate this one to a travel Epilator if the Braun was better.  </li>
            <li>Yet when I used this, it didn&#x27;t pull out many hairs at all.</li>
            <li>since i only use it for one area, this lower priced model is perfect for me!</li>
            <li>I think having a version that plugs in would be better.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>But was able to get through it....</li>
            <li>but it is surely embarassing.</li>
            <li>i would love to be able to return this item that i purchased from amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>After my ordered AP-9L was DOA and returned for refund, I read more reviews and ordered the Emjoi Divine AP-17B.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used an epilator and was pleased to find reviews stating user satisfaction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update after 1 month: I&#x27;ve now used it 3 times and remain pleased.</li>
            <li>It is much better than using tweezer/shaving/waxing.</li>
            <li>It is like shaving but better</li>
            <li>For my arm pits i only use this epilator and its awesome.</li>
            <li>Very worth it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective and makes a significant difference in the underarm area if you&#x27;re looking to lighten up that area.</li>
            <li>I found that motioning up at an angle tends to pull more hair successfully than just straight up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But while it worked it did a pretty good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It plucked out the hair pretty good</li>
            <li>For the price, I guess it&#x27;s pretty good -</li>
            <li>I have a pretty good tolerance for pain</li>
            <li>I think this is a pretty good intro to epilating hair remover.  </li>
            <li>it is a pretty good epilator</li>
            <li>good for the women this worked for, but please be cautious when trying it out for the first time.</li>
            <li>Does a pretty good job about eliminating unwanted hair though.</li>
            <li>I just had higher hopes because my emjoi slim is soooooo good</li>
            <li>It hurt when I first started, but now that I&#x27;m used to it, it almost feels good.  </li>
            <li>My best advice for using this product is to drink a few glasses of wine first and then go to your happy place.</li>
            <li>The package says you can buy a cord from another website, but I bought rechargeable batteries and that works fine (and the charger works for both AA and AAA, so I can use it for most of my batteries)</li>
            <li>The item shipped fast and was exactly as described; I just don&#x27;t think the product itself is very good.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi Divine Hair Remover, White/Pink was a very good product, however, it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as the more expensive kind, but for the price i am satisfied.</li>
            <li>but so far it seems great.</li>
            <li>Ideally, you should really only use this on your underarms.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth my skin feels after epilating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a cheap epilator and</li>
            <li>I am glad to be free of that.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item from Amazon a month ago and wanted to really give it a fair test run before writing my review.</li>
            <li>Lots of good advise from lots of ladies, thanks.  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold when using,    </li>
            <li>It does seem to hurt more if you are hormonal but on a regular day it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>easy to hold in your hands and wrap fingers around&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use...</li>
            <li>Return was easy though, so</li>
            <li>so this was easy to use.</li>
            <li>Batteries drain very quickly.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and easy to carry also.</li>
            <li>Batteries are easy to change, the battery cover slips off for inserting the 3 AAA.</li>
            <li>Now I just need to brave the bikini area, ripping hair out is not pleasant but ssooo worth being able to throw out the razaorit!!!</li>
            <li>Take a warm bath first to loosen up the pores.</li>
            <li>It did kind of hurt the first time, but after that it didnt.  </li>
            <li>If this is true, I would say getting a better one will pay off in not buying batteries in the end.</li>
            <li>so happy that having a socially acceptable amount of body hair is no longer something thy</li>
            <li>The razor is working fine now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my hair is to fine or course</li>
            <li>It could grab and pluck even fine hairs without a lot of over-stroking.  </li>
            <li>Pulled out some hairs, pain level was fine for what it is, but broke</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the purchase :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not recommended for fine hairs at all.</li>
            <li>Hurts extraordinarily!</li>
            <li>If you move the hair remover in a circle motion, it tends to remove more hair and it gets the job done relatively quick.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for my armpits and it makes them super smooth.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>My bestfriend had told me about the &amp;#34;epilator&amp;#34; so I bought the cheapest one witht he best reviews, I am hoping to get a more expensive one with better reviews soon!</li>
            <li>is a huge plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is a huge plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT NOTE, the HUGE DOWNSIDE: this thing takes forever,</li>
            <li>for everyone that thought it didn&#x27;t work, try an adapter on it, makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Fortunately Emjoi sells adapter cords for this unit so it can be used while plugged into the wall which remedies this</li>
            <li>and I think the sound is the scariest part about it.</li>
            <li>so it takes a bit more effort to remove the hair but deff worth it.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I am overall happy with it for my desired use.  </li>
            <li>, my armpits are baby smooth.</li>
            <li>my arms and my calves are so silky smooth atm!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it primarily for my bikini line area.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to shave as often and my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall great product</li>
            <li>I like the smooth feel, but do not get it with this product.  </li>
            <li>It does sound kinda like an electric razor.</li>
            <li>(gosh didn&#x27;t even know if it would fit.</li>
            <li>It is such a great investment (including rechargeable batteries).</li>
            <li>I would use it just for keeping my legs smooth, probably not to start from scratch.</li>
            <li>Light, durable, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I do still like how smooth I feel after epilating.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is completely comfortable to use, because it massages your skin.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy It</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean..</li>
            <li>It takes forever to get two inches of my leg smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this is time consuming, and to be hair free you&#x27;ll need to use it for awhile.</li>
            <li>Years have passed and I decided to give the Emjoi another chance at making me hair-free and fabulous.</li>
            <li>my arms were smooth for a couple of days, then i started to get bumps.</li>
            <li>I primarily use the epilator when the warmer weather rolls around, and just stick to lower maintenance shaving in the winter, when I&#x27;m covered by clothing anyway.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been completely smooth for 3 days.  </li>
            <li>I think the majority of them leaving me anything but smooth.</li>
            <li>(it was cheap with free shipping too) and that made all the difference.  </li>
            <li>I got scared because of the reviews saying that it hurt, so went cheap, and learned that it doesn&#x27;t hurt what-so-ever.</li>
            <li>With this being on the cheap end of the epilators, I just say that I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>Glides smoothly over skin pulling hair from its roots.</li>
            <li>The box states battery-operated, there is no mention of an available adapter in the instructions, but there is an input at the bottom of the unit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It definitely takes a few sets of batteries to REALLY learn the best way to use this thing, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;ll become your best friend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually very pleasantly surprised by how good of a job this epilator does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually very pleasantly surprised by how good of a job this epilator does.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I had tried a friend&#x27;s Emjoi, and I liked it for my upper lip, so I decided to get one of my own.</li>
            <li>, I liked my old one better</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to be able to do more in a shorter amount of time but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case because I repeatedly have to go over sections.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very useful in the summer and has resulted in the thinning of the epilated hair.</li>
            <li>I find that using it right when the hairs are still pretty short is best.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what it says it does, and just a hint: make sure you use super fresh batteries so its faster and get dones faster :)</li>
            <li>Reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Products made by Emjoi in general had good reviews in Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so excited once I received it but held off on using it for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I needed :)</li>
            <li>and by then I was so excited to use it</li>
            <li>many it started buzzing funny</li>
            <li>which is what I originally purchased  this item for.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>first time I used it I felt like I was not going to be able to finish the process.</li>
            <li>so you know its crucial&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this epilator excited to use&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this is the first time i purchased an epilator, but I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>It was a great buy to introduce me to epilating at a reasonable price, but getting a better product was necessary once I decided to stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, again, the results make it well worth it!    </li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t realize exactly how many times I&#x27;d have to go over the area that I wanted removed.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited for those results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems like a great product I hope it lasts me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>clean it often  4.</li>
            <li>But you&#x27;ll get a few week&#x27;s worth of awesome looking underarms for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also spray the head with 90% alcohol solution to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did a really clean job, I did not have to do any plucking</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other enjoy products that work great bit</li>
            <li>there was, I guess I had set my expectations pretty high for some pain, but surprisingly, after the first couple pulls (just like tweezing your eyebrows) it becomes \\&quot;nothing\\&quot; to finish the job!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to recieve this item.</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;m used to my original hair remover and the quick and efficient job it did.</li>
            <li>But, this is great if you&#x27;re not sure about epilating, mainly because of the price, but also because it&#x27;s a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>, it is cheap and very efficient also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and I believe this is why the pain was so much more intense.</li>
            <li>This one gives you full control.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t try to use it on your bikini area unless you&#x27;re cool with experiencing the pain of a Brazilian wax x10.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t seem to get them out good enough</li>
            <li>I have 4 kids and a full time job</li>
            <li>This is a good epilator and simple one to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve emailed the company to tell them that i want a full refund.</li>
            <li>I have saved so much money with my Emjoi; I love the fact that I can use this in the privacy of my home instead of getting waxed at a beauty salon.</li>
            <li>The batteries last a good while</li>
            <li>I found this one to be just as good and will use it for travel in the future (no adapters to bring along, no worries about voltage or plugs when abroad etc...</li>
            <li>It removes the hair and does not make the skin feel sore but is not quite as good as it could be for the upper lip.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product who wants a safe product to use.</li>
            <li>Its true</li>
            <li>and finally I broke it for good.</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I am very prone to ingrown hairs, so I mostly prefer to use an electric trimmer on this area.  </li>
            <li>So many women complaining about how much it hurt.  </li>
            <li>but it stopped working after only three times of use, and my hairs are very fine and not that many.</li>
            <li>This one was easy to use for a beginner: unpack from the box, add batteries, read the pamphlet on how-to, took a hot shower, exfoliated, and went right to it!</li>
            <li>The cord would be a worthy investment since this hair remover was such a good price.</li>
            <li>My original machine was defective and died after the first two uses, and they immediately sent me a replacement!</li>
            <li>Such a great product for such a cheap price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the seller was fantastic!</li>
            <li>Other than that I think it&#x27;s a great alternative for hair removal.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li>I love this thing, much more power and pulls the hair out in much less time then the Remington even did (more tweezers).</li>
            <li>A quick swap of the batteries</li>
            <li>Adequate hair removal device.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>After a quick youtube search one user suggested trying an Epilator for hair removal.</li>
            <li>I had to go over the same areas many times in order to remove most of the hair.</li>
            <li>If you are on the fence, want to getrid of body hair without messing with the wax and have the stomach for mildly masochistic methods in the pursuit of beauty (and what woman doesn&#x27;t?)</li>
            <li>If I try this type product again, I&#x27;ll pay the extra money and get an electrical one in hopes that more power will give it more pull.</li>
            <li>My wife liked it very much very cute small one.</li>
            <li>It took a bit of getting used to, but it pulls out hairs quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>and my skin is super</li>
            <li>The batteries are drained too quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a more substantial unit than the AP-9L as it has 36 tweezer discs and many features such as massaging fingers.</li>
            <li>but I think I like the more simple models better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li>I loved that it was light and portable, and pink!</li>
            <li>I have only tried on my legs and they are very smooth!</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;s still pretty smooth to touch once done.</li>
            <li>Only used once but results turned out pretty good.</li>
            <li>This product is good for those who are not sure if you&#x27;re going to be able to handle the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; of an epilator.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this one as I&#x27;m quite sure they do the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>Do not be discouraged during your first use!</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator!</li>
            <li>I feel confident the hair will take time to come back, when it does it will be easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>This epilator has been fine, I suggest getting some rechargeable batteries if you use it much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the tricks and this still doesn&#x27;t work very well with my fine body hair.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it on your legs or armpits but it gets rid of fine hair very well.</li>
            <li>The hair will start to grow back slower, and you&#x27;ll feel much more confident in your new smooth</li>
            <li>Works great but does pull a little.  </li>
            <li>It did a pretty decent job, but for the parts that it missed, I&#x27;ll just shave it off until i get a better hang of the epilator.</li>
            <li>I bout it for my wife ,she is very happy with it ,It is simply great product with low price which is hard to get such balance on Items nowadays</li>
            <li>I, myself have used it several times and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>it was a waste for me but may be great for someone else</li>
            <li>my underarms are the only place that had amazing results (thinner hair and slowed growth) from epilating.</li>
            <li>You do have to go over the area a few times but it does remove the hair and at a great price.</li>
            <li>As far as the product, I love it.</li>
            <li>Buuut hair grows back much more... smoothly(?)</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has become most frequently used gadget of mine.</li>
            <li>It does cause a bit of irritation and will leave the skin kind of red</li>
            <li>(Plus only $23 was nice)</li>
            <li>Used old plug but works better with AAA battery.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I might have been more surprised because I&#x27;ve never waxed before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so worth it...</li>
            <li>My daughter could not handle it, but she is not into the beauty is worth the pain and effort mindset.</li>
            <li>51 years old and have discovered epillating and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>And I have to say it&#x27;s well worth your money.</li>
            <li>I didnt think it had enough tweezers and speed honestly..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price just for that.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the result....</li>
            <li>but like I said before its time consuming, probably take me 15 minutes on just one leg but its worth it</li>
            <li>I tried it after taking a warm bath to exfoliate my skin, open my pores, and soften the hair.</li>
            <li>and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It took me forever to get both of my legs done, but within a week I knew it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Honestly I just went back to shaving.</li>
            <li>So it is worth it.</li>
            <li>The biggest difference is that b/c this one has a curved edge going upwards, you have to make sure that the hair you&#x27;re trying to remove is completely centered.</li>
            <li>It was worth it for me.</li>
            <li>The results were totally worth the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even fresh out the shower, I still looked like I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow (and my razor gets the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever seen).</li>
            <li>So I decided to buy this as my first epilator back in May, and i love it!</li>
            <li>I originally was using a Tweezie and this works so much better for upper lip and chin area.  </li>
            <li>it will go thru batteries pretty quickly, so either nab some rechargeable</li>
            <li>Runs through batteries pretty quickly but has lasted me til now.</li>
            <li>Good thing about it is that most locations which give you the most pain are hidden from the public view, so you can take as much time as you wish.</li>
            <li>This Emjoi is very travel friendly.</li>
            <li>so when one runs out the other one is good to go.</li>
            <li>all stubbly and leave a shadow right after shaving.</li>
            <li>right after it arrives (which mine did in 4 days)</li>
            <li>Got this in the mail yesterday and used it right away.</li>
            <li>Move the epilator head in the right</li>
            <li>right in about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>It does get rid of the hair, you can see the hair being plucked right out, but the pain is the downside.</li>
            <li>This is just right for me.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t hold this just right, it pulls your skin in.  </li>
            <li>- the price was right for me to try it out.  </li>
            <li>price is right for seeing you want to try this type of hair removal.</li>
            <li>right well it&#x27;s been a year and the bumps are still there</li>
            <li>take-away on epilator a is that they are perfect for busy people who just don&#x27;t want to shave everyday!</li>
            <li>It does hurt the first few times but works great.  </li>
            <li>It plugs the hair perfectly fine, even if hair break sometimes, but that is perfectly normal and can&#x27;t be avoided.</li>
            <li>Yes, the pain is very much there, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>If you are currently waxing, it is a cheap and easy transition.  </li>
            <li>Most of the sensation you get is from the vibrations of the rotating piece, so you barely notice the pain from plucking.</li>
            <li>I just used my epilator for over an hour straight and the batteries were still full of power at the end of that timeframe.</li>
            <li>When the device is running at full power, it is fast.  </li>
            <li>This was a battery operated hair remover (first mistake, always get one with a power cord for consistent/constant power) and after opening the package, I immediately put in fresh batteries and turned it on.  </li>
            <li>but I think I should of invested a little more for a more durable product.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll probably by irritated after the first couple uses too, so be prepared and don&#x27;t epilate right before you go out or</li>
            <li>Overall I am super excited!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is just me, but I experienced a lot of ingrown hairs on my legs after my first use.</li>
            <li>Another bonus was I had enough Amazon points that I got this for free and free shipping with the Amazon Prime</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s cute, girly, and cheap</li>
            <li>I am so liking this little guy that I have worn him out, he doesn&#x27;t work as good as he did, so I am retiring it and going on to the 72 tweezer machine.</li>
            <li>You can feel it less pain and the tweezers grab the hair more easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*update*&lt;br /&gt;Photos have been posted.&lt;br /&gt;Continuous run time(in high setting) on full charged Eneloop(2000mah) is 2 hours 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Your legs are so much more sensitive than your arms that I really highly recommend you shower before hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very fast too - use it on my arms mostly, but will probably try it on my legs next.</li>
            <li>some brushing and blowing the air makes it clean as new.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase in this type of product</li>
            <li>SUERTE CHICAS ;)</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s exactly what it feels like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d actually call it more of a medium discomfort but either way</li>
            <li>a hindrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself feels pretty sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>So I was a bit scared to use this at first.</li>
            <li>the first time I used it, I was in the school car rider line waiting for my kids</li>
            <li>I tried my first epilator which is Braun 3 on the store counter and found out the same result when I tried this one, so I&#x27;m glad I got this with cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>This was my first epilator that I ever used and purchased.</li>
            <li>First time is the hardest and takes the longest.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like matter of minutes if you use it regularly.</li>
            <li>and it got here really fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Hispanic and have some pretty unsightly hair under my chin that this takes care of for me.</li>
            <li>Since this is my first I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else</li>
            <li>My first epilator.</li>
            <li>Try going with the hair first</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>I bought this epilator 3 months ago, and it worked well for the first week.</li>
            <li>Some spots, no matter how many times I go over, wont be silky totally hairless</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>First here&#x27;s a heads up.</li>
            <li>I think I will eventually get a more expensive model though I have recommended this to my mother and friends because it really does a great job.</li>
            <li>I used it on my arms first and did both arms within like 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I think the hair was too short and too coarse - if it had been longer I&#x27;m sure it would have worked better</li>
            <li>I bought batteries at first</li>
            <li>First off I am a latina</li>
            <li>it seems to help if you shower first  5.</li>
            <li>It really works and it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not something you can use by itself most of the time because if hairs are too short, you will have to tweeze or shave them.</li>
            <li>Holy moly, prepare yourself before going in the first time.</li>
            <li>I did my lower leg first on one day</li>
            <li>First time every purchasing an epilator for my missus.</li>
            <li>Make sure you also get something to exfoliate the dead/dry skin so that way your legs get smoother and DEFINITELY use lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first time trying to use it,, doesnt even turn on.</li>
            <li>I suggest you take a hot shower and exfoliate before using it.</li>
            <li>The first day i got it</li>
            <li>(I would advise first time users to shave the area first because it hurts when the hairs are longer.</li>
            <li>This is my first time writing a review on amazon</li>
            <li>This is my first time to use this type of device - recommend over a razor and cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are no uncomfortable cuts with the Emjoi as with a razor.</li>
            <li>I will probably be using this for many years to come, but will reorder if necessary from this seller.</li>
            <li>I stick to my legs and my upper lip and am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re thinking of buying an epilator for the first time, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be worth it in the long run, and epilating is SO much better than shaving and waxing.</li>
            <li>This was my first epilator</li>
            <li>And I personally feel that my pores are more noticeable.</li>
            <li>so I read as many reveiws as possible on as many diffrent products as possible.</li>
            <li>It does take awhile the first time you use it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used an adapter cord with it and it works so much better because of the extra power the cord gives it.</li>
            <li>So this was my first try at one of these.</li>
            <li>this was my first time ever epilating.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m really glad i tried it, because now i&#x27;ll never go back</li>
            <li>Be aware of what you are buying.</li>
            <li>I just used mine for the first time and did both lower legs, forearms and bikini area.</li>
            <li>I am a waxer and am pretty pain tolerant in this arena.</li>
            <li>I know there are recommendations that specifically say what direction to move the device over your skin, but I found that in order to get most of the hair I had to sort of wing it and go over the same areas many times in various directions.</li>
            <li>Please note it takes time the first time you use it if you never have pulled hairs out of your body and it does hurt until the endorphins kick in.</li>
            <li>my first epilator to be exact.</li>
            <li>I had bled the first time.</li>
            <li>It was my first time using one.  </li>
            <li>Overall this product seems an ok as a  starter, because it gives you a sense as to what others systems, like this one, feel and seem like.</li>
            <li>At First</li>
            <li>This is my favorite personal care tool!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time did hurt quite a bit, but it&#x27;s bearable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to upgrade to a higher end type once this one craps out</li>
            <li>and it was my first time trying an epilator.</li>
            <li>when i first got it, i tried it on my legs.</li>
            <li>at first i thought i was allergic reaction to something else, but i realized that some of the bumps looked like ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>i would recommend trying it on a small patch of hair in an unnoticeable place.&lt;br /&gt;the only reason i gave this two stars instead of one, is because if you&#x27;re going to try it, this is probably the best deal and size to try.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li>This model is also very affordable!</li>
            <li>but I love it for the underarm area because with shaving I always look like I haven&#x27;t shaved two hours later.</li>
            <li>And, at first it took a while</li>
            <li>This works exactly like</li>
            <li>In reading the Amazon reviews, one reviewer recommended having a glass of wine before the first time.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even imagine how much money i&#x27;ve saved on wax!.  </li>
            <li>Love this elipator, gonna invest in a rechargeable one next...</li>
            <li>Maybe I have a higher tolerance of pain, but I felt none at all..</li>
            <li>But the battery died fast!</li>
            <li>First time epilating ever.....</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got it .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li>I have always been an avid brazilian waxer.  </li>
            <li>like I had to do when I first waxed.  </li>
            <li>this is not the first one i have purchased, so i know they do not do 100% of a job</li>
            <li>I tried using it on my bikini area and not only did it hurt a lot, it didn&#x27;t even pluck most of the hairs.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well on the hairs that I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;Trying to remove.</li>
            <li>Ok, so you&#x27;re pulling each individual hair out by the root.</li>
            <li>But that ended up being because it was still my first time.</li>
            <li>Thanks again, guys!</li>
            <li>this is my first epilator, i didn&#x27;t want to buy a super pricey high end model until i knew i&#x27;d like using one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s portable, easy to handle, &amp; powerful enough for all the jobs I need it for.</li>
            <li>Buy the battery operated is not strong power wise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 3 times with new batteries and the batteries drained pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I initially bought this model because of the price, not wanting to invest a large amount into something I had never used before and wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d stick with.</li>
            <li>I initially bought this model because of the price, not wanting to invest a large amount into something I had never used before and wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d stick with.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to sit still long enough to use it on my legs, but I think it would be worthwhile to give it</li>
            <li>Luckily for me those fine hairs are usually blonde and you can&#x27;t really see them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i honestly can&#x27;t see myself using this anywere other than my underarms.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months now and my leg hair is finally growing back in slowly, very light and fine</li>
            <li>I apparently have really fine hair</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure after the initial use it will be much quicker and easier,spot checking so to speak.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i found it&#x27;s helpful to move the epilator in a circular pattern instead of just straight lines back &amp; forth-grips some of the stubborn hairs better.</li>
            <li>It works at first and you will love how it&#x27;s ripping the hair out of the root but in the long run it will ruin your skin</li>
            <li>it works great on long hairs but not so hot for shorter ones... who wants hairs in unwanted places to get long and shabby before they can be handled by the product?</li>
            <li>Btw, it drains batteries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>but I did it and after the first time it doesn&#x27;t really hurt at all.</li>
            <li>It does eat up the batteries pretty fast</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator which means i dont have much to compare it to</li>
            <li>I own three different sizes and useful for different purpose.</li>
            <li>Not worth is in my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>and then I don&#x27;t know if the pain stopped, or if I denied the pain because I loved how effective it is at removing excess facial hair that I was frustratingly plucking for years.</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;ve found that I have to go over areas several times, and that fine hairs are often not picked up.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your skin and hair are dry.</li>
            <li>The pain was not what I expected, it&#x27;s more a hot feeling than a plucked feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy and simple to use!  </li>
            <li>&amp; make sure the area is dry before you start working on it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work long enough for me to tell if it would have done a good job or not.</li>
            <li>As my first epilator I was a little unsure whether or not it would be worth the money since I have tried many none shaving approaches.  </li>
            <li>The IMPORTANT tip is to use your free hand to hold down the skin you&#x27;re about to do.</li>
            <li>It takes out MOST not every single one of your hairs</li>
            <li>rounded shape of the head gets in the way once in a while (ie: while doing my arms up by my wrist bones, in certain places around my knees, etc.)</li>
            <li>I would not use it for large areas like legs.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re gonna epilate more sensitive areas, slather on cream with lidocaine, wait 20 min, and be sure to be careful with thin skinned areas, but you&#x27;ll be more smooth than you&#x27;ve been before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many years ago, when this technology was new, a relative tried it and described torture.  </li>
            <li>Pulling the skin taut in areas with more dense hair and/or loose skin helps minimize the pain quite a bit as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emjoi</li>
            <li>The third time, I was fine.</li>
            <li>it seemed to work fine (definitely NOT painless, but not unbearable).</li>
            <li>It works, but you have to go over the skin OVER AND OVER; It broke a lot of hairs before actually pulling them, even though I have really fine hair.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of purchasing an epilator for the first time, I highly recommend watching this video :</li>
            <li>Love this little guy, love the process of the hair growing in thinner, softer, and at different intervals.  </li>
            <li>I quickly got used to the pain, and when I started lightly exfoliating every other day (damp washcloth after showering), the ingrown hairs stopped.  </li>
            <li>I had used on most delicate skin but was still comfortable.</li>
            <li>When you turn it on and see the really fast rotation and hear the motor running it can be intimidating.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend the Emoji!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t work at all really</li>
            <li>It works fast and took out the unwanted hairs.</li>
            <li>Really hurts as it tugs on the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Once you get the job done, keeping it is much easier.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I would much prefer this hair remover if there was a power cord</li>
            <li>so I have nothing to compare it to, but I can say that it works very well</li>
            <li>Since I was already plucking the hair in that spot, it really didn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>I would recommend the straight head, not the curved head, model since the skin is rougher, tougher and thicker and won&#x27;t get pinched.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it has the same pain amount as waxing but at least you can do it at your own pace in your home.  </li>
            <li>They both work very well.</li>
            <li>the product itself isnt really workin out for me.</li>
            <li>the process is also very time consuming.</li>
            <li>Hair grows much slower.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Very time consuming.</li>
            <li>Would be much faster to just shave.</li>
            <li>but I feel that is very painless to use, uses a lot of battery though so invest in some rechargeable ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>I really like this epilator</li>
            <li>what is beauty with no pain haha, i will rate this 4 stars since i&#x27;ve use it just once</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t pull out all the hairs at once, rather it took out a lot of the thicker hairs, but left the finer ones, so you&#x27;ll feel your leg feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>This epilator is cheap, and was bought because my British one doesn&#x27;t work in the US.</li>
            <li>I use to have the Epilady coil shaver which works really well.</li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>This epilator does it job very well.</li>
            <li>It is used w/batteries which I don&#x27;t like because they die to fast.</li>
            <li>And it really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it gets my skin extra smooth</li>
            <li>I was unsure of which Emjoi model to buy, this one or the corded/rechargeable version that is almost twice as much money.</li>
            <li>The hair remover also removes hair at a much shorter length.  </li>
            <li>it makes it MUCH EASIER</li>
            <li>It was very time consuming and hurt like hell.</li>
            <li>However, I much prefer a bit of momentary pain (which does diminish each session, just like waxing) then the razor bumps and infected ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>But who wants to wait for that?</li>
            <li>Really been wanting to try an epilator.</li>
            <li>I got it hoping it would work really well</li>
            <li>I gave it a two because it really didn&#x27;t pull out the hairs well.</li>
            <li>It works very well and ends up paying for itself with money saved with not needing to buy razors.</li>
            <li>I had never used an epilator, but was very attracted to the idea of not having to worry about shaving my legs so often.</li>
            <li>Very easy!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I do find htis item to be comfortable, I am either dense or the facial hair is coarser and the Emjoi can&#x27;t pick it up.  </li>
            <li>I thought the pain would be too much and that it might not work that</li>
            <li>but with this, i dont so much.</li>
            <li>I am very prone to ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a razor in over 3 months, and I noticed the hair is really sparse</li>
            <li>Otherwise very tolerable.</li>
            <li>This worked very well.</li>
            <li>It is another $17 including shipping, but then it will be battery capable and corded too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!  </li>
            <li>It is too gentle and does not remove hairs.</li>
            <li>your skin gets used to it and it becomes much easier if you keep up with it.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my legs and it didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>works really well..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good&lt;br /&gt;منتج</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m use to tweezing my chin and found this to be pain free... only delivered a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>Instead of pulling the hair as a whole, it would break the hair.</li>
            <li>I found this accidently and loveeee it soooo much.</li>
            <li>and i haven&#x27;t seen the outcome maybe in a couple of weeks, but since the first time i noticed my skin was way more smoother, and you can actually see the root of the hair coming out, make sure to do it when your hair is not that long neither too short because is gonna hurt so much or is not gonna help at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was nice to not have to search to destroy and wonder what was missed as you have to do when manually tweezing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m leaving it at 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of getting thick hair.</li>
            <li>The pain is slightly surprising in the beginning, but just take it slow and take your time, and it&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that by dry brushing (a form of exfoliating) before my showers, then following epilating with a good natural lotion pretty much eliminates all of these issues.</li>
            <li>it is more time consuming than any other method if i do a large area (took 2 hours to do one leg).</li>
            <li>Just get a good one, even if it&#x27;s more expensive!</li>
            <li>Also make sure to clean the head by tapping it against the sink or trash on slow speed and using the brush that came with it.  </li>
            <li>I also had many set of rechargeable batteries for other uses.</li>
            <li>so in order to see if it was worth growing out my hair more, i decided to try it on my arms since that hair was long enough.</li>
            <li>I have never been this satisfied with any other hair remover.  </li>
            <li>And, I love PINK!</li>
            <li>there are a bunch of other brands and more pricey.  </li>
            <li>I have very light skin and rather dark hair, so</li>
            <li>It seems to work just fine, but it takes a LONG time.  </li>
            <li>Just glide the head over the skin nice and slow until you feel the first sign of it grabbing the hair.</li>
            <li>Works great and left very very few hairs -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to bet waxing hurts more, and I&#x27;ve definitely endured womanly things that hurt a hell of a lot more than the little sting of this gadget.  </li>
            <li>Effective at pulling hair, not too painful, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>: I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have hirsuitism.. which basically means that I have more body hair than the average woman.</li>
            <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emjoi Divine Hair Remover is probably not a top of the line epilator, but it does the job quite nicely.</li>
            <li>Once all those hairs are finally plucked away (may take a good month or so of every few days of use), you will be much happier with the results.</li>
            <li>It does hurt a bit on certain areas, surprisingly the legs hurt worse than the &#x27;ahem&#x27; pits.</li>
            <li>The hair is removed relatively fast although you need to spend a little more time than shaving.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair that won&#x27;t stay smooth via shaving for more than a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>One less thing has made a huge improvement!</li>
            <li>This is MUCH better on my skin than waxing, and costs tons less, too.</li>
            <li>I recommend investing in a more expensive and better quality epilator.</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly for my armpits and bikini line.</li>
            <li>The ones on my legs faded fairly quickly but the ones on my arms were still noticeable hours later.</li>
            <li>The red bumps still appear but they quickly disappear after lotioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain</li>
            <li>More expensive epilators may work better, but I haven&#x27;t tried them yet.   </li>
            <li>I had never used epilator before, so this review applies to both this particular model and the epilator in general.&lt;br</li>
            <li>reasons I chose this particular model are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare to others, but so far I&#x27;m really liking it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to work too well on very coarse hair - will test out more later!</li>
            <li>they cost way more for only a moderate improvement.</li>
            <li>Second, make sure your hair is short!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely suggest getting rechargeable AAA batteries, as it goes through them quickly.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research online, mostly YouTube video reviews, and decide that if I bought it, I had to use it at least three times to see if it was worth it</li>
            <li>First of all, this is not my first purchase of an Emjoi or similar product.</li>
            <li>so I use it mainly for my underarms.</li>
            <li>You CAN still operate it, but it will be more likely to get ingrown hairs and hairs that aren&#x27;t pulled out all the way and such.  </li>
            <li>I have always had a problem maintaining the constant hair growth on my upper lip, not that it is overwhelming</li>
            <li>For the first couple hours, you&#x27;ll have little red marks that kind of look like a rash.</li>
            <li>I simply went over the hairs, moving the epilator to the right or left or even angling it, and it eventually got them all, even the tiny, fine ones!</li>
            <li>nonetheless if you are pain tolerant like me you will feel a slight pinch at first then its smooth sailing from there.</li>
            <li>Great for the little soft peach fuzz sort of facial hairs, but those pesky chin hairs are left standing straight!  </li>
            <li>highly recomended article</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>used it on high speed</li>
            <li>Maybe I have a high tolerance for pain because as soon as I tried it on my legs</li>
            <li>It is so convenient to give this a run when needed and the chin stays clean for a long time.</li>
            <li>: This epilator does a great job of pulling the hairs vs. merely breaking them.</li>
            <li>I used this for two weeks... and it never really made my legs &#x27;smooth&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve use it just once almost all over my body, and it works perfect, yes it is painful but</li>
            <li>I was always really self conscious about myself and my hairy arms and refused to go out during the summer time because of it.</li>
            <li>I am very excited to use this once my hair grows a little longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Found its easier to clean if you let the hair follicles dry out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since touched up my arms a few times and used my epilator on the slower speed and it has done a much better job of pulling the hairs from the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red</li>
            <li>but I am hoping that if eventually the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back, it is worth the pain.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally give reviews but this product..</li>
            <li>, I will be purchasing a more long lasting model though.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you&#x27;d have to go over the spot a few more times but in the end it does it what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I was exciting when i purchased since i have smaller emjoi.</li>
            <li>I might update this after a few months. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to me for the convenience of not worrying about a cord, but it&#x27;s something to think about for the future.</li>
            <li>Since it is relatively inexpensive, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy their first epilator since I don&#x27;t think epilating (just like waxing) is for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it kind of sucks,</li>
            <li>But this seems to eat up batteries really fast because there is a noticable power reduction from the first time I used it to the second.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, and it helps to have fresh batteries, as they die it gets sluggish and therefore more painful!</li>
            <li>time, I&#x27;ll take the time to read and follow the instructions, such as directing the unit as to how the hair grows and using the correct speed, low for fine and high for course.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, especially because the price is right.</li>
            <li>Also got it right away, two days earlier than estimated.</li>
            <li>I did go back and finish my underarms the next day and although this was by far the most sensitive area, it too was bearable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d grow out the hair for a day or two before epilating, and make sure you pull the skin TIGHT!  </li>
            <li>and it still works like new.</li>
            <li>Also, lidocaine has become my new friend.</li>
            <li>I tried new batteries and no luck.</li>
            <li>But, as far as my bikini line goes, I think its great, I don&#x27;t like to shave the area and feel like waxing is just too expensive</li>
            <li>She says it doesnt really sting much compared to prior reviews.</li>
            <li>This leaves me with inflamed empty hair follicles for the first day or two after, but then thankfully for the first time I haven&#x27;t needed to worry about how my legs look/feel.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad i only spent $25.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you are very sensitive to pain, this epilator shouldn&#x27;t cause too much discomfort whatsoever, even in the more delicate bits.</li>
            <li>My arms were done pretty quickly and I bled a little.</li>
            <li>It soothes the your red skin and makes your skin super soft, plus you won&#x27;t have a leg full of red pores the next day.  </li>
            <li>I decided I&#x27;d only do a little on my right underarm and then shave, then do a little more when that grew back, and shave the rest again, and continued that pattern til most of my hair was removed via the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li>Also, the pain tends to hurt more the higher (elevation wise) up the mound you go, so I tend to only use it up to the base of the pubic bone.  </li>
            <li>take a shower first, exfoliate your skin, and then make sure your skin is extra dry, and use the epilator also epilate on short  hair so if you hair is long , i Suggest shaving it first then</li>
            <li>I bought this product did not know much about epilator the battery runs down quickly</li>
            <li>: As I explained above, the first time hurts.</li>
            <li>had some fear before I actually used it for the first time</li>
            <li>Definitely buy this for the first timers and don&#x27;t get yourself work up over the pain.</li>
            <li>I kinda held it just above the hair at first</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is only the first day of using it</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>My first experience with a device like this and will be my last.  </li>
            <li>At first I was sceptical because of the low price of this item, but still bought it because the customer reviews were good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First off I bought this to use myself (male).</li>
            <li>After around half a year of owning this epilator, it is still working fine.</li>
            <li>started reading more reviews on websites other than amazon, and i see that  a lot of people have the same problem with epilators.</li>
            <li>but it actually works really well and the pain isn&#x27;t unbearable!</li>
            <li>The areas I was used to waxing did not hurt at all when I first used the epilator over them (underarm, legs, arms, upper lip).</li>
            <li>I was using a power cord, not batteries, as it blew through fresh batteries in about 2 minutes, if that long.</li>
            <li>BUT it really only hurts a lot the first time or two, just like waxing.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no way i&#x27;m putting it near my bikini line; waxing is quicker!</li>
            <li>The only complain is that should come with the power cord,it was ok with me because I&#x27;m using the one from the other epiroll.</li>
            <li>tried using the epilator at first on my upper lips.</li>
            <li>However it was a huge let down.</li>
            <li>There are so many brands of epilators that are extremely expensive, so I read numerous reviews before finding the Emjoi.&lt;br /&gt;The first time using it on my underarms was a bit of a plucking feeling, but not painful.</li>
            <li>By the time you switch to the next leg or arm the previous side will feel fine!   </li>
            <li>Well, I have tried my new Emjoi a few times and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>When I first tried my new Emjoi, I was satisfied, thinking it had pulled the hair out by the root when what it actually does, for the mmost part, at least on me, is shave the hair.</li>
            <li>First use was painful but my results were great.</li>
            <li>It may help my legs look less hairy, but I never feel smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly , before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>The first time I use it on my entire leg will probably result in maybe 20-30% of the hair growing back in a couple of days (ones that accidentally broke off at the skin, I guess), so it takes two or three sessions at the beginning of the summer before I&#x27;ve really gotten it all.  </li>
            <li>A little too strong a blade, I got it for my elderly mother who has used a smaller one for years and this one is just too much, probably for someone with tighter skin</li>
            <li>The DIVINE is even better that the previous battery opereated model, if at all possible.  </li>
            <li>Look for one with the maximum number of tweezers possible to make the process take less time by getting more hair at one</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it will use that many batteries all the time because it will be faster the next times because there will definitely be less hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick, dark body hair that grows really fast, I literally had to shave my legs 3 times a day if wanted to keep them smooth and hair free.  </li>
            <li>Works fine for a few weeks</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s nice to prune the shrubbery back a bit, and reduces the overall area by about half or so—which can be the difference between sticking out from a bikini or not.  </li>
            <li>Also the size is pretty big and you can not get to the small areas of your face easily.</li>
            <li>I do use it of course, but my old Epilady is still my first choice due to the straight tweezers plate.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t quite understand how to apply a large head to an individual hair, but instructions are clear to not use it elsewhere on the face or as an electric</li>
            <li>but if you start in more painful location, you&#x27;ll feel much more</li>
            <li>When I got it I thought that it could be more powerful, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find the same one and found this on Amazon with great reviews.</li>
            <li>After spending so much time using it, I was still left with stragglers and had to shave/ tweeze the rest.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s loud, but portable)</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not for days, you can take weeks to complete.</li>
            <li>frequently seems to use a lot of juice out of the batteries.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like the epilator.  </li>
            <li>But so far, it pulled up about 60 percent of the hair on whatever surface you are pulling from.</li>
            <li>Besides, who wants a big bulky thing?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cheap, easier to use, and makes your hair grow back much thinner/slower.</li>
            <li>The quality was no where near what I was expecting and try as I might</li>
            <li>and the cord doesn&#x27;t let you get as far as I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>It takes about a week before it really starts working (assuming you were shaving before this), because the hair has to grow out enough.</li>
            <li>It works really well on my facial hair and under my arms.</li>
            <li>My old Emjoi is still working well, but I wanted a back-up in case it ever wears out.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought -- except on my upper lip(I will just have to be hairy there).  </li>
            <li>If it stings too much, just stop, relax and work on a different area.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product just doesn&#x27;t grab the hair like my old Epilady.</li>
            <li>Also, use the epilator cream after - I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I did get a rash when I didn&#x27;t use the cream.</li>
            <li>If your thinking of buying an epilator don&#x27;t bother if you can&#x27;t handle waxing or tweezing sensitive spots.</li>
            <li>The only thing that really bugged me is how often I will have to replace the batteries but no matter.</li>
            <li>My skin is incredibly sensitive and after years of struggling to find something that would not make me look like I tried to rip my skin off, I decided to give this epilator idea a try.</li>
            <li>The second time I was really sore.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s working so far, so</li>
            <li>The effects last so much longer than shaving.</li>
            <li>Works very well, though obviously it&#x27;s not painless.</li>
            <li>But I wish I would&#x27;ve gotten one when I was much younger; would&#x27;ve saved so much money and confidence.</li>
            <li>If the outer edge were curved downwards (like my old one), the blades could reach the hairs at any angle.</li>
            <li>Also, using it on my legs means I don&#x27;t have to shave them as frequently, even in summer.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it for soft cuddles; I bought it to remove my hair from the root.  </li>
            <li>It breaks a lot of hairs, and completely misses a lot of hairs.</li>
            <li>Overall, it speeds up the process, but it doesn&#x27;t do the whole job.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised @</li>
            <li>No irritation, blood, or raised areas; no ingrown hairs so far either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend this for larger areas such as your legs, only or places where being completely free of hair isnt the biggest concern.</li>
            <li>even on the sensitive spots.</li>
            <li>I eventually gave up in these areas completely.</li>
            <li>This epilator solved that problem completely.</li>
            <li>Okay, I got a few hairs in and decided I&#x27;d had enough for the night.</li>
            <li>That feeling alone is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>Powerful didn&#x27;t work as well as expected</li>
            <li>I got this and was only able to use it a few times.</li>
            <li>But is IS effective, the battery life is not great abnd</li>
            <li>i gave it four stars because it doesnt pick up the super little hairs, but thats normal even with wax.</li>
            <li>So at first it will tweeze quickly but when the batteries are old, it loses strength.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that cleaning this is slightly difficult to get all the hairs out, other than that, this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>The chin feels a bit raw and there remains a bit of fine stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>My main problem with it was the shape of it because when I try to remove my armpit hair, the upper sides of this get in my way and don&#x27;t allow me to grab the hair because it cant get close enough and doesn&#x27;t work very well on curved body parts</li>
            <li>The first use was the most painful but don&#x27;t get scared off, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>It hurt a little the first time; but after that not so much.</li>
            <li>I only use this on my upper lip, while taking breaks in between tears,not my under arm because it hurts far too much!</li>
            <li>It pulls on them pretty hard, but rarely pulls them out.  </li>
            <li>When you feel the first pain, pull it back then take a deep breath.</li>
            <li>After some experiment, I found that adding sideway movement such as in small circular or zigzag motion to forward motion helps picking up more hair.</li>
            <li>Read lots of reviews and finally chose this one mainly because of the price.</li>
            <li>And the long lasting results are definitely worth the temporary pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>may want to have a small flat screw driver or something similar handy,</li>
            <li>It gets most of the hairs, only leaves very few.</li>
            <li>I will not lie-I personally have a high tolerance for pain and this even made me wince.</li>
            <li>short, I highly recommend this to anyone who likes smoother, longer-lasting results than a shave can give.</li>
            <li>If you have extremely thin or crepey skin, very mature skin for example, you may injure yourself if that tissuey skin is able to get caught in the pinching mechanism.</li>
            <li>It took a really long time to epilate both of my legs because I kept taking time off to breathe hahaha.</li>
            <li>yet!&lt;br /&gt;- give your body a couple of hours before you have to go out to get back to normal.</li>
            <li>First, be careful to follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li>And I am using it much less than at first, plus I notice certain stray hairs that never grow back.</li>
            <li>It may not be the best as high priced epilators, but let me tell you when buying one you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li>the battery runs out a little quickly but it&#x27;s nothing</li>
            <li>For the price I paid I&#x27;m fine with shelling out a few extra bucks to order the adapter cord from the Emjoi site.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid I&#x27;m fine with shelling out a few extra bucks to order the adapter cord from the Emjoi site.</li>
            <li>and it takes an hour or two for the skin to calm down.</li>
            <li>I can do this once a week while watching a tv show (or three to get all the hair) and then shave the next morning and have silky smooth legs for a little under a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The problem was that it still didn&#x27;t pluck hardly any hairs even after I let the hair grow out and went over the same spot MANY times.  </li>
            <li>I suggest using brand new batteries because if you don&#x27;t, the tweezers will spin slower than the actual speed and make epilating a longer process.</li>
            <li>shave my underarms every day, winter or summer, and even right after shaving you can see the dark spots from the hair beneath the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Legs:&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to grow your hair out very long to use it—just a millimeter or so—which is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that really hurts is the upper lip</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator, and I had my doubts about it, but it has worked out really well for the past couple of months.</li>
            <li>I was sort of skeptical if it was going to really take away most of my body hair</li>
            <li>It takes a few times for your legs to feel smooth, but the hair does grow back finer and slower if you keep at it.</li>
            <li>Good for thoes who think waxing is too painful, it still hurts but is very convenient.</li>
            <li>I used many in last 20 years and this one hurt least so that I can use it on my under arms.</li>
            <li>I kept getting discouraged that I couldn&#x27;t get myself completely hairless, and had spent so much time.</li>
            <li>Take it easy and slow.</li>
            <li>It takes MUCH longer than my braun one, and misses lots of hair, but my braun one was much more expensive, so I guess it works out.</li>
            <li>Also, it wont pick up short fuzz, is better for the thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I found this for a reasonable price, but I was not for sure if it works as well as my expensive Braun epi.</li>
            <li>This device gets rid of hairs, but it creates major ingrown hair if used on face.</li>
            <li>Works better than waxing, although it leaves a few hairs they&#x27;re not nearly to the same amount as waxing.</li>
            <li>The pink parts are right but the white part of the one shown is silver on mine.</li>
            <li>For the most part it gets all the hair, but I find myself having to go over spots a few times and trying a few different directions before it really gets everything.  </li>
            <li>only con is that the hair that gets pulled stays in the device unless you shake it out and use the little brush that comes with it (meant to help clean the device and get the hair out of it).</li>
            <li>The only down fall is the batteries die out quickly.</li>
            <li>But as you use the hair remover, it becomes much less painful, and it is much more effective than waxing.  </li>
            <li>BEING A OLDER ITALIAN FEMALE</li>
            <li>This thing is so freaking painful, lol.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used mine long enough to know about battery life, but some reviews say that the batteries die fast.</li>
            <li>, I barely felt hurt, well it stings a bit</li>
            <li>The hair can&#x27;t be too short, but it gets nearly everything.</li>
            <li>basically my upper lip is just too sensitive and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if that happens to be your problem area.</li>
            <li>so I have no regrets about this impulse purchase.</li>
            <li>and I have use it only on my underarms so far.</li>
            <li>So far I dropped it only three or four times - no affect on productivity.  </li>
            <li>It barely grabs any hair that is coarser than arm hair.</li>
            <li>I am very unsatisfied with this product as it was not as I expected to be(look at its description).</li>
            <li>I use this on my legs and barely feel a thing.</li>
            <li>Apparently if you want to use the epilator as a corded device, you need to buy an AC adapter SEPARATELY.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>If you have no experience with waxing it will be worse for you and you may not be able to tolerate the pain.</li>
            <li>only reason I took off one star is because I think the batteries make it less powerful over time.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a lot less messy than waxing, and better than shaving, so</li>
            <li>There is a technique to how to use it, like moving in small quick circles or switching directions.  </li>
            <li>That REALLY hurt, but I&#x27;d just do as much as a could at night, then shave the rest, let it grow out a little, use the epilator for as long as I could, and then shave the rest.</li>
            <li>A little bit of stinging, but I was surprised that it actually works (this was my first time using an epilator).</li>
            <li>I expected my legs to be smooth and stay smooth for at least a few days--does not happen.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, it does not hurt that much, I might have a higher pain tolerance</li>
            <li>wonder if other brands might work better for me, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m willing to waste money trying to find out.</li>
            <li>I was unable to use this product because it would not turn on (I&#x27;ve tried several new batteries to make sure the batteries I was using wasn&#x27;t a problem).</li>
            <li>With some more getting use to, I&#x27;m sure it will be a lot less painful,</li>
            <li>In real use by on-off frequently, it probably goes only half as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleaning is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Despite its complicated looking mechanism, the hair won&#x27;t get stuck inside because critical parts comeout easily for the cleaning.</li>
            <li>Your only going to get about 2 hours charge time no matter how much money you spent on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, my batteries lasted much longer than I expected them too especially since I heard cheaper epilators ate batteries like a fat boy and cake.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using it with longer hair growth, short hair growth, barely there hair growth, legs, arms, armpits, belly...</li>
            <li>I recommend it for beginners but not long term</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t near as long as my leg or arm hair</li>
            <li>Its been 3 weeks since she used it and barely a hair has come back.</li>
            <li>Ten years from now, you&#x27;ll barely need to use this thing</li>
            <li>It does hurt the first few times, but the pain does decrease.</li>
            <li>I would call it more of an annoying sensation at times, but after a few minutes I actually liked knowing that it was working!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I bought this epilator because it was the cheapest and had decent reviews.  </li>
            <li>I got it mainly to avoid the endless irritation from shaving, and it has done just that.  </li>
            <li>, it can be frustrating at times but the patience is worth it for the hair to grow back more slowly.  </li>
            <li>Yes, some hair will be too small and stubborn, but you can remove those easily by any other means, or they won&#x27;t even be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Following the advice of other reviewers, I started the epilator on an area with no hair (the top of my foot) and slowly crept up on the leg hair.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it gets maybe half out if you&#x27;re really thorough.</li>
            <li>biggest complaint about this unit is how quickly it drains batteries.</li>
            <li>and then if it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs you want the first few times, try a different direction.  </li>
            <li>I am not too easy on my stuff (poor storage, dropping stuff often and etc)</li>
            <li>however that since this one is a very basic model, you will have to go over the hairs a few times for it to grab all of them, but I didn&#x27;t expect perfection for this price, not when compared to the fact that the majority of epilators costs twice as much!</li>
            <li>i use ice before and after so my face cools down, but only recommend this to people with a high tolerance for pain!</li>
            <li>Excited to know that it will hurt less and less.</li>
            <li>The first day you may had a bit tender skin but nothing bad and the next day it will be lovely.  </li>
            <li>I did some research trying to figure out first, if I even wanted to attempt epilating, then second which one to buy to test it out ... ended up buying the Emjoi Divine (pink &amp; white) because of the price and based on other reviews (on Amazon &amp; the web in general).</li>
            <li>apparently, what feels like the hairs being pulled straight from the root, can really just be the hairs being pulled and/or broken.</li>
            <li>That being said, I like having to shave less often, and the hair that grows back is much thinner and easier to remove.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is the batteries run out quick.</li>
            <li>Because of how the tweezers are place on the epilator, it makes it a little hard to reach everything in your under arm, so I spend a more time in that area.  </li>
            <li>The hair also gets all jammed up in the top part and it&#x27;s very hard to get out.</li>
            <li>The little tweezer blades seem to move slower that the ones in the silk epil, thus not as fast at removing unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>but it really hurts and leaves my skin a little irritated.</li>
            <li>Problem is now I need to find a new adapter, the other one has bit the dust and the Divine</li>
            <li>The main problem I have is that its a little difficult to clean with the brush, particularly under the spinning part, but this hasn&#x27;t changed its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I have a high pain tolerance and still had trouble making it through my first few sessions with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The underarms ARE more painful than the legs, because the skin is more delicate and the hair isthicker.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> everyone says and is awesome if you have to wear a bathing suit all the time.</li>

            <li> I am in love with my Divine Hair Remover!!  </li>
            <li> i love this thing!!</li>
            <li> Comes very handy.</li>
            <li> it works OKAY at best.</li>
            <li> This is a great one to start with if you want to try it out without spending a good chunk of money.</li>
            <li> And best part of it is that it&#x27;s cheap as well!</li>
            <li> I read so many great reviews, it was affordable!</li>
            <li> product does what it says it is made for I love it :D</li>
            <li> Good product and great service</li>
            <li> Okay so this product is awesome!</li>
            <li> I searched for all the epilating products for the best reviews within my price range and this was at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE WORKS GREAT!!</li>
            <li> I feel like this does a good job removing hair</li>
            <li> so this is a good solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie - it doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> and I was good to go again.</li>
            <li> It was still bearable though and went fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> I got this because I read some good review out of this, and this one is battery operated, so I can function it well in Asia, which run in 210-230 voltage, and when I tried this</li>
            <li> I went on you tube and saw some good reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> Battery life seems good.    </li>
            <li> I bought this because it had good reviews and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  </li>
            <li> SO that was GOOD...</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you want good results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good in removing hair with the roots.</li>
            <li> Good luck if you want to try,</li>
            <li> There is also the option of getting a chord, which is good too.</li>
            <li> I have owned others with cord, they were good, but a pain in the butt.</li>
            <li> It is a good fix between waxing.  </li>
            <li> Delivered on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Good but also time consuming&lt;</li>
            <li> well keep it its good deal .</li>
            <li> which is good.</li>
            <li> I think this was a good deal</li>
            <li> was looking for a good hair removal method.</li>
            <li> It did a good job at picking up the hairs.</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, this is not a shitty/cheap-o epilator, so you&#x27;re getting a good introduction without it costing a bundle.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on if they stay smooth for the 6 weeks quoted on the box, but if they prevent stubble for longer than 2 days, then it&#x27;s a great product in my book!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good deal.  </li>
            <li> Good wish it plugged in the wall</li>
            <li> For me it doesn&#x27;t seem to grab the hairs as good as the emjoi slim.</li>
            <li> Good product to me</li>
            <li> I thought the multi blades would be good</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews were great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for underarms, but if you think you&#x27;ll be able to use it on your legs without getting ingrown hairs, think again.</li>
            <li> Works great for armpit and top of bikini line for me.</li>
            <li> Personally, I really love it on my armpits, bikini area, happy trail and arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it all the time all throughout the year, but I&#x27;m very glad I bought it for the occasions when I opt for this strategy.  </li>
            <li> This hair remover works great and the price makes it even better.</li>
            <li> I find that it is best right after my shower, when the pores are &amp;#34;relaxed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I read so many great reviews on it but honestly, it does not work at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent service, I very highly recommend both the product and the seller!</li>
            <li> (many of the rechargeable epilators on the market can&#x27;t be used while plugged in!)</li>
            <li> (many of the rechargeable epilators on the market can&#x27;t be used while plugged in!)</li>
            <li> love this device!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to get easier with practice!</li>
            <li> Make sure you have AAA batteries!</li>
            <li> THIS EPILATOR WORKS FANTASTIC!!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this, except it doesn&#x27;t come with a plug, and tells you to use as a batteries !  </li>
            <li> Way better than shaving though, no prickly armpits anymore!</li>
            <li> One of my girlfriends has an epilator with 74 tweezer heads and worked so much better!</li>
            <li> Works wonderful :) worth every penny!</li>
            <li> love my Emjoi!</li>
            <li> Otherwise I am pleased with it!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheaper then most and would let me try this technique without breaking my bank!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love to use it and it keeps me hairfree for weeks!</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this I had already purchased the emjoi slim which I love, and still do!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t even been able to get on the computer to check their response to me and it was at my door!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed &amp; have since replaced this with a laser one which is clearly better, but for the money, not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> it works great its cheap without having compromised quality.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I have re-chargable batteries and also just happened to have a 100-240V AC Adapter that works great with it.  </li>
            <li> I liked this epilator when it worked but after a couple of months the heads stopped spinning.</li>
            <li> This product is effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ripping hairs out at the root and honestly</li>
            <li> I used the epilator according to the instruction, I also used it considering the tips of one of the reviewers on here, and tried my own methods.</li>
            <li> and it has held up nicely.    </li>
            <li> I skipped the part where I should have let my legs and stuff soak in warm water before use.</li>
            <li> Just went ahead and bought myself my own.</li>
            <li> it would work nicely for</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good price for it as well :)</li>
            <li> , It works fast and, the best, It is cordless.  </li>
            <li> I liked this, but for some reason it gives me a lot of ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> and I liked what it did.</li>
            <li> Nice quality.</li>
            <li> This removes those nicely as well the increasing amount of peach fuzz I seem to be getting.</li>
            <li> It was really effective once I figured out that I needed to hold it in the counter-intuitive way -- with the logo away from the body.</li>
            <li> I loved the price, but the quality was okay.</li>
            <li> This product works better then any that I have ever tried and the price is good too</li>
            <li> This item came nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> It kind of numbs out the area you are working on.</li>
            <li> nice item to buy</li>
            <li> I own two at the moment.</li>
            <li> The feel of the product is nice and well built.</li>
            <li> to each its own tho.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this method of hair removal for about 25 years now, and the improvements in home tools is remarkable, but this tool has a curvature that does not allow the tool reach the skin easily.  </li>
            <li> My husband thinks it&#x27;s cute, but I don&#x27;t! : ).  </li>
            <li> This item received good reviews after spending about 30 minutes researching a great epilator for a decent price.  </li>
            <li> Would have liked it to work plugged in better.</li>
            <li> Good, cheap starter.</li>
            <li> and I found that using the slower speed was more effective in removing hair instead of just breaking it off.</li>
            <li> i bought this  one because the advertising made sound good.  </li>
            <li> It worked great, but I noticed to get the best (as in quickest and less pain) results, I had to replace the batteries</li>
            <li> So now it as easy as brushing my teeth!</li>
            <li> but I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure glad I did! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure glad I did! :)</li>
            <li> Try to get one that is rechargeable (this one is not) because it is amazing how nice it is to sit in a comfortable chair and watch a show while doing this</li>
            <li> this point I was feeling pretty brave and decided to tackle my underarms.</li>
            <li> can use this epilator anytime pretty much lol.</li>
            <li> It was a great choice, for a my first epilator.</li>
            <li> So I started with a very light tap.</li>
            <li> Also, very cheap.</li>
            <li> When it does, the results are great, but I have to wonder if there are others out there that would get more hair on the first pass.      </li>
            <li> That is how you get it.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I have very smooth skin using the very affordable Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Waxing was much better.</li>
            <li> I am not even sure if it even grabs the longest hair at all.</li>
            <li> I figured if the process was something I couldn&#x27;t go through more than once than I&#x27;d better not break the bank.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it on my underarms and my bikini line and it does well in those areas.</li>
            <li> This hurt slightly more than my legs, even with trimming the hairs to an appropriate length beforehand.</li>
            <li> but I chalk this up to my inexperience more than the fault of the epilator.</li>
            <li> but for the most part the contoured shape is not</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get it to grab just about every</li>
            <li> things considered I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get it to grab just about every</li>
            <li> things considered I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> ok purchase</li>
            <li> On top of that, sometimes I&#x27;d forget to shave in the shower</li>
            <li> Letting hair grow out then using it hurts way more.</li>
            <li> It would have just been nicer and more hygienic to be able to get all the hair out of the device somehow.</li>
            <li> The pain was bearable, but I think that&#x27;s because most of the hair wasn&#x27;t being pulled from the root.</li>
            <li> I *love</li>
            <li> And then reward myself with ice cream :)</li>
            <li> Tho of course, I&#x27;ll have to wait a month to be able to do it again ^_____^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I know what real pain is lol</li>
            <li> so I was not quite sure what the felling would be like</li>
            <li> I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to jump on top of the line while I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> It turned out I got more than I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad it gives you the time to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t push the head downward, it won&#x27;t make the tweezers grab more hair but the direction and the angle of it will.</li>
            <li> Most of the time the tweezers catch the hair</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it.</li>
            <li> but I can say I&#x27;m glad I got this.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll upgrade to a pricier one and hope for slightly better results.</li>
            <li> Give your armpits time to adjust and the end results are lovely and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Now, even after the battery was replaced, it doesn&#x27;t work for more than 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> painless\\&quot; well that is comical.</li>
            <li> the curved style in the best, and may try my next model a \\&quot;straight\\&quot; head model.</li>
            <li> in a cute box like you bought it from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to do my bikini line and it just brought tears to my eyes</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was scared but that hurts more so if you are like me</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Cheap!</li>
            <li> So much more affordable than I would have thought.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I got this</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> More like a bite or pinch.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I dropped it so many times that I thought it was indistructable.  </li>
            <li> I love love love this thing.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be able to tolerate the pain since tweezing has never hurt me...</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it since i did pay for it 8)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t let there be any more than a week of razor stubble, or it will hurt worse.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> but i went through so many batteries</li>
            <li> would do a better job, but i bought the cheapest one i found just to try it out.</li>
            <li> It missed SO many hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about getting a numbing cream just so I can use it more.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It will hurt, it will take forever, the batteries used will be many.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> it delivers more pain than results.  </li>
            <li> I could tolerate the pain if I got good results, but these results are far from good.</li>
            <li> This will be more \\&quot;painful\\&quot; in areas with thicker hair as well.)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing.</li>
            <li> However, even if you have to go over an area more than once, you have to be sure to hold your skin taught in the area you are removing hair.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> But it could be better.</li>
            <li> After repeated use, it does make my leg hairs grow in softer and much more sparsely.</li>
            <li> More stingy than anything.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, it does pull out the roots, but it also just pulls out the hair instead of the roots.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be able to notice that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not go over the area more than 2-3 times because it will irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> Warning: Stings 3x more than the legs!&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> I let it grow out so it would work better.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this product, but it isn&#x27;t the best out there.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> The longer the hair, the more pain.  </li>
            <li> And I love the color, cute</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m actually pleased w/the product.</li>
            <li> I wasin&#x27;t even sure would work)</li>
            <li> so if you don&#x27;t you may have better results.</li>
            <li> Most of the hair was still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> If you want to know more about it just wikipedia it.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the epilator and recommend it to anyone with body</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> Body scrub - Helps some of the ingrown hairs and it does leave your skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> After this one dies on me, I will probably invest in a better quality epilator.</li>
            <li> so I figured it would be safe in case</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m definitely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> and I was pinching more than plucking.</li>
            <li> I was pleased that it didn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare this to, but I am pleased.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> any day I want at ok</li>
            <li> needs stronger energy source of power maybe an electronic one would be better than this battery powered one.</li>
            <li> But Most Of My Hairs Were Cut Off.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> It does not get better with time.</li>
            <li> I had one years ago that was OK but just never removed all the hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> i would have been better shaving my arms.</li>
            <li> these seem to work okay, but eat batteries like no tomorrow.  </li>
            <li> which I trust and have been using for many years.</li>
            <li> but I still love this product.</li>
            <li> dots aren&#x27;t that cute IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve learned that when you hear it starting to run slower, it&#x27;s best to change the batteries.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love it.  </li>
            <li> I think she paid more for hers, and it did a better job than this one does.</li>
            <li> i do this every night after my shower and my legs have been smooth ever since!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see how much better that gets with time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2/9/13: I purchased a Braun Epilator that was stronger/better according to reviews and was going to relegate this one to a travel Epilator if the Braun was better.  </li>
            <li> Yet when I used this, it didn&#x27;t pull out many hairs at all.</li>
            <li> since i only use it for one area, this lower priced model is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> I think having a version that plugs in would be better.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> But was able to get through it....</li>
            <li> but it is surely embarassing.</li>
            <li> i would love to be able to return this item that i purchased from amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> After my ordered AP-9L was DOA and returned for refund, I read more reviews and ordered the Emjoi Divine AP-17B.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator and was pleased to find reviews stating user satisfaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update after 1 month: I&#x27;ve now used it 3 times and remain pleased.</li>
            <li> It is much better than using tweezer/shaving/waxing.</li>
            <li> It is like shaving but better</li>
            <li> For my arm pits i only use this epilator and its awesome.</li>
            <li> Very worth it!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective and makes a significant difference in the underarm area if you&#x27;re looking to lighten up that area.</li>
            <li> I found that motioning up at an angle tends to pull more hair successfully than just straight up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But while it worked it did a pretty good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It plucked out the hair pretty good</li>
            <li> For the price, I guess it&#x27;s pretty good -</li>
            <li> I have a pretty good tolerance for pain</li>
            <li> I think this is a pretty good intro to epilating hair remover.  </li>
            <li> it is a pretty good epilator</li>
            <li> good for the women this worked for, but please be cautious when trying it out for the first time.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job about eliminating unwanted hair though.</li>
            <li> I just had higher hopes because my emjoi slim is soooooo good</li>
            <li> It hurt when I first started, but now that I&#x27;m used to it, it almost feels good.  </li>
            <li> My best advice for using this product is to drink a few glasses of wine first and then go to your happy place.</li>
            <li> The package says you can buy a cord from another website, but I bought rechargeable batteries and that works fine (and the charger works for both AA and AAA, so I can use it for most of my batteries)</li>
            <li> The item shipped fast and was exactly as described; I just don&#x27;t think the product itself is very good.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Divine Hair Remover, White/Pink was a very good product, however, it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as the more expensive kind, but for the price i am satisfied.</li>
            <li> but so far it seems great.</li>
            <li> Ideally, you should really only use this on your underarms.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my skin feels after epilating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a cheap epilator and</li>
            <li> I am glad to be free of that.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from Amazon a month ago and wanted to really give it a fair test run before writing my review.</li>
            <li> Lots of good advise from lots of ladies, thanks.  </li>
            <li> Easy to hold when using,    </li>
            <li> It does seem to hurt more if you are hormonal but on a regular day it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> easy to hold in your hands and wrap fingers around&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use...</li>
            <li> Return was easy though, so</li>
            <li> so this was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Batteries drain very quickly.  </li>
            <li> easy to use and easy to carry also.</li>
            <li> Batteries are easy to change, the battery cover slips off for inserting the 3 AAA.</li>
            <li> Now I just need to brave the bikini area, ripping hair out is not pleasant but ssooo worth being able to throw out the razaorit!!!</li>
            <li> Take a warm bath first to loosen up the pores.</li>
            <li> It did kind of hurt the first time, but after that it didnt.  </li>
            <li> If this is true, I would say getting a better one will pay off in not buying batteries in the end.</li>
            <li> so happy that having a socially acceptable amount of body hair is no longer something thy</li>
            <li> The razor is working fine now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my hair is to fine or course</li>
            <li> It could grab and pluck even fine hairs without a lot of over-stroking.  </li>
            <li> Pulled out some hairs, pain level was fine for what it is, but broke</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the purchase :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not recommended for fine hairs at all.</li>
            <li> Hurts extraordinarily!</li>
            <li> If you move the hair remover in a circle motion, it tends to remove more hair and it gets the job done relatively quick.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for my armpits and it makes them super smooth.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My bestfriend had told me about the &amp;#34;epilator&amp;#34; so I bought the cheapest one witht he best reviews, I am hoping to get a more expensive one with better reviews soon!</li>
            <li> is a huge plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is a huge plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT NOTE, the HUGE DOWNSIDE: this thing takes forever,</li>
            <li> for everyone that thought it didn&#x27;t work, try an adapter on it, makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Fortunately Emjoi sells adapter cords for this unit so it can be used while plugged into the wall which remedies this</li>
            <li> and I think the sound is the scariest part about it.</li>
            <li> so it takes a bit more effort to remove the hair but deff worth it.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I am overall happy with it for my desired use.  </li>
            <li> , my armpits are baby smooth.</li>
            <li> my arms and my calves are so silky smooth atm!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it primarily for my bikini line area.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to shave as often and my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall great product</li>
            <li> I like the smooth feel, but do not get it with this product.  </li>
            <li> It does sound kinda like an electric razor.</li>
            <li> (gosh didn&#x27;t even know if it would fit.</li>
            <li> It is such a great investment (including rechargeable batteries).</li>
            <li> I would use it just for keeping my legs smooth, probably not to start from scratch.</li>
            <li> Light, durable, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I do still like how smooth I feel after epilating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is completely comfortable to use, because it massages your skin.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy It</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to clean..</li>
            <li> It takes forever to get two inches of my leg smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this is time consuming, and to be hair free you&#x27;ll need to use it for awhile.</li>
            <li> Years have passed and I decided to give the Emjoi another chance at making me hair-free and fabulous.</li>
            <li> my arms were smooth for a couple of days, then i started to get bumps.</li>
            <li> I primarily use the epilator when the warmer weather rolls around, and just stick to lower maintenance shaving in the winter, when I&#x27;m covered by clothing anyway.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been completely smooth for 3 days.  </li>
            <li> I think the majority of them leaving me anything but smooth.</li>
            <li> (it was cheap with free shipping too) and that made all the difference.  </li>
            <li> I got scared because of the reviews saying that it hurt, so went cheap, and learned that it doesn&#x27;t hurt what-so-ever.</li>
            <li> With this being on the cheap end of the epilators, I just say that I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Glides smoothly over skin pulling hair from its roots.</li>
            <li> The box states battery-operated, there is no mention of an available adapter in the instructions, but there is an input at the bottom of the unit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely takes a few sets of batteries to REALLY learn the best way to use this thing, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;ll become your best friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually very pleasantly surprised by how good of a job this epilator does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually very pleasantly surprised by how good of a job this epilator does.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I had tried a friend&#x27;s Emjoi, and I liked it for my upper lip, so I decided to get one of my own.</li>
            <li> , I liked my old one better</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to be able to do more in a shorter amount of time but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case because I repeatedly have to go over sections.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very useful in the summer and has resulted in the thinning of the epilated hair.</li>
            <li> I find that using it right when the hairs are still pretty short is best.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what it says it does, and just a hint: make sure you use super fresh batteries so its faster and get dones faster :)</li>
            <li> Reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Products made by Emjoi in general had good reviews in Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited once I received it but held off on using it for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> Was exactly what I needed :)</li>
            <li> and by then I was so excited to use it</li>
            <li> many it started buzzing funny</li>
            <li> which is what I originally purchased  this item for.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> first time I used it I felt like I was not going to be able to finish the process.</li>
            <li> so you know its crucial&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this epilator excited to use&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this is the first time i purchased an epilator, but I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> It was a great buy to introduce me to epilating at a reasonable price, but getting a better product was necessary once I decided to stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, again, the results make it well worth it!    </li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t realize exactly how many times I&#x27;d have to go over the area that I wanted removed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited for those results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems like a great product I hope it lasts me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> clean it often  4.</li>
            <li> But you&#x27;ll get a few week&#x27;s worth of awesome looking underarms for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also spray the head with 90% alcohol solution to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did a really clean job, I did not have to do any plucking</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other enjoy products that work great bit</li>
            <li> there was, I guess I had set my expectations pretty high for some pain, but surprisingly, after the first couple pulls (just like tweezing your eyebrows) it becomes \\&quot;nothing\\&quot; to finish the job!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to recieve this item.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;m used to my original hair remover and the quick and efficient job it did.</li>
            <li> But, this is great if you&#x27;re not sure about epilating, mainly because of the price, but also because it&#x27;s a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> , it is cheap and very efficient also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> and I believe this is why the pain was so much more intense.</li>
            <li> This one gives you full control.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t try to use it on your bikini area unless you&#x27;re cool with experiencing the pain of a Brazilian wax x10.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to get them out good enough</li>
            <li> I have 4 kids and a full time job</li>
            <li> This is a good epilator and simple one to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve emailed the company to tell them that i want a full refund.</li>
            <li> I have saved so much money with my Emjoi; I love the fact that I can use this in the privacy of my home instead of getting waxed at a beauty salon.</li>
            <li> The batteries last a good while</li>
            <li> I found this one to be just as good and will use it for travel in the future (no adapters to bring along, no worries about voltage or plugs when abroad etc...</li>
            <li> It removes the hair and does not make the skin feel sore but is not quite as good as it could be for the upper lip.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product who wants a safe product to use.</li>
            <li> Its true</li>
            <li> and finally I broke it for good.</li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I am very prone to ingrown hairs, so I mostly prefer to use an electric trimmer on this area.  </li>
            <li> So many women complaining about how much it hurt.  </li>
            <li> but it stopped working after only three times of use, and my hairs are very fine and not that many.</li>
            <li> This one was easy to use for a beginner: unpack from the box, add batteries, read the pamphlet on how-to, took a hot shower, exfoliated, and went right to it!</li>
            <li> The cord would be a worthy investment since this hair remover was such a good price.</li>
            <li> My original machine was defective and died after the first two uses, and they immediately sent me a replacement!</li>
            <li> Such a great product for such a cheap price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the seller was fantastic!</li>
            <li> Other than that I think it&#x27;s a great alternative for hair removal.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, much more power and pulls the hair out in much less time then the Remington even did (more tweezers).</li>
            <li> A quick swap of the batteries</li>
            <li> Adequate hair removal device.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> After a quick youtube search one user suggested trying an Epilator for hair removal.</li>
            <li> I had to go over the same areas many times in order to remove most of the hair.</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence, want to getrid of body hair without messing with the wax and have the stomach for mildly masochistic methods in the pursuit of beauty (and what woman doesn&#x27;t?)</li>
            <li> If I try this type product again, I&#x27;ll pay the extra money and get an electrical one in hopes that more power will give it more pull.</li>
            <li> My wife liked it very much very cute small one.</li>
            <li> It took a bit of getting used to, but it pulls out hairs quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin is super</li>
            <li> The batteries are drained too quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a more substantial unit than the AP-9L as it has 36 tweezer discs and many features such as massaging fingers.</li>
            <li> but I think I like the more simple models better.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li> I loved that it was light and portable, and pink!</li>
            <li> I have only tried on my legs and they are very smooth!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s still pretty smooth to touch once done.</li>
            <li> Only used once but results turned out pretty good.</li>
            <li> This product is good for those who are not sure if you&#x27;re going to be able to handle the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; of an epilator.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this one as I&#x27;m quite sure they do the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> Do not be discouraged during your first use!</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator!</li>
            <li> I feel confident the hair will take time to come back, when it does it will be easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> This epilator has been fine, I suggest getting some rechargeable batteries if you use it much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the tricks and this still doesn&#x27;t work very well with my fine body hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it on your legs or armpits but it gets rid of fine hair very well.</li>
            <li> The hair will start to grow back slower, and you&#x27;ll feel much more confident in your new smooth</li>
            <li> Works great but does pull a little.  </li>
            <li> It did a pretty decent job, but for the parts that it missed, I&#x27;ll just shave it off until i get a better hang of the epilator.</li>
            <li> I bout it for my wife ,she is very happy with it ,It is simply great product with low price which is hard to get such balance on Items nowadays</li>
            <li> I, myself have used it several times and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> it was a waste for me but may be great for someone else</li>
            <li> my underarms are the only place that had amazing results (thinner hair and slowed growth) from epilating.</li>
            <li> You do have to go over the area a few times but it does remove the hair and at a great price.</li>
            <li> As far as the product, I love it.</li>
            <li> Buuut hair grows back much more... smoothly(?)</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS WELL WORTH</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has become most frequently used gadget of mine.</li>
            <li> It does cause a bit of irritation and will leave the skin kind of red</li>
            <li> (Plus only $23 was nice)</li>
            <li> Used old plug but works better with AAA battery.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I might have been more surprised because I&#x27;ve never waxed before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so worth it...</li>
            <li> My daughter could not handle it, but she is not into the beauty is worth the pain and effort mindset.</li>
            <li> 51 years old and have discovered epillating and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> And I have to say it&#x27;s well worth your money.</li>
            <li> I didnt think it had enough tweezers and speed honestly..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price just for that.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the result....</li>
            <li> but like I said before its time consuming, probably take me 15 minutes on just one leg but its worth it</li>
            <li> I tried it after taking a warm bath to exfoliate my skin, open my pores, and soften the hair.</li>
            <li> and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It took me forever to get both of my legs done, but within a week I knew it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Honestly I just went back to shaving.</li>
            <li> So it is worth it.</li>
            <li> The biggest difference is that b/c this one has a curved edge going upwards, you have to make sure that the hair you&#x27;re trying to remove is completely centered.</li>
            <li> It was worth it for me.</li>
            <li> The results were totally worth the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even fresh out the shower, I still looked like I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow (and my razor gets the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever seen).</li>
            <li> So I decided to buy this as my first epilator back in May, and i love it!</li>
            <li> I originally was using a Tweezie and this works so much better for upper lip and chin area.  </li>
            <li> it will go thru batteries pretty quickly, so either nab some rechargeable</li>
            <li> Runs through batteries pretty quickly but has lasted me til now.</li>
            <li> Good thing about it is that most locations which give you the most pain are hidden from the public view, so you can take as much time as you wish.</li>
            <li> This Emjoi is very travel friendly.</li>
            <li> so when one runs out the other one is good to go.</li>
            <li> all stubbly and leave a shadow right after shaving.</li>
            <li> right after it arrives (which mine did in 4 days)</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail yesterday and used it right away.</li>
            <li> Move the epilator head in the right</li>
            <li> right in about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> It does get rid of the hair, you can see the hair being plucked right out, but the pain is the downside.</li>
            <li> This is just right for me.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t hold this just right, it pulls your skin in.  </li>
            <li> - the price was right for me to try it out.  </li>
            <li> price is right for seeing you want to try this type of hair removal.</li>
            <li> right well it&#x27;s been a year and the bumps are still there</li>
            <li> take-away on epilator a is that they are perfect for busy people who just don&#x27;t want to shave everyday!</li>
            <li> It does hurt the first few times but works great.  </li>
            <li> It plugs the hair perfectly fine, even if hair break sometimes, but that is perfectly normal and can&#x27;t be avoided.</li>
            <li> Yes, the pain is very much there, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> If you are currently waxing, it is a cheap and easy transition.  </li>
            <li> Most of the sensation you get is from the vibrations of the rotating piece, so you barely notice the pain from plucking.</li>
            <li> I just used my epilator for over an hour straight and the batteries were still full of power at the end of that timeframe.</li>
            <li> When the device is running at full power, it is fast.  </li>
            <li> This was a battery operated hair remover (first mistake, always get one with a power cord for consistent/constant power) and after opening the package, I immediately put in fresh batteries and turned it on.  </li>
            <li> but I think I should of invested a little more for a more durable product.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll probably by irritated after the first couple uses too, so be prepared and don&#x27;t epilate right before you go out or</li>
            <li> Overall I am super excited!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is just me, but I experienced a lot of ingrown hairs on my legs after my first use.</li>
            <li> Another bonus was I had enough Amazon points that I got this for free and free shipping with the Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s cute, girly, and cheap</li>
            <li> I am so liking this little guy that I have worn him out, he doesn&#x27;t work as good as he did, so I am retiring it and going on to the 72 tweezer machine.</li>
            <li> You can feel it less pain and the tweezers grab the hair more easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*update*&lt;br /&gt;Photos have been posted.&lt;br /&gt;Continuous run time(in high setting) on full charged Eneloop(2000mah) is 2 hours 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> Your legs are so much more sensitive than your arms that I really highly recommend you shower before hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very fast too - use it on my arms mostly, but will probably try it on my legs next.</li>
            <li> some brushing and blowing the air makes it clean as new.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase in this type of product</li>
            <li> SUERTE CHICAS ;)</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s exactly what it feels like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d actually call it more of a medium discomfort but either way</li>
            <li> a hindrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself feels pretty sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> So I was a bit scared to use this at first.</li>
            <li> the first time I used it, I was in the school car rider line waiting for my kids</li>
            <li> I tried my first epilator which is Braun 3 on the store counter and found out the same result when I tried this one, so I&#x27;m glad I got this with cheaper price.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator that I ever used and purchased.</li>
            <li> First time is the hardest and takes the longest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like matter of minutes if you use it regularly.</li>
            <li> and it got here really fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Hispanic and have some pretty unsightly hair under my chin that this takes care of for me.</li>
            <li> Since this is my first I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else</li>
            <li> My first epilator.</li>
            <li> Try going with the hair first</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator 3 months ago, and it worked well for the first week.</li>
            <li> Some spots, no matter how many times I go over, wont be silky totally hairless</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> First here&#x27;s a heads up.</li>
            <li> I think I will eventually get a more expensive model though I have recommended this to my mother and friends because it really does a great job.</li>
            <li> I used it on my arms first and did both arms within like 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I think the hair was too short and too coarse - if it had been longer I&#x27;m sure it would have worked better</li>
            <li> I bought batteries at first</li>
            <li> First off I am a latina</li>
            <li> it seems to help if you shower first  5.</li>
            <li> It really works and it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not something you can use by itself most of the time because if hairs are too short, you will have to tweeze or shave them.</li>
            <li> Holy moly, prepare yourself before going in the first time.</li>
            <li> I did my lower leg first on one day</li>
            <li> First time every purchasing an epilator for my missus.</li>
            <li> Make sure you also get something to exfoliate the dead/dry skin so that way your legs get smoother and DEFINITELY use lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first time trying to use it,, doesnt even turn on.</li>
            <li> I suggest you take a hot shower and exfoliate before using it.</li>
            <li> The first day i got it</li>
            <li> (I would advise first time users to shave the area first because it hurts when the hairs are longer.</li>
            <li> This is my first time writing a review on amazon</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use this type of device - recommend over a razor and cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are no uncomfortable cuts with the Emjoi as with a razor.</li>
            <li> I will probably be using this for many years to come, but will reorder if necessary from this seller.</li>
            <li> I stick to my legs and my upper lip and am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re thinking of buying an epilator for the first time, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be worth it in the long run, and epilating is SO much better than shaving and waxing.</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator</li>
            <li> And I personally feel that my pores are more noticeable.</li>
            <li> so I read as many reveiws as possible on as many diffrent products as possible.</li>
            <li> It does take awhile the first time you use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used an adapter cord with it and it works so much better because of the extra power the cord gives it.</li>
            <li> So this was my first try at one of these.</li>
            <li> this was my first time ever epilating.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m really glad i tried it, because now i&#x27;ll never go back</li>
            <li> Be aware of what you are buying.</li>
            <li> I just used mine for the first time and did both lower legs, forearms and bikini area.</li>
            <li> I am a waxer and am pretty pain tolerant in this arena.</li>
            <li> I know there are recommendations that specifically say what direction to move the device over your skin, but I found that in order to get most of the hair I had to sort of wing it and go over the same areas many times in various directions.</li>
            <li> Please note it takes time the first time you use it if you never have pulled hairs out of your body and it does hurt until the endorphins kick in.</li>
            <li> my first epilator to be exact.</li>
            <li> I had bled the first time.</li>
            <li> It was my first time using one.  </li>
            <li> Overall this product seems an ok as a  starter, because it gives you a sense as to what others systems, like this one, feel and seem like.</li>
            <li> At First</li>
            <li> This is my favorite personal care tool!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time did hurt quite a bit, but it&#x27;s bearable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to upgrade to a higher end type once this one craps out</li>
            <li> and it was my first time trying an epilator.</li>
            <li> when i first got it, i tried it on my legs.</li>
            <li> at first i thought i was allergic reaction to something else, but i realized that some of the bumps looked like ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> i would recommend trying it on a small patch of hair in an unnoticeable place.&lt;br /&gt;the only reason i gave this two stars instead of one, is because if you&#x27;re going to try it, this is probably the best deal and size to try.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li> This model is also very affordable!</li>
            <li> but I love it for the underarm area because with shaving I always look like I haven&#x27;t shaved two hours later.</li>
            <li> And, at first it took a while</li>
            <li> This works exactly like</li>
            <li> In reading the Amazon reviews, one reviewer recommended having a glass of wine before the first time.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even imagine how much money i&#x27;ve saved on wax!.  </li>
            <li> Love this elipator, gonna invest in a rechargeable one next...</li>
            <li> Maybe I have a higher tolerance of pain, but I felt none at all..</li>
            <li> But the battery died fast!</li>
            <li> First time epilating ever.....</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got it .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li> I have always been an avid brazilian waxer.  </li>
            <li> like I had to do when I first waxed.  </li>
            <li> this is not the first one i have purchased, so i know they do not do 100% of a job</li>
            <li> I tried using it on my bikini area and not only did it hurt a lot, it didn&#x27;t even pluck most of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well on the hairs that I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;Trying to remove.</li>
            <li> Ok, so you&#x27;re pulling each individual hair out by the root.</li>
            <li> But that ended up being because it was still my first time.</li>
            <li> Thanks again, guys!</li>
            <li> this is my first epilator, i didn&#x27;t want to buy a super pricey high end model until i knew i&#x27;d like using one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s portable, easy to handle, &amp; powerful enough for all the jobs I need it for.</li>
            <li> Buy the battery operated is not strong power wise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times with new batteries and the batteries drained pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this model because of the price, not wanting to invest a large amount into something I had never used before and wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d stick with.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this model because of the price, not wanting to invest a large amount into something I had never used before and wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d stick with.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to sit still long enough to use it on my legs, but I think it would be worthwhile to give it</li>
            <li> Luckily for me those fine hairs are usually blonde and you can&#x27;t really see them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i honestly can&#x27;t see myself using this anywere other than my underarms.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months now and my leg hair is finally growing back in slowly, very light and fine</li>
            <li> I apparently have really fine hair</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure after the initial use it will be much quicker and easier,spot checking so to speak.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i found it&#x27;s helpful to move the epilator in a circular pattern instead of just straight lines back &amp; forth-grips some of the stubborn hairs better.</li>
            <li> It works at first and you will love how it&#x27;s ripping the hair out of the root but in the long run it will ruin your skin</li>
            <li> it works great on long hairs but not so hot for shorter ones... who wants hairs in unwanted places to get long and shabby before they can be handled by the product?</li>
            <li> Btw, it drains batteries pretty fast.</li>
            <li> but I did it and after the first time it doesn&#x27;t really hurt at all.</li>
            <li> It does eat up the batteries pretty fast</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator which means i dont have much to compare it to</li>
            <li> I own three different sizes and useful for different purpose.</li>
            <li> Not worth is in my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> and then I don&#x27;t know if the pain stopped, or if I denied the pain because I loved how effective it is at removing excess facial hair that I was frustratingly plucking for years.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve found that I have to go over areas several times, and that fine hairs are often not picked up.</li>
            <li> Just make sure your skin and hair are dry.</li>
            <li> The pain was not what I expected, it&#x27;s more a hot feeling than a plucked feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy and simple to use!  </li>
            <li> &amp; make sure the area is dry before you start working on it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work long enough for me to tell if it would have done a good job or not.</li>
            <li> As my first epilator I was a little unsure whether or not it would be worth the money since I have tried many none shaving approaches.  </li>
            <li> The IMPORTANT tip is to use your free hand to hold down the skin you&#x27;re about to do.</li>
            <li> It takes out MOST not every single one of your hairs</li>
            <li> rounded shape of the head gets in the way once in a while (ie: while doing my arms up by my wrist bones, in certain places around my knees, etc.)</li>
            <li> I would not use it for large areas like legs.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re gonna epilate more sensitive areas, slather on cream with lidocaine, wait 20 min, and be sure to be careful with thin skinned areas, but you&#x27;ll be more smooth than you&#x27;ve been before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many years ago, when this technology was new, a relative tried it and described torture.  </li>
            <li> Pulling the skin taut in areas with more dense hair and/or loose skin helps minimize the pain quite a bit as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emjoi</li>
            <li> The third time, I was fine.</li>
            <li> it seemed to work fine (definitely NOT painless, but not unbearable).</li>
            <li> It works, but you have to go over the skin OVER AND OVER; It broke a lot of hairs before actually pulling them, even though I have really fine hair.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of purchasing an epilator for the first time, I highly recommend watching this video :</li>
            <li> Love this little guy, love the process of the hair growing in thinner, softer, and at different intervals.  </li>
            <li> I quickly got used to the pain, and when I started lightly exfoliating every other day (damp washcloth after showering), the ingrown hairs stopped.  </li>
            <li> I had used on most delicate skin but was still comfortable.</li>
            <li> When you turn it on and see the really fast rotation and hear the motor running it can be intimidating.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend the Emoji!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work at all really</li>
            <li> It works fast and took out the unwanted hairs.</li>
            <li> Really hurts as it tugs on the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Once you get the job done, keeping it is much easier.</li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I would much prefer this hair remover if there was a power cord</li>
            <li> so I have nothing to compare it to, but I can say that it works very well</li>
            <li> Since I was already plucking the hair in that spot, it really didn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> I would recommend the straight head, not the curved head, model since the skin is rougher, tougher and thicker and won&#x27;t get pinched.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it has the same pain amount as waxing but at least you can do it at your own pace in your home.  </li>
            <li> They both work very well.</li>
            <li> the product itself isnt really workin out for me.</li>
            <li> the process is also very time consuming.</li>
            <li> Hair grows much slower.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Very time consuming.</li>
            <li> Would be much faster to just shave.</li>
            <li> but I feel that is very painless to use, uses a lot of battery though so invest in some rechargeable ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator</li>
            <li> what is beauty with no pain haha, i will rate this 4 stars since i&#x27;ve use it just once</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t pull out all the hairs at once, rather it took out a lot of the thicker hairs, but left the finer ones, so you&#x27;ll feel your leg feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> This epilator is cheap, and was bought because my British one doesn&#x27;t work in the US.</li>
            <li> I use to have the Epilady coil shaver which works really well.</li>
            <li> This works really well</li>
            <li> This epilator does it job very well.</li>
            <li> It is used w/batteries which I don&#x27;t like because they die to fast.</li>
            <li> And it really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it gets my skin extra smooth</li>
            <li> I was unsure of which Emjoi model to buy, this one or the corded/rechargeable version that is almost twice as much money.</li>
            <li> The hair remover also removes hair at a much shorter length.  </li>
            <li> it makes it MUCH EASIER</li>
            <li> It was very time consuming and hurt like hell.</li>
            <li> However, I much prefer a bit of momentary pain (which does diminish each session, just like waxing) then the razor bumps and infected ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> But who wants to wait for that?</li>
            <li> Really been wanting to try an epilator.</li>
            <li> I got it hoping it would work really well</li>
            <li> I gave it a two because it really didn&#x27;t pull out the hairs well.</li>
            <li> It works very well and ends up paying for itself with money saved with not needing to buy razors.</li>
            <li> I had never used an epilator, but was very attracted to the idea of not having to worry about shaving my legs so often.</li>
            <li> Very easy!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I do find htis item to be comfortable, I am either dense or the facial hair is coarser and the Emjoi can&#x27;t pick it up.  </li>
            <li> I thought the pain would be too much and that it might not work that</li>
            <li> but with this, i dont so much.</li>
            <li> I am very prone to ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a razor in over 3 months, and I noticed the hair is really sparse</li>
            <li> Otherwise very tolerable.</li>
            <li> This worked very well.</li>
            <li> It is another $17 including shipping, but then it will be battery capable and corded too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!  </li>
            <li> It is too gentle and does not remove hairs.</li>
            <li> your skin gets used to it and it becomes much easier if you keep up with it.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my legs and it didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> works really well..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good&lt;br /&gt;منتج</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use to tweezing my chin and found this to be pain free... only delivered a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> Instead of pulling the hair as a whole, it would break the hair.</li>
            <li> I found this accidently and loveeee it soooo much.</li>
            <li> and i haven&#x27;t seen the outcome maybe in a couple of weeks, but since the first time i noticed my skin was way more smoother, and you can actually see the root of the hair coming out, make sure to do it when your hair is not that long neither too short because is gonna hurt so much or is not gonna help at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was nice to not have to search to destroy and wonder what was missed as you have to do when manually tweezing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m leaving it at 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of getting thick hair.</li>
            <li> The pain is slightly surprising in the beginning, but just take it slow and take your time, and it&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that by dry brushing (a form of exfoliating) before my showers, then following epilating with a good natural lotion pretty much eliminates all of these issues.</li>
            <li> it is more time consuming than any other method if i do a large area (took 2 hours to do one leg).</li>
            <li> Just get a good one, even if it&#x27;s more expensive!</li>
            <li> Also make sure to clean the head by tapping it against the sink or trash on slow speed and using the brush that came with it.  </li>
            <li> I also had many set of rechargeable batteries for other uses.</li>
            <li> so in order to see if it was worth growing out my hair more, i decided to try it on my arms since that hair was long enough.</li>
            <li> I have never been this satisfied with any other hair remover.  </li>
            <li> And, I love PINK!</li>
            <li> there are a bunch of other brands and more pricey.  </li>
            <li> I have very light skin and rather dark hair, so</li>
            <li> It seems to work just fine, but it takes a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> Just glide the head over the skin nice and slow until you feel the first sign of it grabbing the hair.</li>
            <li> Works great and left very very few hairs -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to bet waxing hurts more, and I&#x27;ve definitely endured womanly things that hurt a hell of a lot more than the little sting of this gadget.  </li>
            <li> Effective at pulling hair, not too painful, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> : I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have hirsuitism.. which basically means that I have more body hair than the average woman.</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emjoi Divine Hair Remover is probably not a top of the line epilator, but it does the job quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Once all those hairs are finally plucked away (may take a good month or so of every few days of use), you will be much happier with the results.</li>
            <li> It does hurt a bit on certain areas, surprisingly the legs hurt worse than the &#x27;ahem&#x27; pits.</li>
            <li> The hair is removed relatively fast although you need to spend a little more time than shaving.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that won&#x27;t stay smooth via shaving for more than a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> One less thing has made a huge improvement!</li>
            <li> This is MUCH better on my skin than waxing, and costs tons less, too.</li>
            <li> I recommend investing in a more expensive and better quality epilator.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for my armpits and bikini line.</li>
            <li> The ones on my legs faded fairly quickly but the ones on my arms were still noticeable hours later.</li>
            <li> The red bumps still appear but they quickly disappear after lotioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain</li>
            <li> More expensive epilators may work better, but I haven&#x27;t tried them yet.   </li>
            <li> I had never used epilator before, so this review applies to both this particular model and the epilator in general.&lt;br</li>
            <li> reasons I chose this particular model are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really compare to others, but so far I&#x27;m really liking it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work too well on very coarse hair - will test out more later!</li>
            <li> they cost way more for only a moderate improvement.</li>
            <li> Second, make sure your hair is short!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely suggest getting rechargeable AAA batteries, as it goes through them quickly.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research online, mostly YouTube video reviews, and decide that if I bought it, I had to use it at least three times to see if it was worth it</li>
            <li> First of all, this is not my first purchase of an Emjoi or similar product.</li>
            <li> so I use it mainly for my underarms.</li>
            <li> You CAN still operate it, but it will be more likely to get ingrown hairs and hairs that aren&#x27;t pulled out all the way and such.  </li>
            <li> I have always had a problem maintaining the constant hair growth on my upper lip, not that it is overwhelming</li>
            <li> For the first couple hours, you&#x27;ll have little red marks that kind of look like a rash.</li>
            <li> I simply went over the hairs, moving the epilator to the right or left or even angling it, and it eventually got them all, even the tiny, fine ones!</li>
            <li> nonetheless if you are pain tolerant like me you will feel a slight pinch at first then its smooth sailing from there.</li>
            <li> Great for the little soft peach fuzz sort of facial hairs, but those pesky chin hairs are left standing straight!  </li>
            <li> highly recomended article</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> used it on high speed</li>
            <li> Maybe I have a high tolerance for pain because as soon as I tried it on my legs</li>
            <li> It is so convenient to give this a run when needed and the chin stays clean for a long time.</li>
            <li> : This epilator does a great job of pulling the hairs vs. merely breaking them.</li>
            <li> I used this for two weeks... and it never really made my legs &#x27;smooth&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve use it just once almost all over my body, and it works perfect, yes it is painful but</li>
            <li> I was always really self conscious about myself and my hairy arms and refused to go out during the summer time because of it.</li>
            <li> I am very excited to use this once my hair grows a little longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Found its easier to clean if you let the hair follicles dry out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since touched up my arms a few times and used my epilator on the slower speed and it has done a much better job of pulling the hairs from the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red</li>
            <li> but I am hoping that if eventually the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back, it is worth the pain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally give reviews but this product..</li>
            <li> , I will be purchasing a more long lasting model though.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you&#x27;d have to go over the spot a few more times but in the end it does it what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I was exciting when i purchased since i have smaller emjoi.</li>
            <li> I might update this after a few months. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to me for the convenience of not worrying about a cord, but it&#x27;s something to think about for the future.</li>
            <li> Since it is relatively inexpensive, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy their first epilator since I don&#x27;t think epilating (just like waxing) is for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it kind of sucks,</li>
            <li> But this seems to eat up batteries really fast because there is a noticable power reduction from the first time I used it to the second.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, and it helps to have fresh batteries, as they die it gets sluggish and therefore more painful!</li>
            <li> time, I&#x27;ll take the time to read and follow the instructions, such as directing the unit as to how the hair grows and using the correct speed, low for fine and high for course.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, especially because the price is right.</li>
            <li> Also got it right away, two days earlier than estimated.</li>
            <li> I did go back and finish my underarms the next day and although this was by far the most sensitive area, it too was bearable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d grow out the hair for a day or two before epilating, and make sure you pull the skin TIGHT!  </li>
            <li> and it still works like new.</li>
            <li> Also, lidocaine has become my new friend.</li>
            <li> I tried new batteries and no luck.</li>
            <li> But, as far as my bikini line goes, I think its great, I don&#x27;t like to shave the area and feel like waxing is just too expensive</li>
            <li> She says it doesnt really sting much compared to prior reviews.</li>
            <li> This leaves me with inflamed empty hair follicles for the first day or two after, but then thankfully for the first time I haven&#x27;t needed to worry about how my legs look/feel.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m glad i only spent $25.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you are very sensitive to pain, this epilator shouldn&#x27;t cause too much discomfort whatsoever, even in the more delicate bits.</li>
            <li> My arms were done pretty quickly and I bled a little.</li>
            <li> It soothes the your red skin and makes your skin super soft, plus you won&#x27;t have a leg full of red pores the next day.  </li>
            <li> I decided I&#x27;d only do a little on my right underarm and then shave, then do a little more when that grew back, and shave the rest again, and continued that pattern til most of my hair was removed via the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> Also, the pain tends to hurt more the higher (elevation wise) up the mound you go, so I tend to only use it up to the base of the pubic bone.  </li>
            <li> take a shower first, exfoliate your skin, and then make sure your skin is extra dry, and use the epilator also epilate on short  hair so if you hair is long , i Suggest shaving it first then</li>
            <li> I bought this product did not know much about epilator the battery runs down quickly</li>
            <li> : As I explained above, the first time hurts.</li>
            <li> had some fear before I actually used it for the first time</li>
            <li> Definitely buy this for the first timers and don&#x27;t get yourself work up over the pain.</li>
            <li> I kinda held it just above the hair at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is only the first day of using it</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> My first experience with a device like this and will be my last.  </li>
            <li> At first I was sceptical because of the low price of this item, but still bought it because the customer reviews were good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First off I bought this to use myself (male).</li>
            <li> After around half a year of owning this epilator, it is still working fine.</li>
            <li> started reading more reviews on websites other than amazon, and i see that  a lot of people have the same problem with epilators.</li>
            <li> but it actually works really well and the pain isn&#x27;t unbearable!</li>
            <li> The areas I was used to waxing did not hurt at all when I first used the epilator over them (underarm, legs, arms, upper lip).</li>
            <li> I was using a power cord, not batteries, as it blew through fresh batteries in about 2 minutes, if that long.</li>
            <li> BUT it really only hurts a lot the first time or two, just like waxing.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no way i&#x27;m putting it near my bikini line; waxing is quicker!</li>
            <li> The only complain is that should come with the power cord,it was ok with me because I&#x27;m using the one from the other epiroll.</li>
            <li> tried using the epilator at first on my upper lips.</li>
            <li> However it was a huge let down.</li>
            <li> There are so many brands of epilators that are extremely expensive, so I read numerous reviews before finding the Emjoi.&lt;br /&gt;The first time using it on my underarms was a bit of a plucking feeling, but not painful.</li>
            <li> By the time you switch to the next leg or arm the previous side will feel fine!   </li>
            <li> Well, I have tried my new Emjoi a few times and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> When I first tried my new Emjoi, I was satisfied, thinking it had pulled the hair out by the root when what it actually does, for the mmost part, at least on me, is shave the hair.</li>
            <li> First use was painful but my results were great.</li>
            <li> It may help my legs look less hairy, but I never feel smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly , before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> The first time I use it on my entire leg will probably result in maybe 20-30% of the hair growing back in a couple of days (ones that accidentally broke off at the skin, I guess), so it takes two or three sessions at the beginning of the summer before I&#x27;ve really gotten it all.  </li>
            <li> A little too strong a blade, I got it for my elderly mother who has used a smaller one for years and this one is just too much, probably for someone with tighter skin</li>
            <li> The DIVINE is even better that the previous battery opereated model, if at all possible.  </li>
            <li> Look for one with the maximum number of tweezers possible to make the process take less time by getting more hair at one</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will use that many batteries all the time because it will be faster the next times because there will definitely be less hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark body hair that grows really fast, I literally had to shave my legs 3 times a day if wanted to keep them smooth and hair free.  </li>
            <li> Works fine for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s nice to prune the shrubbery back a bit, and reduces the overall area by about half or so—which can be the difference between sticking out from a bikini or not.  </li>
            <li> Also the size is pretty big and you can not get to the small areas of your face easily.</li>
            <li> I do use it of course, but my old Epilady is still my first choice due to the straight tweezers plate.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite understand how to apply a large head to an individual hair, but instructions are clear to not use it elsewhere on the face or as an electric</li>
            <li> but if you start in more painful location, you&#x27;ll feel much more</li>
            <li> When I got it I thought that it could be more powerful, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find the same one and found this on Amazon with great reviews.</li>
            <li> After spending so much time using it, I was still left with stragglers and had to shave/ tweeze the rest.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s loud, but portable)</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not for days, you can take weeks to complete.</li>
            <li> frequently seems to use a lot of juice out of the batteries.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like the epilator.  </li>
            <li> But so far, it pulled up about 60 percent of the hair on whatever surface you are pulling from.</li>
            <li> Besides, who wants a big bulky thing?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cheap, easier to use, and makes your hair grow back much thinner/slower.</li>
            <li> The quality was no where near what I was expecting and try as I might</li>
            <li> and the cord doesn&#x27;t let you get as far as I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> It takes about a week before it really starts working (assuming you were shaving before this), because the hair has to grow out enough.</li>
            <li> It works really well on my facial hair and under my arms.</li>
            <li> My old Emjoi is still working well, but I wanted a back-up in case it ever wears out.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought -- except on my upper lip(I will just have to be hairy there).  </li>
            <li> If it stings too much, just stop, relax and work on a different area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product just doesn&#x27;t grab the hair like my old Epilady.</li>
            <li> Also, use the epilator cream after - I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I did get a rash when I didn&#x27;t use the cream.</li>
            <li> If your thinking of buying an epilator don&#x27;t bother if you can&#x27;t handle waxing or tweezing sensitive spots.</li>
            <li> The only thing that really bugged me is how often I will have to replace the batteries but no matter.</li>
            <li> My skin is incredibly sensitive and after years of struggling to find something that would not make me look like I tried to rip my skin off, I decided to give this epilator idea a try.</li>
            <li> The second time I was really sore.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s working so far, so</li>
            <li> The effects last so much longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> Works very well, though obviously it&#x27;s not painless.</li>
            <li> But I wish I would&#x27;ve gotten one when I was much younger; would&#x27;ve saved so much money and confidence.</li>
            <li> If the outer edge were curved downwards (like my old one), the blades could reach the hairs at any angle.</li>
            <li> Also, using it on my legs means I don&#x27;t have to shave them as frequently, even in summer.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it for soft cuddles; I bought it to remove my hair from the root.  </li>
            <li> It breaks a lot of hairs, and completely misses a lot of hairs.</li>
            <li> Overall, it speeds up the process, but it doesn&#x27;t do the whole job.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised @</li>
            <li> No irritation, blood, or raised areas; no ingrown hairs so far either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend this for larger areas such as your legs, only or places where being completely free of hair isnt the biggest concern.</li>
            <li> even on the sensitive spots.</li>
            <li> I eventually gave up in these areas completely.</li>
            <li> This epilator solved that problem completely.</li>
            <li> Okay, I got a few hairs in and decided I&#x27;d had enough for the night.</li>
            <li> That feeling alone is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Powerful didn&#x27;t work as well as expected</li>
            <li> I got this and was only able to use it a few times.</li>
            <li> But is IS effective, the battery life is not great abnd</li>
            <li> i gave it four stars because it doesnt pick up the super little hairs, but thats normal even with wax.</li>
            <li> So at first it will tweeze quickly but when the batteries are old, it loses strength.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that cleaning this is slightly difficult to get all the hairs out, other than that, this product is awesome.</li>
            <li> The chin feels a bit raw and there remains a bit of fine stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> My main problem with it was the shape of it because when I try to remove my armpit hair, the upper sides of this get in my way and don&#x27;t allow me to grab the hair because it cant get close enough and doesn&#x27;t work very well on curved body parts</li>
            <li> The first use was the most painful but don&#x27;t get scared off, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> It hurt a little the first time; but after that not so much.</li>
            <li> I only use this on my upper lip, while taking breaks in between tears,not my under arm because it hurts far too much!</li>
            <li> It pulls on them pretty hard, but rarely pulls them out.  </li>
            <li> When you feel the first pain, pull it back then take a deep breath.</li>
            <li> After some experiment, I found that adding sideway movement such as in small circular or zigzag motion to forward motion helps picking up more hair.</li>
            <li> Read lots of reviews and finally chose this one mainly because of the price.</li>
            <li> And the long lasting results are definitely worth the temporary pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> may want to have a small flat screw driver or something similar handy,</li>
            <li> It gets most of the hairs, only leaves very few.</li>
            <li> I will not lie-I personally have a high tolerance for pain and this even made me wince.</li>
            <li> short, I highly recommend this to anyone who likes smoother, longer-lasting results than a shave can give.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely thin or crepey skin, very mature skin for example, you may injure yourself if that tissuey skin is able to get caught in the pinching mechanism.</li>
            <li> It took a really long time to epilate both of my legs because I kept taking time off to breathe hahaha.</li>
            <li> yet!&lt;br /&gt;- give your body a couple of hours before you have to go out to get back to normal.</li>
            <li> First, be careful to follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li> And I am using it much less than at first, plus I notice certain stray hairs that never grow back.</li>
            <li> It may not be the best as high priced epilators, but let me tell you when buying one you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> the battery runs out a little quickly but it&#x27;s nothing</li>
            <li> For the price I paid I&#x27;m fine with shelling out a few extra bucks to order the adapter cord from the Emjoi site.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid I&#x27;m fine with shelling out a few extra bucks to order the adapter cord from the Emjoi site.</li>
            <li> and it takes an hour or two for the skin to calm down.</li>
            <li> I can do this once a week while watching a tv show (or three to get all the hair) and then shave the next morning and have silky smooth legs for a little under a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem was that it still didn&#x27;t pluck hardly any hairs even after I let the hair grow out and went over the same spot MANY times.  </li>
            <li> I suggest using brand new batteries because if you don&#x27;t, the tweezers will spin slower than the actual speed and make epilating a longer process.</li>
            <li> shave my underarms every day, winter or summer, and even right after shaving you can see the dark spots from the hair beneath the skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Legs:&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to grow your hair out very long to use it—just a millimeter or so—which is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that really hurts is the upper lip</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, and I had my doubts about it, but it has worked out really well for the past couple of months.</li>
            <li> I was sort of skeptical if it was going to really take away most of my body hair</li>
            <li> It takes a few times for your legs to feel smooth, but the hair does grow back finer and slower if you keep at it.</li>
            <li> Good for thoes who think waxing is too painful, it still hurts but is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I used many in last 20 years and this one hurt least so that I can use it on my under arms.</li>
            <li> I kept getting discouraged that I couldn&#x27;t get myself completely hairless, and had spent so much time.</li>
            <li> Take it easy and slow.</li>
            <li> It takes MUCH longer than my braun one, and misses lots of hair, but my braun one was much more expensive, so I guess it works out.</li>
            <li> Also, it wont pick up short fuzz, is better for the thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I found this for a reasonable price, but I was not for sure if it works as well as my expensive Braun epi.</li>
            <li> This device gets rid of hairs, but it creates major ingrown hair if used on face.</li>
            <li> Works better than waxing, although it leaves a few hairs they&#x27;re not nearly to the same amount as waxing.</li>
            <li> The pink parts are right but the white part of the one shown is silver on mine.</li>
            <li> For the most part it gets all the hair, but I find myself having to go over spots a few times and trying a few different directions before it really gets everything.  </li>
            <li> only con is that the hair that gets pulled stays in the device unless you shake it out and use the little brush that comes with it (meant to help clean the device and get the hair out of it).</li>
            <li> The only down fall is the batteries die out quickly.</li>
            <li> But as you use the hair remover, it becomes much less painful, and it is much more effective than waxing.  </li>
            <li> BEING A OLDER ITALIAN FEMALE</li>
            <li> This thing is so freaking painful, lol.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used mine long enough to know about battery life, but some reviews say that the batteries die fast.</li>
            <li> , I barely felt hurt, well it stings a bit</li>
            <li> The hair can&#x27;t be too short, but it gets nearly everything.</li>
            <li> basically my upper lip is just too sensitive and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if that happens to be your problem area.</li>
            <li> so I have no regrets about this impulse purchase.</li>
            <li> and I have use it only on my underarms so far.</li>
            <li> So far I dropped it only three or four times - no affect on productivity.  </li>
            <li> It barely grabs any hair that is coarser than arm hair.</li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied with this product as it was not as I expected to be(look at its description).</li>
            <li> I use this on my legs and barely feel a thing.</li>
            <li> Apparently if you want to use the epilator as a corded device, you need to buy an AC adapter SEPARATELY.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> If you have no experience with waxing it will be worse for you and you may not be able to tolerate the pain.</li>
            <li> only reason I took off one star is because I think the batteries make it less powerful over time.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a lot less messy than waxing, and better than shaving, so</li>
            <li> There is a technique to how to use it, like moving in small quick circles or switching directions.  </li>
            <li> That REALLY hurt, but I&#x27;d just do as much as a could at night, then shave the rest, let it grow out a little, use the epilator for as long as I could, and then shave the rest.</li>
            <li> A little bit of stinging, but I was surprised that it actually works (this was my first time using an epilator).</li>
            <li> I expected my legs to be smooth and stay smooth for at least a few days--does not happen.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, it does not hurt that much, I might have a higher pain tolerance</li>
            <li> wonder if other brands might work better for me, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m willing to waste money trying to find out.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this product because it would not turn on (I&#x27;ve tried several new batteries to make sure the batteries I was using wasn&#x27;t a problem).</li>
            <li> With some more getting use to, I&#x27;m sure it will be a lot less painful,</li>
            <li> In real use by on-off frequently, it probably goes only half as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleaning is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Despite its complicated looking mechanism, the hair won&#x27;t get stuck inside because critical parts comeout easily for the cleaning.</li>
            <li> Your only going to get about 2 hours charge time no matter how much money you spent on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , my batteries lasted much longer than I expected them too especially since I heard cheaper epilators ate batteries like a fat boy and cake.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using it with longer hair growth, short hair growth, barely there hair growth, legs, arms, armpits, belly...</li>
            <li> I recommend it for beginners but not long term</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t near as long as my leg or arm hair</li>
            <li> Its been 3 weeks since she used it and barely a hair has come back.</li>
            <li> Ten years from now, you&#x27;ll barely need to use this thing</li>
            <li> It does hurt the first few times, but the pain does decrease.</li>
            <li> I would call it more of an annoying sensation at times, but after a few minutes I actually liked knowing that it was working!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I bought this epilator because it was the cheapest and had decent reviews.  </li>
            <li> I got it mainly to avoid the endless irritation from shaving, and it has done just that.  </li>
            <li> , it can be frustrating at times but the patience is worth it for the hair to grow back more slowly.  </li>
            <li> Yes, some hair will be too small and stubborn, but you can remove those easily by any other means, or they won&#x27;t even be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Following the advice of other reviewers, I started the epilator on an area with no hair (the top of my foot) and slowly crept up on the leg hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it gets maybe half out if you&#x27;re really thorough.</li>
            <li> biggest complaint about this unit is how quickly it drains batteries.</li>
            <li> and then if it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs you want the first few times, try a different direction.  </li>
            <li> I am not too easy on my stuff (poor storage, dropping stuff often and etc)</li>
            <li> however that since this one is a very basic model, you will have to go over the hairs a few times for it to grab all of them, but I didn&#x27;t expect perfection for this price, not when compared to the fact that the majority of epilators costs twice as much!</li>
            <li> i use ice before and after so my face cools down, but only recommend this to people with a high tolerance for pain!</li>
            <li> Excited to know that it will hurt less and less.</li>
            <li> The first day you may had a bit tender skin but nothing bad and the next day it will be lovely.  </li>
            <li> I did some research trying to figure out first, if I even wanted to attempt epilating, then second which one to buy to test it out ... ended up buying the Emjoi Divine (pink &amp; white) because of the price and based on other reviews (on Amazon &amp; the web in general).</li>
            <li> apparently, what feels like the hairs being pulled straight from the root, can really just be the hairs being pulled and/or broken.</li>
            <li> That being said, I like having to shave less often, and the hair that grows back is much thinner and easier to remove.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the batteries run out quick.</li>
            <li> Because of how the tweezers are place on the epilator, it makes it a little hard to reach everything in your under arm, so I spend a more time in that area.  </li>
            <li> The hair also gets all jammed up in the top part and it&#x27;s very hard to get out.</li>
            <li> The little tweezer blades seem to move slower that the ones in the silk epil, thus not as fast at removing unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> but it really hurts and leaves my skin a little irritated.</li>
            <li> Problem is now I need to find a new adapter, the other one has bit the dust and the Divine</li>
            <li> The main problem I have is that its a little difficult to clean with the brush, particularly under the spinning part, but this hasn&#x27;t changed its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I have a high pain tolerance and still had trouble making it through my first few sessions with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The underarms ARE more painful than the legs, because the skin is more delicate and the hair isthicker.  </li>
            <li> but it just takes some extra pulling of the skin and a stiff neck afterwords haha</li>
            <li> Still couldn&#x27;t get them all, and by the time I went back for a second try a few days later, new hairs had started sprouting again!</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be pretty sensitive and the places where the hairs got pulled out there were red dots left behind that stayed for about a day.</li>
            <li> It also got less and less powerful over time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also a problem if I shave too frequently, so balancing the two against each other</li>
            <li> Slight difficulty with stubborn new stubble growth..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my epilator on several occasions since that first time to touch-up areas all over my body (legs, arms, underarms, bikini area, even face) and I can tell you the pain is far less than it was initially as the epilator is merely removing the regrowth which is very sporadic compared to the amount of hair I started with.</li>
            <li> using this epilator took a really long time and did not get all of my hairs, so i had to go over the same area multiple times.</li>
            <li> After the process was done, my legs are pretty hairless and the ingrown hairs I had were all removed and the red bumps were still there but were slowly going away.</li>
            <li> Even on high speed it kept missing about 30% of the hairs</li>
            <li> But so far I&#x27;ve only been able to use it on my arms because the pain is so bad I have not had the courage to use it on my legs, also because I ran out of batteries.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t take long before the red bumps appeared everywhere</li>
            <li> A set of AAA batteries doesn&#x27;t last for a long time(test result in update at the end) before it needs recharging</li>
            <li> I found some hair grow flat to the skin</li>
            <li> do recommend trimming areas with LONG coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting to see how long the batteries will last, though.</li>
            <li> Maybe you have to wait til the hair is long enough..</li>
            <li> however, the hair on my legs wasn&#x27;t long enough (i had just shaved not about a week before).</li>
            <li> This is a good product but the batteries dont last long , so, though this is an affordable hair remover unless you use rechargeable batteries you will end up spending a lot each time :(</li>
            <li> It always seems a little laggy even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical of this particular epilator to work, but it works wonders.  </li>
            <li> If you use it regularly, most painful part will become nearly painless.</li>
            <li> it is the most painful method of hair removal i have tried thus far.</li>
            <li> I had heard many a horror story of people purchasing epilators and talking about it being too painful and how the epilator was frighteningly loud, and basically just chickening out.  </li>
            <li> so shaving gives you completely smooth for a few days, at least in my experience.</li>
            <li> I would recomend rechargable batteries for this, as it uses 3 AAAs and that will be expensive very quickly.</li>
            <li> Tweezing the old fashioned way hurts less, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I would just finish shaving and still have to be self conscious about all the black dots all over my legs.</li>
            <li> I had to go over the same area quite a few times to get the spot completely hairless and by the time i was done</li>
            <li> I like this product but it does take quite a few passes to remove all the hair but its worth it in the end when you don&#x27;t have to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> My first one was a purple colored Braun for a little less than what the Emjoi cost.</li>
            <li> The first few times it is painful, but as you use it more, it starts to not hurt.</li>
            <li> Extremely painful the first go around, after the first time I barely felt it.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as my smaller version, the slight curve makes it hard to do my underarms and bikini area.</li>
            <li> my first use hurt really bad, since my leg hairs were pretty long, but additional uses barely hurt because my hairs were shorter.</li>
            <li> The short hairs left me feeling slightly stubbly, and later on</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised at how little discomfort</li>
            <li> It really helps to start in one area and work your way out from that spot slowly (at least for me).</li>
            <li> On my first try it only took me well within 5 minutes to get rid of my embarassing issue with Emjoi Divine, it can be painful at first but that will start to decrease overtime,</li>
            <li> Takes way too long to remove the hair</li>
            <li> this took WAYYY too long</li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t be using it for that long because of the pain.</li>
            <li> It removes the hair for a long time but it took me an hour to do a piece of one leg.</li>
            <li> , and I had absolutely no issues with having to go back to</li>
            <li> Keeps hair away for a long time-opposed to shaving.</li>
            <li> If the hair is too long the user will feel discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going to wait and see how long I can go without a touch up.</li>
            <li> wait for it to get long where people can see it.</li>
            <li> As a long time epilady user I was leary of straying from the \\&quot;brand name\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t return the hair remover as I have had it for too long.</li>
            <li> even if i didn&#x27;t get the bumps, i don&#x27;t like that fact that the hair has to be relatively long in order for this to work.</li>
            <li> Beware leg hair that is too long though...</li>
            <li> : it died a long time ago</li>
            <li> and I have long since thrown it out.</li>
            <li> It does take a long time to grow it out and then sit there for a while getting all the hairs.</li>
            <li> (even worse than my lady parts) and left me with ingrown hair ish whiteheads and straight up arm zits for weeks !  </li>
            <li> After awhile you seriously become used to the feel until you move to a more coarse area, then you slow down and become used to the area again.&lt;br /&gt;True</li>
            <li> and I have to go over the same spot over and over again to get what little hair this actually gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this model due to the price - wanted to see what I was getting into, before dropping 70 dollars.</li>
            <li> it takes a little longer than your more expensive products to remove all your hair but it does remove hair.</li>
            <li> I prefer epilating once a week over shaving every other day and having a stubble show up that same day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just went back to my other one</li>
            <li> I use this on my upper lip every week, and on my chin and other areas about every two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I bought this model because of the price, and because other one&#x27;s with similar prices had fewer tweezers on the head.</li>
            <li> I bought some rechargeable batteries that I use in all my little gadgets such as this so that I&#x27;m not constantly spending money on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been plucking my eyebrows for about 5 years now, and just recently started growing them back out to be a little fuller again.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re used to epilating/waxing or you seriously have a VERY high pain tolerance, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> But now, instead of taking a very long time to get rid of the hair, I just have to use the Emjoi Hair Remover.</li>
            <li> I have to run it over the same area a few times to get every hair, and it is pretty painful at first but definitely eases with use.</li>
            <li> I cleared both legs of all hair, and it was painful, but it really wasn&#x27;t worth doing it again.</li>
            <li> It got a few of the hairs on my legs, but left the vast majority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The stinging sensation only lasts a few moments after the hairs are pulled out though and is definitely tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could not live without it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I do have to tweeze a few stubborn hairs, but nothing major.</li>
            <li> the unit doesn&#x27;t catch every single hair with a single pass.</li>
            <li> the unit doesn&#x27;t catch every single hair with a single pass.</li>
            <li> With shaving I had to face the hassle of shaving every single day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t grab every single hair, but neither does waxing..</li>
            <li> As a former razor girl I was looking for ways to lighten my dark pits.</li>
            <li> It barely shaves the hair and has trouble &amp;#34;grabbing&amp;#34; the hairs to pull out.</li>
            <li> I had to CONSTANTLY thread my upper lip for at least 10 minutes to make sure I got every single little hair out of sight, it then became tedious since I had to maintain it every two days or so.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s painful for the first month or so, and the batteries die very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product it was painful - much like waxing.  </li>
            <li> So if you just glide it over your skin, the last hair you pulled overrides the pain of the previous plucked hairs.</li>
            <li> It usually takes a week for my hair to grow back in, however everyone is different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got ghost-white skin and jet black hair, so shaving always left the root of my hair visible through my skin.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t make my hair growth slow down that much.</li>
            <li> Other than that you cannot hurt yourself as long as you hold the skin taut as you pass the device over the surface.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt too bad, the ONLY thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the batteries die very quickly</li>
            <li> I spent about 20 minutes on just the section of my left leg under the knee;  still didn&#x27;t get even half of the hair.  </li>
            <li> So I use the epilator once every two weeks or so, but since the hair is more sparse in subsequent sessions, it&#x27;s much less painful, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms:&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sound is the same as an electric razor so not too bad</li>
            <li> I had shaved a few days prior to my epilator arriving</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of hours trying to get it to work the way it is supposed to</li>
            <li> I have never really waxed</li>
            <li> I have to run back over again several times for it to grasp the hair that left behind.  </li>
            <li> I had to roll the product over my underarms gently several times to remove the hair but it kept missing some.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it about 2-3 weeks and use it every few days for touch-ups, and I&#x27;m on the 3rd set of batteries.    </li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s really not an issue.</li>
            <li> were too expensive or weren&#x27;t worth the work.      </li>
            <li> But they went away within a few hours and left smooooth skin!  </li>
            <li> so some discomfort is expected.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this epilator is not as powerful as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Not as I expected.</li>
            <li> Have tried few different times to &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; using this.</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks for my hair to grow back.</li>
            <li> After a few uses I&#x27;ve learned the proper process of holding and moving it.</li>
            <li> I take off the outer pink, plastic cover to use it.</li>
            <li> As I am maturing, I&#x27;m getting those few ling and coarse hairs beneath my chin.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been waxing for quite some time, my hairs are not very course or plentiful.</li>
            <li> so I expected it).</li>
            <li> It is necessary to go over spots a few times.</li>
            <li> but this machine would only pick up a few in each run.</li>
            <li> (well.. that was kinda expected), so I had to do three sessions of epilation.</li>
            <li> (I guess that&#x27;s expected as well looking at everyone&#x27;s reviews).</li>
            <li> but I will get these in a few days, they may have been too short.  </li>
            <li> Being tired of spending so much on razors/blades, I decided to give this a try with a gift certificate I&#x27;d been given.  </li>
            <li> The rest of the hair will grow back in probably a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It worked but it was messy and imprecise and the areas I waxed would be irritated and sometimes break out the next day.</li>
            <li> But not moreso than expected.</li>
            <li> and I only have to use it in a few places every couple of weeks now (and</li>
            <li> I spent hours trying to get all the hair</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is because I have thin hair, but it still has not helped me all that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with thick hair and wanted to try something besides waxing and shaving.</li>
            <li> The hair grows back thick, and no different from how it&#x27;d be</li>
            <li> not very happy with it because it just gets the hairs that are longer not really the short short ones.</li>
            <li> Very painful and do not work good on my legs and the battery do not lost longer</li>
            <li> but i believe that after a long while of pulling out those hairs the less hairs there will be.</li>
            <li> The first time was only lightly painful, but the results definitely out weighed that.  </li>
            <li> and skin felt alittle raw, but after applying after-epilation cream, it was totally taken care of.</li>
            <li> After my first try, I looked like a plucked chicken with red, raised bumps!  </li>
            <li> , twas way too painful (usually that kind of pain doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> Wow, this was realy painful at first, but I got used to it.</li>
            <li> So far, I found it to be painful at times, for my first time .</li>
            <li> Not a clean shave and has strange angles which you can&#x27;t get to all the spots.</li>
            <li> I did have quite a few arm hairs broken the first time I epilated</li>
            <li> If you shave after epilating with this your legs will be silky for around 5 days - the little hairs it leaves behind are extrememly fine and slow growing</li>
            <li> The mustache hurt the most, not so bad if I tighten my lip by pulling it down over my teeth.  </li>
            <li> However, I found it a bit more painful than my previous Phillips model.</li>
            <li> Pretty close to useless.</li>
            <li> Cried and winced until I got one done and said screw the other one.  </li>
            <li> They sell other items for twice the price and this one was the cheapest.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer I&#x27;ve never had an epilator before</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Original Review*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about this product at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews and some complain that it hurts</li>
            <li> ON MY FACE (NOT PRETTY).</li>
            <li> NO nicks or cuts as with other product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not pinch on your legs or some other parts of your body, but It does pinch when you use it on your underarm.</li>
            <li> It breaks other hairs without getting the root.</li>
            <li> Recommend it to those who have waxed or used other hair removers.</li>
            <li> I used to shave my legs only once a week because I&#x27;m lazy and am in a LDR, but with epilating I didn&#x27;t have to worry about my legs looking progressively hairier as the week went on, they stayed hair</li>
            <li> I was looking for an epilator that works with batteries without charging for my foreign travel.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was using it for small areas, like my fingers or belly.  </li>
            <li> This may work for other people, but not for me.  </li>
            <li> I am Caucasian and got discoloration, small white spots you can barley see them</li>
            <li> The good thing about this product is that it actually pulls out the hair instead of just cutting it off although if your trying this for the first time it will be a bit painful especially if your hair on legs are long, and less painful if their short.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s often extremely painful while often little more than tickling sensation, depends on the location and the thickness of the hair.</li>
            <li> And at one point, this epilator actually grabbed some of my face skin, pinched hard, jammed and stopped.  </li>
            <li> No redness was a plus as waxing has left me with irritating red hair bumps.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive,I always used shave my legs and next day started itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> for Bikini uses, it didn&#x27;t work too well for me, in the sense that it was a little difficult for me to angle it the right way to pull out all the hairs.</li>
            <li> you must be careful and hold skin tight or you can get skin cought</li>
            <li> And if you cut a lemon in half, rub it on your legs (yes, it will burn a little) and let it dry AFTER you..pluck?</li>
            <li> I purchased this item mainly for using on my underarms, as I was tired of shaving them everyday.</li>
            <li> Love that my arm pit hair is no longer lethal stabbing sharp, but softer and seriously I seem to have less BO, need to not use deodorant twice a day either.  </li>
            <li> I had read in other reviews previously that it hurt like something yanking on your face</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that it takes so many batteries,</li>
            <li> I had the smaller version and it was hard to line it up to snatch them.</li>
            <li> It is little bit slower in hair removal than other brands and need to change the battery quite often, however, I could not use any other hair remover on my underarms before.</li>
            <li> I actually use a purposed hard bristle toothbrush and that works.</li>
            <li> It keeps my pits smooth all the time, no discoloration or ingrown hairs, and the pain isn&#x27;t so bad in that area.</li>
            <li> I really thought it might be mediocre, but it didn&#x27;t meet that expectation.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, I used to pluck my underarms so that I could avoid getting a dark spot.</li>
            <li> This does make hair grow back faster in comparison to getting a wax (for me at least).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m anxious to see how long until I have to use it again.  </li>
            <li> Dark pits are lightening up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 4 dollars worth of batteries for 2 months of crazy epilating.</li>
            <li> Try each region at least twice, especially if you have never waxed or plucked the area since as the follicle weakens, the pain and regrowth texture</li>
            <li> So many at home hair removal products had disappointed me in the past, and they never really worked like they said it would.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush that is included is not useful to me.</li>
            <li> It is not worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it twice so far and nothing has gotten broken or damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am Greek and have thick, dark hair.</li>
            <li> I used it on my underarms a few times, and each time I did, it was so rough, that it burned my underarms.</li>
            <li> the hair grows back slowly.</li>
            <li> bikini area was surprisingly painless, with the stomach and underarms being one of the worst things I&#x27;ve ever had to experience.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ll scrub your legs down with sugar (brown sugar is easier on your skin) before, and after you use this, it helps alot.</li>
            <li> but BEFORE you scrub your legs with sugar, you cut down on your ingrown chances</li>
            <li> That way, the hair gets pulled upward instead of pulled down and side way.</li>
            <li> After a week, the motor started slowing down.</li>
            <li> Trim the hair down and then go over it with the hair remover to ease the pain.  </li>
            <li> I am going to knock the ratings down to four stars because I realized it does break off some of your hair</li>
            <li> Also, I shaved the hair down and it seems easier for the &amp;#34;Devine&amp;#34; to catch shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely can cause ingrown hairs though and little hard to use on curves.</li>
            <li> few common issues and my personal experience with them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a week and a half for delivery.</li>
            <li> Takes less time every time too.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, when I wax, it takes me about 10 minutes per arm pit, and I am left with stray hairs that need to be plucked afterward/later</li>
            <li> DO ensure that hair length is slightly half an inch maximum before using the epilator.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as my previous Emojoi I had.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this has less blades.</li>
            <li> but you get used to it in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> and I was done on my legs in less than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> It does the job but not quite as well as the one I previously used.  </li>
            <li> Less hair combined with the fact that my underarms are getting used to</li>
            <li> and if it became less painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In conclusion, for all of those first timers, like myself, or maybe for those searching for their next epilator, I recommend this epilator, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> so it took forever to de-hair half of one leg.</li>
            <li> So, I was a bit wary about this thing because the thought of multiple little tweezers plucking out armpit hair sounded terrifying but my armpits are very sensitive and the many other methods of removing hair either didn&#x27;t work,</li>
            <li> I do have to go over certain areas several times and even had to take a few breaks because it was getting painful.</li>
            <li> None of that mess from wax, and no stubble from a razor or trimmer.</li>
            <li> However, this little machine did not remove even half of my hair.  </li>
            <li> even the closest shave will leave the hair just beneath the skin visible and little black stubble</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, convenient and less painful than you would think (unless you do your underarms).</li>
            <li> Got a slim one for face and tight spot.</li>
            <li> so you have to hold the skin tight</li>
            <li> you already use an epilator and are looking to buy a new one, I would not recommend this product because it&#x27;s just not perfect.</li>
            <li> This is adequate but a little painful when using.  </li>
            <li> but I wish it was a little faster.</li>
            <li> I can take a little pain.</li>
            <li> I found out after some experiment for the people not familiar with using epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little device doesn&#x27;t is a savior.</li>
            <li> Took me a little longer</li>
            <li> A little ouchy, but all of them are.  </li>
            <li> what would I do without this little device???  </li>
            <li> However this little machine does the job.</li>
            <li> So I worked around it by just letting the hair grow out a little longer.</li>
            <li> I just remove a little bit of hair each night before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> It calms the nerves and gives you a little courage.</li>
            <li> just like little pinches...</li>
            <li> It is extremely painful, left many hairs behind &amp; seemed like the motor became weak &amp; stopped working all together after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> not crazy bad.  </li>
            <li> Within two minutes I was numb enough to do my entire leg AND both arms.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money..</li>
            <li> I said, waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> finished with one leg (up to the knee) and was halfway done with the second when my epilator started dying, approximately 35 minutes in.</li>
            <li> a few aaa batteries can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> i was welted and bleeding in a few places.</li>
            <li> I will deal with having to shave every few days if it means not being in pain.</li>
            <li> I have been been trying to look for a product that will end my everyday battle with razorblades.</li>
            <li> I found out after I got the product and had it run through a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I saw a few YouTube videos and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> No loss of power, like after a few minutes of the batteries...</li>
            <li> I was tired of shaving all the time, ingrown hairs, and red bumps everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Not as described i wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this product.</li>
            <li> I was using wax strips, but it can be so messy</li>
            <li> I like the product, but a few words of caution.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would break the hairs and be a waste of time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof either, so you have to do it when you&#x27;re dried up.</li>
            <li> few tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a few times of going over each spot to get all of the hairs.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this simply because i&#x27;m tired of shaving.</li>
            <li> a few times before I got all of the hair removed.</li>
            <li> Gave it four stars instead of five because of the missing batteries.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> The hairs were not fine nor stubby</li>
            <li> On the first use it was a little painful but not to the point of crying or anything.</li>
            <li> The first time i used it on my leg was a little painful.</li>
            <li> yes, its a little painful when you first start to use it, but your body gets used to it.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick and dark hair and using this on even my legs resulted in a lot of broken hairs which grew back noticeably within a week.</li>
            <li> Speaking as a person who regularly waxes and am used to the pain, I can definitely say this is way less painful.  </li>
            <li> I have done this about six times and it really does get less painful every time.  </li>
            <li> If you start there first, then you may feel it painful</li>
            <li> Painful as all get out - shower first and maybe have a shot or two!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would say it is painful the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> The first one was decades ago and horribly painful.</li>
            <li> but it was still painful for the first couple uses</li>
            <li> One of the problems though, is that since it is battery powered, as you go along, it will slow down.</li>
            <li> The slightest bit of pressure I would place on it to try and grab a hair would slow it down.</li>
            <li> There is slight chaffing, but hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> (shaving always left uncomfortable stubble, waxing was always too messy, chemical depilatories never even worked).</li>
            <li> Now all my hair is growing back at different rates, so it&#x27;s not so painful.  </li>
            <li> Left a lot of ugly red bumps too.  </li>
            <li> its a little weird at first, but its just like a wax, the first time is the worst.</li>
            <li> and I have thick dark hair which can be hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I do have very dark and relatively thick hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really hurt as bad as I thought.</li>
            <li> This one works very well, but is painful (don&#x27;t plan on getting one unless you can handle your hair getting pulled out from the root).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that by making small circular motions with the epilator</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that by making small circular motions with the epilator</li>
            <li> Do small part at a time.</li>
            <li> You may see some redness and small bumps afterward where the hair came out, but in a day or two, the skin will become baby smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /smooth, not sure why.</li>
            <li> Im not sure</li>
            <li> and my sister&#x27;s been using for the past two years</li>
            <li> got it and the noise it makes is probably one of the scariest parts, once you get past the noise it gets worse,&lt;br /&gt;it removed a small amount of hair and nicked me in the process</li>
            <li> Still had some small hairs on legs</li>
            <li> At first, I was disappointed because I couldn&#x27;t see to get all the hairs out.</li>
            <li> Gonna try another one, not sure which as of yet.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Not sure if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I started with a small section on one of my legs.  </li>
            <li> If not, I recommend getting the adapter, then start by working in small areas.  </li>
            <li> No more bumps or ingrowns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to go over areas around 5 or 6 times to get all of the hair off, and even then small hairs show up here or there.</li>
            <li> After the 1st use, there was no more irritation.</li>
            <li> I hated this at first because I spent HOURS trying to pluck all my hairs.</li>
            <li> leg hair is black, and medium thick, not too thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used countless exfoliators, it&#x27;s very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Did not want to get a more expensive one and hate it.  </li>
            <li> now my arms look horrible and all i can really do is wait until the hair grows back.</li>
            <li> You do need to go over the area a few times if there&#x27;s tough hair to pull up, but my friend who has the expensive Braun&#x27;s epilator said that she has to do the same with hers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale so you can see the hair</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> this was my first time using an epilator, which i bought because i hate shaving.</li>
            <li> I like to take it slow and work with small areas at a time with breaks in between.</li>
            <li> The process of going over my limbs with the epilator was also a slow and laborious process since it is relatively small and performed  inconsistently in pulling hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> how less painful it was compared to an actual Brazilian Wax.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s hard for the tweezers to catch.</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to get off the cover that protects the blades, but it does come off with a little coaxing.</li>
            <li> Get those stubborn hard hairs that u can&#x27;t get with the tweezers.</li>
            <li> I barely feel anything unpleasant now.  </li>
            <li> Too late to return</li>
            <li> But I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say it&#x27;s painful.</li>
            <li> It took me about a day to actually use it because I was afraid of the spinning tweezers</li>
            <li> I whipped out my 3 AAA batteries and popped those suckers in there.</li>
            <li> SAY GOODBYE TO SHAVE GEL, SAY GOODBYE TO RAZORS, SAY GOODBYE TO RUDE BEAUTY SALON STAFF, SAY GOODBYE TO RAZOR BUMPS,</li>
            <li> I did make the mistake of trying to use this on my underarms, and was in pain for at least three days after.</li>
            <li> it sucks my skin into it</li>
            <li> my skin sucks now</li>
            <li> i wish i could return it, but it is probably too late</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow and just hurt.</li>
            <li> so I will be returning if you have thick hair</li>
            <li> slowly apply it to an area with no hair like the palm of your hand</li>
            <li> No more waxing!</li>
            <li> Im reformed, no more razors!</li>
            <li> I mean hundreds of these ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> i mean it gets the job done, but</li>
            <li> Unpleasant, but brief and negligible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s broken, but I would say it&#x27;s not equipped for lengthy use on legs etc.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this for me after my Remington Gold bit the dust; at first I hated it, it just didn&#x27;t have any power even after I changed the batteries and wouldn&#x27;t pull out the hair</li>
            <li> But seriously this doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Nothing serious, but I did get a couple bruises.  </li>
            <li> I find the reviews complaining of pain ridiculous.</li>
            <li> so I seriously do recommend using rechargeable batteries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Red bumps and ingrown hairs are terrible in this area, but I&#x27;ve recently found that treating the area with witch hazel afterwards seems to help prevent that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> im serious</li>
            <li> I actually think it is less painful to just wax than use this thing!</li>
            <li> Does not hurt too bad, batteries usually last for 4-5 use</li>
            <li> but I contend with bad ingrown hair on my thighs and back side and</li>
            <li> If you wax regular (like me) then epilating would not be painful.</li>
            <li> I prepared myself for the worst possible pain, but it honestly wasn&#x27;t horrible.</li>
            <li> There is a tiny prick of sensation with use, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it painful.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin extremely red and painful but you&#x27;ll get used to the pain after a while.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;PS the second time around isnt as painful.</li>
            <li> But when it dies or I get tired of how slow it is</li>
            <li> I got tired of expensive waxing and shaving everyday was a pain.  </li>
            <li> at first I was doubtful about buying it, but now that I have it has changed my life forever!</li>
            <li> wanted to wait for a bit before posting, because I knew the first time would be awful (from reading reviews and comments)</li>
            <li> The first day was the worst because I just wasn&#x27;t used to it</li>
            <li> It sucks..!</li>
            <li> The first week it hurt something terrible.  </li>
            <li> It still goes weak within minutes.</li>
            <li> From the reviews I&#x27;ve read, they seem very common.</li>
            <li> i have very thick hair</li>
            <li> dont waste your money on this one!!!</li>
            <li> re-pluck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about how painful it would be to use this, but it really isn&#x27;t too bad (probably because I&#x27;ve waxed/plucked before).</li>
            <li> Next I decided to try my legs and holy crap</li>
            <li> Alas, after one drop too (way too)</li>
            <li> It leaves behind patches on my legs and does not work on underarms</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Since i&#x27;m terminally broke</li>
            <li> I think waxing is worse because it rips your skin off w/</li>
            <li> I looked into epilators because shaving was really irritating my underarms.  </li>
            <li> I had been using an epilady purchased from HSN approximately 8+ years ago.  </li>
            <li> over time I expect it to thin out my hair</li>
            <li> alas, it is not.  </li>
            <li> It worked for approximately 5 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong, it hurts like a B</li>
            <li> My biggest disappointment was that the product arrived without the AC Adapter, so there was no way to plug it in to use, and I don&#x27;t usually have 3 AAA batteries just lying around the house.</li>
            <li> so I could go get them waxed, took me about half an hour to do, and didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> This does the trick and is less painful than the Epilady.</li>
            <li> Much less painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> That was a less painful plan.  </li>
            <li> Emjoi was lots less painful</li>
            <li> only gave 4 stars because it is painful to use (feels like the hairs are being ripped out...which they are!)</li>
            <li> NO GOOD!</li>
            <li> NOT a good buy!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, a little painful</li>
            <li> It was a little painful</li>
            <li> so my hairs are tough!</li>
            <li> So the batter power become very weak  </li>
            <li> I thought removing hair from the tweezers would be difficult but just rotating it by finger,</li>
            <li> She was skeptical about using one.</li>
            <li> I am 36 yo and have waxed ever since I was 17, but waxing is way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the cheaper epilators, and I thought I&#x27;d give this a try before going all out and getting some expensive one (which I tend to do a lot on impulse) and hating it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> although the results are not breathtaking...</li>
            <li> idk why even if I go over and over idk why but ill try</li>
            <li> It feels a bit numb after I done it, but it feels like a baby&#x27;s butt, which I have never experienced before on my body.</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs today, yes it is uncomfortable but soaking in a bath did help.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use it to remove all the hair under my left arm and it was AWFUL!  </li>
            <li> but they were too expensive.</li>
            <li> does what it says, but idk if i&#x27;m using it the wrong way?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I kept dropping it</li>
            <li> Sometimes there are weird angles in which I want to catch the hair but can&#x27;t b/c of the design.</li>
            <li> It was gettng expensive even though I do the waxing myself</li>
            <li> It is very painful when it removes the hair and the tweezers are very rough.</li>
            <li> Painful and never got less painful.</li>
            <li> It is very painful and in my opinion not worth it.</li>
            <li> I also tried it on my legs which was uncomfortable but not that bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been afraid to try waxing but would rather give it a try than to use this again.</li>
            <li> It is alright but too painful and tedious for me.</li>
            <li> I am afraid of ingrown hair that might appear.</li>
            <li> It does not have any moving &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34; or any blades so you don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t find it that painful; that seemed to exaggerated.</li>
            <li> This thing hurts like crazy.  </li>
            <li> and those are expensive !  </li>
            <li> it was very weird.</li>
            <li> every girl should get one of these, seriously!!!</li>
            <li> PS- Epilating doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad</li>
            <li> Badly.  </li>
            <li> its not that bad.</li>
            <li> Its not as bad as what othera says.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to write a bad reveiw or go through the headache of trying to send it back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to order a wire separately because the batteries are a bad idea.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad</li>
            <li> I assumed it would be a rather painful process</li>
            <li> As for the pain on a scale of 1-10 and 10 being really painful</li>
            <li> It works&amp; it&#x27;s painful</li>
            <li> /&gt;Epilating is not as painful as some people mentioned.</li>
            <li> So Iv&#x27;e used an epilator before and it wasn&#x27;t too painful.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything except to stand on my head to ease the pain, but it truly is painful.</li>
            <li> Once I did, it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought, but it was painful.</li>
            <li> So painful and never ending.</li>
            <li> dont remember at the time to finish up after being so frustrated and had to use something to prevent hair bumps.</li>
            <li> I think it probably depends on the person using this product, but for me it is painful and will stick with cream hair remover...</li>
            <li> Alot of people say it&#x27;s just so painful</li>
            <li> Epilating wasn&#x27;t as painful as it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  </li>
            <li> It pulls your hair out by the roots which is by definition painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as painful as I thought It would be, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> It Wasn&#x27;t Too Painful,</li>
            <li> Painful but works well.</li>
            <li> so yes it is painful but not unbearable.</li>
            <li> and it was incredibly painful; I had never waxed there before.</li>
            <li> Ugh, just so disappointed.</li>
            <li> , I had to repeatedly pass it over an area (my arm pit) to remove the hair, unfortunately it was so awful</li>
            <li> It picks up about 30% of the hairs which is very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> it was quite annoying.</li>
            <li> Additionally I hate shaving my bikini line</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my under arms, because I hate to shave them.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and afraid of using stuff like that, take your time using it and you are going to realise that It is not that horrible</li>
            <li> I would hate it if it had no cord.</li>
            <li> There is pulling, yes, but it beats waxing which I hate.</li>
            <li> just how painful it could be!</li>
            <li> People complain it&#x27;s painful, and OF COURSE it is!</li>
            <li> I hated it.  </li>
            <li> It jerks the hair out your face, very painful.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The pain isn&#x27;t horrible, but it does hurt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now, and to be frank, it&#x27;s terribly ineffective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hurts TERRIBLY</li>
            <li> and this is the worst</li>
            <li> ALL TERRIBLE TERRIBLE  </li>
            <li> Crap!</li>
            <li> That was worst than waxing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the products doesn&#x27;t come a charger, so you need to buy AAA batteries</li>
            <li> I recommend investing in a more expensive and better quality epilator. This was a waste of money.. Pretty close to useless. Takes way too long to remove the hair and I have to go over the same spot over and over again to get what little hair this actually gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, waste of money. Don&#x27;t even bother.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> This device gets rid of hairs, but it creates major ingrown hair if used on face. If you buy it take my advice, don&#x27;t put it on your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow and just hurt. Waxing was much better.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t grab hair at all. I am not even sure if it even grabs the longest hair at all. I really thought it might be mediocre, but it didn&#x27;t meet that expectation. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I liked this epilator when it worked but after a couple of months the heads stopped spinning. I have contacted the seller to see if mine was defective but who knows if they will get back to me. PS- Epilating doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad everyone says and is awesome if you have to wear a bathing suit all the time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price. It&#x27;s effective and makes a significant difference in the underarm area if you&#x27;re looking to lighten up that area. It&#x27;s also very useful in the summer and has resulted in the thinning of the epilated hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase in this type of product so I chose this model because of its low price. I figured if the process was something I couldn&#x27;t go through more than once than I&#x27;d better not break the bank. I feel like this does a good job removing hair but I wish it was a little faster. I mostly use it on my underarms and my bikini line and it does well in those areas. I found that when I used it on my legs I grew back a lot of ingrowns so I will just shave them. But, as far as my bikini line goes, I think its great, I don&#x27;t like to shave the area and feel like waxing is just too expensive so this is a good solution. I think maybe in a year I will upgrade to a different model.</li>
            <li> Can you afford regular waxing at the spa up the street?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If yes, you should probably just keep doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re like me and can&#x27;t afford to go to the spa up the street. This product is effective. However, I would recommend also buying a $5 bottle of wine if you have my sort of pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product. It doesn&#x27;t pluck the hair out but breaks it off leaving you with stuble. I have tried going with the hair, against the hair, and in circles but end up with the same results. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for my armpits and bikini line. it works OKAY at best. Even on high speed it kept missing about 30% of the hairs no matter what direction i went in. After spending so much time using it, I was still left with stragglers and had to shave/ tweeze the rest. it was quite annoying. Buy an epilator with interchangeable heads to that you can shave or get closer in others ways too. this took WAYYY too long</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, I used to pluck my underarms so that I could avoid getting a dark spot. But now, instead of taking a very long time to get rid of the hair, I just have to use the Emjoi Hair Remover. Sometimes it won&#x27;t pick up all the hair, but all I have to do is pluck the leftovers, which is no big deal.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m supposedly a good candidate for this, and while I followed directions perfectly, this just didn&#x27;t work for me. It got a few of the hairs on my legs, but left the vast majority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if other brands might work better for me, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m willing to waste money trying to find out.</li>

            <li> It is extremely painful, left many hairs behind &amp; seemed like the motor became weak &amp; stopped working all together after a couple uses. Very dissapointed :(</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from Amazon a month ago and wanted to really give it a fair test run before writing my review. Here&#x27;s how it went:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to start with my legs. I had shaved a few days prior to my epilator arriving so I was all set. Following the advice of other reviewers, I started the epilator on an area with no hair (the top of my foot) and slowly crept up on the leg hair. I&#x27;m not going to lie - it doesn&#x27;t feel good. It&#x27;s ripping hairs out at the root and honestly, that&#x27;s exactly what it feels like. The best thing I can compare the pain to is when your arm hairs get caught in your watch band and get tugged on. The pain isn&#x27;t horrible, but it does hurt. The stinging sensation only lasts a few moments after the hairs are pulled out though and is definitely tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished with one leg (up to the knee) and was halfway done with the second when my epilator started dying, approximately 35 minutes in. A quick swap of the batteries and I was good to go again. I finished my legs, then decided to do my arms. This hurt slightly more than my legs, even with trimming the hairs to an appropriate length beforehand. It was still bearable though and went fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I was feeling pretty brave and decided to tackle my underarms. YIKES! Okay, I got a few hairs in and decided I&#x27;d had enough for the night. I did go back and finish my underarms the next day and although this was by far the most sensitive area, it too was bearable and I made it through. The hair folicles in my underarms appear to produce 4-5 hairs each and I believe this is why the pain was so much more intense. Again though, it wasn&#x27;t unbearable. I found that pulling the skin taut in my underarms helped a lot as it minimized the amount of tugging on my skin while the hairs were being removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few common issues and my personal experience with them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair breakage: This epilator does a great job of pulling the hairs vs. merely breaking them. I did have quite a few arm hairs broken the first time I epilated but I chalk this up to my inexperience more than the fault of the epilator. I&#x27;ve since touched up my arms a few times and used my epilator on the slower speed and it has done a much better job of pulling the hairs from the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red bumps / ingrown hairs: I have pretty sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t take long before the red bumps appeared everywhere I had epilated. The ones on my legs faded fairly quickly but the ones on my arms were still noticeable hours later. I&#x27;ve also had some issues with ingrown hairs on my arms and on my legs. I&#x27;ve found that by dry brushing (a form of exfoliating) before my showers, then following epilating with a good natural lotion pretty much eliminates all of these issues. The red bumps still appear but they quickly disappear after lotioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain: As I explained above, the first time hurts. I&#x27;d actually call it more of a medium discomfort but either way, you&#x27;re going to feel it. I&#x27;ve used my epilator on several occasions since that first time to touch-up areas all over my body (legs, arms, underarms, bikini area, even face) and I can tell you the pain is far less than it was initially as the epilator is merely removing the regrowth which is very sporadic compared to the amount of hair I started with. Pulling the skin taut in areas with more dense hair and/or loose skin helps minimize the pain quite a bit as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emjoi Divine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rounded shape of the head gets in the way once in a while (ie: while doing my arms up by my wrist bones, in certain places around my knees, etc.) but for the most part the contoured shape is not a hindrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself feels pretty sturdy and well made. I&#x27;ve dropped it twice so far and nothing has gotten broken or damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint about this unit is how quickly it drains batteries. Fortunately Emjoi sells adapter cords for this unit so it can be used while plugged into the wall which remedies this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When epilating regrowth the unit doesn&#x27;t catch every single hair with a single pass. I&#x27;ve found that by making small circular motions with the epilator I&#x27;m able to get it to grab just about every hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my purchase. I initially bought this model because of the price, not wanting to invest a large amount into something I had never used before and wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d stick with. I&#x27;m actually very pleasantly surprised by how good of a job this epilator does. For the price I paid I&#x27;m fine with shelling out a few extra bucks to order the adapter cord from the Emjoi site. The versatility of having an epilator that can be used both corded and cordless (many of the rechargeable epilators on the market can&#x27;t be used while plugged in!) is a huge plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t try epilating sooner. I&#x27;ve tossed my razors and am never going back! Epilating may not be for everyone but the only way to know if it&#x27;s for you is to give it a try. I&#x27;m sure glad I did! :)le plugged into the wall which remedies this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When epilating regrowth the unit doesn&#x27;t catch every single hair with a single pass.

            <li> Painful and never got less painful. Felt like my skin was being peeled off. Too late to return is so I guess it will go into the trash.</li>
            <li> Ordered this on the 16th, it stayed in CA for 5 days, then went to another state, and then another, then another. It took a week and a half for delivery. As far as the product, I love it. The only thing that really hurts is the upper lip but I am hoping that if eventually the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back, it is worth the pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now, and to be frank, it&#x27;s terribly ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using it with longer hair growth, short hair growth, barely there hair growth, legs, arms, armpits, belly...it just doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Adequate hair removal device. Slight difficulty with stubborn new stubble growth.. ok purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year but never wrote a review.&lt;br /&gt;I love this device! It removes all my armpit hair in seconds. I haaated how shaving would make hair grow back all stubbly and leave a shadow right after shaving. On top of that, sometimes I&#x27;d forget to shave in the shower so I&#x27;d be screwed once I was already dressed.&lt;br /&gt;You can use this epilator anytime pretty much lol. Just make sure your skin and hair are dry. This does make hair grow back faster in comparison to getting a wax (for me at least). Buuut hair grows back much more... smoothly(?) in comparison to shaving. It does hurt but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. I find that using it right when the hairs are still pretty short is best. Letting hair grow out then using it hurts way more. The epilator can pluck short hairs! Use it the next day or 2 days after, and it can still remove the hairs that are creeping back.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND!&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that the hair that gets pulled stays in the device unless you shake it out and use the little brush that comes with it (meant to help clean the device and get the hair out of it). Hair will still remain in the device but my epilator only stays in my bathroom so it&#x27;s not a huge deal. Plus, it&#x27;s myyy hair so eh. It would have just been nicer and more hygienic to be able to get all the hair out of the device somehow.</li>
            <li> it works great on long hairs but not so hot for shorter ones... who wants hairs in unwanted places to get long and shabby before they can be handled by the product? not me!</li>
            <li> So I was a bit scared to use this at first. (It took me 4 days from firs turning it on to \\&quot;fully commit\\&quot; lol) When you turn it on and see the really fast rotation and hear the motor running it can be intimidating. So I started with a very light tap. Let me say this: to use this you must be fully committed LOL! Once you make up your mind to \\&quot;get close\\&quot; and let this wonderful machine do its job the results are amazing! I will admit that there is a measure of discomfort but it DOES NOT leave you in pain. By the time you switch to the next leg or arm the previous side will feel fine!   I used this on my bikini area and its great! None of that mess from wax, and no stubble from a razor or trimmer. Just SMOOTHNESS. I HIGHLY recommend the Emoji!</li>
            <li> This is battery operated so i just use it on my face. The rest of my body needs the &#x27;plug in&#x27; Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I used the epilator according to the instruction, I also used it considering the tips of one of the reviewers on here, and tried my own methods. It just didn&#x27;t work for me. It did pull about 50% of the hair on my legs out from the root, but the rest was not pulled from the root. I spent a lot of hours trying to get it to work the way it is supposed to, I tried growing the hair to different lengths, it just didn&#x27;t work. The pain was bearable, but I think that&#x27;s because most of the hair wasn&#x27;t being pulled from the root. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it really is awesome. the battery runs out a little quickly but it&#x27;s nothing a few aaa batteries can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I bought this product did not know much about epilator the battery runs down quickly and it stopped working after my second use.</li>
            <li> I *love* this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I just regret not getting it sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it doesn&#x27;t feel good. Your ripping out your hair (hopefully!) by the root. But I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say it&#x27;s painful. My legs, which I had been letting grow out for 2 weeks so I could go get them waxed, took me about half an hour to do, and didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad as I thought it would. And since the waxer lady was going to charge me 60$ to do what my $27 machine did...I can take a little pain. And then reward myself with ice cream :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t quite got the hang of positioning it correctly yet, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to get easier with practice! Tho of course, I&#x27;ll have to wait a month to be able to do it again ^_____^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those of you worried about ingrowns-if you&#x27;ll scrub your legs down with sugar (brown sugar is easier on your skin) before, and after you use this, it helps alot. And if you cut a lemon in half, rub it on your legs (yes, it will burn a little) and let it dry AFTER you..pluck? but BEFORE you scrub your legs with sugar, you cut down on your ingrown chances even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely adore this, and recommend it. You can do it almost anywhere (it&#x27;s loud, but portable) the first time I used it, I was in the school car rider line waiting for my kids (don&#x27;t look at me like that, I had just gotten it in the mail as I was going to get them-and I had shorts on!!)&lt;br /&gt;And it will go thru batteries pretty quickly, so either nab some rechargeable, you only need 3 AAA batteries, or you can just go to the dollar store and get 8 for $1. Your only going to get about 2 hours charge time no matter how much money you spent on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this DOESN&#x27;T come with batteries, so after you buy it, go get some, so you can use it right after it arrives (which mine did in 4 days)</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work at all really</li>
            <li> I ordered this epilator not knowing what i was getting in to. I assumed it would be a rather painful process but I had no idea just how painful it could be! I had to go over the same area quite a few times to get the spot completely hairless and by the time i was done i was welted and bleeding in a few places. That being said, I like having to shave less often, and the hair that grows back is much thinner and easier to remove. Just be warned. My best advice for using this product is to drink a few glasses of wine first and then go to your happy place.</li>
            <li> I used this for two weeks... and it never really made my legs &#x27;smooth&#x27;.  After about 10 days of attempting to get all the hair removed (from my legs) I began having ingrown hairs.  This happened even though I was exfoliating in hopes of preventing experiencing any ingrown hairs... but it didn&#x27;t work.  Overall... I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use a device like this again.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best birthday gift ever.  My husband got this for me because I have been asking for one for a while now.  I picked this one because of the price. Did not want to get a more expensive one and hate it.  As for the pain on a scale of 1-10 and 10 being really painful it was a 1.  Now I am a mother of two girls and I know what real pain is lol and this is not it.  I have never really waxed so I was not quite sure what the felling would be like but it is no big deal at all.  THIS PRODUCT IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail yesterday and used it right away. I don&#x27;t normally give reviews but this product..I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. It works fast and took out the unwanted hairs. The only down fall is the batteries die out quickly. If you wax regular (like me) then epilating would not be painful. Will definitely purchase another epilator from Emjoi.</li>
            <li> It was a great choice, for a my first epilator. So if you&#x27;re a beginner , in my opinion this is the best one for you. But don&#x27;t expect it to last forever. I got about 6 months out of it before it quit. But while it worked it did a pretty good job.&lt;br /&gt;So I recommend it for beginners but not long term, I will be purchasing a more long lasting model though.</li>
            <li> I got this because I read some good review out of this, and this one is battery operated, so I can function it well in Asia, which run in 210-230 voltage, and when I tried this, I barely felt hurt, well it stings a bit but I endure it.  I tried my first epilator which is Braun 3 on the store counter and found out the same result when I tried this one, so I&#x27;m glad I got this with cheaper price.  I noticed some of the hair was pulled from the root but some was just cut in the middle, so I have to run back over again several times for it to grasp the hair that left behind.  Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Hi everyone again   I wrote a review for  this product couple of weeks ago saying that the product was defected and that I would have to contact the seller and exchange my epilator. I exchanged my product and I am so happy now!!! it works great its cheap without having compromised quality. will definitely recommend this product and this seller to anyone</li>
            <li> This hurt.  Badly.  I used it once.  Winced in pain for the rest of the day any time anything brushed against my leg.  Tried it again on my underarms.  Cried and winced until I got one done and said screw the other one.  So, after using this only twice, I tossed it and went back to my razor.  I will deal with having to shave every few days if it means not being in pain.</li>
            <li> I have been been trying to look for a product that will end my everyday battle with razorblades. I went on you tube and saw some good reviews on this product. They sell other items for twice the price and this one was the cheapest. Don&#x27;t let that fool you because......it works! Yes, the pain is very much there, but it is worth it. With shaving I had to face the hassle of shaving every single day. Don&#x27;t even get me started with ingrown hair. With this product I don&#x27;t have to worry about any of that. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and maybe I&#x27;m not using it properly but I was hoping my skin would be smoother after the use. It tends to break my hair sometimes...But for the money I paid, it&#x27;s alright. Does not hurt too bad, batteries usually last for 4-5 use and I get no ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item mainly for using on my underarms, as I was tired of shaving them everyday. A little bit of stinging, but I was surprised that it actually works (this was my first time using an epilator). The hair can&#x27;t be too short, but it gets nearly everything. Sometimes I do have to tweeze a few stubborn hairs, but nothing major. The main problem I have is that its a little difficult to clean with the brush, particularly under the spinning part, but this hasn&#x27;t changed its effectiveness. I would recommend this product, especially because the price is right. More expensive epilators may work better, but I haven&#x27;t tried them yet.   Make sure you have AAA batteries!</li>
            <li> Really hurts as it tugs on the hair. I don&amp;#34;t use it because I can&#x27;t get use to how it feels.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but the batteries dont last long , so, though this is an affordable hair remover unless you use rechargeable batteries you will end up spending a lot each time :(</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator that I ever used and purchased. It&#x27;s awesome!! The only thing I have to complain about it that it takes batteries. My next epilator will be the Emjoi brand but one that is rechargeable or is a plug in. This is a great one to start with if you want to try it out without spending a good chunk of money.</li>
            <li> I had never used epilator before, so this review applies to both this particular model and the epilator in general.&lt;br /&gt;It works much better than I expected. Make no mistake about it, it&#x27;s not painless. It&#x27;s often extremely painful while often little more than tickling sensation, depends on the location and the thickness of the hair. Good thing about it is that most locations which give you the most pain are hidden from the public view, so you can take as much time as you wish. If it&#x27;s not for days, you can take weeks to complete. Visible parts such as arms and legs are relatively painless. If you start there first, then you may feel it painful but if you start in more painful location, you&#x27;ll feel much more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reasons I chose this particular model are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Price.&lt;br /&gt;It was the cheapest. I didn&#x27;t want to jump on top of the line while I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;ll like it and keep using it. It turned out I got more than I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)Battery operated.&lt;br /&gt;Mobility is one thing, it lets me use it anywhere I choose without restriction of the cord length. I also had many set of rechargeable batteries for other uses. It has become my habit to look for \\&quot;battery operated\\&quot; gadgets instead of rechargeable or corded. A set of AAA batteries doesn&#x27;t last for a long time(test result in update at the end) before it needs recharging but you won&#x27;t be using it for that long because of the pain. You&#x27;ll be glad it gives you the time to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Products made by Emjoi in general had good reviews in Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found out after I got the product and had it run through a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Battery change is a bit difficult.&lt;br /&gt;You may want to have a small flat screw driver or something similar handy, otherwise removing them out of the compartment will be hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Cleaning is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Despite its complicated looking mechanism, the hair won&#x27;t get stuck inside because critical parts comeout easily for the cleaning. I thought removing hair from the tweezers would be difficult but just rotating it by finger, some brushing and blowing the air makes it clean as new. You can even wash the tweezers part in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It doesn&#x27;t grab the skin and tear it.&lt;br /&gt;I had some fear before I actually used it for the first time but it didn&#x27;t happen. The edge of the metal tweezers pieces are well rounded, that may explain it. I had used on most delicate skin but was still comfortable. It does pull the skin because when the hair get pulled, the hair pulls the skin just before it comes out and you can see the skin vibrates up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips I found out after some experiment for the people not familiar with using epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)Take your time.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try to make it as a 10 minutes job like shaving. If it hurts, give it a rest. Do small part at a time. First time is the hardest and takes the longest. Once you get the job done, keeping it is much easier. You may see some redness and small bumps afterward where the hair came out, but in a day or two, the skin will become baby smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Move the epilator head in the right direction.&lt;br /&gt;If you see the switch of the epilator, you move it toward you. If you don&#x27;t, you move it away from you. That way, the hair gets pulled upward instead of pulled down and side way. You can feel it less pain and the tweezers grab the hair more easily. Don&#x27;t push the head downward, it won&#x27;t make the tweezers grab more hair but the direction and the angle of it will. Just glide the head over the skin nice and slow until you feel the first sign of it grabbing the hair. When you feel the first pain, pull it back then take a deep breath. Try again the same thing, then again and again, you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update*&lt;br /&gt;Photos have been posted.&lt;br /&gt;Continuous run time(in high setting) on full charged Eneloop(2000mah) is 2 hours 7 minutes. It&#x27;s a lot longer than I thought. Runningit switch on-off frequently seems to use a lot of juice out of the batteries. In real use by on-off frequently, it probably goes only half as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update*(7-24-11)&lt;br /&gt;It has become most frequently used gadget of mine. After some experiment, I found that adding sideway movement such as in small circular or zigzag motion to forward motion helps picking up more hair. This maybe different from person to person depends on what type of hair you have. I found some hair grow flat to the skin and that&#x27;s hard for the tweezers to catch. Most of the time the tweezers catch the hair I can&#x27;t even see. It shouldn&#x27;t take hours like some reviewers say. It&#x27;s more like matter of minutes if you use it regularly. If you use it regularly, most painful part will become nearly painless.</li>
            <li> This item received good reviews after spending about 30 minutes researching a great epilator for a decent price.  Most of the reviews were great so I figured why not give it a whirl.  I was so excited once I received it but held off on using it for a couple of days.  After taking a shower and exfoliating accordingly I used the product on my underarms.  I&#x27;m used to waxing and tweezing so the product did not tug or pull the skin at all.  I had to roll the product over my underarms gently several times to remove the hair but it kept missing some.  The hairs were not fine nor stubby so I have no idea why it missed them. In the end I ended up tweezing the hairs it missed.  You get what you pay for.  Btw, it drains batteries pretty fast.</li>
            <li> at first I was doubtful about buying it, but now that I have it has changed my life forever! highly recomended article and it got here really fast!</li>
            <li> This little device doesn&#x27;t is a savior. I&#x27;m Hispanic and have some pretty unsightly hair under my chin that this takes care of for me. I have to run it over the same area a few times to get every hair, and it is pretty painful at first but definitely eases with use. I can only bring myself to use it on the area from my chin to my neck-- basically my upper lip is just too sensitive and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if that happens to be your problem area. It does cause a bit of irritation and will leave the skin kind of red and it takes an hour or two for the skin to calm down. Considering this, don&#x27;t use it if you have immediate plans after unless you want to explain why your beard area is all red.</li>
            <li> Works great....only gave 4 stars because it is painful to use (feels like the hairs are being ripped out...which they are!)</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewer I&#x27;ve never had an epilator before and I didn&#x27;t want to spend tons of money on something if it was possible I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it. As it is I just used this on my legs a bit and it works very well. Since this is my first I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else but I can say I&#x27;m glad I got this. The pain was not what I expected, it&#x27;s more a hot feeling than a plucked feeling. Already I&#x27;m getting used to it. The sound is the same as an electric razor so not too bad but it&#x27;s not silent either and I think the sound is the scariest part about it. Well, that and looking at the tweezer disks spinning. Other than that it&#x27;s cute, girly, and cheap so I have no regrets about this impulse purchase.</li>
            <li> THIS EPILATOR WORKS FANTASTIC!! AFTER PURCHASING THE NONO I DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO TRUST A HAIR REMOVAL SYSTEM AGAIN!  EASY TO USE WORKS GREAT!! THANK YOU</li>
            <li> PAIN. I tried this on my underarms and stopped when I saw blood. I tried it on my legs and nothing happened. I&#x27;ve been afraid to try waxing but would rather give it a try than to use this again.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I bought this epilator because it was the cheapest and had decent reviews.  I&#x27;ve never had one before so I can&#x27;t really compare to others, but so far I&#x27;m really liking it.  The only cons:     1) It can go through batteries like nobody&#x27;s business.  This is probably just the nature of epilators, but I think I&#x27;d go with a rechargeable one next time.  I&#x27;ve had it about 2-3 weeks and use it every few days for touch-ups, and I&#x27;m on the 3rd set of batteries.    2) For the most part it gets all the hair, but I find myself having to go over spots a few times and trying a few different directions before it really gets everything.  When it does, the results are great, but I have to wonder if there are others out there that would get more hair on the first pass.      Overall I really like the epilator.  I got it mainly to avoid the endless irritation from shaving, and it has done just that.  But when it dies or I get tired of how slow it is, I&#x27;ll upgrade to a pricier one and hope for slightly better results.</li>
            <li> This thing is so freaking painful, lol. It removes the hair for a long time but it took me an hour to do a piece of one leg. I couldn&#x27;t stomach doing the rest.</li>
            <li> There is Not a power cord option. So the batter power become very weak  I would much prefer this hair remover if there was a power cord</li>
            <li> its not that bad. it does what its supposed to. i have very thick hair so it takes a bit more effort to remove the hair but deff worth it.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I needed :)</li>
            <li> My first epilator. Extremely painful the first go around, after the first time I barely felt it. Really short battery life, my future purchase of an epilator will definitely be corded. Works better than waxing, although it leaves a few hairs they&#x27;re not nearly to the same amount as waxing. If you shave after epilating with this your legs will be silky for around 5 days - the little hairs it leaves behind are extrememly fine and slow growing so shaving gives you completely smooth for a few days, at least in my experience.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, and I had my doubts about it, but it has worked out really well for the past couple of months. I&#x27;ve been impressed! It&#x27;s portable, easy to handle, &amp; powerful enough for all the jobs I need it for. You do need to go over the area a few times if there&#x27;s tough hair to pull up, but my friend who has the expensive Braun&#x27;s epilator said that she has to do the same with hers. So, it&#x27;s really not an issue. Love it!</li>
            <li> I only use this product on my armpits so that is what this review will be centered around.    So, I was a bit wary about this thing because the thought of multiple little tweezers plucking out armpit hair sounded terrifying but my armpits are very sensitive and the many other methods of removing hair either didn&#x27;t work, were too expensive or weren&#x27;t worth the work.      The first use was the most painful but don&#x27;t get scared off, it was worth it.  I have done this about six times and it really does get less painful every time.  I barely feel anything unpleasant now.  Try going with the hair first and then if it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs you want the first few times, try a different direction.  My hair does not grow all the same direction so it is required.  The first day you may had a bit tender skin but nothing bad and the next day it will be lovely.  Give your armpits time to adjust and the end results are lovely and healthy.  Takes less time every time too.  (Not everyone is built the same way but this was MY experience)    Battery life seems good.    I am not too easy on my stuff (poor storage, dropping stuff often and etc) and it has held up nicely.    Easy to clean.  I did not even have to read the directions.    A couple speeds to choose from.    Easy to hold when using,    I am overall happy with it for my desired use.  (Plus only $23 was nice)</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator so I have nothing to compare it to, but I can say that it works very well, my armpits are baby smooth. I don&#x27;t find any need for the massaging finger thing, but for aesthetic purposes, I&#x27;m leaving it on.</li>
            <li> Said it could be used plugged in or with battery. Did not come with plug. Used old plug but works better with AAA battery. Would have liked it to work plugged in better. Quick delivery. Have been using an emjoy for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator 3 months ago, and it worked well for the first week. After a week, the motor started slowing down. Now, even after the battery was replaced, it doesn&#x27;t work for more than 5 seconds. I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s broken, but I would say it&#x27;s not equipped for lengthy use on legs etc.</li>
            <li> The instructions say \\&quot;virtually painless\\&quot; well that is comical. It does hurt. Dont kid yourself. But so far, it pulled up about 60 percent of the hair on whatever surface you are pulling from. Some spots, no matter how many times I go over, wont be silky totally hairless/smooth, not sure why. I would recomend rechargable batteries for this, as it uses 3 AAAs and that will be expensive very quickly. I did have some \\&quot;razor burn/redness\\&quot; immediately after and skin felt alittle raw, but after applying after-epilation cream, it was totally taken care of. I initially purchased this model due to the price - wanted to see what I was getting into, before dropping 70 dollars. Im not sure the curved style in the best, and may try my next model a \\&quot;straight\\&quot; head model. so far so good. But definatly not painless.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and I have use it only on my underarms so far. Since I was already plucking the hair in that spot, it really didn&#x27;t hurt at all. Maybe I was already used to the pain. But seriously this doesn&#x27;t hurt. Definitely buy this for the first timers and don&#x27;t get yourself work up over the pain.</li>
            <li> First here&#x27;s a heads up. This delivery requires your signature, they don&#x27;t just drop it off. So be home the day of the estimated delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came in a cute box like you bought it from Wal-Mart. Take a warm bath first to loosen up the pores. I prepared myself for the worst possible pain, but it honestly wasn&#x27;t horrible. The IMPORTANT tip is to use your free hand to hold down the skin you&#x27;re about to do. Before I could say \\&quot;ouch!\\&quot; the hair is gone from that area. So if you just glide it over your skin, the last hair you pulled overrides the pain of the previous plucked hairs. After awhile you seriously become used to the feel until you move to a more coarse area, then you slow down and become used to the area again.&lt;br /&gt;True, it left stubble after 1-2 glides, but HAKUNA MATATA!! Just grip the emjoi and use it as if your coloring a book, but color your skin over that area. It&#x27;ll pick up any removing hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the more expensive emjois do anything this one doesn&#x27;t. Besides, who wants a big bulky thing? This one gives you full control.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend trimming areas with LONG coarse hair. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I was expending a lot of money going to a place that they took my face hairs with string, Now I don&#x27;t have to go and I do it at home as often as I needed or wanted. It is like they describe on the web page.</li>
            <li> It works&amp; it&#x27;s painful</li>
            <li> **Update**&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it almost a month now and I&#x27;m so happy I bought it.  I think I will eventually get a more expensive model though I have recommended this to my mother and friends because it really does a great job. The pain on my legs made me not want to try it again but I did it and after the first time it doesn&#x27;t really hurt at all. I might have been more surprised because I&#x27;ve never waxed before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m leaving it at 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of getting thick hair. I wanted to be able to do my bikini line and it just brought tears to my eyes cause it would grab and pull but not remove the hair. Definitely great for legs and arms though and I&#x27;ve not noticed too many hairs left behind! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;*Original Review*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about this product at first but I saw a few YouTube videos and decided to buy it. So there are some definite things you should know but I&#x27;ll sum it up for those of you who don&#x27;t want to read further: It hurts like heck but it works! I definitely recommend [[ASIN:B003II4D2C Emjoi Divine Hair Remover, White/Pink]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off I&#x27;m a white female with darker hair but medium hair on my arms and everywhere else. I&#x27;m very pale so you can see the hair and I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to get rid of for some time. Additionally I hate shaving my bikini line so I was hoping this would be the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product arrived (in perfect condition by the way), I had to run and get some AAA batteries and by then I was so excited to use it I skipped the part where I should have let my legs and stuff soak in warm water before use. So off I went turning this thing on and it was buzzing away. I kinda held it just above the hair at first cause I was scared but that hurts more so if you are like me just suck it up and stick it on your arm - but be prepared for pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it hurts a LOT! I used it on my arms first and did both arms within like 10 minutes. Took me a little longer cause I wasn&#x27;t used to it. Next I decided to try my legs and holy crap thats a shock! Your legs are so much more sensitive than your arms that I really highly recommend you shower before hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after doing just the calves on each of my legs I wanted to see how it would work against really coarse hair. I had some stubble around my bikini line but it wasn&#x27;t near as long as my leg or arm hair (Yes I didn&#x27;t shave in preparation for this!). This is where the epilator doesn&#x27;t do the best job. I think the hair was too short and too coarse - if it had been longer I&#x27;m sure it would have worked better but I&#x27;ll have to update later when I find out. I&#x27;m not too keen on letting any hair anywhere get longer than the stubble was around my bikini line just because it makes me so itchy but I&#x27;ll try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is only the first day of using it but so far it seems great. I will definitely exfoliate often to avoid ingrown hairs and I&#x27;ll try the arm pits and bikini line later after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Works great and left very very few hairs - my arms and my calves are so silky smooth atm!&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap! So much more affordable than I would have thought. I wanted to buy one that was around $60 but I&#x27;m glad I got this one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Painful as all get out - shower first and maybe have a shot or two!&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t seem to work too well on very coarse hair - will test out more later!</li>
            <li> I had purchased the silk epil last time.  I figured I would try a different brand this time to do some comparing.  This product is louder.  The little tweezer blades seem to move slower that the ones in the silk epil, thus not as fast at removing unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has a plug at the bottom for what I assume would be a charger, but no charger came with the device.  It does take batteries, though, 3 AA batteries..</li>
            <li> So far so good. I love this product. Only used once but results turned out pretty good. Its not as bad as what othera says. It plucked out the hair pretty good and it doesnt hurt (me atleast). No more waxing! Hoo ray!!</li>
            <li> I love this, except it doesn&#x27;t come with a plug, and tells you to use as a batteries !  It doesn&#x27;t even say that you CAN use a plug... I bought batteries at first and it went through 3 triple A&#x27;s in literally 10 minutes...and those are expensive !  But it has a hole for a plug, so I hooked it up to the plug that came with my husband&#x27;s hair clippers it works Great !  No loss of power, like after a few minutes of the batteries... it works Great !  I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong, it hurts like a B but so worth it... fyi don&#x27;t do it on your arms ! !  It hurts TERRIBLY (even worse than my lady parts) and left me with ingrown hair ish whiteheads and straight up arm zits for weeks !  But for legs and bikini it&#x27;s great !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator and had no idea what to expect.  I bought this because it had good reviews and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  I have to say that I am wondering why I&#x27;ve never used one of these before!  Wow!  I bought it primarily for my bikini line area.  I was tired of shaving all the time, ingrown hairs, and red bumps everywhere.  After my first try, I looked like a plucked chicken with red, raised bumps!  But they went away within a few hours and left smooooth skin!  It hurts a bit, but not crazy bad.  More like a bite or pinch.  Very worth it!  I will always use this and I&#x27;m anxious to see how long until I have to use it again.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, try it!</li>
            <li> Seriously, it does not hurt that much, I might have a higher pain tolerance but I don&#x27;t think so.  My daughter could not handle it, but she is not into the beauty is worth the pain and effort mindset. I lay there and watched a movie while epillating my bikini area, under arms, legs and even my mustache.  The mustache hurt the most, not so bad if I tighten my lip by pulling it down over my teeth.  Works really well, just have to be patient and take the time to do the job.  If you are in a hurry, shave.  It is a doable weekly lounge on the bed, with a blanket to catch the hairs, watching a movie type of activity.&lt;br /&gt;8/22/12 Update.  Love this little guy, love the process of the hair growing in thinner, softer, and at different intervals.  Love that my arm pit hair is no longer lethal stabbing sharp, but softer and seriously I seem to have less BO, need to not use deodorant twice a day either.  Can&#x27;t figure that one out, but I will take it.  Read a review that one person wrote that suggested shaving after epillating to catch the hairs that I miss.  Like that too.  I use sugar scrub with coconut oil each time I shower and that helps with the ingrown hairs and keeps my skin softer than I have ever had, (read that tip in a review here too).  Lots of good advise from lots of ladies, thanks.  I am so liking this little guy that I have worn him out, he doesn&#x27;t work as good as he did, so I am retiring it and going on to the 72 tweezer machine. I could purchase another one for the price, I think I&#x27;ll go with the bigger one to save the time spent each couple of weeks, cuz it does take a while, and I am all about forgetting to do it now that it is so soft and sometimes I need to get it done faster, so I am diving in and am not even worried about the bigger investment.  51 years old and have discovered epillating and am glad I did.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I had a similar emjoi device for years.  I dropped it so many times that I thought it was indistructable.  Alas, after one drop too (way too) many it started buzzing funny and I ordered emjoy DIVINE.  So far I dropped it only three or four times - no affect on productivity.  The DIVINE is even better that the previous battery opereated model, if at all possible.  I only use it for underarms and well... to achieve the brazilian wax effect.  DIVINE it is, as in DIVINE results.  For arms and legs I would recommend the straight head, not the curved head, model since the skin is rougher, tougher and thicker and won&#x27;t get pinched.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says!  Trim the hair down and then go over it with the hair remover to ease the pain.  I&#x27;m sure it has the same pain amount as waxing but at least you can do it at your own pace in your home.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> First off I am a latina and I have thick dark hair which can be hard to get rid of. I love love love this thing. I have this product(the emjoi divine) and the tweeze(also by emjoi). They both work very well. I use the divine on my legs, stomach, and underarms. It does seem to hurt more if you are hormonal but on a regular day it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve read other reviews and some complain that it hurts but it IS pulling hair out from the root so some discomfort is expected. It gets most of the hairs, only leaves very few. I don&#x27;t have to shave as often and my skin is smooth. Worth the price.  Oh some advice if you do get it.  1. read the directions  2. have 3 AAA batteries on hand  3. clean it often  4. it seems to help if you shower first  5. exfoliate often to prevent ingrown hairs  Hope my review helps.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to have the power I needed.  It started to run out of &#x27;gas&#x27; before I was finished.  This is a battery operated device.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my under arms, because I hate to shave them. This was a miracle compared to waxing/plucking. Seriously, when I wax, it takes me about 10 minutes per arm pit, and I am left with stray hairs that need to be plucked afterward/later--this thing took care of both under arms right in about 10 minutes, and I had absolutely no issues with having to go back to re-pluck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about how painful it would be to use this, but it really isn&#x27;t too bad (probably because I&#x27;ve waxed/plucked before). The pain is slightly surprising in the beginning, but just take it slow and take your time, and it&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has not become irritated by it at all. There is slight chaffing, but hardly noticeable. The only thing is that cleaning this is slightly difficult to get all the hairs out, other than that, this product is awesome. It really works and it&#x27;s affordable! How great is that?</li>
            <li> It works. Except you have to go over the same spot a zillion times...and it HURTS I thought I would be able to tolerate the pain since tweezing has never hurt me...but it hurt a lot. My skin tends to be pretty sensitive and the places where the hairs got pulled out there were red dots left behind that stayed for about a day. It is alright but too painful and tedious for me. It sits in the back of my vanity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for underarms, but if you think you&#x27;ll be able to use it on your legs without getting ingrown hairs, think again. Also, don&#x27;t try to use it on your bikini area unless you&#x27;re cool with experiencing the pain of a Brazilian wax x10. Ideally, you should really only use this on your underarms. It keeps my pits smooth all the time, no discoloration or ingrown hairs, and the pain isn&#x27;t so bad in that area. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Well i received my product a couples days before estimated SO that was GOOD... HOWEVER...the product itself isnt really workin out for me. It still leaves bristles on my leg..as if its just breakin the hair instead of pulling it from the root. I will continue to use it since i did pay for it 8)</li>
            <li> This is a great epilator for starters to see if you like it or not. I suggest using brand new batteries because if you don&#x27;t, the tweezers will spin slower than the actual speed and make epilating a longer process. I use it mostly for my armpits and it makes them super smooth. If you have thicker or coarser body hair then this will make the epilated region sore, but after a while it will become easier to epilate.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this epilator is not as powerful as I had hoped. It barely grabs any hair that is coarser than arm hair. It leaves behind patches on my legs and does not work on underarms which is what I originally purchased  this item for.</li>
            <li> The item shipped fast and was exactly as described; I just don&#x27;t think the product itself is very good. It barely shaves the hair and has trouble &amp;#34;grabbing&amp;#34; the hairs to pull out. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you want good results.</li>
            <li> wished i had bought one years sooner. not going to lie, this is NOT a pain-free hair removal option! But is IS effective, the battery life is not great abnd the process is also very time consuming. Overall great product</li>
            <li> As a former razor girl I was looking for ways to lighten my dark pits. After a quick youtube search one user suggested trying an Epilator for hair removal. So off to Amazon I went to purchase my Emjoi. First use was painful but my results were great. Dark pits are lightening up.  Im reformed, no more razors!</li>
            <li> i have used it twice or thrice and I would say it is painful the first time you use it. it&#x27;s good in removing hair with the roots. Hair grows much slower.</li>
            <li> It hurts, but NO PAIN NO GAIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my batteries lasted much longer than I expected them too especially since I heard cheaper epilators ate batteries like a fat boy and cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, easier to use, and makes your hair grow back much thinner/slower. No longer do I have a forest of under arm hair with the strength of a sumo wrestler.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to get them out good enough</li>
            <li> Great for the little soft peach fuzz sort of facial hairs, but those pesky chin hairs are left standing straight!  And at one point, this epilator actually grabbed some of my face skin, pinched hard, jammed and stopped.  My first experience with a device like this and will be my last.  It does &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; a bit when you use it, but I don&#x27;t have a lot of face hair and find that part tolerable. However, I cannot imagine using it under my arms.</li>
            <li> It works great for me, I use it on my underarm area. The first few times it is painful, but as you use it more, it starts to not hurt. Keeps hair away for a long time-opposed to shaving. It&#x27;s not something you can use by itself most of the time because if hairs are too short, you will have to tweeze or shave them. But since it is basically the same process as waxing, you can expect some ingrown hairs. Easy to clean and easy to use. One of the problems though, is that since it is battery powered, as you go along, it will slow down. So at first it will tweeze quickly but when the batteries are old, it loses strength. Way better than shaving though, no prickly armpits anymore!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now and am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to wait for a bit before posting, because I knew the first time would be awful (from reading reviews and comments) and I wanted to get the courage to finally epilate my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;My take-away on epilator a is that they are perfect for busy people who just don&#x27;t want to shave everyday! I haven&#x27;t worried about my armpit hair in a week! I have 4 kids and a full time job, my body hair needs to be a thing I can maintain on my time, which this epilator has made possible.&lt;br /&gt;Important: get dollar store batteries! I&#x27;ve gone through 4 dollars worth of batteries for 2 months of crazy epilating. I will probably buy the cord eventually.&lt;br /&gt;- Holy moly, prepare yourself before going in the first time. I wouldn&#x27;t let there be any more than a week of razor stubble, or it will hurt worse.&lt;br /&gt;- Take it easy and slow. I did my lower leg first on one day, then the next day I did my thighs, then I did my arms, then tried out my face, and finally got up the courage to do my armpits. The first day was the worst because I just wasn&#x27;t used to it yet!&lt;br /&gt;- give your body a couple of hours before you have to go out to get back to normal. For the first couple hours, you&#x27;ll have little red marks that kind of look like a rash. If you&#x27;ve waxed before you know this!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy that having a socially acceptable amount of body hair is no longer something thy I have to stress about when getting dressed. One less thing has made a huge improvement!</li>
            <li> I like the ease of use, but it does not remove all the hair. I expected my legs to be smooth and stay smooth for at least a few days--does not happen.  My legs will have stubbles the very next day. Sometimes I think the unit is breaking the hairs off instead of pulling them out.  I was a former PE teacher and shaved daily for 25 years. I like the smooth feel, but do not get it with this product.  I did not feel pain at all using this product--another reason I believe the product is breaking the hairs off instead of pulling them out.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister because she had been asking for an epilator. I, myself have used it several times and it is amazing. Works well and my sister&#x27;s been using for the past two years so it&#x27;s durable as well. Just went ahead and bought myself my own. Well worth it! And best part of it is that it&#x27;s cheap as well!</li>
            <li> Not as I expected. thanks</li>
            <li> So, I finally decided to purchase an epilator after yearning for one for a couple of months now. And I have to say it&#x27;s well worth your money. It may not be the best as high priced epilators, but let me tell you when buying one you will not be disappointed! I think it works wonders so what are you waiting for?</li>
            <li> Emjoi, is very good...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to shave every day. It&#x27;s summer and I would have to shave my armpits every day. It is going on two weeks and I am still hair free.&lt;br /&gt;Whoot! Whoot!</li>
            <li> Works as well as my more expensive facial hair remover....</li>
            <li> First time every purchasing an epilator for my missus. She was skeptical about using one. However after using it she felt this has to be one of the best items she ever used. It removes hair instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilating is not as painful as some people mentioned. Its mobile as it can be used with just batteries, how convienient. DO ensure that hair length is slightly half an inch maximum before using the epilator. If the hair is too long the user will feel discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENED to both mail and female.</li>
            <li> not very happy with it because it just gets the hairs that are longer not really the short short ones. wouln&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> Works fine for a few weeks but i went through so many batteries and it still didn&#x27;t pick up hairs correctly. Wish I had saved the money and invested in razors instead !</li>
            <li> I loved that it was light and portable, and pink! However using it was totally different. The slightest bit of pressure I would place on it to try and grab a hair would slow it down. One of my girlfriends has an epilator with 74 tweezer heads and worked so much better! Downside of that is you&#x27;ll have to spend about $80! So, moral of the story? You will get what you pay for and it&#x27;s no $80 epilator!</li>
            <li> So Iv&#x27;e used an epilator before and it wasn&#x27;t too painful.  But THIS one I could not tolerate.  The quality was no where near what I was expecting and try as I might I couldn&#x27;t force myself to use it, twas way too painful (usually that kind of pain doesn&#x27;t bother me but this time it did.)  They also said they&#x27;d give me a refund but they only gave back 50% of what I paid for it... Not happy.</li>
            <li> Not as described i wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this product. It is very painful when it removes the hair and the tweezers are very rough. Will not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> this was my first time using an epilator, which i bought because i hate shaving. my first use hurt really bad, since my leg hairs were pretty long, but additional uses barely hurt because my hairs were shorter. using this epilator took a really long time and did not get all of my hairs, so i had to go over the same area multiple times. this epilator also uses 3 batteries, which died after my third use. i feel like a better quality/more expensive epilator would do a better job, but i bought the cheapest one i found just to try it out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this product online but rather at the nearby store.  I wish I would have gone online after I saw the price difference.  As my first epilator I was a little unsure whether or not it would be worth the money since I have tried many none shaving approaches.  This one works very well, but is painful (don&#x27;t plan on getting one unless you can handle your hair getting pulled out from the root).  I have very thick hair that won&#x27;t stay smooth via shaving for more than a couple of hours.  I use it on all the hair parts that I wish just stopped growing hair and it works well for all areas!  I can do this once a week while watching a tv show (or three to get all the hair) and then shave the next morning and have silky smooth legs for a little under a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When looking for an epilator here is some advice:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Look for one with the maximum number of tweezers possible to make the process take less time by getting more hair at one pass.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Try to get one that is rechargeable (this one is not) because it is amazing how nice it is to sit in a comfortable chair and watch a show while doing this and the cord doesn&#x27;t let you get as far as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Make sure you also get something to exfoliate the dead/dry skin so that way your legs get smoother and DEFINITELY use lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all this was a great investment and years from now when this one poops out I will definitely be replacing it.</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES it , which who I bought it for. She says it doesnt really sting much compared to prior reviews. When she was done she used Aloe Vera Gel that we keep in the refrigerator over her legs which removed any sting remaining and moisturized her skin. Its been 3 weeks since she used it and barely a hair has come back.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT BUY FOR SOMEONE WHO DOESNT WANNA GO GET THEMSELVES WAXED ALL THE TIME BUT SHAVING GIVES THEM BUMPS OR COARSE FINISH&lt;br /&gt;IT HAS HELPED SAVE TONS OF TIME AND MONEY ON WAXING.NEVER CUT ME OR GAVE ME BUMOS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT&lt;br /&gt;IT HURTS AND USES BATTERIES BUT YOU KNOW WHAT GET OVER IT!!</li>
            <li> what a run for your money. this doesnt even work. first time trying to use it,, doesnt even turn on. look somewhere else to a working one</li>
            <li> It jerks the hair out your face, very painful.</li>
            <li> Works great for armpit and top of bikini line for me. I suggest often cleaning during use for best results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through back surgeries and two unmedicated childbirths, but this thing hurts like a son of a gun! I have tried everything except to stand on my head to ease the pain, but it truly is painful. I don&#x27;t get the women who say it isn&#x27;t. They must know something I haven&#x27;t figured out. Tweezing the old fashioned way hurts less, in my opinion. Good luck if you want to try, but I&#x27;m still searching for a satisfactory at-home method.</li>
            <li> A little too strong a blade, I got it for my elderly mother who has used a smaller one for years and this one is just too much, probably for someone with tighter skin it would work nicely for</li>
            <li> Hurts a lot to use this. Have tried few different times to &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; using this. Hurts extraordinarily! It caused big welt like bumps on every pulled out hair strand on my legs. It missed SO many hairs. Very time consuming. Would be much faster to just shave. Was hopeful this would work. In retrospect i wish I had returned this!</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail a week ago and I&#x27;ve already had to change the batteries twice!! It does work and get rid of the hair, I&#x27;ll give it that. But so far I&#x27;ve only been able to use it on my arms because the pain is so bad I have not had the courage to use it on my legs, also because I ran out of batteries. I suggest you either buy a lifetime supply of AAA batteries or rechargeable ones. There is also the option of getting a chord, which is good too. Depends if you want it to be portable. I am very happy that it works. It does get rid of the hair, you can see the hair being plucked right out, but the pain is the downside. I would say that it looks scarier than it is. It took me about a day to actually use it because I was afraid of the spinning tweezers lol. Once I did, it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought, but it was painful. I&#x27;m thinking about getting a numbing cream just so I can use it more. I am afraid of ingrown hair that might appear. From the reviews I&#x27;ve read, they seem very common. I suggest you take a hot shower and exfoliate before using it. So if you&#x27;re wondering if this thing works, well it does! Downsides are the life of the batteries (which I are not included!!) and the pain. Other than that I think it&#x27;s a great alternative for hair removal. Also research the product before you buy it!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, does an awesome job removing hair. It does sound kinda like an electric razor. I would buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> I quite like this. Keep in mind that it WILL hurt. It is not like shaving. Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> It works well and does its job. Sometimes you&#x27;d have to go over the spot a few more times but in the end it does it what its supposed to do. Some say that it hurts but I feel that is very painless to use, uses a lot of battery though so invest in some rechargeable ones.</li>
            <li> This is a good epilator and simple one to use. Run on batteries and can epilator anywhere and travel. I own three different sizes and useful for different purpose. Got a slim one for face and tight spot. This one for larger area.</li>
            <li> Buy the battery operated is not strong power wise. I have the cord one and I love it. I just bought this battery for traveling abroad. I don&#x27;t need to worry about the vault 110 &amp; 220.</li>
            <li> I used this for 4 months on my armpits and legs. It takes about a week before it really starts working (assuming you were shaving before this), because the hair has to grow out enough. I noticed it reduced my hair growth and made my hair finer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT NOTE, the HUGE DOWNSIDE: this thing takes forever, it&#x27;s painful for the first month or so, and the batteries die very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Good, cheap starter. It will hurt, it will take forever, the batteries used will be many. My next one will be bigger and have a plug, which will help immensely. It does work though.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this for me after my Remington Gold bit the dust; at first I hated it, it just didn&#x27;t have any power even after I changed the batteries and wouldn&#x27;t pull out the hair (I have been using epilators since 1990 so I do know how to use them). But then I had an AH HA  moment and used my ac adapter from the reminton to see if that was the problem (gosh didn&#x27;t even know if it would fit. Viola I love this thing, much more power and pulls the hair out in much less time then the Remington even did (more tweezers). I can not shave my legs related to severe back pain with spasms and this does the trick. Problem is now I need to find a new adapter, the other one has bit the dust and the Divine is once again not so divine.&lt;br /&gt;So for everyone that thought it didn&#x27;t work, try an adapter on it, makes a huge difference. Oh yes I have had this epilator for 4 maybe 5 years and it is still working, my last epilator lasted 11 years.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful :) worth every penny! I was sort of skeptical if it was going to really take away most of my body hair and it did ! I recommend for others to purchase this epilator and it&#x27;s a good price for it as well :)</li>
            <li> I was super excited to recieve this item. The first day i got it i wanted to use it. I whipped out my 3 AAA batteries and popped those suckers in there. To my surprise the damn thing didn&#x27;t turn on. I thought it was the batteries so i swiched them out. Still did not turn on. I was so disappointed! I read so many great reviews, it was affordable! I&#x27;ve emailed the company to tell them that i want a full refund. Hopefully, i won&#x27;t have any troubles there. Ugh, just so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this product because it would not turn on (I&#x27;ve tried several new batteries to make sure the batteries I was using wasn&#x27;t a problem).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with thick hair and wanted to try something besides waxing and shaving. I was ecstatic when I received my package and rushed to get batteries. However it was a huge let down. After going over and over and over my skin with this Emjoi Divine I had to come to grips that it wasn&#x27;t working.  I went in different directions as well as using both speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to experience what I read with the great reviews but this Emjoi Divine Hair Remover, White/Pink just couldn&#x27;t cut it. I don&#x27;t doubt that this works for some but it was not made to stand up to my texture (underarm, legs, bikini.)</li>
            <li> The good thing about this product is that it actually pulls out the hair instead of just cutting it off although if your trying this for the first time it will be a bit painful especially if your hair on legs are long, and less painful if their short.</li>
            <li> This epilator has been fine, I suggest getting some rechargeable batteries if you use it much. It works great for the money, though there are nicer ones out there they cost way more for only a moderate improvement.</li>
            <li> Is this the best product out there? probably not but  it does get the job done. it takes a little longer than your more expensive products to remove all your hair but it does remove hair. on if it hurts or  not i think depends on your pain tolerance. It takes a few weeks for my hair to grow back.</li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied with this product as it was not as I expected to be(look at its description). It sucks..!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as my previous Emojoi I had. Used that one for a lot of years.  Perhaps this has less blades.</li>
            <li> do not buy id rather shave instead!!! the pain is unbearable!!! ugh!! pleASE DO NOT BUY!!! save your 30 bucks on waxing instead!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  A little ouchy, but all of them are.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It&#x27;s reasonable price. It doesn&#x27;t really hurt as bad as I thought. For the price, great product.</li>
            <li> So painful and never ending. Go with a home laser like Silk n flash instead for permanent, non-painful results.</li>
            <li> what would I do without this little device???  It makes my life so much easier. I am 36 yo and have waxed ever since I was 17, but waxing is way too expensive.  However this little machine does the job. I don&#x27;t feel pain at all, It works fast and, the best, It is cordless.  I have owned others with cord, they were good, but a pain in the butt. This is just right for me. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> It seems to work just fine, but it takes a LONG time.  I worked on one leg for about 2 hrs a day for 2 days and the leg still felt hairy.</li>
            <li> it delivers more pain than results.  It picks up about 30% of the hairs which is very disappointing.  I could tolerate the pain if I got good results, but these results are far from good.</li>
            <li> SAY GOODBYE TO SHAVE GEL, SAY GOODBYE TO RAZORS, SAY GOODBYE TO RUDE BEAUTY SALON STAFF, SAY GOODBYE TO RAZOR BUMPS, SAY SEE YOU LATER OR GOODBYE TO INGROWN HAIRS, SAY SEE YOU LATER TO YOUR UNWANTED HAIR! :D♥&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my Emjoi! I cannot stop raving about it! This Emjoi is very travel friendly. It is such a great investment (including rechargeable batteries). I have saved so much money with my Emjoi; I love the fact that I can use this in the privacy of my home instead of getting waxed at a beauty salon. I love how smooth my skin feels after epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I felt like I was not going to be able to finish the process. I was not used to the plucking sensation it was very weird. It took a really long time to epilate both of my legs because I kept taking time off to breathe hahaha. By the time that I did my 2nd leg I was getting used to the \\&quot;pain\\&quot;. (I would advise first time users to shave the area first because it hurts when the hairs are longer. This will be more \\&quot;painful\\&quot; in areas with thicker hair as well.) It usually takes a week for my hair to grow back in, however everyone is different. I obviously don&#x27;t get razor bumps anymore which is a big plus. I seldom get ingrown hairs, but that is the result of not exfoliating. I prefer epilating once a week over shaving every other day and having a stubble show up that same day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;The product does what it says it is made for I love it :D</li>
            <li> This is my first time writing a review on amazon so you know its crucial&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this epilator excited to use&lt;br /&gt;I got it and the noise it makes is probably one of the scariest parts, once you get past the noise it gets worse,&lt;br /&gt;it removed a small amount of hair and nicked me in the process, I had to repeatedly pass it over an area (my arm pit) to remove the hair, unfortunately it was so awful i just used a razor or clippers dont remember at the time to finish up after being so frustrated and had to use something to prevent hair bumps. I didnt think it had enough tweezers and speed honestly.. it was a waste for me but may be great for someone else</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly.  Just what I wanted</li>
            <li> I liked this, but for some reason it gives me a lot of ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing. My bestfriend had told me about the &amp;#34;epilator&amp;#34; so I bought the cheapest one witht he best reviews, I am hoping to get a more expensive one with better reviews soon!</li>
            <li> I had never used and epilator before purchasing the Emjoi. Because shaving underarms and legs had become such an uneasy and unsatisfactory task, I wanted to try something different. There are so many brands of epilators that are extremely expensive, so I read numerous reviews before finding the Emjoi.&lt;br /&gt;The first time using it on my underarms was a bit of a plucking feeling, but not painful. I don&#x27;t find discomfort at all when using it on my legs. It just feels almost like exfoliating. After a few uses I&#x27;ve learned the proper process of holding and moving it. So now it as easy as brushing my teeth! I only use the Emjoi about every 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Some say that it doesn&#x27;t get every hair. However, even if you have to go over an area more than once, you have to be sure to hold your skin taught in the area you are removing hair. That is how you get it.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I have very smooth skin using the very affordable Emjoi. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Ihate it !!! It doesn&#x27;t work, sending it back, this is my fourth emjoi and this is the worst,it doesn&#x27;t remove any hair AT ALL TERRIBLE TERRIBLE  mamapet</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to give up my Epilady since I had had it for over 10 years and I liked what it did. However, the motor finally gave out and I had to find something else to remove hair! This does the trick and is less painful than the Epilady. Very fast too - use it on my arms mostly, but will probably try it on my legs next.</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator, it is cheap and very efficient also easy to clean. It does hurt at the beggining but you get used to it in less than a minute. The batteries last a good while but i recommend recharchable batteries i have 2 sets so when one runs out the other one is good to go. You can use it all over your body too, though not all over your face only upper lip n chin ( the irritation took a while to go away n it look like I had breakouts).</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve use it just once almost all over my body, and it works perfect, yes it is painful but what is beauty with no pain haha, i will rate this 4 stars since i&#x27;ve use it just once and i haven&#x27;t seen the outcome maybe in a couple of weeks, but since the first time i noticed my skin was way more smoother, and you can actually see the root of the hair coming out, make sure to do it when your hair is not that long neither too short because is gonna hurt so much or is not gonna help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think for the price is a very good product if you cant afford waxing.</li>
            <li> Good product and great service</li>
            <li> Use in a circlure motion, awesome for the arm pits. I&#x27;m no longer self conscience in workout class. Also great for vacation. Use it one day before the vacation, and you won&#x27;t need to worry about packing a razor.  Nice quality. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair remover as tool to remove hair from the chin of one of my elderly friends.  Seemed like it would be just the tool.  It caught her lip and I thought by the time I pushed the off button that her lip would be hamburger but It did not cut her.  Scared us both to death but no blood.  She decided to try it herself and it did the same thing on the side of her lip. Not use-able for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> I like the product. But it could be better. I take off the outer pink, plastic cover to use it. With it on, you don&#x27;t get it all. Runs through batteries pretty quickly but has lasted me til now.</li>
            <li> Works great but does pull a little.  Use on legs, arms and face. Removal lasts a couple weeks.  This is my first time to use this type of device - recommend over a razor and cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses 3 standard AAA batteries. A plugin battery eliminator is not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments are per my wife. Purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was exciting when i purchased since i have smaller emjoi. Not as powerful as my smaller version, the slight curve makes it hard to do my underarms and bikini area. I just went back to my other one</li>
            <li> Wow, this was realy painful at first, but I got used to it. It works really well on my facial hair and under my arms. It&#x27;s worth the price just for that. I actually did use it on my legs. I cleared both legs of all hair, and it was painful, but it really wasn&#x27;t worth doing it again. The short hairs left me feeling slightly stubbly, and later on when I had to shave, even my razor didn&#x27;t give me a close shave. I don&#x27;t know how, but they were still stubbly. The razor is working fine now.</li>
            <li> This is one of the cheaper epilators, and I thought I&#x27;d give this a try before going all out and getting some expensive one (which I tend to do a lot on impulse) and hating it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s supposed to pull the hair out, but I don&#x27;t feel like it does. The hair grows back thick, and no different from how it&#x27;d be had I shaved with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of ergonomics, 5/5:&lt;br /&gt;very easy to hold in your hands and wrap fingers around&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of functionality, 1/5:&lt;br /&gt;you have to go over the same spot multiple times for it to get all of the hair, and a lot of the times, it doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair, but just rips it off.</li>
            <li> It does not grab all of your hair, and it actually just tortures you.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in perfect condition. My old Emjoi is still working well, but I wanted a back-up in case it ever wears out. This is the same model I have used for years. After trying this one, I find that it works just as well. As I am maturing, I&#x27;m getting those few ling and coarse hairs beneath my chin. This removes those nicely as well the increasing amount of peach fuzz I seem to be getting. My husband thinks it&#x27;s cute, but I don&#x27;t! : ).  There is a tiny prick of sensation with use, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it painful. I don&#x27;t like pain! I also use it for my legs, but not my underarms. I still orefer a razor for that area as I do for the bikini line. After repeated use, it does make my leg hairs grow in softer and much more sparsely. There are no uncomfortable cuts with the Emjoi as with a razor. I will probably be using this for many years to come, but will reorder if necessary from this seller.</li>
            <li> this is the type of product you can&#x27;t judge without using.  everyone&#x27;s skin, hair, pain tolerance, etc are different. it is the most painful method of hair removal i have tried thus far. it is more time consuming than any other method if i do a large area (took 2 hours to do one leg). i got tons of razor bumps although i exfoliated. it didn&#x27;t make my hair growth slow down that much. my underarms are the only place that had amazing results (thinner hair and slowed growth) from epilating.</li>
            <li> At first I was sceptical because of the low price of this item, but still bought it because the customer reviews were good.&lt;br /&gt;I was on vacation in the USA and had forgotten my (more expensive) hair remover at home. I found this one to be just as good and will use it for travel in the future (no adapters to bring along, no worries about voltage or plugs when abroad etc...).&lt;br /&gt;I used it on high speed and I was done on my legs in less than 20 minutes. The only thing I missed was a pouch to store it in, but I guess you can&#x27;t have it all at that price.&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend this item to anyone that has used this type of hair removal device before, as well as to the ones that want to try it.</li>
            <li> I was using wax strips, but it can be so messy and then you have to wash all of the wax off of your legs after. I had been considering an epilator and after months of contemplation and reading reviews, I finally decided to get one. Best decision ever. Since I&#x27;ve been waxing for quite some time, my hairs are not very course or plentiful. I use this on my legs and barely feel a thing. Much less painful than waxing. I did make the mistake of trying to use this on my underarms, and was in pain for at least three days after. I stick to my legs and my upper lip and am completely satisfied. I saw this same epilator at a beauty supply store for $57 so this is a bargain. I recommend it to all of my friends. It&#x27;s quick, convenient and less painful than you would think (unless you do your underarms).</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought -- except on my upper lip(I will just have to be hairy there).  It was really effective once I figured out that I needed to hold it in the counter-intuitive way -- with the logo away from the body.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Divine Hair Remover, White/Pink was a very good product, however, it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as the more expensive kind, but for the price i am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I think it probably depends on the person using this product, but for me it is painful and will stick with cream hair remover...</li>
            <li> this is the first time i purchased an epilator, but I guess it&#x27;s okay. The first time i used it on my leg was a little painful. More stingy than anything. It didn&#x27;t pull out all the hairs at once, rather it took out a lot of the thicker hairs, but left the finer ones, so you&#x27;ll feel your leg feeling smooth. Most of the time, it does pull out the roots, but it also just pulls out the hair instead of the roots. You&#x27;ll be able to notice that.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a lot of patience. You can&#x27;t rush this at all. I found that motioning up at an angle tends to pull more hair successfully than just straight up.&lt;br /&gt;Do not go over the area more than 2-3 times because it will irritate the skin. If it stings too much, just stop, relax and work on a different area.&lt;br /&gt;As for Bikini uses, it didn&#x27;t work too well for me, in the sense that it was a little difficult for me to angle it the right way to pull out all the hairs. Warning: Stings 3x more than the legs!&lt;br /&gt;my leg hair is black, and medium thick, not too thick. I let it grow out so it would work better. It did a pretty decent job, but for the parts that it missed, I&#x27;ll just shave it off until i get a better hang of the epilator.</li>
            <li> This epilator is cheap, and was bought because my British one doesn&#x27;t work in the US. For the price, I guess it&#x27;s pretty good - but I wouldn&#x27;t use it when I haven&#x27;t epilated in ages. It takes MUCH longer than my braun one, and misses lots of hair, but my braun one was much more expensive, so I guess it works out. I would use it just for keeping my legs smooth, probably not to start from scratch. So if you&#x27;re thinking of buying an epilator for the first time, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one. Just get a good one, even if it&#x27;s more expensive! It&#x27;ll be worth it in the long run, and epilating is SO much better than shaving and waxing.</li>
            <li> WORKS LIKE A DREAM...BEING A OLDER ITALIAN FEMALE I HAVE HAIR ON MY FACE (NOT PRETTY). I DO FIND I NEED TO USE THIS HAIR REMOVER EVERY 3 TO 4 DAYS, BUT THAT&#x27;S OK!!!!</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator and I was excited to try it out. I loved the price, but the quality was okay. I&#x27;m not sure if this is just me, but I experienced a lot of ingrown hairs on my legs after my first use. And I personally feel that my pores are more noticeable. I did experience some redness and bumps (I have sensitive skin so I expected it). But it went away in a couple hours. It doesn&#x27;t pick up all of my leg hair though after going over the spot numerous times. So I worked around it by just letting the hair grow out a little longer. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this product, but it isn&#x27;t the best out there.</li>
            <li> This thing hurts... i guess you get use to it but then it starts to hurt again. I don&#x27;t like it but it&#x27;s worth the result.... although the results are not breathtaking... it&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s easy to use... well besides the pain and it comes in great packaging.</li>
            <li> I use to have the Epilady coil shaver which works really well. This product just doesn&#x27;t grab the hair like my old Epilady. Not a clean shave and has strange angles which you can&#x27;t get to all the spots. I didn&#x27;t return it but it&#x27;s going into the garbage.</li>
            <li> So I decided to buy this as my first epilator back in May, and i love it! I was considering buying one that didnt need batteries, but im happy i chose this one.  It lasted me close to three months with 3 AAA batteries.  I noticed a difference in the thickness of hair that grew back, and the amount.  Dont expect all of your hair to be picked up with this (the reason for the 4 stars i am giving), it can be frustrating at times but the patience is worth it for the hair to grow back more slowly.  Also, it wont pick up short fuzz, is better for the thick hair.  It did kind of hurt the first time, but after that it didnt.  Epilator &gt; shaving, good luck with finding your epilator!</li>
            <li> This works really well and I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year now and it still works like new.</li>
            <li> This is a very good portable, battery-operated hair remover. Light, durable, and gets the job done. Also, very cheap. Perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> This is adequate but a little painful when using.  It is a good fix between waxing.  I would not use it for large areas like legs.</li>
            <li> This is a rechargeable epilator so I wish it would have come with the the cord and rechargeable batteries needed to actually make it so. Otherwise I am pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and in good condition. Works great. It is a little difficult to get off the cover that protects the blades, but it does come off with a little coaxing.</li>
            <li> Effective at pulling hair, not too painful, easy to clean. Definitely can cause ingrown hairs though and little hard to use on curves.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but a few words of caution.  First, be careful to follow the instructions.  If you don&#x27;t hold this just right, it pulls your skin in.  Nothing serious, but I did get a couple bruises.  Second, make sure your hair is short! Think about shaving first, then using the epilator after is grows to no more than 1/4\\&quot;.  The longer the hair, the more pain.  I did not notice the hair growing back thinner, but it takes longer to come back than shaving.  Also, use the epilator cream after - I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I did get a rash when I didn&#x27;t use the cream.</li>
            <li> This epilator does it job very well. It is easy to clean. Comes very handy. And I love the color, cute</li>
            <li> My biggest disappointment was that the product arrived without the AC Adapter, so there was no way to plug it in to use, and I don&#x27;t usually have 3 AAA batteries just lying around the house. Apparently if you want to use the epilator as a corded device, you need to buy an AC adapter SEPARATELY.&lt;br /&gt;As to removing hair, it does what it is supposed to do. However, I found it a bit more painful than my previous Phillips model. It&#x27;s bearable though. If you are a beginner, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend starting with this one.</li>
            <li> I just recieved my Divine epilator today and i&#x27;m actually pleased w/the product. I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before so I read as many reveiws as possible on as many diffrent products as possible.Since i&#x27;m terminally broke I knew I couldin&#x27;t afford to spend to much(especially on something I wasin&#x27;t even sure would work) so I found this to be the best deal w/the best reveiws.&lt;br /&gt;  Alot of people say it&#x27;s just so painful they can&#x27;t use it. Maybe I have a high tolerance for pain because as soon as I tried it on my legs I knew I wouldin&#x27;t have a problem. Within two minutes I was numb enough to do my entire leg AND both arms. If your thinking of buying an epilator don&#x27;t bother if you can&#x27;t handle waxing or tweezing sensitive spots. I think waxing is worse because it rips your skin off w/the hair.&lt;br /&gt; It is used w/batteries which I don&#x27;t like because they die to fast. However you can use a 120v adapter cord which as another reveiwer pointed out they don&#x27;t mention but they should. I haven&#x27;t tried that but I will.&lt;br /&gt; It is necessary to go over spots a few times.It does take awhile the first time you use it but I&#x27;m sure after the initial use it will be much quicker and easier,spot checking so to speak.&lt;br /&gt; So I&#x27;m happy with it. Before you buy this understand what your buying so you don&#x27;t have to write a bad reveiw or go through the headache of trying to send it back.&lt;br /&gt; Update: July 28th, 2013- I still use this product, however I have found the amount of ingrown hairs I have now has doubled. For this reason I only use this occasionally. When my hair grows back after using this I feel like I could scratch my skin off, it&#x27;s just so itchy. Shaving has never given me either of these problems.I do have very dark and relatively thick hair so if you don&#x27;t you may have better results. I do still like how smooth I feel after epilating. I&#x27;ve also used an adapter cord with it and it works so much better because of the extra power the cord gives it. I would never use it with just batteries again unless I was traveling.just batteries again unless I was traveling.</li>
            <li> So this was my first try at one of these. I will not lie-I personally have a high tolerance for pain and this even made me wince. I don&#x27;t know if my hair is to fine or course but this machine would only pick up a few in each run. I tried to just do my ankles and in 10 mins of using it it had yet to even....make a difference. Most of the hair was still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to use it on my underarms it ended up pulling my skin instead of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I guess it works for some and not all. I personally don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try another one of these any time soon.</li>
            <li> Great price and works well. One of the features I like best is that there is the option of using power cord with it. Although this is not mentioned in owners manual.I would recommend it to anyone wanting to buy a product like t</li>
            <li> this was my first time ever epilating. and i&#x27;m really glad i tried it, because now i&#x27;ll never go back (shaving always left uncomfortable stubble, waxing was always too messy, chemical depilatories never even worked). I&#x27;ve been using this on the most difficult regions: the underarms and bikini area. And it really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll take out maybe 85% of the hair in the area, if you keep going over and over repeatedly. Yes, some hair will be too small and stubborn, but you can remove those easily by any other means, or they won&#x27;t even be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is completely comfortable to use, because it massages your skin. Most of the sensation you get is from the vibrations of the rotating piece, so you barely notice the pain from plucking. I would definitely recommend this to people who have not epilated before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good it gets my skin extra smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it misses a couple of hairs idk why even if I go over and over idk why but ill try i guess the hairs are stubborn ,again I guess I&#x27;ll keep it. Good but also time consuming&lt;br /&gt;So take a shower first, exfoliate your skin, and then make sure your skin is extra dry, and use the epilator also epilate on short  hair so if you hair is long , i Suggest shaving it first then wait about 3 days until it grows back and starts getting stubbly again.  well keep it its good deal . But it will get your hair but like I said before its time consuming, probably take me 15 minutes on just one leg but its worth it, hair stayed away for like a week.</li>
            <li> I like this product but it does take quite a few passes to remove all the hair but its worth it in the end when you don&#x27;t have to shave everyday. I feel like it doesn&#x27;t have enough power as it should. It always seems a little laggy even with new batteries. My main problem with it was the shape of it because when I try to remove my armpit hair, the upper sides of this get in my way and don&#x27;t allow me to grab the hair because it cant get close enough and doesn&#x27;t work very well on curved body parts but it just takes some extra pulling of the skin and a stiff neck afterwords haha</li>
            <li> Works GREAT! yes, its a little painful when you first start to use it, but your body gets used to it. This product works better then any that I have ever tried and the price is good too</li>
            <li> Epilating wasn&#x27;t as painful as it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  However, this little machine did not remove even half of my hair.  I spent about 20 minutes on just the section of my left leg under the knee;  still didn&#x27;t get even half of the hair.  Return was easy though, so no complaints there.</li>
            <li> I only use this on my upper lip, while taking breaks in between tears,not my under arm because it hurts far too much! I would not recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I have a pretty good tolerance for pain so this was easy to use. The only thing that really bugged me is how often I will have to replace the batteries but no matter. It looks like it could be charged so all I&#x27;ll need to do is find a cord.</li>
            <li> It does its job. It doesn&#x27;t hurt too bad, the ONLY thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the batteries die very quickly I use it on my underarms and by the time I finish with one, the batteries have already died.</li>
            <li> I find the reviews complaining of pain ridiculous. Be aware of what you are buying. This is an epilator. It does not give you a back rub. It pulls your hair out by the roots which is by definition painful. I just used mine for the first time and did both lower legs, forearms and bikini area. I am a waxer and am pretty pain tolerant in this arena. If you have no experience with waxing it will be worse for you and you may not be able to tolerate the pain. I was unsure of which Emjoi model to buy, this one or the corded/rechargeable version that is almost twice as much money. I&#x27;m glad I bought this one as I&#x27;m quite sure they do the exact same thing. I just used my epilator for over an hour straight and the batteries were still full of power at the end of that timeframe. As for the function of the device, it is a rotating head that has a line of metal inserts that spin around and catch the hair, pinching it between themselves and pulling the hair out. It does not have any moving &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34; or any blades so you don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting yourself. If you have extremely thin or crepey skin, very mature skin for example, you may injure yourself if that tissuey skin is able to get caught in the pinching mechanism. Other than that you cannot hurt yourself as long as you hold the skin taut as you pass the device over the surface. I had to go over the same areas many times in order to remove most of the hair. I know there are recommendations that specifically say what direction to move the device over your skin, but I found that in order to get most of the hair I had to sort of wing it and go over the same areas many times in various directions. The device has two speeds and I found that using the slower speed was more effective in removing hair instead of just breaking it off. I plan to continue using it and hopefully someday my hair follicles will get the idea and quit producing hair, which does eventually happen over time. If you are on the fence, want to getrid of body hair without messing with the wax and have the stomach for mildly masochistic methods in the pursuit of beauty (and what woman doesn&#x27;t?), I say go for it.</li>
            <li> Its a wonderful product  and Its works good and I really enjoy It and  recommend  It  to everyone to use</li>
            <li> I love it.  It does hurt the first few times but works great.  The only downside is you have to buy the ac adapter separately.  Batteries drain very quickly.  Also, if you use it on your face, it leaves a rash.  Atleast, for me it did.</li>
            <li> First off I bought this to use myself (male). Never ever thought I would contemplate using a depilatory device on my legs but I contend with bad ingrown hair on my thighs and back side and with research this idea came up. I thought it would break the hairs and be a waste of time but it pulls the hair out like it says, root and all. Please note it takes time the first time you use it if you never have pulled hairs out of your body and it does hurt until the endorphins kick in. After the process was done, my legs are pretty hairless and the ingrown hairs I had were all removed and the red bumps were still there but were slowly going away. I am going to wait and see how long I can go without a touch up. I would recommend looking for the optional cord to plug in the wall because I used up 9 Duracell AAA&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t think it will use that many batteries all the time because it will be faster the next times because there will definitely be less hair. The cord would be a worthy investment since this hair remover was such a good price. I feel confident the hair will take time to come back, when it does it will be easy to maintain. That feeling alone is worth the money spent. Excited to know that it will hurt less and less. Great investment.</li>
            <li> It does the job but not quite as well as the one I previously used.  It removes the hair and does not make the skin feel sore but is not quite as good as it could be for the upper lip.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> My skin is incredibly sensitive and after years of struggling to find something that would not make me look like I tried to rip my skin off, I decided to give this epilator idea a try. It was the best decision ever!!! It hurts quite a bit, but it doesn&#x27;t give you a rash at all, trust me, if it doesn&#x27;t do it to me, it won&#x27;t do it to you! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stqrs it&#x27;s because it takes a loooong time to do both legs. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a cheap epilator and a more expensive one won&#x27;t be that way.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right but it does not pull my hair from the roots.</li>
            <li> Works great.  NO nicks or cuts as with other product.  Leaves nothing but smoothness.  I recommend this product who wants a safe product to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before. I&#x27;ve shaved, waxed and tweezed but after using this product, I will never use anything else!!!</li>
            <li> I like it...but then after a while of using it...well it was slower...and did not take all my hair out from the root....maybe I need to replace the battery. I just think it should have lasted longer and removed moved hair.</li>
            <li> I am Greek and have thick, dark hair. I tried it after taking a warm bath to exfoliate my skin, open my pores, and soften the hair. The pain wasn&#x27;t an issue for me but it gave me ingrown hairs a couple days after. It was only 30 something bucks but I think I should of invested a little more for a more durable product. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times with new batteries and the batteries drained pretty quick.</li>
            <li> i got  another one of these and i use it alot, i realy like it and well worth the money.  runs on  3 AAA batteries. i will never be with out it agian. Diana</li>
            <li> I have hirsuitism.. which basically means that I have more body hair than the average woman. If you want to know more about it just wikipedia it. I was always really self conscious about myself and my hairy arms and refused to go out during the summer time because of it. So I bought myself this epilator -- my first epilator to be exact. It hurts a lot on the armpit area (well.. that was kinda expected), so I had to do three sessions of epilation. I had bled the first time. The second time I was really sore. The third time, I was fine. There were still some leftover hairs sticking out, but I guess I will just use a tweezer and pull them out manually. Moving onto the arms and legs. It took me forever to do my legs (I guess that&#x27;s expected as well looking at everyone&#x27;s reviews). My arms were done pretty quickly and I bled a little. It feels a bit numb after I done it, but it feels like a baby&#x27;s butt, which I have never experienced before on my body. I am satisfied with the epilator and recommend it to anyone with body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it&#x27;s easy to clean.. which is good. It&#x27;s not waterproof either, so you have to do it when you&#x27;re dried up. I&#x27;m using the epilator with the epilator cream by Emjoi and I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s working so far, so I might update this after a few months. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 08/03/2012: Okay. After around half a year of owning this epilator, it is still working fine. I am going to knock the ratings down to four stars because I realized it does break off some of your hair, it doesn&#x27;t pick up all your hair, it does cause ingrown hair, and it does eat your batteries like there&#x27;s no tomorrow. I would recommend having on hand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Rechargeable AAA batteries - It will save your money A LOT. I had used up 20 AAA batteries in around five months (epilating 1-2 times a week) so I seriously do recommend using rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;2. Body scrub - Helps some of the ingrown hairs and it does leave your skin nice and smooth. Exfoliatebefore epilating!&lt;br /&gt;3. Pain killers - I do not have this problem, but I do know that there are people with very low tolerance for pain. If you are one of them, take a pain killer, or I have heard that blow-drying the area you are going to epilate with a hair dryer will help with the pain since you&#x27;re opening up the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a $20 epilator, it does its job well. After this one dies on me, I will probably invest in a better quality epilator.</li>
            <li> This is one of my wisest beauty product purchases.  Do not be discouraged during your first use! The first time I used this product it was painful - much like waxing.  But as you use the hair remover, it becomes much less painful, and it is much more effective than waxing.  I am in love with my Divine Hair Remover!!  The hair remover also removes hair at a much shorter length.  I use this on my upper lip every week, and on my chin and other areas about every two weeks.  I could not live without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used epilator instead of razor or wax because of its simplicity. It plugs the hair perfectly fine, even if hair break sometimes, but that is perfectly normal and can&#x27;t be avoided. I&#x27;m waiting to see how long the batteries will last, though.</li>
            <li> Okay so this product is awesome! I am very excited to use this once my hair grows a little longer.&lt;br /&gt; People complain it&#x27;s painful, and OF COURSE it is! But what do you expect. You are pulling each hair out of its folicule! It&#x27;s like when you start plucking your eyebrows. Eventually you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt; Overall I am super excited! Great quality.</li>
            <li> Recieved the Emjoi Divine Hair Remover a couple days ago, just tried it today.  I was a little disappointed that it takes so many batteries, 3AAA however I noticed there is a port for an AC adapter.  I used it on my legs today, yes it is uncomfortable but soaking in a bath did help.  Still had some small hairs on legs but I will get these in a few days, they may have been too short.  No redness was a plus as waxing has left me with irritating red hair bumps.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the longterm effects.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> It takes a few times for your legs to feel smooth, but the hair does grow back finer and slower if you keep at it.</li>
            <li> I think this is a pretty good intro to epilating hair remover.  It was my first time using one.  I looked into epilators because shaving was really irritating my underarms.  I think this was a good deal - the price was right for me to try it out.  And it came with a 30 day money back guarantee, so I figured it would be safe in case I hated it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;m definitely pleased with the results.  The first week it hurt something terrible.  I tried to use it to remove all the hair under my left arm and it was AWFUL!  I decided I&#x27;d only do a little on my right underarm and then shave, then do a little more when that grew back, and shave the rest again, and continued that pattern til most of my hair was removed via the Emjoi.  That was a less painful plan.  Now all my hair is growing back at different rates, so it&#x27;s not so painful.  I just remove a little bit of hair each night before I go to bed.  Less hair combined with the fact that my underarms are getting used to it makes it MUCH EASIER to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I took off one star is because I think the batteries make it less powerful over time.  It&#x27;s worth it to me for the convenience of not worrying about a cord, but it&#x27;s something to think about for the future.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife because she wanted a no-no but they were too expensive. You get what you pay for I guess. It was very time consuming and hurt like hell. It also left ingrown hairs and bruises on her legs.</li>
            <li> I got this exclusively for facial hair. Seems that as I age I have some &amp;#34;granny hairs&amp;#34; on my chin and mustache area. Te eyes are not so great either and I was pinching more than plucking. So, this device is meant to solve all my problems. At first, I was disappointed because I couldn&#x27;t see to get all the hairs out. I find that it is best right after my shower, when the pores are &amp;#34;relaxed&amp;#34;. Also, I shaved the hair down and it seems easier for the &amp;#34;Devine&amp;#34; to catch shorter hair. This item came nicely packaged. The directions were so so. I was pleased that it didn&#x27;t hurt at all. I have nothing to compare this to, but I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Not only does this thing hurt, a lot, but you have to keep going over the area to get all the hairs.  Not worth is in my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Works quite well you must be careful and hold skin tight or you can get skin cought</li>
            <li> Powerful didn&#x27;t work as well as expected but I have very fine hair so I will be returning if you have thick hair I say order it</li>
            <li> I bout it for my wife ,she is very happy with it ,It is simply great product with low price which is hard to get such balance on Items nowadays</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly , before the expected delivery date. It looked just like ths picture. The item works well and I love it. Perfect item for a epilator virgin.</li>
            <li> Epilators are torture devices. I have no intentions on misleading anyone about that. However, I much prefer a bit of momentary pain (which does diminish each session, just like waxing) then the razor bumps and infected ingrown hairs I get from shaving. I have lots of friends with epilators and it seems like each of them prefers to use them for different body regions. Personally, I really love it on my armpits, bikini area, happy trail and arms. I haven&#x27;t been able to sit still long enough to use it on my legs, but I think it would be worthwhile to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emjoi Divine Hair Remover is probably not a top of the line epilator, but it does the job quite nicely. Since it is relatively inexpensive, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy their first epilator since I don&#x27;t think epilating (just like waxing) is for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;- Take an anti-inflammatory beforehand to help ease the pain.&lt;br /&gt;- Try each region at least twice, especially if you have never waxed or plucked the area since as the follicle weakens, the pain and regrowth texture changes.&lt;br /&gt;- I like to take it slow and work with small areas at a time with breaks in between.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I read so many great reviews on it but honestly, it does not work at all. I haven&#x27;t felt it grab any hairs at all. Maybe you have to wait til the hair is long enough.. But who wants to wait for that? I don&#x27;t want the hair there at all let alone wait for it to get long where people can see it. I would not recommend this item for anyone.</li>
            <li> I had been using an epilady purchased from HSN approximately 8+ years ago.  It could grab and pluck even fine hairs without a lot of over-stroking.  It finally gave out so I began searching for its replacement and decided on the Emjoi.  Even after going over the area several times (and it took several times to even see any results) I had to conclude it just wasn&#x27;t doing the job - at all in fact.  (The area in question was my upper lip area and chin).  Guess I&#x27;m used to my original hair remover and the quick and efficient job it did.</li>
            <li> it is a pretty good epilator but you do have to go over your legs several times to get all the hair off</li>
            <li> was looking for a good hair removal method. this is good! does what it says, but idk if i&#x27;m using it the wrong way? Sometimes it makes my hair break (thus sometimes ending up with short hairs.</li>
            <li> It takes a few times of going over each spot to get all of the hairs. It does hurt the first few times, but the pain does decrease. The effects last so much longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> I like my moji because it&#x27;s convenient and u can use it anywhere and any day I want at ok</li>
            <li> Really been wanting to try an epilator. Read lots of reviews and finally chose this one mainly because of the price. Its true you get what you pay for. No it did not hurt, maybe because it did nothing at all. Gonna try another one, not sure which as of yet. dont waste your money on this one!!!</li>
            <li> Many years ago, when this technology was new, a relative tried it and described torture.  Being tired of spending so much on razors/blades, I decided to give this a try with a gift certificate I&#x27;d been given.  Great product, great price, and great results!</li>
            <li> Works very well, though obviously it&#x27;s not painless. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I got it hoping it would work really well, it just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. I gave it a two because it really didn&#x27;t pull out the hairs well.</li>
            <li> This product has low power. When I got it I thought that it could be more powerful, but I was wrong. It needs 3 batteries triple A and It does not come with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it It&#x27;s not as painful as I thought It would be, which is a plus. If you are like me and afraid of using stuff like that, take your time using it and you are going to realise that It is not that horrible feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not pinch on your legs or some other parts of your body, but It does pinch when you use it on your underarm. However It did not hurt me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also It did not remove all of hair from my legs and I had to reuse it multiple times in the same spot.</li>
            <li> Good for thoes who think waxing is too painful, it still hurts but is very convenient. Sometimes I think it cuts the hair off instead of pulling it out.</li>
            <li> It tweezes as stated. Although the discomfort that comes with tweezing is involved, the product satisfies my basic needs for facial hair removal.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for those stray chin, neck, face hairs. I had the smaller version and it was hard to line it up to snatch them. It also got less and less powerful over time. This thing can&#x27;t miss. Also got it right away, two days earlier than estimated.</li>
            <li> It pulls on my hairs without ripping them out. It breaks other hairs without getting the root. It takes forever to get two inches of my leg smooth. Crap!</li>
            <li> NO GOOD! needs stronger energy source of power maybe an electronic one would be better than this battery powered one. This item will stop on you.</li>
            <li> I use this on my armpits and its wonderful! It takes a week or two for the hair to grow back which is really good! Definitely would recommend this!</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Divine hair remover met the requirements that it set out to do. It did a good job at picking up the hairs. On the first use it was a little painful but not to the point of crying or anything. I had read in other reviews previously that it hurt like something yanking on your face but I didn&#x27;t find it that painful; that seemed to exaggerated. The only problem I found with it was that yes it was picking up majority of the hairs but I had to let the hairs grow, and it wouldn&#x27;t pick up ALL of the hairs. Overall this product seems an ok as a  starter, because it gives you a sense as to what others systems, like this one, feel and seem like.</li>
            <li> I Personally Did Not Like It. It Pulled Some Hair Out But Most Of My Hairs Were Cut Off. I Tried This On My Face And When My Hair Came Back I Noticed Some Hairs Grew Back Longer :/ It Wasn&#x27;t Too Painful, At First It Feels Like A Zap But You Get Used To It.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  Great for hair removal.  Recommend it to those who have waxed or used other hair removers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It works very well and ends up paying for itself with money saved with not needing to buy razors.</li>
            <li> Painful but works well. However, if you are prone to ingrown hairs take that into consideration before you buy it.</li>
            <li> only problem is that you have to replace batteries often!</li>
            <li> I thought will come with AC adapter,or charger. Still will be usefull , but I have to order another one with AC adapter, so I do not have to be worry about replacing the batteries.I wish it was indicated in the ad, so I do not have to buy another one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely suggest getting rechargeable AAA batteries, as it goes through them quickly. Also, lidocaine has become my new friend. Amazon is selling it at 4%, and even 6%. If you&#x27;re gonna epilate more sensitive areas, slather on cream with lidocaine, wait 20 min, and be sure to be careful with thin skinned areas, but you&#x27;ll be more smooth than you&#x27;ve been before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this is time consuming, and to be hair free you&#x27;ll need to use it for awhile. But I wish I would&#x27;ve gotten one when I was much younger; would&#x27;ve saved so much money and confidence. This leaves me with inflamed empty hair follicles for the first day or two after, but then thankfully for the first time I haven&#x27;t needed to worry about how my legs look/feel. This is MUCH better on my skin than waxing, and costs tons less, too.</li>
            <li> Works great. Found its easier to clean if you let the hair follicles dry out. they just fall off</li>
            <li> This product does pluck hairs but there&#x27;s constant hair breakage and ingrown hairs. Leaves skin extremely red and painful but you&#x27;ll get used to the pain after a while. Batteries were not included.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite personal care tool!  If you have chin hairs, you NEED this!!</li>
            <li> I bought this model because of the price, and because other one&#x27;s with similar prices had fewer tweezers on the head. I had never used an epilator, but was very attracted to the idea of not having to worry about shaving my legs so often. I did a lot of research online, mostly YouTube video reviews, and decide that if I bought it, I had to use it at least three times to see if it was worth it and if it became less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time did hurt quite a bit, but it&#x27;s bearable. It took me forever to get both of my legs done, but within a week I knew it was worth it. I used to shave my legs only once a week because I&#x27;m lazy and am in a LDR, but with epilating I didn&#x27;t have to worry about my legs looking progressively hairier as the week went on, they stayed hair free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that I decided to try my armpits. That REALLY hurt, but I&#x27;d just do as much as a could at night, then shave the rest, let it grow out a little, use the epilator for as long as I could, and then shave the rest. You get the pattern. It took a couple weeks, but I can now proudly say that my armpits are bald! I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT- there are some downsides. First of all, I&#x27;ve found that I have to go over areas several times, and that fine hairs are often not picked up. Luckily for me those fine hairs are usually blonde and you can&#x27;t really see them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already use an epilator and are looking to buy a new one, I would not recommend this product because it&#x27;s just not perfect. I&#x27;ve only had this a month and already know that I want a nicer one that will pick up the finer hairs with fewer passes in the not-too-far-off future. But, this is great if you&#x27;re not sure about epilating, mainly because of the price, but also because it&#x27;s a good deal for the price. From what I can tell, this is not a shitty/cheap-o epilator, so you&#x27;re getting a good introduction without it costing a bundle.</li>
            <li> I did some research trying to figure out first, if I even wanted to attempt epilating, then second which one to buy to test it out ... ended up buying the Emjoi Divine (pink &amp; white) because of the price and based on other reviews (on Amazon &amp; the web in general). I was actually surprised at how little discomfort there was, I guess I had set my expectations pretty high for some pain, but surprisingly, after the first couple pulls (just like tweezing your eyebrows) it becomes \\&quot;nothing\\&quot; to finish the job! I have only tried on my legs and they are very smooth! I can&#x27;t comment on if they stay smooth for the 6 weeks quoted on the box, but if they prevent stubble for longer than 2 days, then it&#x27;s a great product in my book! This one was easy to use for a beginner: unpack from the box, add batteries, read the pamphlet on how-to, took a hot shower, exfoliated, and went right to it! Very easy!&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Note however that since this one is a very basic model, you will have to go over the hairs a few times for it to grab all of them, but I didn&#x27;t expect perfection for this price, not when compared to the fact that the majority of epilators costs twice as much! But to see if you even like the process, then this is a great one to try! I simply went over the hairs, moving the epilator to the right or left or even angling it, and it eventually got them all, even the tiny, fine ones!</li>
            <li> The product was just as advertised.  As a long time epilady user I was leary of straying from the \\&quot;brand name\\&quot;.  The difference in price convinced me to give it a try.  Glad I did.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is how it eats batteries.  I quickly got used to the pain, and when I started lightly exfoliating every other day (damp washcloth after showering), the ingrown hairs stopped.  It does eat batteries though!  The package says you can buy a cord from another website, but I bought rechargeable batteries and that works fine (and the charger works for both AA and AAA, so I can use it for most of my batteries)</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, a little painful but i got use to that. I had to order a wire separately because the batteries are a bad idea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this method of hair removal for about 25 years now, and the improvements in home tools is remarkable, but this tool has a curvature that does not allow the tool reach the skin easily.  I do use it of course, but my old Epilady is still my first choice due to the straight tweezers plate.  I would not purchase this item again</li>
            <li> This thing hurts like a bitch. It does not get better with time. Honestly I just went back to shaving.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair remover I had. I used many in last 20 years and this one hurt least so that I can use it on my under arms. It is little bit slower in hair removal than other brands and need to change the battery quite often, however, I could not use any other hair remover on my underarms before. So it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Although I do find htis item to be comfortable, I am either dense or the facial hair is coarser and the Emjoi can&#x27;t pick it up.  Can someone give me some feedback on how to use the item better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Sarah</li>
            <li> First of all, this is not my first purchase of an Emjoi or similar product. I had one years ago that was OK but just never removed all the hair. Years have passed and I decided to give the Emjoi another chance at making me hair-free and fabulous. When I first tried my new Emjoi, I was satisfied, thinking it had pulled the hair out by the root when what it actually does, for the mmost part, at least on me, is shave the hair. I follow the directions, take my time, pull my skin taunt, or as much as is possible to pull it on 64 year-old skin. I didn&#x27;t return the hair remover as I have had it for too long. I just basically use it as a shaver. If I try this type product again, I&#x27;ll pay the extra money and get an electrical one in hopes that more power will give it more pull.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd epilator I&#x27;ve gotten. My first one was a purple colored Braun for a little less than what the Emjoi cost. It worked SO well. Unfortunately I kept dropping it and finally I broke it for good. Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find the same one and found this on Amazon with great reviews. I can&#x27;t use the epilator on my legs b/c it causes 99% of ingrown hair (happened from both epilators) so I use it mainly for my underarms. The biggest difference is that b/c this one has a curved edge going upwards, you have to make sure that the hair you&#x27;re trying to remove is completely centered. Not sure if that makes sense. Sometimes there are weird angles in which I want to catch the hair but can&#x27;t b/c of the design. If the outer edge were curved downwards (like my old one), the blades could reach the hairs at any angle. I probably wouldn&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT &amp;#60;3 IT WORKS WELL TO REMOVE THE HAIR BY THE ROOTS! I CAN&#x27;T WAIT UNTIL MY ARMPIT GROWS IN SOFTER AND LIGHTER</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m in love! I&#x27;ve been playing around with the idea of getting (and using) an epilator for about a year now. But I never wanted to make the plunge into something I may not like and shell out a bunch of money for it. I searched for all the epilating products for the best reviews within my price range and this was at the top of my list. Another bonus was I had enough Amazon points that I got this for free and free shipping with the Amazon Prime trial.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product... I have never waxed so yes it is painful but not unbearable. It really helps to start in one area and work your way out from that spot slowly (at least for me). It kind of numbs out the area you are working on. Also if you are apprehensive about the discs and vibrations slowly apply it to an area with no hair like the palm of your hand so you can get used to the feeling and realize that it is not pinching your skin when you use it but the feeling of the hair being ripped out.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right for seeing you want to try this type of hair removal. I&#x27;m going to upgrade to a higher end type once this one craps out (if it does).</li>
            <li> I decided to try this simply because i&#x27;m tired of shaving. i chose this one because of the price and it was my first time trying an epilator. when i first got it, i tried it on my legs. however, the hair on my legs wasn&#x27;t long enough (i had just shaved not about a week before). so in order to see if it was worth growing out my hair more, i decided to try it on my arms since that hair was long enough. it seemed to work fine (definitely NOT painless, but not unbearable). my arms were smooth for a couple of days, then i started to get bumps. at first i thought i was allergic reaction to something else, but i realized that some of the bumps looked like ingrown hairs. now my arms look horrible and all i can really do is wait until the hair grows back. i&#x27;m probably going to have to buy one of those bumper stoppers for ingrown hairs or something.&lt;br /&gt;i started reading more reviews on websites other than amazon, and i see that  a lot of people have the same problem with epilators. apparently, what feels like the hairs being pulled straight from the root, can really just be the hairs being pulled and/or broken. i would have been better shaving my arms. UGH. i&#x27;m glad i only spent $25.&lt;br /&gt;this is DEFINITELY not for me. good for the women this worked for, but please be cautious when trying it out for the first time. i would recommend trying it on a small patch of hair in an unnoticeable place.&lt;br /&gt;the only reason i gave this two stars instead of one, is because if you&#x27;re going to try it, this is probably the best deal and size to try. even if i didn&#x27;t get the bumps, i don&#x27;t like that fact that the hair has to be relatively long in order for this to work.</li>
            <li> I thought the pain would be too much and that it might not work that well but it actually works really well and the pain isn&#x27;t unbearable! The hair is removed relatively fast although you need to spend a little more time than shaving. It was worth it for me.</li>
            <li> mind you, this product hurts like a mother trucker- but i prefer it to waxing. i used to wax my facial hair but would get a reaction (which i already knew i would) but with this, i dont so much. i use ice before and after so my face cools down, but only recommend this to people with a high tolerance for pain! i gave it four stars because it doesnt pick up the super little hairs, but thats normal even with wax. it does exactly what it says it does, and just a hint: make sure you use super fresh batteries so its faster and get dones faster :)&lt;br /&gt;PS the second time around isnt as painful.</li>
            <li> OUCH...these seem to work okay, but eat batteries like no tomorrow.  Does a pretty good job about eliminating unwanted hair though.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an epilator that works with batteries without charging for my foreign travel. I found this for a reasonable price, but I was not for sure if it works as well as my expensive Braun epi. which I trust and have been using for many years. Well, I have tried my new Emjoi a few times and it works just fine. The size is lot bigger than my Braun, but much lighter because it doesn&#x27;t have the heavy AC adapter thing. I wish the color was different.. but I still love this product. Thanks :)</li>
            <li> I primarily use the epilator when the warmer weather rolls around, and just stick to lower maintenance shaving in the winter, when I&#x27;m covered by clothing anyway.  But when my underarms and legs are exposed, I prefer to go through the extra steps to remove the hair from the follicle.  I have very light skin and rather dark hair, so even the closest shave will leave the hair just beneath the skin visible and little black stubble dots aren&#x27;t that cute IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So shorts and tank tops come out and I break out the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs:&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to grow your hair out very long to use it—just a millimeter or so—which is very convenient.  Also, using it on my legs means I don&#x27;t have to shave them as frequently, even in summer.  I am very prone to ingrown hairs and sometimes that is a problem with the epilator, but it&#x27;s also a problem if I shave too frequently, so balancing the two against each other I get fewer ingrown hairs with the epilator.  The first time I use it on my entire leg will probably result in maybe 20-30% of the hair growing back in a couple of days (ones that accidentally broke off at the skin, I guess), so it takes two or three sessions at the beginning of the summer before I&#x27;ve really gotten it all.  Even then, 20-30% of leg hair isn&#x27;t as noticeable if you want to skip a couple of days of shaving, so my legs are already lower maintenance at that point (and look smoother, too).  The rest of the hair will grow back in probably a few weeks.  So I use the epilator once every two weeks or so, but since the hair is more sparse in subsequent sessions, it&#x27;s much less painful, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms:&lt;br /&gt;I shave my underarms every day, winter or summer, and even right after shaving you can see the dark spots from the hair beneath the skin.  Sometimes in the summer when I want to eliminate this I&#x27;ll go through the steps to epilate it off.  The underarms ARE more painful than the legs, because the skin is more delicate and the hair isthicker.  I&#x27;d grow out the hair for a day or two before epilating, and make sure you pull the skin TIGHT!  Even then, it&#x27;s going to hurt.  It&#x27;s also going to leave your underarms red and feeling like they&#x27;ve been attacked by razor burn, so you might want to keep them covered for another day while the redness subsides.  But you&#x27;ll get a few week&#x27;s worth of awesome looking underarms for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini:&lt;br /&gt;Again, I am very prone to ingrown hairs, so I mostly prefer to use an electric trimmer on this area.  Also, the pain tends to hurt more the higher (elevation wise) up the mound you go, so I tend to only use it up to the base of the pubic bone.  Still, it&#x27;s nice to prune the shrubbery back a bit, and reduces the overall area by about half or so—which can be the difference between sticking out from a bikini or not.  Red bumps and ingrown hairs are terrible in this area, but I&#x27;ve recently found that treating the area with witch hazel afterwards seems to help prevent that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain:&lt;br /&gt;Definitely overplayed in a lot of the reviews I read when I bought this.  So many women complaining about how much it hurt.  I&#x27;m willing to bet waxing hurts more, and I&#x27;ve definitely endured womanly things that hurt a hell of a lot more than the little sting of this gadget.  Like someone else put it, it&#x27;s like getting your hair caught in a watch.  Unpleasant, but brief and negligible.  And the long lasting results are definitely worth the temporary pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life:&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, it kind of sucks, and I&#x27;ve learned that when you hear it starting to run slower, it&#x27;s best to change the batteries.  You CAN still operate it, but it will be more likely to get ingrown hairs and hairs that aren&#x27;t pulled out all the way and such.  I bought some rechargeable batteries that I use in all my little gadgets such as this so that I&#x27;m not constantly spending money on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love it.  I don&#x27;t use it all the time all throughout the year, but I&#x27;m very glad I bought it for the occasions when I opt for this strategy.  I didn&#x27;t buy it for soft cuddles; I bought it to remove my hair from the root.  It does that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the tricks and this still doesn&#x27;t work very well with my fine body hair. It breaks a lot of hairs, and completely misses a lot of hairs. It may help my legs look less hairy, but I never feel smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> My wife liked it very much very cute small one. easy to use and easy to carry also. nice item to buy</li>
            <li> Very painful and do not work good on my legs and the battery do not lost longer I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this recently from another site.  So far, so good.  I started with a small section on one of my legs.  It&#x27;s been completely smooth for 3 days.  I look at expanding to the rest of my leg later tonight.  There&#x27;s been some gritting of teeth, but I don&#x27;t think the pain is \\&quot;unbearable\\&quot;.  Of course, I&#x27;m used to facial waxing.  I got this and the smaller &#x27;Tweezie&#x27; for a combined $20, so it&#x27;s a good deal.  You can run this unit while plugged in, or unplugged on battery.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator. I&#x27;m obsessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to wax at home. It worked but it was messy and imprecise and the areas I waxed would be irritated and sometimes break out the next day. This product is a miracle worker. It took a bit of getting used to, but it pulls out hairs quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. The areas I was used to waxing did not hurt at all when I first used the epilator over them (underarm, legs, arms, upper lip). However, I will say I epilated my bikini area (and not *just* the bikini line -- everything) and it was incredibly painful; I had never waxed there before. In my bikini area, some of the follicles bled a tiny bit afterwards; this is probably what users who have never waxed before can expect under the arms as well. The results were totally worth the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I highly recommend this to anyone who likes smoother, longer-lasting results than a shave can give. This model is also very affordable!</li>
            <li> This works well and has met all of my expectations it takes awhile for regrowth to occur and some cases the hair does not come back</li>
            <li> I had tried a friend&#x27;s Emjoi, and I liked it for my upper lip, so I decided to get one of my own. I think she paid more for hers, and it did a better job than this one does. It does get some of the hair, but I still need to follow up with tweezers. Overall, it speeds up the process, but it doesn&#x27;t do the whole job.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick and dark hair and using this on even my legs resulted in a lot of broken hairs which grew back noticeably within a week. The process of going over my limbs with the epilator was also a slow and laborious process since it is relatively small and performed  inconsistently in pulling hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are very sensitive to pain, this epilator shouldn&#x27;t cause too much discomfort whatsoever, even in the more delicate bits.</li>
            <li> Pulled out some hairs, pain level was fine for what it is, but broke I think the majority of them leaving me anything but smooth.</li>
            <li> I have had this item for quite some time.  Initially, I was using it for small areas, like my fingers or belly.  Then I grew brave and started using it on my legs.  It worked great, but I noticed to get the best (as in quickest and less pain) results, I had to replace the batteries each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently ordered the adapter from the manufacturer&#x27;s website (it was cheap with free shipping too) and that made all the difference.  When the device is running at full power, it is fast.  I can do my lower legs in under 10 minutes.  I also use it for my underarms.  I haven&#x27;t used a razor in over 3 months, and I noticed the hair is really sparse and my skin is super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes getting used to.  If you are currently waxing, it is a cheap and easy transition.  If not, I recommend getting the adapter, then start by working in small areas.  There is a technique to how to use it, like moving in small quick circles or switching directions.  Also make sure to clean the head by tapping it against the sink or trash on slow speed and using the brush that came with it.  I also spray the head with 90% alcohol solution to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some users mentioned getting bumps or ingrowns.  The key to any hair removal is exfoliation.  I use a bristle brush almost daily on the areas I exfoliate and follow up with an AHA cream.  No more bumps or ingrowns.</li>
            <li> my friend convinced me to get an epilator after she got hers and after reviewing it i decided to buy one and i wish i had bought one sooner! i love this thing!! its a little weird at first, but its just like a wax, the first time is the worst. i do this every night after my shower and my legs have been smooth ever since! every girl should get one of these, seriously!!! dont hesitate, buy now!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheaper then most and would let me try this technique without breaking my bank! It works surprisingly well! Beware leg hair that is too long though...OUCH! Otherwise very tolerable. I use on my pits and legs occasionally. I will try on the bikini line when swim suit season comes around!</li>
            <li> This product is good for those who are not sure if you&#x27;re going to be able to handle the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; of an epilator. I got scared because of the reviews saying that it hurt, so went cheap, and learned that it doesn&#x27;t hurt what-so-ever. It works, but you have to go over the skin OVER AND OVER; It broke a lot of hairs before actually pulling them, even though I have really fine hair. I only did my legs, so I have no idea how it works anywhere else on the body. I haven&#x27;t used mine long enough to know about battery life, but some reviews say that the batteries die fast. If this is true, I would say getting a better one will pay off in not buying batteries in the end. With this being on the cheap end of the epilators, I just say that I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> You have to roll this over and over on the area that you want to remove the hair, that&#x27;s a pain.  And it doesn&#x27;t even get rid of everything.</li>
            <li> it sucks my skin into it so you have to hold the skin tight, I liked my old one better</li>
            <li> I love this product! It hurt a little the first time; but after that not so much. I use it for my underarm, legs, and \\&quot;Brazilian Wax\\&quot;. I was pleasantly surprised @ how less painful it was compared to an actual Brazilian Wax. No irritation, blood, or raised areas; no ingrown hairs so far either. I could not be happier w/ this product. I only wish I found it sooner!</li>
            <li> Worked for about an hour, then it died. It got extremely hot during use - hot enough to be uncomfortable to hold or touch. It didn&#x27;t work long enough for me to tell if it would have done a good job or not. I was using a power cord, not batteries, as it blew through fresh batteries in about 2 minutes, if that long.</li>
            <li> I have never used an epillator before and I got this one because of the price. It was a little painful but I love it for the underarm area because with shaving I always look like I haven&#x27;t shaved two hours later. This worked very well. You do have to go over the area a few times but it does remove the hair and at a great price.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. Only complaint is the batteries run out quick. But you can buy a power supply on Emjoi&#x27;s website. It is another $17 including shipping, but then it will be battery capable and corded too. So far, I found it to be painful at times, for my first time . But not moreso than expected. I&#x27;ll see how much better that gets with time. And, at first it took a while becuz I was getting used to it, but your speed picks up as you figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/9/13: I purchased a Braun Epilator that was stronger/better according to reviews and was going to relegate this one to a travel Epilator if the Braun was better.  It was.  So I just traveled at the end of January and took this with me. I hadn&#x27;t epilated in a couple of days. Yet when I used this, it didn&#x27;t pull out many hairs at all. I epilate regularly with my Braun and ALWAYS get a bunch of hairs out.  After that experience, I threw this in the garbage. It was a great buy to introduce me to epilating at a reasonable price, but getting a better product was necessary once I decided to stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/13/13: it died a long time ago and I have long since thrown it out. My Braun has had a ton of use and is still going.</li>
            <li> I got this and was only able to use it a few times. It is very painful and in my opinion not worth it. I actually think it is less painful to just wax than use this thing!</li>
            <li> I got tired of expensive waxing and shaving everyday was a pain.  This epilator changed my life!  It&#x27;s so easy and simple to use!  I did a lot of research on epilators before I decided to purchase.  Read all the reviews and watched YouTube recommendations. If you are thinking of purchasing an epilator for the first time, I highly recommend watching this video :[...]    This is my first epilator! I had heard many a horror story of people purchasing epilators and talking about it being too painful and how the epilator was frighteningly loud, and basically just chickening out.  So it took me a while to finally decide to purchase one.  I ended up purchasing the model that the girl in the YouTube video is using.  It&#x27;s a great price and works great!    Speaking as a person who regularly waxes and am used to the pain, I can definitely say this is way less painful.  I would compare it to plucking your eyebrows, you feel the tug but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  After receiving the epilator in the mail from Amazon, I admit that it sat on my bathroom counter for maybe three weeks. I was trying to work up the courage.  So many at home hair removal products had disappointed me in the past, and they never really worked like they said it would.  This works exactly like the reviews say!    In reading the Amazon reviews, one reviewer recommended having a glass of wine before the first time.  I highly recommend this!  It calms the nerves and gives you a little courage. The first time was only lightly painful, but the results definitely out weighed that.  The second time, I breeze through it, no pain.  It&#x27;s a matter wrapping your mind around the fact that you are intentionally ripping out your hair.    I also purchased the Emjoi after epilation cream that they recommend.  I definitely recommend putting this on after epilation! It soothes the your red skin and makes your skin super soft, plus you won&#x27;t have a leg full of red pores the next day.  I have used this epilator on my legs, under arm, and bikini line. Because of how the tweezers are place on the epilator, it makes it a little hard to reach everything in your under arm, so I spend a more time in that area.  But, again, the results make it well worth it!    In conclusion, for all of those first timers, like myself, or maybe for those searching for their next epilator, I recommend this epilator, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This hair remover works great and the price makes it even better. I purchased one months ago and my friend uses mine all the time, so I purchased one for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it about once a week and it works as well as anything I have tried.</li>
            <li> Do not work as i though</li>
            <li> I did not buy my Emjoi from Amazon, and it is slightly different than the one pictured. The pink parts are right but the white part of the one shown is silver on mine. Mine also has a cord which is definitely a necessary inclusion. Battery power does not cut it at all. Not even when I tried keeping it plugged in between uses to try the battery that way. It still goes weak within minutes. So I always use it corded. I will use the batteries in something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second electric hair plucker thing I have used. The first one was decades ago and horribly painful. Emjoi was lots less painful but it was still painful for the first couple uses and then I don&#x27;t know if the pain stopped, or if I denied the pain because I loved how effective it is at removing excess facial hair that I was frustratingly plucking for years. I am glad to be free of that. And I am using it much less than at first, plus I notice certain stray hairs that never grow back. So this makes my sessions shorter. The mustach is even getting easier and quicker to expel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush that is included is not useful to me. I actually use a purposed hard bristle toothbrush and that works. So all in all, I am happy with my CORDED Emjoi. I would hate it if it had no cord.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark body hair that grows really fast, I literally had to shave my legs 3 times a day if wanted to keep them smooth and hair free.  i&#x27;ve tried waxing, which works for about 1 week for me.  i&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months now and my leg hair is finally growing back in slowly, very light and fine and I only have to use it in a few places every couple of weeks now (and I can&#x27;t even imagine how much money i&#x27;ve saved on wax!.  I have never been this satisfied with any other hair remover.  The only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 5 star rating is the battery usage.  It does eat up the batteries pretty fast so I think it should come with an AC Adapter.  Fortunately, I have re-chargable batteries and also just happened to have a 100-240V AC Adapter that works great with it.  I&#x27;ve also been using it on my stache with great results.  Now I just need to brave the bikini area, ripping hair out is not pleasant but ssooo worth being able to throw out the razaorit!!!</li>
            <li> Good wish it plugged in the wall</li>
            <li> This product does not do what it is supposed to do. It is too gentle and does not remove hairs. I&#x27;ve had other enjoy products that work great bit this one is so &amp;#34;devine&amp;#34; that it does nothing.</li>
            <li> Love this elipator, gonna invest in a rechargeable one next...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get all the hair out. I&#x27;d say it gets maybe half out if you&#x27;re really thorough. The hair also gets all jammed up in the top part and it&#x27;s very hard to get out. But it&#x27;s a lot less messy than waxing, and better than shaving, so I guess it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and it was affordable. I love to use it and it keeps me hairfree for weeks!</li>
            <li> great product for the price. this is my first epilator, i didn&#x27;t want to buy a super pricey high end model until i knew i&#x27;d like using one. &amp; i do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of course it&#x27;s going to hurt! you&#x27;re ripping hair out of your body. BUT it really only hurts a lot the first time or two, just like waxing. your skin gets used to it and it becomes much easier if you keep up with it. you&#x27;ll probably by irritated after the first couple uses too, so be prepared and don&#x27;t epilate right before you go out or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use this on my underarms. exfoliate first-best advice ever. &amp; make sure the area is dry before you start working on it. i found it&#x27;s helpful to move the epilator in a circular pattern instead of just straight lines back &amp; forth-grips some of the stubborn hairs better. follow up with some neosporin; this helps relieve irritation and my waxer says it can help prevent ingrowns. i honestly can&#x27;t see myself using this anywere other than my underarms. there&#x27;s no way i&#x27;m putting it near my bikini line; waxing is quicker! since i only use it for one area, this lower priced model is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> I originally was using a Tweezie and this works so much better for upper lip and chin area.  Have not yet tried it on my legs.  There is pulling, yes, but it beats waxing which I hate.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my legs and it didn&#x27;t really work.  Could be my hair is too coarse.  I spent hours trying to get all the hair and I still had stubble.  A week later I noticed I even have ingrown hairs! This may work for other people, but not for me.  I am in the process of returning the item.  Have a request in to the seller, but have yet to hear from the company.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this I had already purchased the emjoi slim which I love, and still do! I own two at the moment. But this seems to eat up batteries really fast because there is a noticable power reduction from the first time I used it to the second. For me it doesn&#x27;t seem to grab the hairs as good as the emjoi slim. I really wanted this to be able to do more in a shorter amount of time but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case because I repeatedly have to go over sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for larger areas such as your legs, only or places where being completely free of hair isnt the biggest concern. I just had higher hopes because my emjoi slim is soooooo good</li>
            <li> It has no power to it. It must be refurbished model. I tried one of my girlfriends that worked so well and this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying this product, and when I got it I figured I&#x27;d have to go over my legs a few times before I got all of the hair removed. But I didn&#x27;t realize exactly how many times I&#x27;d have to go over the area that I wanted removed. I&#x27;ve had to go over areas around 5 or 6 times to get all of the hair off, and even then small hairs show up here or there. Perhaps this is because I have thin hair, but it still has not helped me all that much. I gave it two stars just because it may be my hair&#x27;s fault for the problem.</li>
            <li> It works at first and you will love how it&#x27;s ripping the hair out of the root but in the long run it will ruin your skin im serious read my story- After 3 months of using it I am not kidding you I had hundreds of ingrown hairs on my, legs, arms, and some on my face. So I stopped after 3 months right well it&#x27;s been a year and the bumps are still there and some are infected I mean hundreds of these ingrown hairs. I am Caucasian and got discoloration, small white spots you can barley see them but if I get any color from the sun or tan I look like a Lepard. I&#x27;m 28 and do not get acne but as of now I look like I have it severely everywhere and it won&#x27;t go away I&#x27;ve also used countless exfoliators, it&#x27;s very frustrating. So everyone please warn your friends and family not to use these especially an epulator. It is not worth it my skin sucks now and I feel gross.  I have read and heard very similar stories from lots of women and men so consider this a warning if you care about your skin being health don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> Not quit but working on it. I think having a version that plugs in would be better. The batteries are drained too quickly.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive,I always used shave my legs and next day started itching like crazy.I went to a beauty supply store and bought me one epiroll and tried.It hurt a lot! But when I got this one,what a different! It doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad and I used in my arms too.The only complain is that should come with the power cord,it was ok with me because I&#x27;m using the one from the other epiroll.But definitely,BUY this produt!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I have a higher tolerance of pain, but I felt none at all..I would call it more of an annoying sensation at times, but after a few minutes I actually liked knowing that it was working!&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t grab every single hair, but neither does waxing.. over time I expect it to thin out my hair and I&#x27;m excited for those results.&lt;br /&gt;It works really well.. didn&#x27;t make my skin irradiated afterwards..even on the sensitive spots. Seems like a great product I hope it lasts me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I would 100% recommend this.</li>
            <li> Get those stubborn hard hairs that u can&#x27;t get with the tweezers. Glides smoothly over skin pulling hair from its roots.</li>
            <li> I removed my underarm hair and it didn&#x27;t come back for almost 2 weeks! Love this. But the battery died fast!</li>
            <li> Ordered Saturday and got it by Wednesday!  First time epilating ever.....did my legs arms and underarms.... legs didn&#x27;t hurt ... arms didn&#x27;t hurt.... just like little pinches... but totally bareable.. underarms.... did hurt! !!! On a scale from 1 to 10 a Def 10!! But was able to get through it.... apila to dis it&#x27;s job 100% totally recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this! I wish I would have bought one sooner! It does hurt a bit on certain areas, surprisingly the legs hurt worse than the &#x27;ahem&#x27; pits. Easy to clean, and it helps to have fresh batteries, as they die it gets sluggish and therefore more painful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s practical when travelling since you dont need to carry the adapter or worry about the different voltage when you&#x27;re overseas. Being said, it does the job but tends to break the hair instead of pulling it from the root. Overall, I&#x27;m glad I got it .</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed &amp; have since replaced this with a laser one which is clearly better, but for the money, not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my first time using an epilator so it&#x27;s not a surprise that there is some pain when using the product. The feel of the product is nice and well built. The batteries aren&#x27;t included, however I did realize that it takes a bit of battery power so use rechargeable batteries if you can. If you move the hair remover in a circle motion, it tends to remove more hair and it gets the job done relatively quick. I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the purchase :)Gave it four stars instead of five because of the missing batteries.</li>
            <li> I apparently have really fine hair so it took forever to de-hair half of one leg. It did work and take the hair out....I guess that is what it is meant for</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good&lt;br /&gt;منتج رائع عمله على البطاريات هو افضل ميزه فيه&lt;br /&gt;لاتسبب الم كثير عند الاستخدام&lt;br /&gt;الشكل رائع جدا جدا&lt;br /&gt;الحجم صغير</li>
            <li> It does not remove all the hairs 😥</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem maintaining the constant hair growth on my upper lip, not that it is overwhelming but it is surely embarassing. I had to CONSTANTLY thread my upper lip for at least 10 minutes to make sure I got every single little hair out of sight, it then became tedious since I had to maintain it every two days or so. On my first try it only took me well within 5 minutes to get rid of my embarassing issue with Emjoi Divine, it can be painful at first but that will start to decrease overtime, nonetheless if you are pain tolerant like me you will feel a slight pinch at first then its smooth sailing from there. Highly recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li> I have not used this in months. I used it on my underarms a few times, and each time I did, it was so rough, that it burned my underarms. NOT a good buy!</li>
            <li> It did the job alright but it stopped working after only three times of use, and my hairs are very fine and not that many.</li>
            <li> I like how the Emjoi Divine Hair Remover plucks out all of my facial hairs.  It hurt when I first started, but now that I&#x27;m used to it, it almost feels good.  And, I love PINK!</li>
            <li> That was worst than waxing. it felt like the hairs were being pulled out one at a time</li>
            <li> i would love to be able to return this item that i purchased from amazon.com.  i do not like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;this is the second hair remover i have purchased from amazon.  the last on was worthless---i threw it away.  i bought this  one because the advertising made sound good.  alas, it is not.  it has clutched my skin and hurt me.  i wish i could return it, but it is probably too late and i don&#x27;t know if i could find the paper work with which to return it.  i am reviewing emjoi  divine hair remover.  it is NOT divine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dale turmell</li>
            <li> After my ordered AP-9L was DOA and returned for refund, I read more reviews and ordered the Emjoi Divine AP-17B. It is a more substantial unit than the AP-9L as it has 36 tweezer discs and many features such as massaging fingers. I&#x27;ve never used an epilator and was pleased to find reviews stating user satisfaction. Today, it was time to do the job and before running out the door, I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m use to tweezing my chin and found this to be pain free... only delivered a tingling sensation. It was nice to not have to search to destroy and wonder what was missed as you have to do when manually tweezing. While using it, I found that it had cut rather than pull out some hairs, but I kept at it and in a short time all were removed. The chin feels a bit raw and there remains a bit of fine stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I&#x27;ll take the time to read and follow the instructions, such as directing the unit as to how the hair grows and using the correct speed, low for fine and high for course. The pictorial instructions address how to do legs and underarms ~ in sweeping motions in the direction of hair growth. But regarding face hair, it only mentions to remove an individual hair from the chin or upper lip... I don&#x27;t quite understand how to apply a large head to an individual hair, but instructions are clear to not use it elsewhere on the face or as an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The warranty is one year. Batteries are easy to change, the battery cover slips off for inserting the 3 AAA. The box states battery-operated, there is no mention of an available adapter in the instructions, but there is an input at the bottom of the unit. The instructions are only in English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 1 month: I&#x27;ve now used it 3 times and remain pleased. After the 1st use, there was no more irritation. It is so convenient to give this a run when needed and the chin stays clean for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have always been an avid brazilian waxer.  It was gettng expensive even though I do the waxing myself and I was looking for an alternate way to get rid of hair in that area.  At first, I was skeptical of this particular epilator to work, but it works wonders.  I do have to go over certain areas several times and even had to take a few breaks because it was getting painful. With some more getting use to, I&#x27;m sure it will be a lot less painful, like I had to do when I first waxed.  Overall, it took about 20 minutes to do a brazilian with this epilator for me. It did a really clean job, I did not have to do any plucking like I would with waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using the epilator at first on my upper lips. Instead of pulling the hair as a whole, it would break the hair. I would imagine this product to work on men facial hair.  It&#x27;s not recommended for fine hairs at all.</li>
            <li> this is not the first one i have purchased, so i know they do not do 100% of a job</li>
            <li> i mean it gets the job done, but i don&#x27;t like how it is battery operated ! to each its own tho. Nothing to rave over</li>
            <li> This thing hurts like crazy.  I guess if you&#x27;ve had waxing done before you might not mind it, but I simply couldn&#x27;t stand it.  I tried using it on my bikini area and not only did it hurt a lot, it didn&#x27;t even pluck most of the hairs.  It pulls on them pretty hard, but rarely pulls them out.  Left a lot of ugly red bumps too.  I also tried it on my legs which was uncomfortable but not that bad.  The problem was that it still didn&#x27;t pluck hardly any hairs even after I let the hair grow out and went over the same spot MANY times.  Unless you&#x27;re used to epilating/waxing or you seriously have a VERY high pain tolerance, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was really great.. It does the job for hair removal and the hair grows back slowly. Good product to me</li>
            <li> It works pretty well on the hairs that I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;Trying to remove. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it on your legs or armpits but it gets rid of fine hair very well.</li>
            <li> I dont understand why nobody ever mention to me about this epilator. I found this accidently and loveeee it soooo much. It is much better than using tweezer/shaving/waxing. It is like shaving but better cos its pulling it out and it will save you time.The product works well eventough there are a bunch of other brands and more pricey.  I use it for my armpit hair.&lt;br /&gt;The pain is bearable, I am used to it so for me it is not a big deal. Gals, you gotta have one!</li>
            <li> Ok, so you&#x27;re pulling each individual hair out by the root. Of course this is going to hurt. So if you have a low threshold for pain, this is not the product for you. I have a high pain tolerance and still had trouble making it through my first few sessions with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely takes a few sets of batteries to REALLY learn the best way to use this thing, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;ll become your best friend. I hated this at first because I spent HOURS trying to pluck all my hairs. Still couldn&#x27;t get them all, and by the time I went back for a second try a few days later, new hairs had started sprouting again! (Yes, I&#x27;m a hairy Italian!) I kept getting discouraged that I couldn&#x27;t get myself completely hairless, and had spent so much time. But that ended up being because it was still my first time. Once all those hairs are finally plucked away (may take a good month or so of every few days of use), you will be much happier with the results. The hair will start to grow back slower, and you&#x27;ll feel much more confident in your new smooth skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been plucking my eyebrows for about 5 years now, and just recently started growing them back out to be a little fuller again. Well, it&#x27;s been almost 3 months now and all the hairs STILL haven&#x27;t grown back in! I&#x27;m guessing the same thing will happen with years of using this product on your arms, legs, etc. Ten years from now, you&#x27;ll barely need to use this thing anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bikini area was surprisingly painless, with the stomach and underarms being one of the worst things I&#x27;ve ever had to experience. I eventually gave up in these areas completely. Still, everything else came out just wonderfully. I&#x27;ve got ghost-white skin and jet black hair, so shaving always left the root of my hair visible through my skin. I would just finish shaving and still have to be self conscious about all the black dots all over my legs. Even fresh out the shower, I still looked like I had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow (and my razor gets the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever seen). This epilator solved that problem completely. I was amazed. Such a great product for such a cheap price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the seller was fantastic! My original machine was defective and died after the first two uses, and they immediately sent me a replacement! I hadn&#x27;t even been able to get on the computer to check their response to me and it was at my door! Excellent service, I very highly recommend both the product and the seller! Thanks again, guys!</li>
            <li> Does the job but it really hurts and leaves my skin a little irritated. I thought the multi blades would be good but I think I like the more simple models better. Also the size is pretty big and you can not get to the small areas of your face easily.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator which means i dont have much to compare it to but i did my research and for the great reviews and an affordable price i found this! My hair is very spanish coarse frizzy (type 3b-c) curls so my hairs are tough! It takes out MOST not every single one of your hairs but i believe that after a long while of pulling out those hairs the less hairs there will be. IT&#x27;s still pretty smooth to touch once done. It does take a long time to grow it out and then sit there for a while getting all the hairs. So what I do is wax then use this for hairs that the wax didn&#x27;t get. For my arm pits i only use this epilator and its awesome.</li>
            <li> This was a battery operated hair remover (first mistake, always get one with a power cord for consistent/constant power) and after opening the package, I immediately put in fresh batteries and turned it on.  It worked for approximately 5 seconds.  I tried new batteries and no luck.</li>
            <li> It hurts!  It doesn&#x27;t rid the hair as advertised.  I still shave as often as before.  Thought it would remove hair from root.</li>
