            <li> Good product. Seems a little high priced for a smaller bottle. Can not be used as body wash only shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> love this for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair:) it makes her hair soo soft and shiny:)</li>
            <li> Smells so yum I want to pour it into a drink. Obviously dont. But yeah its that yum.</li>
            <li> I love the smell! It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair feeling nice and smooth and she doesn&#x27;t give me a hard time about putting this one in her hair! It rinses out easily and no knots is the best part!</li>
            <li> i have been using this for years on my son but I could only find it at walmart. now it&#x27;s right hear on my amazon prime! i don&#x27;t even have to leave home.  the product smells very good and is very gentle and cleans very well.  no snarles and leaves his hair soft (except in the morning when we wake up but you can&#x27;t have everything!). best part it&#x27;s super inexpensive!</li>
            <li> using for years, after graduating from baby shampoo</li>
            <li> My daughter loved the princess on the outside and the shape of the bottle made it easy for her to use</li>
            <li> My 2 year old has naturally curly hair &amp; all the shampoos would dry her hair out leaving it frizzy a mess. This leaves her hair nice &amp; silky soft, and she has natural bounce in her curls!!!!! It also has a little detangler so her hair stays nice &amp; mess free all day long.  She loves the sweet smell &amp; pretty Belle on the bottle,Thank you L&#x27;Oreal!!!</li>
            <li> Little girls love this....smells nice and has a princess on it for the win!</li>
            <li> This product is part of our Subscribe and Save!  We love the 15% discount.  Great shampoo for kids.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it, but that&#x27;s because Belle is on the bottle. It performs just fine as a shampoo. I just think the scent is a little overwhelming. That is sort of the trend with all kids&#x27; shampoos (overwhelming fruit combinations for scents).</li>
            <li> Bought this for our 4 year old. Smells good but stings her eyes and makes her cry. Not gentle.</li>
            <li> I use this for myself and for my 1 year old grandson. Doesn&#x27;t strip or over dry my color processed hair (and I can wash-n-go), and it doesn&#x27;t burn his eyes when shampooing him is like shampooing a whirling dervish! The smell is light and fresh, too.</li>
            <li> My daughter hates washing her hair. Since purchasing this shampoo we no longer have the tantrums because she loves her princess shampoo. And I like how soft and clean her hairs comes out compared to Sauve.</li>
            <li> Not ONLY for Kids!&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes we all need to feel our inner Princess! I admit it, I&#x27;m a grownup, I have almost grownup kids, AND I use BABY shampoos. If you shampoo once a day, you are not going to need industrial strength stuff...just a nice gentle lather. I remember how soft my kids hair was when I used baby shampoo, so started using it myself..Viola...soft clean wonderfully smelling hair. And this stuff is the bees knees! It smells wonderfully clean and citrusy, rinses our like a charm, and leaves my hair so soft, that I no longer need a conditioner. AND the prices at under $2.00 is wonderfully charming too. Forget the $15.00 bottle of &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; shampoo, be a princess for $2.00!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and really likes the scent. She has relatively fine hair and needs a good conditioner to keep it tangle free and this one does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> smells great and my kids love it!  would buy this again</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of the Loreal Kid shampoos, but this is our favorite scent! Just wish I could get my son to use it. Princess on the front keeps him from wanting to touch it! But we still love!</li>
