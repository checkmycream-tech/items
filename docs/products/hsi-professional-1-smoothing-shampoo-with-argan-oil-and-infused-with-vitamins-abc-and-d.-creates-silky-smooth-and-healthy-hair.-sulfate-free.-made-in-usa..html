            <li>An incredible clean (even on my 13 year old son), and soft result.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft and fizz free!!</li>
            <li>I promptly ordered  the shampoo, conditioner, and a full sized leave in treatment.  </li>
            <li>Paired it with the conditioner for nice soft hair.</li>
            <li>well that is true its not going to create a ton of suds</li>
            <li>My hair is soft since the first use, and smell really good.</li>
            <li>In addition (and most importantly), my hair has stopped falling out and new hair has started growing in.  </li>
            <li>I originally started using the leave in conditioner with argan oil and loved it so much I had to try the regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is my new favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li>These products will sooth and make hair so much more manageable and soft!</li>
            <li>My best description is that it left my hair feeling stripped and dry, even after conditioning.</li>
            <li>I have used many professional shampoos and products.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite ever.</li>
            <li>Left it nice and shiny</li>

            <li>She swears it is the best product made for her long, course black hair.</li>
            <li>Both brands lather well, clean and condition fabulously and smell terrific.  </li>
            <li>I love this entire product line.  </li>
            <li>I still need a good conditioner after using it (using Redken Heavy Cream).  </li>
            <li>It works great when applied on either wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Works really well and smells very well.</li>
            <li>Works well with my straight hair, but It does contain silicone.</li>
            <li>This conditioner (with the shampoo) makes my hair so shiny and stick straight</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I do really like the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>(so I use the Agadir on days I don&#x27;t want/need as much conditioning).  </li>
            <li>She is all about cruelty free products so this was a double brownie pointer.</li>
            <li>I read reviews that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well...</li>
            <li>I will use this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>

            <li>She tells me everyday how much she loves this shampoo and conditioner and how her hair has never been so healthy.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that the pump doesn&#x27;t work right (it sticks and takes forever to get the proper amount of shampoo needed to clean my hair).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this shampoo, as well as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This shampoo is fabulous for SHORT hair (not long hair), which is why I passed it on to my boys to use.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend them to anyone who has dry, damaged, or simply frizz prone, unruly hair.</li>
            <li>This product is also very economical,  in that you need a very small amount, as well as a very reasonable price point.</li>
            <li>The pump on this isn&#x27;t strong enough to actually pull out product, so I ended up transferring what was left to another used Aveda shampoo bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have very very long hair and this shampoo clean them very properly.</li>
            <li>HSI PROFESSIONAL #1 SMOOTHING CONDITIONER WITH ARGAN OIL AND INFUSED WITH</li>

            <li>My hair is much thicker (like it used to be when I was younger).  </li>
            <li>I was surprised</li>
            <li>This shampoo also doesn&#x27;t make much l lather, though that might be due to the hard water in my city, since when I took some on vacation I did get more suds.</li>
            <li>(I was ready to cut off several inches to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my dry damaged hair).  </li>

            <li> I like both the Agadir (for both long and short hair) and HSI (for short hair only) brands Argan Oil shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of the argan oil leave in treatment with my hsi flat iron.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any differences</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to find sulfate free shampoo in local stores.</li>
            <li> That long.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and has been straightened.  </li>
            <li> I like the HSI oil (which is not 100% argan oil) because it can also be applied on dry hair without leaving it greasy-looking.  </li>
            <li> When I apply 100% argan oil on my hair when it&#x27;s dry, it leaves my hair greasy/oily looking.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and brittle from experimenting with hair color over the summer</li>
            <li> It still isn&#x27;t as luxurious as I expected.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> plus it is infused with argan oil and other vitamins.</li>
            <li> Will also check out their other items.</li>
            <li> I love that it is not a heavily scented shampoo since I have terrible allergies, others may miss a scent.</li>
            <li> After a week she went back to her old shampoo because this left her hair impossible to brush or comb.  </li>
            <li> I use less than 2 drops (on hair slightly longer than shoulder length).  </li>
            <li> My hair went from feeling like hay to silky soft - its not perfect yet -</li>
            <li> so I used it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> The pump is fairly worthless, though when I requested a replacement it was quickly shipped, though no better.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the pump is just a fluke with the bottle or not.</li>
            <li> I falsely believed that those cheaper (and even expensive) shampoos with sulfates were not negatively affecting my hair.  </li>
            <li> well because of how thick the shampoo is.</li>
            <li> and don&#x27;t have a problem with the pump on HSI Conditioner (which is also thick).  </li>
            <li> She has EXTREMELY thick course hair</li>
            <li> No more frizzy hair either!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very thick.  </li>
            <li> It is a very thick and moisturizing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair has always been very prone to awful tangling.</li>
            <li> Even as an adult I&#x27;ve hated brushing my hair because of it.</li>
            <li> I think it is impossible to have a pump work</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the pump is terrible.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just received my product along with conditioner and heat spray. Works really well and smells very well. When I got it, the pump was unlocked already so the bottle felt greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo; My hair has never been this silky just after one use of this shampoo. It remains silky even after sweating from daily workouts. I will use this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> The bottle came damaged, so product all over the packaging.  The pump on this isn&#x27;t strong enough to actually pull out product, so I ended up transferring what was left to another used Aveda shampoo bottle.  It still isn&#x27;t as luxurious as I expected.  I used to use Morroccan Oil Shampoo and was hoping this would be similar.  I like it OK, but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft since the first use, and smell really good.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and leaves my hair looking great - not flat like most straightening shampoos. My only gripe is that the pump doesn&#x27;t work right (it sticks and takes forever to get the proper amount of shampoo needed to clean my hair). I am not sure if the pump is just a fluke with the bottle or not. Great product though, and I will repurchase when I run out.</li>
            <li> I bought this to maintain my color and keratin treatment. I find it difficult to find sulfate free shampoo in local stores. I love that it is not a heavily scented shampoo since I have terrible allergies, others may miss a scent. I also love how this makes my hair feel like silk. I can also go 2 to 3 days between washings. The pump is fairly worthless, though when I requested a replacement it was quickly shipped, though no better. I think it is impossible to have a pump work well because of how thick the shampoo is. I manage with the pump it just takes multiple hits to get enough. This shampoo also doesn&#x27;t make much l lather, though that might be due to the hard water in my city, since when I took some on vacation I did get more suds. Over all I love this shampoo and will continue using it as long as it remains available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Leaves my hair feeling soft and fizz free!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!! My hair has never felt better....best buy by far!!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the argan oil leave in treatment with my hsi flat iron. I was so thrilled with it I promptly ordered  the shampoo, conditioner, and a full sized leave in treatment.  I have used many professional shampoos and products. This is by far my favorite ever. After about two weeks of use my hair is incredibly healthy and shiny. This product is also very economical,  in that you need a very small amount, as well as a very reasonable price point. I have NO TANGLES after washing. My hair has always been very prone to awful tangling. Even as an adult I&#x27;ve hated brushing my hair because of it. Not anymore. An incredible clean (even on my 13 year old son), and soft result. No more frizzy hair either!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of HSI products, I use there shampoo and conditioner on daily basis.This shampoo is sulfate free, which was my main criteria for selecting this shampoo plus it is infused with argan oil and other vitamins.I have very very long hair and this shampoo clean them very properly.I am very happy with my choice.I got this for free as part of promotional sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Absolutely as good as higher-priced brands. Would definitely buy again. Will also check out their other items.</li>
            <li> Works well with my straight hair, but It does contain silicone.</li>
            <li> Great product - hair felt soft after use AND IT SMELLED FANTASTIC!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again for sure.</li>
            <li> I cannot get enough of this conditioner - I am a repeat purchaser. This conditioner (with the shampoo) makes my hair so shiny and stick straight (after I straighten it lightly) all day long and I love it. I will buy this forever and ever and ever. Yes. That long.</li>
            <li> Great for everyone in the family to use.  Not a overly flowery smell.  Seems to work well on both thick, fine, long and short hair.  Good for all around use.</li>
            <li> Works great! This product is amazing</li>
            <li> Left it nice and shiny</li>
            <li> I love this entire product line.  I hope they never stop making it!!!  My hair has never been so healthy and looked so good!  (I was ready to cut off several inches to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my dry damaged hair).  Boy, am I glad I gave this product line a try!  AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fabulous for SHORT hair (not long hair), which is why I passed it on to my boys to use.  It lathers up nicely (with at least 5 pumps), smells really nice (perfect for gals and guys) and moisturizes.  This shampoo is very thick.  Unfortunately, the pump is terrible.  It really doesn&#x27;t work.  In addition, for some reason, on longer hair this shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well and tangles.  It is great on shorter hair (like my boys have).  My favorite shampoo for longer hair is [[ASIN:B004D8T7F4 Agadir Argan Oil Daily Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner Liter Combo Set 33.8 oz]].  NOTE: I only paid $21 for the 32oz size in Dec 2014.    I do really like the [[ASIN:B00LMIJNUW HSI PROFESSIONAL #1 SMOOTHING CONDITIONER WITH ARGAN OIL AND INFUSED WITH VITAMINS A,B,C &amp; D. CREATES SILKY, SMOOTH AND HEALTHY HAIR. SULFATE FREE. MADE IN USA. (8oz)]] and don&#x27;t have a problem with the pump on HSI Conditioner (which is also thick).  It is my new favorite conditioner.  I love the smell and I love the way it makes my hair feel.  It is a very thick and moisturizing conditioner.  I use the HSI conditioner, along with the shampoo from [[ASIN:B004D8T7F4 Agadir Argan Oil Daily Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner Liter Combo Set 33.8 oz]].  I like both the Agadir (for both long and short hair) and HSI (for short hair only) brands Argan Oil shampoos and conditioners.  The Agadir conditioner is not as thick/heavy as the HSI brand (so I use the Agadir on days I don&#x27;t want/need as much conditioning).  Both brands lather well, clean and condition fabulously and smell terrific.  They are both perfect for guys and gals.    I will add that since I have gone completely sulfate-free on my shampoos (about 4 months now ... alternating between HSI and Agadir), my hair is in MUCH better condition.  In addition (and most importantly), my hair has stopped falling out and new hair has started growing in.  My hair is much thicker (like it used to be when I was younger).  I falsely believed that those cheaper (and even expensive) shampoos with sulfates were not negatively affecting my hair.  Not until I started noticing my hair thinning and started looking for causes did I realize how sulfates (which I had used my entire life) were affecting my hair.  I will never use a shampoo with sulfates again.  Highly recommend this shampoo, as well as [[ASIN:B004D8T7F4 Agadir Argan Oil Daily Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner Liter Combo Set 33.8 oz]].    I also like [[ASIN:B007Q0WW0S HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil LEAVE IN CONDITIONER flat iron thermal protector leaves hair silky and shiny 4oz BOTTLE]].8 oz]].  It works great when applied on either wet or dry hair.  A little goes a long way.  I use less than 2 drops (on hair slightly longer than shoulder length).  It smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.  It also calms the frizzies and fly aways.  I like the HSI oil (which is not 100% argan oil) because it can also be applied on dry hair without leaving it greasy-looking.  When I apply 100% argan oil on my hair when it&#x27;s dry, it leaves my hair greasy/oily looking.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I also have the conditioner. My hair loves it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  I still need a good conditioner after using it (using Redken Heavy Cream).  I did also try the oil - which I like.  My hair is long and has been straightened.  don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy it again yet (I keep going back to Redken - it&#x27;s a good, reliable, standby)</li>
            <li> Great product; wish I had tried it before.  A tad goes a long ways and the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Your hair will love the feeling and quality. Excellent Product!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any differences but it&#x27;s a nice smelling shampoo. Paired it with the conditioner for nice soft hair.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo friends and family notices the change the very same day I satrted using it... I am very happy  with this great shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for X-mas. She is all about cruelty free products so this was a double brownie pointer. She tells me everyday how much she loves this shampoo and conditioner and how her hair has never been so healthy. She has EXTREMELY thick course hair and she said that this shampoo is helping to shave time off of her straightening and curling by helping her hair feel thinner and more manageable. I am not going to lie I had to see what all the hype is about. I read reviews that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well... well that is true its not going to create a ton of suds however I had no issue massaging it into my hair and it seems to lather a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; amount. The product makes my wifes hair smell like she just came from the salon. (love it!)</li>
            <li> I originally started using the leave in conditioner with argan oil and loved it so much I had to try the regular shampoo and conditioner. My hair was dry and brittle from experimenting with hair color over the summer and I needed something that could combat it. The shampoo is incredible, same as both the regular and leave in conditioners! My hair went from feeling like hay to silky soft - its not perfect yet - but this has helped my hair heal enough while I grow it out. I strongly recommend them to anyone who has dry, damaged, or simply frizz prone, unruly hair. These products will sooth and make hair so much more manageable and soft!</li>
            <li> I have been ordering HSI leave in oil for my wife for a couple years. She swears it is the best product made for her long, course black hair. Last time I ordered her oil I also got this shampoo.  After a week she went back to her old shampoo because this left her hair impossible to brush or comb.  I was surprised so I used it for a few days.  My best description is that it left my hair feeling stripped and dry, even after conditioning.</li>
