            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Love the handles males for ease when creating nail art.  </li>

            <li>but they are different even if not by much.</li>
            <li>the smallest dot was duplicated 4 times, so really there were only 6 different</li>
            <li>The quality is mediocre, but once again is good enough for the price!</li>

            <li> After very long wait and disappointment with another order, I was very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> I got this b/c I like to do everything myself that includes my nails and my little 7 y/oprincess nails (mainly her nails)</li>
            <li> I had a slight issue with one tip falling out of the body but that was easily fixed with a dot of epoxy.</li>
            <li> I expected to have completely different sizes of dots, but some were the same/very similar.</li>
            <li> I know you can use toothpicks and other DYI tools to get similar designs on your nails, but these are just easier to use and handle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ordered from Fash Limited-</li>

            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting them to come in a little bag!</li>
            <li> so when i heard of dotting tools i had to have them, unfortunately not many stores have heard of them.</li>
            <li> They have some very small ones</li>

            <li> nice, and came fast considering coming from international.</li>
            <li> Love them. I use the often in my salon. Vey happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> These are great dotting tools. I know you can use toothpicks and other DYI tools to get similar designs on your nails, but these are just easier to use and handle. I do my own nails all the time and use dotting tools a lot. Can&#x27;t get better than these, and for the price, even better.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for Christmas for my twenty something daughters. They loved them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 different pens as describe-sturdy-easy to use-unlimited looks possible for the creative mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered from Fash Limited- I was pleased with speed of delivery and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> I got this b/c I like to do everything myself that includes my nails and my little 7 y/oprincess nails (mainly her nails) I do all kind of designs on her she is always the talk of the school even the Teaches had comment on the designs i do on her nails. I love the fact that there are different sizes and it was not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Works very well.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and work great</li>
            <li> Awesome, enjoying using this</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to put different designs on her nails and this is such a nice easy way to help her !</li>
            <li> Love that there&#x27;s different sizes, love this product....make nail art a lot easier.</li>
            <li> These work great. They have some very small ones so I can even use them on my 4 year old daughters small finger nails which delighted her so much. They have very big ones so you can make bigger dots of those kind and all sizes in between. Great buy for the price. Have used them a lot.</li>
            <li> Was perfect on delivery time. Tried it the first day I got them and it works great. No problems with it at all and it was made to last too.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased these dotting pen. Trying to make nice dots with toothpicks or hairpins just wasn&#x27;t working for me. These dotters made it so much easier to get the nice circles that I was looking for. Quality is very good and I love the color too!</li>
            <li> This is a nail artist best friend.. I love them and it&#x27;s my fave color :)</li>
            <li> These work as intended however like many reviewers before me have stated a lot of the ends are the same size. So in reality you are only getting like 4 or 5 different sizes.</li>
            <li> Arrived three weeks early. I love them!</li>
            <li> I got the product as it&#x27;s shown works great, and they look very nice. The customer service was extremely helpful, and kind I give my full recommendation.</li>
            <li> Only 3 different sizes. You get what you pay for I suppose.</li>
            <li> After very long wait and disappointment with another order, I was very pleased with this one. They look very pretty and seem to have variety of dot sizes. Can&#x27;t wait to try them out!</li>
            <li> Works like they should if only I could do it like at the salon. Practice makes perfect hopefully.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to receive but I like the tools and price was right.</li>
            <li> Came on time, good product. Like the different sizes.</li>
            <li> Mine came in blue. They also shipped really fast. I really love this product, all sizes were there and they&#x27;re really good quality. I would recommend these nail art dotting tools</li>
            <li> Received exactly what I expected to get and right on time!</li>
            <li> Useful. Comfortable in hand. Nice color ;)</li>
            <li> So much fun and much cheaper than paying extra at the salon! Pleased with product and price.</li>
            <li> the smallest dot was duplicated 4 times, so really there were only 6 different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools were cute, and if you dont really need the last 3 smallest sizes then this set will be suitable.</li>
            <li> I am really loving these dotting tools they have a go weight to them and 10 different size dots. They make perfect dots they arrived in two weeks I couldn&#x27;t beat the prize just so happy with them.</li>
            <li> Better quality than I expected. Much better than the last set I bought from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> i love doing my nails so when i heard of dotting tools i had to have them, unfortunately not many stores have heard of them. let me start by saying that they are great. they are exactly like the picture. they did take a while to get here but it was a surprise that was well worth the wait. i tell everyone about them.</li>
            <li> These are an essential to those who do their own nails. So many creations to try now~</li>
            <li> Product was what I expected professional customer service.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my new dotting tools! They came about a week before it was expected to arrive-- which is totally awesome! They came in a handy case and are exactly as I was expecting!</li>
            <li> Love this dotting tool set the picture is pink but my dotting tools look exactly like the picture but its blue. Also incase you didn&#x27;t know the some sizes repeat. Came faster than I expected!</li>
            <li> Took awhile to recv. thanx</li>
            <li> I dont like it. 3 of them were the same size and 2 of the others were the same too. The largest one was like the size of a ball pen.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re dotting tools there isn&#x27;t much to say about thme they&#x27;re gonna take a while to get to you but I did receive them earlier than the date time frame they gave me there are lots a different sizes so it&#x27;d good haven&#x27;t used them yet but it&#x27;s ok they seem good</li>
            <li> Love them thank you my ten year old daugther use them already</li>
            <li> These are really good. One end on the pens are all the same size. However, it has a very small tip that is perfect for doing polka dots on my 2 year old little girl and the larger tip is great for making flowers.</li>
            <li> This product came exactly as described. It also was shipped immediately and was here before the expected delivery date. I have had so much fun using the tools to make nail art designs. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these and the fast service.</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my daughter and she just loves them. She loves to paint her nails and decorate them with pretty designs. They look fancy with the colorful swirls on the handles. These dotting pens work great and are easy to use. If you have never used them, it takes a little practice and some patience but it pays off. There are 10 different tip styles since each pen has 2. I will likely order several more next time so I have some for little gifts or party favors.</li>
            <li> the tools are of good quality! its like having a nail salon at home! lots of fun! I use them to make flowers and to apply Rhinestones.</li>
            <li> The dotting tools were exactly what I was expecting and needed. The acrylic body is lightweight so the tool is easy to use and manuveur. I had a slight issue with one tip falling out of the body but that was easily fixed with a dot of epoxy. I am very pleased with these.</li>
            <li> perfect and cheap set..these are very sturdy and work so well</li>
            <li> These dotting tools work really well and the price was good i went to a salon to get other ones but they were more then here if you like to make designs on your nails these are really nice and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The set arrived with only 4, instead of 5 dotting pens. The 4 pens that we did receive were all the same size on one end, so instead of getting 10 different sizes as described, we only got 4. We returned promptly for a full refund. Thank goodness the order was fulfilled by good &#x27;ole dependable and trustworthy Amazon! Wouldn&#x27;t shop any other way!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t suppose to come til JUNE 17th @ the was earliest and I got it may 26th. Was so happy it came early!  Very good quality so idk why everyone&#x27;s complaining. I love them &amp; would deff recommend.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these pens!!  For minimal cost, we are able to do a design on our nails.  Going to the nail salon is $10 a pop for toes and fingernails.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Great for doing nail designs</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product to use for decorating your nails. It comes in many different sizes to choose from and the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Came in ealier than expected and I&#x27;ve been using them ever since! Work wonderfully</li>
            <li> Item arrived almost immediately and looks to be exactly what my Grand-daughter is looking for.  It&#x27;s a gift and I know she will love it.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying thank you, I found the product to be satisfactory all the way. The intent of the item purchased was to surprised my spouse, and let me tell you she was very surprised and she LOVED IT. She tried to find the item where we are currently station (South Korea), and let me tell you, that she couldn&#x27;t find id anywhere. So once again thank you I hope to continue conducting business with you.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, dotting pens are really just advanced toothpicks. But by the same analogy, cars are really just advanced shoes. The difference is that huge. The level of precision and control is exponentially better, and completely worth the price difference between a good set of dotters and a box of toothpicks.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for one of the foreign exchange students my sister in law is housing this year. She was stoked! Nail art is the big thing right now.</li>
            <li> It is a good, basic dotting set for reasonable price. I expected to have completely different sizes of dots, but some were the same/very similar. The packaging was cheap looking, but served its purpose. The quality is mediocre, but once again is good enough for the price! I was overall satisfied.</li>
            <li> Now my daughter&#x27;s can change their nail art as much as they want. Love them. A must for anyone with teenagers.</li>
            <li> These are great tools.  Love the handles males for ease when creating nail art.  Very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> They were cheap and arrived on time. I read a lot of reviews complaining that it was just duplicates of the same size but they are different even if not by much.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these! Wasn&#x27;t expecting them to come in a little bag!</li>
            <li> Got exactly as pictured and on time happy with my order</li>
            <li> The best nail art dotting pen. It gives me new style on my nails.</li>
            <li> These dotting pens do just what they&#x27;re suppose to do, I love them.</li>
            <li> Items are as pictured and received before expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> Item was just as described! Very fast shipping and delivery! Happy with my purchase! I used it at least two times and I have to say there is a big difference between using this and using toothpicks! ja! Very happy with the results!</li>
