            <li>I LOVE the masque.</li>
            <li>I will return to the masque as it works better on my hair.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite Keratase products.</li>
            <li>Makes it look really healthy too.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH the money!! :)</li>
            <li>but well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>This one seems to use more product and is not as rich.</li>
            <li>could not wait to smooth it through my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Kerastase products for about 10 years and all I can say is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for renewing the color and shine back to your hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I bought one for my friend to enjoy the experience, and she loves it also!</li>
            <li>I have been highlighting my hair for years and this is the only product I have found that truly makes my hair better!!</li>
            <li>Love this product, my hair feels so soft and healthy after using this masque.</li>
            <li>This made my hair feel so soft and amazing.</li>
            <li>I was looking for rich moisturization and this one wasn&#x27;t as good as other Kerastase product.</li>
            <li>I have pretty good hair but their products and especially this one</li>
            <li>my stylist highly recommended this product (even though he is a Tiki rep!!!).  </li>
            <li>Use sparingly and it will be worth every penny.</li>
            <li>the cost is worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is surprisingly light, not thick at all.</li>
            <li>My hair does not weight down, smells great and is super soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for those who are afraid of any residue, and it is outstanding as it does not strip my hair color.</li>
            <li>for general information: my hair is color treated to blend gray, shoulder length and fine to medium in texture.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I think the fact that it is so gentle contributes to it being a somewhat lighter conditioner.</li>
            <li>The price is ridiculously high!</li>
            <li>I love this product, but am suspicious/mystified that sometimes the product I receive is pink</li>
            <li>Any comments/feedback on what is the correct product color (if not both) would be appreciated.</li>
            <li>It does seem to soften and smooth more than a normal daily conditioner, but this is not for extremely damaged hair.</li>
            <li>The previous chromo riche conditioner was much better than this one.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found it cheaper here on amazon, at the salon it was 60 bucks for this little jar.</li>
            <li>It is becoming more difficult to find</li>
            <li>I found this product to live up to my high expectations.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I find it leaves my hair very soft, however, it does not tame all of the frizzies.</li>
            <li>makes my hair silky and soft though not too soft</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years with the shampoo for color hair and have never found any other product that brings new life to my hair.</li>

            <li> I mistakenly purchased this instead of &amp;#34;Chroma Riche&amp;#34;. Oh boy, it&#x27;s such a big difference! I was looking for rich moisturization and this one wasn&#x27;t as good as other Kerastase product. It&#x27;s still great quality though. Not as good as Chroma &amp;#34;Riche&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product is specifically made to help condition color treated hair. It is surprisingly light, not thick at all. It&#x27;s great for those who are afraid of any residue, and it is outstanding as it does not strip my hair color. I find it leaves my hair very soft, however, it does not tame all of the frizzies. I think the fact that it is so gentle contributes to it being a somewhat lighter conditioner. It does seem to soften and smooth more than a normal daily conditioner, but this is not for extremely damaged hair. Heavy duty hair masks take some of my hair dye with it; this one does not. I&#x27;m thankful for all the color preservation I can get.</li>
            <li> I bought this before and loved it, and this time the product has changed.  The color is pink, rather than white and it&#x27;s not as thick.  For $50 you&#x27;d think it would be wonderful, but it&#x27;s just Ok.</li>
            <li> The product is good to give some shine to your hair and that&#x27;s about it. At least, this has been my experience. I still have frizz and my hair still doesn&#x27;t have the body that Kerastase Products claim they give to the hair. The price is ridiculously high!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have it on reorder.  Perfect for hair that has been colored...I can&#x27;t live without this conditioner.  I love all the Kerastase products.  I haven&#x27;t found one thing I didn&#x27;t like.  Pricey for hair products, but well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I waited for this product with bated breath!&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered it after my male friend had commented that my hair looked dull.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has always received compliments but as I have aged it has definitely lost some of its bounce and luster.&lt;br /&gt;His comment sent me tearing through the internet looking for the best product out there.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product and waited impatiently for it to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;I could not wait to smooth it through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it arrived!  I immediately washed my hair (with a Kerastase product) and then used the Chroma Reflect Masque.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting miracles....others seemed to have found one with this product.&lt;br /&gt;For me it was just a watery conditioner that was no better or no worse than any other one I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the scent but would NEVER pay the price for this product again.&lt;br /&gt;Just for general information: my hair is color treated to blend gray, shoulder length and fine to medium in texture.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to everyone else who tries it; I wish you the best!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the BEST I have come across! It smells wonderful and makes my hair soft and healthy looking. I have been highlighting my hair for years and this is the only product I have found that truly makes my hair better!! Little pricy but WELL WORTH the money!! :)</li>
            <li> A good conditioner.  Nourishes hair and provides great control and shine without heaviness.  It is becoming more difficult to find</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for some time, that I would not trade for anything&lt;br /&gt;for me the best cream&lt;br /&gt;note the difference with few applications</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for quite a while and its been the best one I have used so far. My hair does not weight down, smells great and is super soft. I am half black and white so my hair is a mix of coarse and straight. I am glad I found it cheaper here on amazon, at the salon it was 60 bucks for this little jar.</li>
            <li> Seals the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> Quem pediu afirma que o produto é muito bom e de ótima qualidade. Além do que funciona perfeitamente. É um bom presente.</li>
            <li> There is no better product for your hair.  It creates ultra shine and body. It also keeps your hair healthy looking and feeling. The secret is to use only a dime amount after every shampoo. It is also very safe for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Expensive but makes your hair a smother softer texture and much more manageable.  Use sparingly and it will be worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I bought one for my friend to enjoy the experience, and she loves it also!</li>
            <li> I have tried other masque but continue to go back to this one. Kerastase is the best for your hair. i wont try any other product now</li>
            <li> The previous chromo riche conditioner was much better than this one. This one seems to use more product and is not as rich.</li>
            <li> I found this product to live up to my high expectations. I will buy it again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. I have been using this product for years with the shampoo for color hair and have never found any other product that brings new life to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kerastase products for about 10 years and all I can say is fabulous.  I have pretty good hair but their products and especially this one makes my hair silky and soft though not too soft (you hair people know what I mean).  I use hair color and my stylist highly recommended this product (even though he is a Tiki rep!!!).  the cost is worth it.  Totally</li>
            <li> I love this product, but am suspicious/mystified that sometimes the product I receive is pink and sometimes it is thick and white.  Both work, but I&#x27;m wondering if there is some product substitution going on.  Any comments/feedback on what is the correct product color (if not both) would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the masque. However, this time I received Chroma Reflect and didn&#x27;t realize it until I had opened the container to use it. I will return to the masque as it works better on my hair. Lesson learned - double check the shipment!</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel so soft and amazing. I have already used it twice and can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, my hair feels so soft and healthy after using this masque. One of my favorite Keratase products.</li>
            <li> This product is great for renewing the color and shine back to your hair. Makes it look really healthy too.</li>
