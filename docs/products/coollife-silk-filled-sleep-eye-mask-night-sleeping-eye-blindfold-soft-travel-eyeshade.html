            <li>Very Cheaply made!</li>
            <li>great for blocking out light to sleep in or taking a nap during the day</li>
            <li>I just have to be honest.</li>
            <li>But sunlight is always around and this mask cancels it out nicely.</li>
            <li>smell is very strong-</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, come with two head straps and they&#x27;re made out of a breathable material.</li>
            <li>the price was super cheap and the product we got was in great condition.  </li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lightweight, comfortable, effective light-blocking.</li>
            <li>However, the dye used in the production of these otherwise lovely sleep masks bleeds onto your face as you sleep.</li>
            <li>I love the sleep masks.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used it most nights for over 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I am glad it works.</li>
            <li>I have used it many times and I can sleep with it on.</li>
            <li>We havent gotten around to blocking out the light for sleeping yet, and nice window treatments can get expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It blocks light out nicely.</li>
            <li>I tried to wear it, but it was overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still much better than not having one though.</li>
            <li>It mostly washes out but not completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I love to read in bed</li>
            <li>one of the straps broke, too), but I&#x27;m still glad I have this.</li>
            <li>okay -</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found that a satin more breathable fabric works better for me.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m satisfied because the mask is</li>
            <li>Probably would be better when the weather is colder.</li>
            <li>i guess, better than nothing..</li>
            <li>For the cost, what more could you expect.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering a better mask.</li>
            <li>This mask was perfect for my husband who works 2nd shift and needs to sleep in after the sun is up in the morning.</li>
            <li>more than 5 to 8 days.it did however arrive in about two weeks.i</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m ok with it .i&#x27;m</li>
            <li>It was good at first, but the rubber band is too tight.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>For the price it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>these masks are light, very comfortable, and they are washable too.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and does block the light, but the fabric is very cheap and smells strongly of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Sufficient at blocking most of the light.</li>
            <li>get a better fit.</li>
            <li>however it is exactly what I wanted and the price was the best of all offers.</li>
            <li>I love their light weight and fine elastic.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li>But, here I am shopping for a more comfortable fit.</li>
            <li>Just cheap cheap and more cheap</li>
            <li>purchased this from a third party vendor &amp;#34;Smartline&amp;#34; and they provided excellent customer service and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It will do the job until I can fine a nicer one.</li>
            <li>Works fine I think.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect because it&#x27;s not too tight</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can see light out of the bottom of the mask and it&#x27;s not as comfortable to wear as I</li>
            <li>come in hand when i have a headache com my nerve when light not in my eyes thank a lot sleep  everynite with it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, but does the trick.</li>
            <li>cheap but works.  </li>
            <li>It also does let a wee bit of light through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t block out all of the light, but about 75% of it.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and durable.  </li>
            <li>It blocks out light.</li>
            <li>It does the job of blocking out light, either from daylight or a lamp.  </li>
            <li>The price is cheap.</li>
            <li>It does block out all of the light for me at night.</li>
            <li>This mask just isn&#x27;t that comfortable although it does</li>
            <li>They do block out all light.  </li>
            <li>You cannot see through this mask and it was comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>so I give it four stars for the material and snug fit</li>
            <li>Cheaply made of course for the price.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is great if you work second or third shift and the price is great, too.  </li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to: Blocks the light from your eyes.</li>
            <li>light&lt;br /&gt;and comfortable and it enables him to sleep well when I want to read.</li>
            <li>I like that it covers the oter edges and doesn&#x27;t let light in.  </li>
            <li>and if you sleep in a room that is lit or has windows you may notice that it does not block out all the light.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>These are supper cheap (takes forever to be delivered from China) but they do the job and no issues with comfort.  </li>
            <li>kinda works, light weight and comfy cheap</li>
            <li>/&gt;The material on these is soft, the bands fit fairly snug.  </li>
            <li>I like it because its thinner and great for those warm nights when you do not want a heavy mask on that will make you sweaty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The price is right and you get two which is even better.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>but I continue to have all my original problems with it.</li>
            <li>they are ok, however, they make really hot when i wear them.  </li>
            <li>The fit is good and hope the elastic doesn&#x27;t go as I have only been using it for about a week.</li>
            <li>The straps are not held on good enough.</li>
            <li>i love this mask so much.  </li>
            <li>For the price of pennies, this mask works good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Even though I didn&#x27;t get free shipping, it was still well worth it, so I ordered two.</li>
            <li>I love my new Sleep Mask!</li>
            <li>and this is an adequate replacement.</li>
            <li>This mask is adequate.</li>
            <li>The material is cheap (obviously) and doesn&#x27;t breathe, so if your bedroom gets warm you&#x27;ll be sweating under your mask.</li>
            <li>First off, most people will not be aware at the time of purchase that the item will be shipped from China.</li>
            <li>Was shipped very fast!</li>
            <li>(It is hot, and this does not improve with colder weather!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a great little mask.</li>
            <li>They fit very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth $2, but I prefer a satin or softer material.</li>
            <li>We have tried other sleep masks and this one is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be much better off covering the window with a nice heavy, dark blanket or a good set of drapes.</li>
            <li>But, on the bright side, no light can get through it if it&#x27;s solid, and it&#x27;s effective at staying on my head while I sleep.</li>
            <li>Light weight yet totally block out light.  </li>
            <li>Works just as great as the more expensive sleep masks.</li>
            <li>and it really helped me fall to sleep quickly.</li>
            <li>sleep mask was exactly as pictured.it is very soft and comfortable on</li>
            <li>I got six, and so far after a year they are still working fine.</li>
            <li>The mask broke the first time using it.</li>
            <li>so i can rest peaceful.</li>
            <li>Not bulky at all like some masks are but still completely shuts out the light.</li>
            <li>I actually tuck the flaps over the nose up toward my eyes and it worked better for me that way.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize these would be shipped to me straight from China!  </li>
            <li>personally fold it a bit on the top so it doesnt cover my forehead</li>
            <li>That said, it is difficult to find the perfect tightness.</li>
            <li>first, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be harmful, but my eye lids have started to swell up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dark and all but light still comes on from the top.</li>
            <li>spend a bit more and get one with cloth next to your face.</li>
            <li>it feels like sand paper and sound like plastic really loud</li>
            <li>thought I would be buying a higher end mask but</li>
            <li>will at a later date buy a more premium&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought more than one of these, because I&#x27;ve had trouble finding one I like, but now I&#x27;ll be set for awhile!</li>
            <li>I got it quickly and it lets me get to sleep instantly without having to worry about my husband&#x27;s reading light bothering me.</li>
            <li>This may be good for a short flight or short term wear, but I do not recommend using it over night.</li>
            <li>Silky, soft and cool.</li>
            <li>It arrived in 13 days, I think, from China, which I think is fast, it covers almost all of your vision, but the strings are too tight, I need to do something to stretch them more, I cannot use them as they are originally.</li>
            <li>Another great part of this sleep mask is the elastic band isn&#x27;t too tight and they have double bands on them.</li>
            <li>And very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Does the job well and helps me fall asleep when my partner still wants to watch</li>
            <li>Once I get to sleep, most times the sunlight doesn&#x27;t bother me, however, during the Alaska summer, there really is no escaping it</li>
            <li>But you can&#x27;t really complain about it, since they are so inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I doubt you&#x27;ll be able to see any unless you&#x27;re carefully looking for it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the peace and quiet of night, too</li>
            <li>and he wants to sleep.</li>
            <li>Totally blocks all light.</li>
            <li>This is a nice thin sleeping mask that blocks out light</li>
            <li>I originally purchased a more expensive pair and did not feel comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was average but everything was ok.</li>
            <li>works better than more expensive ones I have used.  </li>
            <li>Decent mask.</li>
            <li>I have white pillow cases and if I sleep with the side of my face touching the pillow, I get big gray C shapes where ever I lay on the pillow.</li>
            <li>If only the straps were sowed further apart, then the mask would press on my forehead and my cheeks, which would be much better than pressing on my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily, I have a quiet place.</li>
            <li>if you were clever you could replace it, but these are so inexpensive....</li>
            <li>Ordered about 25 for use in my high school psychology class.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>going to get another one for travel would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One more little thing -when</li>
            <li>Tis comfortable sleep mask is lightweight but really keeps me in the dark.</li>
            <li>I wake up most mornings with it missing (under the headboard) or on the floor.</li>
            <li>but it is made out of such a light material that you can barely feel it as it sits on your eyes.</li>
            <li>But I think that&#x27;s normal for a kid.</li>
            <li>It is also nice if you are like me and stay up late (I&#x27;m retired...</li>
            <li>wanted a sleep mask that blocks out sunlight and gives my eyes space to breathe, but this mask does not cover light below your eyes because of the way this mask is shaped, compare to other masks.</li>
            <li>Although it &amp;#34;leaks&amp;#34; some light at bottom, you can only see that if your eyes are open.  </li>
            <li>OK for me because I have a small head.</li>
            <li>It apparently doesn&#x27;t stay on very well.</li>
            <li>you first open the package the chemical  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate, sits comfortably on the bridge of the nose without falling down.</li>
            <li>Eyes closed, nice and dark</li>
            <li>But still too strong to wear for a few minutes, let alone overnight.</li>
            <li>The material is very soft and silky and never bothers my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Plus it has a little flap that keeps light from coming in by your nose.</li>
            <li>Technically your eyes should be closed, but if you are trying to sleep during the day, you may experience some light filtering in through the mask fabric.</li>
            <li>but I was expecting a soft satin feel</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my 8 year old son, n he&#x27;s been using it every night so far.</li>
            <li>Took nearly two months to arrive.</li>
            <li>Shipping was slow but free so can&#x27;t complain really.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>only complaint is that the bottom elastic strap is pretty stretched out after 5-6 months of nightly use, but then again i have a huge head</li>
            <li>Very light and thin.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, silky black sleep mask that has double elastic bands in the back to sit comfortably on your head.</li>
            <li>It is firm enough around the head but not too tight and is totally dark for a great sleep.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just the shape of my face, but it lets in just a little bit of light around my nose, unlike the last one I had from a different brand.</li>
            <li>and my room has serious light in it during the daylight hours.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer sleeping without it, but sometimes my bf needs to use computer at night which makes uncomfortable level of light for</li>
            <li>I had a better one that was left behind in a hotel</li>
            <li>This mask is a comfortable material thick enough to shield eyes, but supple enough to conform to the curves of the face and not leave any gaps.  </li>
            <li>This worked really well for about a week and half, but one of the straps snapped off after that...</li>
            <li>You should expect at least two weeks of shipping time, or you can buy from a US seller costing a little more</li>

            <li> Probably would be better when the weather is colder.</li>
            <li> i guess, better than nothing..</li>
            <li> For the cost, what more could you expect.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering a better mask.</li>
            <li> This mask was perfect for my husband who works 2nd shift and needs to sleep in after the sun is up in the morning.</li>
            <li> more than 5 to 8 days.it did however arrive in about two weeks.i</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m ok with it .i&#x27;m</li>
            <li> It was good at first, but the rubber band is too tight.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> For the price it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> these masks are light, very comfortable, and they are washable too.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and does block the light, but the fabric is very cheap and smells strongly of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Sufficient at blocking most of the light.</li>
            <li> get a better fit.</li>
            <li> however it is exactly what I wanted and the price was the best of all offers.</li>
            <li> I love their light weight and fine elastic.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> But, here I am shopping for a more comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> Just cheap cheap and more cheap</li>
            <li> purchased this from a third party vendor &amp;#34;Smartline&amp;#34; and they provided excellent customer service and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It will do the job until I can fine a nicer one.</li>
            <li> Works fine I think.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect because it&#x27;s not too tight</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can see light out of the bottom of the mask and it&#x27;s not as comfortable to wear as I</li>
            <li> come in hand when i have a headache com my nerve when light not in my eyes thank a lot sleep  everynite with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, but does the trick.</li>
            <li> cheap but works.  </li>
            <li> It also does let a wee bit of light through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t block out all of the light, but about 75% of it.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and durable.  </li>
            <li> It blocks out light.</li>
            <li> It does the job of blocking out light, either from daylight or a lamp.  </li>
            <li> The price is cheap.</li>
            <li> It does block out all of the light for me at night.</li>
            <li> This mask just isn&#x27;t that comfortable although it does</li>
            <li> They do block out all light.  </li>
            <li> You cannot see through this mask and it was comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> so I give it four stars for the material and snug fit</li>
            <li> Cheaply made of course for the price.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is great if you work second or third shift and the price is great, too.  </li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to: Blocks the light from your eyes.</li>
            <li> light&lt;br /&gt;and comfortable and it enables him to sleep well when I want to read.</li>
            <li> I like that it covers the oter edges and doesn&#x27;t let light in.  </li>
            <li> and if you sleep in a room that is lit or has windows you may notice that it does not block out all the light.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> These are supper cheap (takes forever to be delivered from China) but they do the job and no issues with comfort.  </li>
            <li> kinda works, light weight and comfy cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;The material on these is soft, the bands fit fairly snug.  </li>
            <li> I like it because its thinner and great for those warm nights when you do not want a heavy mask on that will make you sweaty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The price is right and you get two which is even better.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> but I continue to have all my original problems with it.</li>
            <li> they are ok, however, they make really hot when i wear them.  </li>
            <li> The fit is good and hope the elastic doesn&#x27;t go as I have only been using it for about a week.</li>
            <li> The straps are not held on good enough.</li>
            <li> i love this mask so much.  </li>
            <li> For the price of pennies, this mask works good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Even though I didn&#x27;t get free shipping, it was still well worth it, so I ordered two.</li>
            <li> I love my new Sleep Mask!</li>
            <li> and this is an adequate replacement.</li>
            <li> This mask is adequate.</li>
            <li> The material is cheap (obviously) and doesn&#x27;t breathe, so if your bedroom gets warm you&#x27;ll be sweating under your mask.</li>
            <li> First off, most people will not be aware at the time of purchase that the item will be shipped from China.</li>
            <li> Was shipped very fast!</li>
            <li> (It is hot, and this does not improve with colder weather!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a great little mask.</li>
            <li> They fit very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth $2, but I prefer a satin or softer material.</li>
            <li> We have tried other sleep masks and this one is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be much better off covering the window with a nice heavy, dark blanket or a good set of drapes.</li>
            <li> But, on the bright side, no light can get through it if it&#x27;s solid, and it&#x27;s effective at staying on my head while I sleep.</li>
            <li> Light weight yet totally block out light.  </li>
            <li> Works just as great as the more expensive sleep masks.</li>
            <li> and it really helped me fall to sleep quickly.</li>
            <li> sleep mask was exactly as pictured.it is very soft and comfortable on</li>
            <li> I got six, and so far after a year they are still working fine.</li>
            <li> The mask broke the first time using it.</li>
            <li> so i can rest peaceful.</li>
            <li> Not bulky at all like some masks are but still completely shuts out the light.</li>
            <li> I actually tuck the flaps over the nose up toward my eyes and it worked better for me that way.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize these would be shipped to me straight from China!  </li>
            <li> personally fold it a bit on the top so it doesnt cover my forehead</li>
            <li> That said, it is difficult to find the perfect tightness.</li>
            <li> first, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be harmful, but my eye lids have started to swell up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark and all but light still comes on from the top.</li>
            <li> spend a bit more and get one with cloth next to your face.</li>
            <li> it feels like sand paper and sound like plastic really loud</li>
            <li> thought I would be buying a higher end mask but</li>
            <li> will at a later date buy a more premium&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought more than one of these, because I&#x27;ve had trouble finding one I like, but now I&#x27;ll be set for awhile!</li>
            <li> I got it quickly and it lets me get to sleep instantly without having to worry about my husband&#x27;s reading light bothering me.</li>
            <li> This may be good for a short flight or short term wear, but I do not recommend using it over night.</li>
            <li> Silky, soft and cool.</li>
            <li> It arrived in 13 days, I think, from China, which I think is fast, it covers almost all of your vision, but the strings are too tight, I need to do something to stretch them more, I cannot use them as they are originally.</li>
            <li> Another great part of this sleep mask is the elastic band isn&#x27;t too tight and they have double bands on them.</li>
            <li> And very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Does the job well and helps me fall asleep when my partner still wants to watch</li>
            <li> Once I get to sleep, most times the sunlight doesn&#x27;t bother me, however, during the Alaska summer, there really is no escaping it</li>
            <li> But you can&#x27;t really complain about it, since they are so inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I doubt you&#x27;ll be able to see any unless you&#x27;re carefully looking for it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the peace and quiet of night, too</li>
            <li> and he wants to sleep.</li>
            <li> Totally blocks all light.</li>
            <li> This is a nice thin sleeping mask that blocks out light</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a more expensive pair and did not feel comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was average but everything was ok.</li>
            <li> works better than more expensive ones I have used.  </li>
            <li> Decent mask.</li>
            <li> I have white pillow cases and if I sleep with the side of my face touching the pillow, I get big gray C shapes where ever I lay on the pillow.</li>
            <li> If only the straps were sowed further apart, then the mask would press on my forehead and my cheeks, which would be much better than pressing on my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily, I have a quiet place.</li>
            <li> if you were clever you could replace it, but these are so inexpensive....</li>
            <li> Ordered about 25 for use in my high school psychology class.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> going to get another one for travel would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One more little thing -when</li>
            <li> Tis comfortable sleep mask is lightweight but really keeps me in the dark.</li>
            <li> I wake up most mornings with it missing (under the headboard) or on the floor.</li>
            <li> but it is made out of such a light material that you can barely feel it as it sits on your eyes.</li>
            <li> But I think that&#x27;s normal for a kid.</li>
            <li> It is also nice if you are like me and stay up late (I&#x27;m retired...</li>
            <li> wanted a sleep mask that blocks out sunlight and gives my eyes space to breathe, but this mask does not cover light below your eyes because of the way this mask is shaped, compare to other masks.</li>
            <li> Although it &amp;#34;leaks&amp;#34; some light at bottom, you can only see that if your eyes are open.  </li>
            <li> OK for me because I have a small head.</li>
            <li> It apparently doesn&#x27;t stay on very well.</li>
            <li> you first open the package the chemical  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate, sits comfortably on the bridge of the nose without falling down.</li>
            <li> Eyes closed, nice and dark</li>
            <li> But still too strong to wear for a few minutes, let alone overnight.</li>
            <li> The material is very soft and silky and never bothers my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Plus it has a little flap that keeps light from coming in by your nose.</li>
            <li> Technically your eyes should be closed, but if you are trying to sleep during the day, you may experience some light filtering in through the mask fabric.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting a soft satin feel</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 8 year old son, n he&#x27;s been using it every night so far.</li>
            <li> Took nearly two months to arrive.</li>
            <li> Shipping was slow but free so can&#x27;t complain really.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the bottom elastic strap is pretty stretched out after 5-6 months of nightly use, but then again i have a huge head</li>
            <li> Very light and thin.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, silky black sleep mask that has double elastic bands in the back to sit comfortably on your head.</li>
            <li> It is firm enough around the head but not too tight and is totally dark for a great sleep.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just the shape of my face, but it lets in just a little bit of light around my nose, unlike the last one I had from a different brand.</li>
            <li> and my room has serious light in it during the daylight hours.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer sleeping without it, but sometimes my bf needs to use computer at night which makes uncomfortable level of light for</li>
            <li> I had a better one that was left behind in a hotel</li>
            <li> This mask is a comfortable material thick enough to shield eyes, but supple enough to conform to the curves of the face and not leave any gaps.  </li>
            <li> This worked really well for about a week and half, but one of the straps snapped off after that...</li>
            <li> You should expect at least two weeks of shipping time, or you can buy from a US seller costing a little more</li>
            <li> add to this problem, the strap is made tight in order fit people with small heads, but this makes the mask presses on your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now if I get up at night, I can slip it up to my forehead and see with my nightlight, hen slip it back down for complete blackness, even if the TV is on.</li>
            <li> These masks performed extremely well and held up to the rough handling by high school students.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with dry eyes and now that its getting warmer along with air conditioning being on, I have a fan that is directly above my bed.  </li>
            <li> The straps were a little tight at first, but they have since stretched out.  </li>
            <li> sorry it shouldn&#x27;t even be free .no</li>
            <li> And compared to other economy masks that I have bought in the drug stores, the elastic bands have not stretched at all.  </li>
            <li> Took a while for them to arrive,about 5weeks.seem like a overtly long time..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to resort to tying the straps in little knots which holds straps better but still uncomfortable</li>
            <li> I like that it has a little nose peace, but the fabric is thin and you can see pin holes of light coming through it.</li>
            <li> My ceiling fan is drying out my eyes due to my eyes being partially open when I sleep (from a stressful work day).  </li>
            <li> both sides.the little extra piece on the bottom makes a big difference in blocking out light.my</li>
            <li> for $3 you cannot loose.</li>
            <li> However, the black dye will come off, not on your face but onto white or light-colored material.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping toook almost a month and a half just to get a crappy chinese product.</li>
            <li> I buy these  black ones by the dozen as well as the blue ones.</li>
            <li> However, the price on these are so low that I wished I could send just a little to help the workers....</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s not much discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m retired and disabled (really...ask U of M Hospital) and teacher pensions are low.</li>
            <li> I have a big head, and could use one a few inches wider (</li>
            <li> So I never really got the chance to use it.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have expected it seeing as how this is made in China...</li>
            <li> I recently had to purchase this due to excessive dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> I received this in less time than expected and does the job</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because the straps are sowed close to each other, when you put on the sleep mask, the mask presses down on your eyes.</li>
            <li> the straps on this mask were too tight, even though my head is not large.</li>
            <li> Mask keeps it dark.</li>
            <li> Recommended for those who don&#x27;t sleep in a perfectly dark room.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth the wait</li>
            <li> only complaint is i ordered it in april and got a delivery date in june.</li>
            <li> Non adjustable straps are a mixed blessing: No velcro or annoying plastic but a little tight fit.</li>
            <li> we recently moved to a new home, and my hubs works crazy shifts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Suppose price is right if you&#x27;re desperate.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not super.</li>
            <li> Airing it for a week helped slightly.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and not too tight like others.</li>
            <li> I even looked it up, and found out that tight sleeping masks are harmful for your eyes.</li>
            <li> The another brand had an elastic band that was so tight it hurt my head -</li>
            <li> It also is tight.</li>
            <li> and they are a little snug</li>
            <li> I like how it fits on my face while I sleep, but it can get a little shifty if you move around a lot</li>
            <li> /&gt;a few days.</li>
            <li> Straps did disintegrate after a few months.</li>
            <li> your having trouble with neighbors lights shining in your window...</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t even waste a dollar on this product.</li>
            <li> that it took to get to you nor the few bucks I paid for it</li>
            <li> Not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy waste of money...looks used not even in a packet and</li>
            <li> I had also ordered a different sleep mask, that was more expensive, to try out, but I hated it.  </li>
            <li> My head is rather small but the mask flattens my lashes against my eyes.</li>
            <li> (I usually sleep on my side, so</li>
            <li> Plus that nose thing makes it hard to breathe.</li>
            <li> I hardly feel they are on.</li>
            <li> He uses it a lot because I watch tv really late in our bedroom.</li>
            <li> Wash in a stuff sack on delicate cycle with cold water and allow to air dry to extend the life of the elastic.</li>
            <li> This is no good.</li>
            <li> Extremely poor quality.</li>
            <li> It does however end up off my head by morning but has definately cut down on how bad my eyes were when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obnoxious and renders them useless unless you don&#x27;t mind textile dye all over your eyes and nose upon waking.</li>
            <li> I was worried it was gonna be uncomfortable to wear while sleeping</li>
            <li> The clips do not hold well and make bumps that are uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The product will cause your face to become uncomfortable as it is liking putting plastic over your eyes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped me get used to this crazy night</li>
            <li> forgot I was wearing them and thought I went blind over night!</li>
            <li> Crap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with the mask.</li>
            <li> My eyes were miserable when I would wake up.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The mask broke the first time using it.The straps are not held on good enough.I went to target and found 1 for 1 dollar that has lasted alot longer.</li>
            <li> Non adjustable straps are a mixed blessing: No velcro or annoying plastic but a little tight fit. OK for me because I have a small head. Sufficient at blocking most of the light. As another reviewer states, the color can come off on pillow case. Knocked off a couple of star for this reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with the mask. It is lightweight and does block the light, but the fabric is very cheap and smells strongly of chemicals. I had to wash it immediately before wearing to try to lessen the smell. After one use it stained my pillowcases, essentially ruining them, so I refuse to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> works better than more expensive ones I have used.  Although it &amp;#34;leaks&amp;#34; some light at bottom, you can only see that if your eyes are open.  Eyes closed, nice and dark</li>
            <li> It took about a month to receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see light out of the bottom of the mask and it&#x27;s not as comfortable to wear as I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask serves its purpose...but it&#x27;s not super.</li>
            <li> come in hand when i have a headache com my nerve when light not in my eyes thank a lot sleep  everynite with it on so i can rest peaceful.</li>
            <li> The quality is ok but it gets the job done perfectly.</li>
            <li> I like them.  Light weight yet totally block out light.  And very inexpensive. :)&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Does the job well and helps me fall asleep when my partner still wants to watch TV.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, but does the trick. I had a better one that was left behind in a hotel and this is an adequate replacement.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and not too tight like others. Plus it has a little flap that keeps light from coming in by your nose. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect sleep mask. Very light and thin. Not bulky at all like some masks are but still completely shuts out the light.</li>
            <li> Great product! Good quality!  Was shipped very fast! Ordered about 25 for use in my high school psychology class.  These masks performed extremely well and held up to the rough handling by high school students.</li>
            <li> This is one of those things that you get what you pay for. I wake up most mornings with it missing (under the headboard) or on the floor. It apparently doesn&#x27;t stay on very well. I like it for the reason if initially getting to sleep. Once I get to sleep, most times the sunlight doesn&#x27;t bother me, however, during the Alaska summer, there really is no escaping it and the sunlight has woken me up as a result of the mask being removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great little mask. I actually tuck the flaps over the nose up toward my eyes and it worked better for me that way.</li>
            <li> Out of the three I bought, the elastic broke immediately on one pair.  But you can&#x27;t really complain about it, since they are so inexpensive.  I didn&#x27;t realize these would be shipped to me straight from China!  Lightweight, comfortable, effective light-blocking.</li>
            <li> i love this mask so much.  i&#x27;m on the vampire sleep schedule and my room has serious light in it during the daylight hours.  this thing blocks it out 100%  only complaint is that the bottom elastic strap is pretty stretched out after 5-6 months of nightly use, but then again i have a huge head LOL</li>
            <li> cheap but works.  elastic will stretch over time</li>
            <li> Product ships from China (maybe?). Shipping was slow but free so can&#x27;t complain really. However, the dye used in the production of these otherwise lovely sleep masks bleeds onto your face as you sleep. It&#x27;s obnoxious and renders them useless unless you don&#x27;t mind textile dye all over your eyes and nose upon waking. WOULD NOT purchase again. Avoid at all cost.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these sleep masks. (One for my son and one for myself)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son loves his sleep mask and puts it on to feel &amp;#34;cozy and dark&amp;#34; before bed.  He has used it almost every day since getting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the perfect size for a child.  My head is rather small but the mask flattens my lashes against my eyes. I may alter the elastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to get a better fit. It also does let a wee bit of light through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more little thing -when you first open the package the chemical  smell is very strong- but it does go away after airing out for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a few days.</li>
            <li> This was the best gift I could&#x27;ve given my fiance. He uses it a lot because I watch tv really late in our bedroom.</li>
            <li> I love the sleep masks. They fit very well. I love the way it feels on my skin. The price is right and you get two which is even better.</li>
            <li> For the price of pennies, this mask works good enough for me. It doesn&#x27;t block out all of the light, but about 75% of it.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy about this mask.  It just works.  I have used it most nights for over 6 months.  It is comfortable and durable.  And compared to other economy masks that I have bought in the drug stores, the elastic bands have not stretched at all.  Can&#x27;t beat the value.</li>
            <li> It blocks out light. I doubt you&#x27;ll be able to see any unless you&#x27;re carefully looking for it. Which you won&#x27;t be doing while trying to get to sleep.</li>
            <li> Decent mask. Silky, soft and cool. Straps did disintegrate after a few months. I just sewed them back on.</li>
            <li> it came on a &amp;#34;slow boar from China&amp;#34; literally and it took weeks however it is exactly what I wanted and the price was the best of all offers.</li>
            <li> This mask is a comfortable material thick enough to shield eyes, but supple enough to conform to the curves of the face and not leave any gaps.  Wash in a stuff sack on delicate cycle with cold water and allow to air dry to extend the life of the elastic.</li>
            <li> I am glad it works. This is a great sleeping mask. I will tell others I loved it as well.</li>
            <li> It arrived in 13 days, I think, from China, which I think is fast, it covers almost all of your vision, but the strings are too tight, I need to do something to stretch them more, I cannot use them as they are originally.</li>
            <li> Very Cheaply made! It darkens out everything in the room but the strap broke the next week. Shipping was average but everything was ok.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It does the job of blocking out light, either from daylight or a lamp.  However, the black dye will come off, not on your face but onto white or light-colored material.  Therefore, wash this by hand.</li>
            <li> Mask keeps it dark. The price is cheap. The fit is good and hope the elastic doesn&#x27;t go as I have only been using it for about a week.</li>
            <li> This is great. Exactly what I expected. Does the job well. I was worried it was gonna be uncomfortable to wear while sleeping but it is made out of such a light material that you can barely feel it as it sits on your eyes. Recommended for those who don&#x27;t sleep in a perfectly dark room.</li>
            <li> Tis comfortable sleep mask is lightweight but really keeps me in the dark. Now if I get up at night, I can slip it up to my forehead and see with my nightlight, hen slip it back down for complete blackness, even if the TV is on.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s not much discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;I personally fold it a bit on the top so it doesnt cover my forehead</li>
            <li> the straps on this mask were too tight, even though my head is not large. Also the strap broke. Do not recommend</li>
            <li> This mask is adequate. It does block out all of the light for me at night. If it doesn&#x27;t, try tightening the straps. That said, it is difficult to find the perfect tightness. The clips do not hold well and make bumps that are uncomfortable. I&#x27;ve had to resort to tying the straps in little knots which holds straps better but still uncomfortable (I usually sleep on my side, so the bumps aren&#x27;t that big of a deal). I have used it many times and I can sleep with it on. (It is hot, and this does not improve with colder weather!) I much prefer sleeping without it, but sometimes my bf needs to use computer at night which makes uncomfortable level of light for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your having trouble with neighbors lights shining in your window... You&#x27;d be much better off covering the window with a nice heavy, dark blanket or a good set of drapes. This mask just isn&#x27;t that comfortable although it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suppose price is right if you&#x27;re desperate. But, here I am shopping for a more comfortable fit.</li>
            <li> It was good at first, but the rubber band is too tight.&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be harmful, but my eye lids have started to swell up. I even looked it up, and found out that tight sleeping masks are harmful for your eyes.</li>
            <li> we recently moved to a new home, and my hubs works crazy shifts.  So sometimes our sleeping is during the day.  We havent gotten around to blocking out the light for sleeping yet, and nice window treatments can get expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;got two of these.... the price was super cheap and the product we got was in great condition.  Takes a bit to ship, because it is coming from China.  But we weren&#x27;t in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material on these is soft, the bands fit fairly snug.  They do block out all light.  These have been great.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just the shape of my face, but it lets in just a little bit of light around my nose, unlike the last one I had from a different brand.</li>
            <li> Just put it on, close your eyes and go to sleep. You cannot see through this mask and it was comfortable to wear. If you toss and turn during the night, the mask may move around as well. But this is a great sleep mask and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Lets me sleep in in my sunny room on the weekends!</li>
            <li> I received this in less time than expected and does the job but I was expecting a soft satin feel and they are a little snug so I give it four stars for the material and snug fit but it does the job.  It blocks light out nicely.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t even waste a dollar on this product. It doesn&#x27;t deserve the one star it has but I couldn&#x27;t post a review without it. Cheaply made of course for the price. But the strap broke as soon as I went to pull it on my head. Didn&#x27;t even get it on. Crap</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 8 year old son, n he&#x27;s been using it every night so far. Of course when he wakes up, it&#x27;s off. But I think that&#x27;s normal for a kid. Anyway he likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought a friend and I one each, and mine isn&#x27;t the one pictured. It&#x27;s leather and sticks to my face, hurting my nose if it digs in. But, on the bright side, no light can get through it if it&#x27;s solid, and it&#x27;s effective at staying on my head while I sleep.</li>
            <li> great for blocking out light to sleep in or taking a nap during the day</li>
            <li> I love my new Sleep Mask!</li>
            <li> Arrived reeking of chemicals. I tried to wear it, but it was overwhelming. Airing it for a week helped slightly. But still too strong to wear for a few minutes, let alone overnight. I soaked it in vinegar-spiked water for several days, which reduced the odor enough to bear the chemical smell for several minutes. But it&#x27;s still too distracting too sleep with. And who knows if that smell is caused by something that should&#x27;t be next to eyes/nose/mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a lot of sleep masks from various companies.  This is the only one with this issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark and all but light still comes on from the top. It&#x27;s still much better than not having one though.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is great if you work second or third shift and the price is great, too.  It is also nice if you are like me and stay up late (I&#x27;m retired...I don&#x27;t have to get up at dawn and I&#x27;m a night owl). I enjoy the peace and quiet of night, too so I need a sleep mask in the morning. Another great part of this sleep mask is the elastic band isn&#x27;t too tight and they have double bands on them. The another brand had an elastic band that was so tight it hurt my head - can&#x27;t sleep with that. These are made in China so if that bothers you, then order another one. I&#x27;m retired and disabled (really...ask U of M Hospital) and teacher pensions are low. However, the price on these are so low that I wished I could send just a little to help the workers....doubted it would ever get to the workers instead of greedy owners or managers! Sleep well.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to: Blocks the light from your eyes. However, I have two problems with this mask.&lt;br /&gt;1) The material is cheap (obviously) and doesn&#x27;t breathe, so if your bedroom gets warm you&#x27;ll be sweating under your mask. You get to wake up with a gross clammy face lol.&lt;br /&gt;2) The lining around the mask STAINS PILLOWCASES! I have white pillow cases and if I sleep with the side of my face touching the pillow, I get big gray C shapes where ever I lay on the pillow. It mostly washes out but not completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After bleaching the hell out of my pillowcases, the marks from the mask do come out. I still use the mask sometimes but I continue to have all my original problems with it.</li>
            <li> My husband uses the sleep mask nightly. I love to read in bed and he wants to sleep. This is our happy compromise. He finds the mask light&lt;br /&gt;and comfortable and it enables him to sleep well when I want to read.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate, sits comfortably on the bridge of the nose without falling down. I have a big head, and could use one a few inches wider (one of the straps broke, too), but I&#x27;m still glad I have this. Does what a sleep mask does.</li>
            <li> This work okay - but I&#x27;ve found that a satin more breathable fabric works better for me.</li>
            <li> The product will cause your face to become uncomfortable as it is liking putting plastic over your eyes.  spend a bit more and get one with cloth next to your face.</li>
            <li> I like that it covers the oter edges and doesn&#x27;t let light in.  These are perfect for me.  I needed them for a science lab and will be the perfect fit for my students.</li>
            <li> these masks are light, very comfortable, and they are washable too. I got six, and so far after a year they are still working fine.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, silky black sleep mask that has double elastic bands in the back to sit comfortably on your head. I like how it fits on my face while I sleep, but it can get a little shifty if you move around a lot and if you sleep in a room that is lit or has windows you may notice that it does not block out all the light. Technically your eyes should be closed, but if you are trying to sleep during the day, you may experience some light filtering in through the mask fabric. That being said it is a great mask for the value.</li>
            <li> Strand broke as soon as it went to the wash. So I never really got the chance to use it. Oh well you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> very low quality, but what did I expect for a couple bucks</li>
            <li> gift for grandson, he loves it</li>
            <li> First off, most people will not be aware at the time of purchase that the item will be shipped from China. You should expect at least two weeks of shipping time, or you can buy from a US seller costing a little more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I received the item today, one of the two straps seems to be coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the straps are sowed close to each other, when you put on the sleep mask, the mask presses down on your eyes. This is no good. If only the straps were sowed further apart, then the mask would press on my forehead and my cheeks, which would be much better than pressing on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;To add to this problem, the strap is made tight in order fit people with small heads, but this makes the mask presses on your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a sleep mask that blocks out sunlight and gives my eyes space to breathe, but this mask does not cover light below your eyes because of the way this mask is shaped, compare to other masks.</li>
            <li> Works just as great as the more expensive sleep masks.Took a while for them to arrive,about 5weeks.seem like a overtly long time..</li>
            <li> This is a nice thin sleeping mask that blocks out light so you can sleep! I like it because its thinner and great for those warm nights when you do not want a heavy mask on that will make you sweaty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this from a third party vendor &amp;#34;Smartline&amp;#34; and they provided excellent customer service and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The elastic will chop your ears off.&lt;br /&gt;The fabric is alright but its like having a paper towel on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping toook almost a month and a half just to get a crappy chinese product.</li>
            <li> Just cheap cheap and more cheap it&#x27;s so cheap it feels like sand paper and sound like plastic really loud it&#x27;s not worth the wait that it took to get to you nor the few bucks I paid for it sorry it shouldn&#x27;t even be free .no joke I just have to be honest.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable at all. It also is tight. It is a werd feeling on your head. Plus that nose thing makes it hard to breathe.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy waste of money...looks used not even in a packet and not what the descriptions says...its not a silky sleep mask</li>
            <li> I do. Which means I sleep during daylight hours. Luckily, I have a quiet place. But sunlight is always around and this mask cancels it out nicely. It&#x27;s helped me get used to this crazy night shift!&lt;br /&gt;-BigB, Norristown PA</li>
            <li> I have a problem with dry eyes and now that its getting warmer along with air conditioning being on, I have a fan that is directly above my bed.  My eyes were miserable when I would wake up.  This  was the reason for my purchase of the sleep mask.  It works perfectly!  Solved my problem.  Thank-You.</li>
            <li> I buy these  black ones by the dozen as well as the blue ones. I love their light weight and fine elastic. I hardly feel they are on. The elastic does stretch out a bit after a while, way before the mask itself. if you were clever you could replace it, but these are so inexpensive....</li>
            <li> For the price it is pretty good. I like that it has a little nose peace, but the fabric is thin and you can see pin holes of light coming through it. It will do the job until I can fine a nicer one.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed. I got it quickly and it lets me get to sleep instantly without having to worry about my husband&#x27;s reading light bothering me. The material is very soft and silky and never bothers my sensitive skin. Even though I didn&#x27;t get free shipping, it was still well worth it, so I ordered two. Great product!</li>
            <li> Took nearly two months to arrive. Extremely poor quality. Strap broke second night it was used. I guess you get what you pay for but still, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Totally blocks all light. Very comfortable, come with two head straps and they&#x27;re made out of a breathable material. I used mine all the time when I had to sleep during the day. I woke up one morning, forgot I was wearing them and thought I went blind over night! Lol. They work that well. A must if you work 3rd shift and need to sleep during the day.</li>
            <li> This worked really well for about a week and half, but one of the straps snapped off after that... I guess I should have expected it seeing as how this is made in China...</li>
            <li> The mask is as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would be buying a higher end mask but&lt;br /&gt;these will do ( I bought three).&lt;br /&gt;I will at a later date buy a more premium&lt;br /&gt;mask. So I&#x27;m satisfied because the mask is&lt;br /&gt;as advertised</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a more expensive pair and did not feel comfortable.  These are supper cheap (takes forever to be delivered from China) but they do the job and no issues with comfort.  Suggest you save the money and go with something like this.  for $3 you cannot loose.</li>
            <li> I recently had to purchase this due to excessive dry eyes.  My ceiling fan is drying out my eyes due to my eyes being partially open when I sleep (from a stressful work day).  It&#x27;s perfect because it&#x27;s not too tight and it doesn&#x27;t bother your eyes.  It does however end up off my head by morning but has definately cut down on how bad my eyes were when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask works great for me.  The straps were a little tight at first, but they have since stretched out.  It&#x27;s very comfortable on my face and the price was the best part!  I ordered 5 of them to have on hand as needed.  I had also ordered a different sleep mask, that was more expensive, to try out, but I hated it.  I&#x27;m glad I bought more than one of these, because I&#x27;ve had trouble finding one I like, but now I&#x27;ll be set for awhile!</li>
            <li> Works fine I think. Don&#x27;t know what happened but when I woke up it was not on me anymore. Lol guess sleep masks aren&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> they are ok, however, they make really hot when i wear them.  Probably would be better when the weather is colder.</li>
            <li> kinda works, light weight and comfy cheap you get what you pay for i guess, better than nothing.. good for pocket travel</li>
            <li> For the cost, what more could you expect. It&#x27;s worth $2, but I prefer a satin or softer material. I will be ordering a better mask. This may be good for a short flight or short term wear, but I do not recommend using it over night.</li>
            <li> This mask was perfect for my husband who works 2nd shift and needs to sleep in after the sun is up in the morning. He loves it! We have tried other sleep masks and this one is definitely the best. It is firm enough around the head but not too tight and is totally dark for a great sleep. When I get migraines, I have used it as well and it really helped me fall to sleep quickly. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> sleep mask was exactly as pictured.it is very soft and comfortable on both sides.the little extra piece on the bottom makes a big difference in blocking out light.my only complaint is i ordered it in april and got a delivery date in june. i think thats more than 5 to 8 days.it did however arrive in about two weeks.i also had to sign for it with the mailman. i don&#x27;t know how they do this for 3 bucks but i&#x27;m ok with it .i&#x27;m going to get another one for travel would highly recommend.</li>
