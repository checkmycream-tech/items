    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The bottom line for me is that the excellent results have not changed.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best to use these.</li>
            <li>the doctor that completed the surgery recommended their use and i have been very happy with them ever since</li>
            <li>They are very good</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist is always impressed at how good a job I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>The Amazon picture of this item is of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Stim-u-Dents, which were a great product, but which J&amp;J discontinued making in 2008.  </li>
            <li>Great product and price.</li>
            <li>and he thinks they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>great price.</li>
            <li>I have been using these for years and my dentist is happy.</li>
            <li>These work - perhaps the wood isn&#x27;t as great as the originals, but they work.  </li>
            <li>Great to find the bulk pack of 1000 on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Students enable me to floss very effectively.</li>
            <li>Just what I ordered and received quickly at a good price - thx</li>
            <li>This price is really good too.  </li>
            <li>Still a good deal.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>get good dental check-ups</li>
            <li>use them even when I haven&#x27;t eaten a meal since it still feels good to massage my gums.  </li>
            <li>These plaque removers are good for one&#x27;s teeth, yet stores don&#x27;t sell them anymore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The good news....</li>
            <li>The price was fair for the product.</li>
            <li>Great love these.  </li>
            <li>Generally a nice product.  </li>
            <li>Excellent and fast service</li>
            <li>Great price for the original brand.</li>
            <li>Also, my dentist sees a huge difference with my check ups and teeth cleanings!</li>
            <li>Best cleaner outside the dentist office.</li>
            <li>Work really great for me as I can&#x27;t floss very well.  </li>
            <li>Wall-Mart stopped carrying them so very happy I can buy these on-line at a lower price than the local retailers.</li>
            <li>and I think they have saved him from having any more surgeries.  </li>
            <li>This is simply the best oral health product imaginable.</li>
            <li>Eventually, a dentist told me that if I didn&#x27;t do a better job of controlling plaque, my gums would have to be surgically slit so they could scrape plaque away from my teeth below the gumline.</li>
            <li>I have used it daily ever since (for 15-20 years now), and with excellent results.</li>
            <li>Each time I go in for cleaning now, they RAVE about how healthy my gums are, and how little-to-no plaque has accumulated.</li>
            <li>BTW, I recently contacted Johnson &amp; Johnson and learned that they no longer market this wonderful product (J&amp;J sold the rights to it to Caldwell Consumer Health in December, 2008).</li>
            <li>But when you can&#x27;t, Stimudents are the next best thing.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve helped me keep my teeth and gums healthy for many, many years.</li>
            <li>and they are ok no problem at all.    </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find these in any store and love them.</li>
            <li>I use them every day and am so glad I found a source.</li>
            <li>Much better for me than dental floss or tape.</li>
            <li>I love these things.  </li>
            <li>they ask what I am doing to keep my teeth so healthy.</li>
            <li>I love these things.  </li>
            <li>and I find they work much better than toothpicks, and are environmentally friendlier than the plastic type of item.</li>
            <li>Package got beat up pretty good intransit, but I suspect that is USPS issue rather than yours.</li>
            <li>most recent batch I bought, of 1000 picks (10 boxes of 4 x 25 packs) has very good quality, with wood that is uniform and doesn&#x27;t split or splinter, and a very mild mint</li>
            <li>They keep my gums clean!</li>
            <li>good  deal , fast shipper</li>
            <li>Not as sturdy as the original, but ok for the price.  </li>
            <li>The packaging makes them easy to carry in a pocket or purse.</li>
            <li>The product quality is fine, but this is not a \\&quot;Johnson &amp; Johnson\\&quot; product -</li>
            <li>They are my pals: easy to carry around, can have some in handy places, and do the job very well.  </li>
            <li>You will find it as indispensable as I do.     </li>
            <li>I will be traveling out of the country and don&#x27;t know if these will be available</li>
            <li>Absolutely great price for these if you are--as I am--a regular user.  </li>
            <li>Even got my wife to enjoy them.</li>
            <li>Worth the price with free shipping, and better than disposing of plastic hazards.</li>
            <li>I love having such a good supply.</li>
            <li>I use these to clean my teeth after each meal.</li>
            <li>I believe that I should receive a full refund for a product that[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>These are gentle on your gums--much better than toothpicks, which can splinter.  </li>
            <li>Still is good to use floss, but if choosing only 1</li>
            <li>This product really works....better than tooth picks and better than the plastic junk everyone is trying to market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product before but this time the toothpicks break very easily, I think this lot was to old.    </li>
            <li>Very good price compare to buying small packs in store.</li>
            <li>My dentist keeps urging me to use floss, but he can&#x27;t deny my healthy gum tissue and at 79 years old!                </li>
            <li>Excellent to clean between teeth--and usually, in my opinion, obviates the need for flossing and use of a WaterPik, though I have these available  to use when necessary.</li>
            <li>An ounce of prevention truly is worth a pound of cure.     </li>
            <li>My dentists have always been pleased with the results that I&#x27;ve been able to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are reviews that state these picks are inferior to the originals,  If they are, the differences are minimal.  </li>
            <li>Although I floss I find these are useful at times after a meal or in addition to flossing.</li>
            <li>i have used these for many years after undergoing major gum surgery.</li>
            <li>My teeth will NOT accept any other than Stim-U-Dent for the most clean and STIMUlating !</li>
            <li>Super fast fulfillment.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ve just replaced one habit with another, but it&#x27;s still a whole lot healthier AND cheaper!  </li>
            <li>I love using Stimudents daily.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>Now they even have thinner ones (blue package) that are even better.</li>
            <li>Product exactly as expect.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Suppose he wouldn&#x27;t keep asking for them if he didn&#x27;t like them so much!</li>
            <li>This product was for years sold by Johnson&amp;Johnson and was of higher quality and tasted more minty than does the current offering distributed by Revive and made in China.</li>
            <li>These wooden triangular shaped picks work so much better and somehow feel gentler on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The substitute China-made product is OK, and better than nothing, but it is thicker and more fragile than the J&amp;J product, which is not good.  </li>
            <li>as I watch TV (you may as well make additional use of that time), I brush, then floss, then use a Stim-U-Dent pic, and finally a perio aid (which is another indispensable oral-health tool).\\&quot; The Stim-U-Dent pic removes plaque BETWEEN the teeth (like floss, only better), and the perio aid removes plaque from the gumline ALONG the teeth.</li>
            <li>The last hygienist I saw said to me, in a genuinely astonished tone of voice, \\&quot;Whatever</li>
            <li>you are doing, it REALLY works!\\&quot;     </li>
            <li>Much cheaper feel to it.  </li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>We have been using this product for years and our dentist agrees that they help us to keep the plaque under control very well.1</li>
            <li>#34;here, you got to try one off these, they&#x27;re really great&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>very convenient way to buy.</li>
            <li>Very helpful</li>
            <li>Although it helps to initially soak in water before use, using one ensures my teeth feel clean beyond brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li>I use them every day after any meal and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>The box is much improved from the old flimsy paper that would dump the picks at the drop of a finger.</li>
            <li>This tooth picks a soft and gentle on your gums.</li>
            <li>Of course, you do have to laugh when you realize that you suddenly have, like, a thousand of the things...</li>
            <li>I was pleased to orde them from Amazon because they are becoming difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li>These wooden, shaped toothpicks are just right for cleaning all the nooks and crannies&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>right - only after I kept having to complain about the quantity.</li>
            <li>For me, Stim-U-Dents are a fantastic &amp; cheap secret to ending and even reversing periodontal disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is glossy and sturdy now, the picks are the same but the mint tast is a bit strange and strong-</li>
            <li>Either find some old J&amp;J products and sell them--even at a premium--or change the picture!</li>
            <li>I ordered them and the box CLEARLY SAYS</li>
            <li>I really like these for daily usage.  </li>
            <li>I found early on that flossing might work for some.</li>
            <li>seamless transaction.</li>
            <li>hope there are no other things in there.</li>
            <li>Thank God, not long thereafter a dental technician recommended this product to me, and I am ever-so grateful that she did!</li>
            <li>But with Stimudents, unlike the typical pine hard toothpicks, the soft balsa wood picks easily move between all teeth.</li>
            <li>&quot; by a company called \\&quot;Revive Personal Products Company.\\&quot;  There is no excuse for Amazon to not have corrected this misrepresentation after all this time.</li>

            <li> It is glossy and sturdy now, the picks are the same but the mint tast is a bit strange and strong-</li>
            <li> Either find some old J&amp;J products and sell them--even at a premium--or change the picture!</li>
            <li> I ordered them and the box CLEARLY SAYS</li>
            <li> I really like these for daily usage.  </li>
            <li> I found early on that flossing might work for some.</li>
            <li> seamless transaction.</li>
            <li> hope there are no other things in there.</li>
            <li> Thank God, not long thereafter a dental technician recommended this product to me, and I am ever-so grateful that she did!</li>
            <li> But with Stimudents, unlike the typical pine hard toothpicks, the soft balsa wood picks easily move between all teeth.</li>
            <li> &quot; by a company called \\&quot;Revive Personal Products Company.\\&quot;  There is no excuse for Amazon to not have corrected this misrepresentation after all this time.</li>

            <li> I want my teeth to last as long as I last!</li>
            <li> I am a person with large hands and small mouth.</li>
            <li> I use them about 1 to 3 times a week thoroughly in &amp; out between teeth &amp; also use the flat ends like a brush.</li>
            <li> this bulk pack arrived very quickly and worked out less expensive as well.</li>
            <li> I went cold turkey after a health scare last year and never looked back, and these \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; as I call them have really helped.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying this brand of Stim-U-Dent for about a year and have in the past I have experienced some of the quality-control problems mentioned in other posts -- wood that tends to splinter, strange or over-strong mint-flavoring -- however, even at their worst they were still quite usable.</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re hard to find locally, so the online order was the way to go.</li>
            <li> I see where someone complained about this back in 2011.</li>
            <li> First, this appears to be a serious FALSE advertisement by Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is a typical inferior China-made product.  </li>
            <li> I carry these little hi-tech tooth picks in my purse and in my car.  </li>
            <li> These little pieces of wood have kept me from having a cavity for years and years.</li>
            <li> My dentist cannot explain why not available.</li>
            <li> we are hooked on these stim-u-dents and use them everyday...</li>
            <li> Sometimes an individual pick is weak and breaks and can get temporarily stuck between two teeth, but that can be worked around (in fact, it has to be!).</li>
            <li> I purchased this larger amount from Amazon because they are difficult to find at the stores where I have bought them in the past.  </li>
            <li> This purchase was much less expensive than buying them at any other retail outlet.</li>
            <li> These are fatter and don&#x27;t go between the teeth for cleaning very well. :(</li>
            <li> My husband loves these things and they are really hard to find at any stores here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to these and they have been difficult to find locally.</li>
            <li> Addicted to these.</li>
            <li> &quot; I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Been using them for years, but they have gotten expensive in the drug stores if you can find them.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, made in China like everything else in the world.  </li>
            <li> Amazon, how can you be so unfair and abusive to your customers?  </li>
            <li> Was afraid I&#x27;d get a sliver from them.  </li>

            <li> Addicted to these. Dentist approved. Could use stronger flavoring.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years.</li>
            <li> Best cleaner outside the dentist office.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered and received quickly at a good price - thx</li>
            <li> Generally a nice product.  Sometimes an individual pick is weak and breaks and can get temporarily stuck between two teeth, but that can be worked around (in fact, it has to be!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since January 22, 2010...the day I finally quit smoking. I went cold turkey after a health scare last year and never looked back, and these \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; as I call them have really helped. Besides the obvious oral gratification involved, there&#x27;s something about pulling out the pack and taking a stick that gives me the ritual that I was so used to with a pack of smokes.  Even when I go out...I have to check whether I have enough sticks or do i need to bring along an extra pack, just like my smoking days. Maybe I&#x27;ve just replaced one habit with another, but it&#x27;s still a whole lot healthier AND cheaper!  Also, my dentist sees a huge difference with my check ups and teeth cleanings!</li>
            <li> These were recommended by my dentist.  I really like these for daily usage.  I believe they have saved my gums.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years.  Work really great for me as I can&#x27;t floss very well.  Wall-Mart stopped carrying them so very happy I can buy these on-line at a lower price than the local retailers.</li>
            <li> Flossing with dental floss was just not in my purview. Years ago I was introduced to Stim-U-Dent.  They are my pals: easy to carry around, can have some in handy places, and do the job very well.  My dentist keeps urging me to use floss, but he can&#x27;t deny my healthy gum tissue and at 79 years old!                [[ASIN:B000GAT6JU Stim-U-Dent Plaque Removers, Mint Flavor 4 - 25 packs [100 picks] (Pack of 10)]]</li>
            <li> I carry these little hi-tech tooth picks in my purse and in my car.  They keep my gums clean! I want my teeth to last as long as I last!</li>
            <li> good  deal , fast shipper</li>
            <li> My husband loves these things and they are really hard to find at any stores here.  They have helped his gums alot and I think they have saved him from having any more surgeries.  This price is really good too.  When I do find them in Denver they are 3 to 4 dollars a pack and this price averages out just under 2 dollars.</li>
            <li> The Amazon picture of this item is of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Stim-u-Dents, which were a great product, but which J&amp;J discontinued making in 2008.  (I learned that from reading other reviews.)  The substitute China-made product is OK, and better than nothing, but it is thicker and more fragile than the J&amp;J product, which is not good.  Either find some old J&amp;J products and sell them--even at a premium--or change the picture!</li>
            <li> This is simply the best oral health product imaginable. Although I have always brushed regularly, I used to dread getting my teeth cleaned because I knew I would be lectured about my gums bleeding. I would think to myself, \\&quot;As vigorously as the hygienist is scraping my teeth at the gumline, of course my gums are bleeding!\\&quot; I was wrong. Gums shouldn&#x27;t bleed, even then. If they do, it is because of an accumulation of plaque. Eventually, a dentist told me that if I didn&#x27;t do a better job of controlling plaque, my gums would have to be surgically slit so they could scrape plaque away from my teeth below the gumline. Needless to say, that got my attention! Yet I still did not know how to prevent plaque from accumulating.    Thank God, not long thereafter a dental technician recommended this product to me, and I am ever-so grateful that she did! I have used it daily ever since (for 15-20 years now), and with excellent results. Each time I go in for cleaning now, they RAVE about how healthy my gums are, and how little-to-no plaque has accumulated. The last hygienist I saw said to me, in a genuinely astonished tone of voice, \\&quot;Whatever you are doing, it REALLY works!\\&quot;     I answered, \\&quot;Each evening as I watch TV (you may as well make additional use of that time), I brush, then floss, then use a Stim-U-Dent pic, and finally a perio aid (which is another indispensable oral-health tool).\\&quot; The Stim-U-Dent pic removes plaque BETWEEN the teeth (like floss, only better), and the perio aid removes plaque from the gumline ALONG the teeth. There is not a doubt in my mind that I will have my teeth for my entire life, with no major dental problems in the interim (or the resulting pain &amp; bills). An ounce of prevention truly is worth a pound of cure.     In conclusion, if you value your teeth and oral health, use this product daily. You will find it as indispensable as I do.     BTW, I recently contacted Johnson &amp; Johnson and learned that they no longer market this wonderful product (J&amp;J sold the rights to it to Caldwell Consumer Health in December, 2008). I then called CCH at 1-888-317-4402 and was told that they market it in the same packaging, although not necessarily via the same retail outlets.</li>
            <li> The product quality is fine, but this is not a \\&quot;Johnson &amp; Johnson\\&quot; product - that company has not made this product since 2008.  The seller, American Wholesale, has removed the Johnson &amp; Johnson name from its product title, but the picture of the packaging still shows it.</li>
            <li> I believe that Amazone misrepresent this product, which was shown as mint flavored Johnson &amp; Johnson Stim-u-dents. The product sent to me was made in China and was not mint flavored. I believe that I should receive a full refund for a product that[[ASIN:B000GAT6JU Stim-U-Dent Plaque Removers, Mint Flavor 4 - 25 packs [100 picks] (Pack of 10)]] was totally misrepresented and of inferior quality.</li>
            <li> The box is much improved from the old flimsy paper that would dump the picks at the drop of a finger. It is glossy and sturdy now, the picks are the same but the mint tast is a bit strange and strong- hope there are no other things in there. They are very good but I can&#x27;t believe we don&#x27;t even make toothpicks in the U.S. anymore. Still a good deal.</li>
            <li> I have been using Stimudents, after meals, exclusively for over thirty years. I found early on that flossing might work for some. But for me, I have a number of teeth with tighter gaps between, causing the floss to break. But with Stimudents, unlike the typical pine hard toothpicks, the soft balsa wood picks easily move between all teeth. Yes I brush my teeth 2-3 times a day too. But when you can&#x27;t, Stimudents are the next best thing. They&#x27;ve helped me keep my teeth and gums healthy for many, many years.</li>
            <li> My teeth will NOT accept any other than Stim-U-Dent for the most clean and STIMUlating !</li>
            <li> I am a person with large hands and small mouth. Students enable me to floss very effectively. This purchase was much less expensive than buying them at any other retail outlet.</li>
            <li> Very good price compare to buying small packs in store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before but this time the toothpicks break very easily, I think this lot was to old.    my brother sent me some, same type and MFG. and they are ok no problem at all.    Ray</li>
            <li> Although these tooth picks are now made in China, I can&#x27;t detect any difference in texture or flavor. I have to assume that the FDA test them for anything harmful. For me they work as expected.</li>
            <li> I love using Stimudents daily.  Although it helps to initially soak in water before use, using one ensures my teeth feel clean beyond brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li> The product I received is distributed by Revive Personal Products...not Johnson and Johnson.  It states it is Made in China.  Don&#x27;t like the quality.  Much cheaper feel to it.  Was afraid I&#x27;d get a sliver from them.  Won&#x27;t re-order.  Don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find the J&amp;J Stim-U-dents in any store (Jewel-Osco, Walgreens, etc., anymore.</li>
            <li> Great product and price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these in any store and love them. I&#x27;ve asked my dentist about them and he thinks they&#x27;re great. I use them every day and am so glad I found a source.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> These little pieces of wood have kept me from having a cavity for years and years. My dental hygienist is always impressed at how good a job I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> seamless transaction. great price.</li>
            <li> This tooth picks a soft and gentle on your gums. I use them after every meal and it helps reduce my cavities. Now they even have thinner ones (blue package) that are even better.</li>
            <li> I will be traveling out of the country and don&#x27;t know if these will be available so I bought in bulk.  I have been using these for years and my dentist is happy.</li>
            <li> These wooden, shaped toothpicks are just right for cleaning all the nooks and crannies&lt;br /&gt;in my teeth. I tried other types but they are not close.</li>
            <li> These are gentle on your gums--much better than toothpicks, which can splinter.  The packaging makes them easy to carry in a pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> Much better for me than dental floss or tape.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing and am happy to have discovered Stim-u-dent.  But they&#x27;re hard to find locally, so the online order was the way to go.</li>
            <li> Been using them for years, but they have gotten expensive in the drug stores if you can find them.  Great price for the original brand.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as expect. Fast Delivery. Thanks!</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for years and our dentist agrees that they help us to keep the plaque under control very well.1</li>
            <li> For me, Stim-U-Dents are a fantastic &amp; cheap secret to ending and even reversing periodontal disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most recent batch I bought, of 1000 picks (10 boxes of 4 x 25 packs) has very good quality, with wood that is uniform and doesn&#x27;t split or splinter, and a very mild mint flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying this brand of Stim-U-Dent for about a year and have in the past I have experienced some of the quality-control problems mentioned in other posts -- wood that tends to splinter, strange or over-strong mint-flavoring -- however, even at their worst they were still quite usable.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great price for these if you are--as I am--a regular user.  Of course, you do have to laugh when you realize that you suddenly have, like, a thousand of the things...</li>
            <li> Good product.  Have been using for years.  Unfortunately, made in China like everything else in the world.  Use to be a J&amp;J product.</li>
            <li> I love these things.  I purchased this larger amount from Amazon because they are difficult to find at the stores where I have bought them in the past.  I use them every day after any meal and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Stim-U-Dents  for three decades.  They have saved my gums.  My dentists have always been pleased with the results that I&#x27;ve been able to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are reviews that state these picks are inferior to the originals,  If they are, the differences are minimal.  The bottom line for me is that the excellent results have not changed.  Use them as directed and use them often.</li>
            <li> These work - perhaps the wood isn&#x27;t as great as the originals, but they work.  A dentist I had suggested these to all his patients 45 years ago &amp; I have never had to deal with gum surgeries nor bleeding gums. Not so my with friends who never had that advice!  I use them about 1 to 3 times a week thoroughly in &amp; out between teeth &amp; also use the flat ends like a brush. Still is good to use floss, but if choosing only 1 it&#x27;s best to use these.</li>
            <li> Excellent and fast service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Stim-u-dents for years. I always used the Johnson &amp; Johnson brand. These are fatter and don&#x27;t go between the teeth for cleaning very well. :(</li>
            <li> This is a recurring order for me.  I buy them by the boxful for my Dad who HAS to have them.  By his recliner, at his office, in the glove compartment, etc.  I&#x27;ve heard him tell folks, &amp;#34;here, you got to try one off these, they&#x27;re really great&amp;#34;.  Suppose he wouldn&#x27;t keep asking for them if he didn&#x27;t like them so much!</li>
            <li> Have used these for over 30 years.  Every time I go to the dentist they ask what I am doing to keep my teeth so healthy.</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as the original, but ok for the price.  Worth the price with free shipping, and better than disposing of plastic hazards.</li>
            <li> Product as expected. Package got beat up pretty good intransit, but I suspect that is USPS issue rather than yours.</li>
            <li> First, this appears to be a serious FALSE advertisement by Amazon. This product SHOULD NOT be listed as a product by Johnson &amp; Johnson.  I ordered them and the box CLEARLY SAYS \\&quot;MADE IN CHINA\\&quot; by a company called \\&quot;Revive Personal Products Company.\\&quot;  There is no excuse for Amazon to not have corrected this misrepresentation after all this time. I see where someone complained about this back in 2011. Amazon, how can you be so unfair and abusive to your customers?  This product is a typical inferior China-made product.  The stimudents are fragile and they split every time and sometimes break off while between your teeth. THIS IS A LOUSY, INFERIOR PRODUCT EVERYBODY!!!!  I did give it 2-stars only because it does remove some of the bits between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I wonder whether Johnson &amp; Johnson even makes this product any longer.  It is not listed on their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN addition, with my recent experience with American Wholesale, they kept trying to rip me off in sending the quantity I ordered. They had to send me 3 different packages before they finally got it right - only after I kept having to complain about the quantity. Shipping the quantity the customer ordered is not rocket science and I took it as intentional.</li>
            <li> Super fast fulfillment. Thank you!</li>
            <li> For those people that don&#x27;t like to floss - I use this product several times a day to get rid of food stuck in between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I get good dental check-ups and they always say &amp;#34;keep doing what you&#x27;re doing&amp;#34; - which always includes the use of Stimudents.&lt;br /&gt;I use them even when I haven&#x27;t eaten a meal since it still feels good to massage my gums.  Even got my wife to enjoy them.</li>
            <li> i have used these for many years after undergoing major gum surgery. the doctor that completed the surgery recommended their use and i have been very happy with them ever since</li>
            <li> very convenient way to buy.</li>
            <li> I love having such a good supply. I&#x27;m addicted to these and they have been difficult to find locally.</li>
            <li> Great love these.  Walmart stopped carrying them so I ordered on here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years.  Excellent to clean between teeth--and usually, in my opinion, obviates the need for flossing and use of a WaterPik, though I have these available  to use when necessary.</li>
            <li> These plaque removers are good for one&#x27;s teeth, yet stores don&#x27;t sell them anymore. My dentist cannot explain why not available.</li>
            <li> I use these to clean my teeth after each meal. Very helpful</li>
            <li> This product was for years sold by Johnson&amp;Johnson and was of higher quality and tasted more minty than does the current offering distributed by Revive and made in China.</li>
            <li> I love these things.  The places I shop quit carrying these and I almost ran out.  Great to find the bulk pack of 1000 on Amazon.  This product really works....better than tooth picks and better than the plastic junk everyone is trying to market.  These wooden triangular shaped picks work so much better and somehow feel gentler on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boo on Walmart and Fred Meyers for dropping these from their shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news....this bulk pack arrived very quickly and worked out less expensive as well.</li>
            <li> we are hooked on these stim-u-dents and use them everyday...we started using them years ago..</li>
            <li> I use these regularly throughout the day as needed. Although I floss I find these are useful at times after a meal or in addition to flossing. I have used these for years and I find they work much better than toothpicks, and are environmentally friendlier than the plastic type of item. I was pleased to orde them from Amazon because they are becoming difficult to find in stores. The price was fair for the product.</li>
