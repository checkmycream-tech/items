            <li>Love the scent, not overpowering but noticeable...</li>

            <li>Products fine just didn&#x27;t care for the perfume.</li>
            <li>These arrived so quickly!  </li>
            <li>buy these mini ones and ENJOY</li>
            <li>Sexy yet elegant and classic.  </li>
            <li>Love the fragrance .. fresh and clean .. would recommend it for day or evening wear.  </li>
            <li>Love it and the fast delivery service!</li>
            <li>When I originally ordered this it didn&#x27;t show up at my doorstep.  </li>
            <li>and the scent is not like the original.</li>
            <li>this is my most fav perfume and i wanted to try before i buy a big bottle.these are the perfect fragrance awith an equal price.well</li>
            <li>Okay the sample smells nice and I will purchase a full size in the future.</li>
            <li>Thanks I will pruse more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good test run before buying the big bottle</li>
            <li>These are samples they even marked out the word free sample,Macy&#x27;s has them if you ask for one:-)</li>
            <li>would say this is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>My favorite new perfume.</li>
            <li>This a lovely new fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Notes of floral against cedar and woods, amazing - if you like Issey Miyake for women, you will probably love this fragrance - it&#x27;s slightly more full-bodied but similar notes in the mix.</li>
            <li>and they sent a complimentary lipstick.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite by far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing, light and it last all day.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last all day!</li>
            <li>My confusion stems from my perception that this scent doesn&#x27;t smell like what I originally smelled at the store which is what made me interested in the perfume in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Products was exactly as described and came in quickly.</li>
            <li>The scent is long-lasting and just right.</li>
            <li>Loved my purchase, as I stated a while ago, this scent is so sophisticated, and subtle, it works for me, I don&#x27;t much care for perfumes anymore,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>You only need a dab and it&#x27;ll leave you smelling like you bathed in wealth :)</li>
            <li>She is still on her first tube and its almost been a month.</li>
            <li>Excellent fragrance, need small parfum for my tiny pruse.</li>
            <li>I definitely did not want to  spend the money without k owing for sure</li>
            <li>THe one problem is that the top is not removable from a regular size bottle fo the Modern Muse in order to fill travel-size bottles -</li>
            <li>I will Also  be  smart and go to the Est√©e Lauder counter in a Belks and spray  </li>
            <li>Great little splurge to have a try-me before you invest in the bigger bottles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Hoping for a real bottle for xmas.</li>
            <li>,it smell&#x27;s very good,but i&#x27;ve all way&#x27;s have been an Estee Lauder girl..</li>
            <li>Very noticeable scent with tons of compliments.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly and included the 3 Modern Muse vials, as well as two other free samples!  </li>
            <li>I really like this new perfume</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like having to spend top dollar for a perfume I love just to have to toss over half of it a year later because perfume definitely does not keep.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance---not too loud or brash.  </li>
            <li>love it &amp;#34; next time I will get the bigger bottle....</li>
            <li>Classic bait and switch/ad..</li>
            <li>Love that the little bottles have spray units.  </li>
            <li>and I love these little travel vials.  </li>
            <li>a sample on my wrist to make sure i want to make the investment as my money is  budgeted and cant afford to waste it on a whim.</li>
            <li>Will give the other two samples to friends as a stocking stuffer for them to enjoy.</li>
            <li>New signature scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new addiction</li>
            <li>Decent scent but not enough to get me to commit to a large bottle.</li>
            <li>Light, fresh, a little lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>when I wear one, I go for a really low profile one, and baby this one is very sensuous!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>The price was good but the shipping is expensive.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that they were just samples, and the fact that the shipping was so high for such a tiny package, well I will not make that mistake again.</li>
            <li>Smells absolutely heavenly - clean and expensive smelling, not a heavy alcohol smell like a lot of fragrances.</li>
            <li>A light, subtle scent that stays all</li>
            <li>The scent of these samples is a nondescript smell that is not interesting and fresh like what I sampled in the store.</li>
            <li>No comments or compliments from anyone good or bad.</li>

            <li> The scent is long lasting and you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> I was curious about this perfume so, i purchased the 3 samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This perfume was received exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think I want to wear any other.</li>
            <li> Does this mean that these samples should not be sold, only given away in stores?  </li>
            <li> Used up in less than two days.</li>
            <li> but that was a lot of money to pay for those 3 little vials of spray.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a bit heavy...</li>
            <li> In the end, in my opinion, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this fragrance and a must have for on the go traveling or just an overnight trip or to slip in your clutch at a wedding and add a little extra oomph throughout the day!</li>
            <li> The shipping charges for these small vials may be prohibitive however.</li>
            <li> Discovering these small vials on Amazon gave me a way to test the fragrance for a longer period.  </li>
            <li> She got a small rub off card sample in mail  one day from Macy&#x27;s of this scent</li>
            <li> After I complained about not getting what I ordered the seller contacted me</li>
            <li> a teensy late.</li>
            <li> Just a small squirt is plenty!</li>
            <li> I could be wrong about the scent, but I don&#x27;t think so.  </li>
            <li> Obsessed with this scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I want to keep this perfume my secret!</li>

            <li> this is the way to test before buying</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a bit heavy...Our family tends to like lighter fragrances, and this one is definitely strong! Not a fan...</li>
            <li> Products was exactly as described and came in quickly.</li>
            <li> I was curious about this perfume so, i purchased the 3 samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a delicious perfume.  Sexy yet elegant and classic.  It is a floral but, not that clinging type floral.  A light, subtle scent that stays all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best I can describe is it is as you would imagine some elegant perfume would smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And its perfect for day or night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is my new favorite.  New signature scent.  the one i will be reaching for all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping for a real bottle for xmas.</li>
            <li> love it &amp;#34; next time I will get the bigger bottle....</li>
            <li> Smells so good I even shared with a friend.</li>
            <li> I love this Estee Lauder perfume, and I&#x27;ve worn Pleasures for years.  THe one problem is that the top is not removable from a regular size bottle fo the Modern Muse in order to fill travel-size bottles - I had to order these vials to have something to travel with.  Beautiful scent...try it!</li>
            <li> When I originally ordered this it didn&#x27;t show up at my doorstep.  After I complained about not getting what I ordered the seller contacted me and I did receive the product.  My confusion stems from my perception that this scent doesn&#x27;t smell like what I originally smelled at the store which is what made me interested in the perfume in the first place.  I could be wrong about the scent, but I don&#x27;t think so.  The scent of these samples is a nondescript smell that is not interesting and fresh like what I sampled in the store. Also, the back of the sample packages I received say \\&quot;Not For Sale\\&quot;.  Does this mean that these samples should not be sold, only given away in stores?  Are they out-of-date samples that the seller somehow got hold of, and that is why they smell off to me?  In the end, in my opinion, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely heavenly - clean and expensive smelling, not a heavy alcohol smell like a lot of fragrances. Notes of floral against cedar and woods, amazing - if you like Issey Miyake for women, you will probably love this fragrance - it&#x27;s slightly more full-bodied but similar notes in the mix.</li>
            <li> These were samples !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Should not have been sold . Should have been given away in stores .&lt;br /&gt; I do not think these were designed to be sold .</li>
            <li> this are great to try the new parfum before buying it ,they give you about 6 to 7 spray&#x27;s,it smell&#x27;s very good,but i&#x27;ve all way&#x27;s have been an Estee Lauder girl..</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought a designer fragrance would ever win me over, but I&#x27;m in love with Modern Muse. It&#x27;s my new addiction and I don&#x27;t think I want to wear any other. The scent is long-lasting and just right. You only need a dab and it&#x27;ll leave you smelling like you bathed in wealth :)</li>
            <li> Very nice - just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that they were just samples, and the fact that the shipping was so high for such a tiny package, well I will not make that mistake again. I did like the Parfum  smell though.</li>
            <li> I really like this new perfume and I love these little travel vials.  They are great to throw in your purse or use on a trip.  The price was good but the shipping is expensive.  I think they should give a discount on shipping when you buy multiples of the perfume.</li>
            <li> Great clean smell! My favorite new perfume. Very noticeable scent with tons of compliments. I want to keep this perfume my secret!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this item I was led to believe I would be recieving (3) tubes of this fragrance? Okay the sample smells nice and I will purchase a full size in the future. Classic bait and switch/ad..</li>
            <li> This perfume was received exactly as expected. Very pleased with sender and they sent a complimentary lipstick.  I thought that was awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be buying the bigger bottle soon</li>
            <li> These arrived so quickly!  I had tested Muse and Muse Rouge in a department store.  Discovering these small vials on Amazon gave me a way to test the fragrance for a longer period.  Now I wish I could get the Muse Rouge ones too!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent. These are good for travelling.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom. She got a small rub off card sample in mail  one day from Macy&#x27;s of this scent and she hasn&#x27;t stopped talking of it since. I wanted to get her a bottle of it, but couldn&#x27;t afford to at the time so the order of the 3 pack (0.05) oz sample tubes was perfect. The scent is long lasting and you only need a small amount. Also like the fact its three spray bottles! She is still on her first tube and its almost been a month. I&#x27;m guessing they will last her three months. For around 4$ plus shipping you can&#x27;t beat this. Order will please you.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t already you should smell this perfume! It&#x27;s a great scent for the summer because it&#x27;s a light smelling fragrance. It is my favorite by far and I always get compliments when wearing it! I like the convenience of being able to I take it wherever I go. This is the second time buying this product! Great scent!!!</li>
            <li> Decent scent but not enough to get me to commit to a large bottle. No comments or compliments from anyone good or bad.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and get compliments when I wear it every time!</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance, need small parfum for my tiny pruse. Thanks I will pruse more.</li>
            <li> Used up in less than two days. Smells really nice</li>
            <li> We love it! I gave one to my mom. I am pleased with the product and the timely delivery of the product. This is a great way to sample before you buy.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. It&#x27;s refreshing, light and it last all day. I get so many compliments wearing this.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this fragrance and a must have for on the go traveling or just an overnight trip or to slip in your clutch at a wedding and add a little extra oomph throughout the day!</li>
            <li> These are samples they even marked out the word free sample,Macy&#x27;s has them if you ask for one:-)</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance----not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to try a new fragrance without spending a lot.  I used to wear Pleasures all the time so I am an Estee Lauder fan.  This a lovely new fragrance.  Light, fresh, a little lasts a long time.  Floral without being overpowering.  Good for day and evening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving one star because it seems it is mixed with water and the scent is not like the original.</li>
            <li> Very nice..... Would buy again.........</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and included the 3 Modern Muse vials, as well as two other free samples!  Great scent.</li>
            <li> great [price.arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance .. fresh and clean .. would recommend it for day or evening wear.  I&#x27;ve told friends about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the perfume but that was a lot of money to pay for those 3 little vials of spray.</li>
            <li> Great little splurge to have a try-me before you invest in the bigger bottles.  I love that there&#x27;s 3 in this set - one for your vanity, one for your purse, one for your desk at work.  The scent is lovely - warm but not too spice, and not too light.</li>
            <li> Smells so good. I keep one in my makeup bag. I love it</li>
            <li> this is my most fav perfume and i wanted to try before i buy a big bottle.these are the perfect fragrance awith an equal price.well packaged.came a teensy late.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome!  Just a small squirt is plenty!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of perfume so this worked perfectly for me. I don&#x27;t like having to spend top dollar for a perfume I love just to have to toss over half of it a year later because perfume definitely does not keep.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, not overpowering but noticeable... I have received many compliments</li>
            <li> Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t last all day! I would still buy from seller! :)</li>
            <li> Loved my purchase, as I stated a while ago, this scent is so sophisticated, and subtle, it works for me, I don&#x27;t much care for perfumes anymore,&lt;br /&gt;but when I wear one, I go for a really low profile one, and baby this one is very sensuous!&lt;br /&gt;And the perfume company did a great job packaging the perfume samples, and it was delivered in an  expedient&lt;br /&gt;time frame, the service was  good.</li>
            <li> Smells great, I received a lot of compliments and asked for the brand name.</li>
            <li> Smells so good! It&#x27;s a good test run before buying the big bottle</li>
            <li> We are given a chance to get an idea of what that Est√©e Lauder scent smells like. They are samples. Wish the shipping had been lower. Will decide from these samples weither or not i desire to purchase that scent . I will Also  be  smart and go to the Est√©e Lauder counter in a Belks and spray  a sample on my wrist to make sure i want to make the investment as my money is  budgeted and cant afford to waste it on a whim. Will give the other two samples to friends as a stocking stuffer for them to enjoy.</li>
            <li> Great... Smelled this in a magazine and had to try it. I definitely did not want to  spend the money without k owing for sure I would like it</li>
