            <li>i absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered it more than once!</li>
            <li>I spoke to the people at Koru Naturals and they are extremely nice and helpful.</li>
            <li>Our whole family uses this product and since we&#x27;ve depleted our supply, I&#x27;ve purchased through Amazon (Amazon had the best price).  </li>
            <li>Arrives nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sweet, like honey of course!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>I had read of the many benefits of Manuka Honey and wanted to try it myself.</li>
            <li>I love this body butter.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product -</li>
            <li>Just love the lotion.  </li>
            <li>Tea is ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Best product I have found for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased to find it available on Amazon and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and lovely ( if you like honey) and it makes your skin feel like silk.</li>
            <li>Some might not want that in a body cream, but I love the light honey like scent of this cream.</li>
            <li>I bought this in New Zealand three years ago and was happy to find the exact same jar online, technology is wonderful sometimes.</li>
            <li>Certainly easy to recommend this product.</li>
            <li>First off - this stuff is amazingly creamy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It ruins what would be a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I use it on my arms where I have cuts and large scratches with great fast healing results</li>
            <li>It has what I consider a light scent.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so ridiculously smooth</li>
            <li>I love the way it is absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is smooth, healing cream.</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li>Ingredients listed (among the stabilizing/binding agents) are jojoba oil, cocoa butter, shea butter, Manuka honey, sweet almond oil, and bees wax, but the amounts aren&#x27;t listed.</li>
            <li>I also like the mild, sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>Mild smell like honey, but the smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I actually like the honey scent, light and nice.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s rich and creamy, absorbs well into the skin and has only a very light, non cloying fragrence.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to see a moderately priced body butter work so effectively for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Get the large size!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve liked all of the Wild Ferns manuka honey products.</li>
            <li>First time using this Manuka honey.  </li>
            <li>At first it feels as if your skin will not absorb it.</li>
            <li>Great for guys thick skin.</li>
            <li>I wish I had read the ingredient list first.</li>
            <li>Only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is my preference for a more perfume-y body lotion.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin soft and smooth and stays all day.  </li>
            <li>The skin feels very smooth for a while after a single use.</li>
            <li>Your&#x27;s might not, but if you have seriously dry skin like I do, it just drank it right up and left my skin feeling soft, smooth, refreshed and nicely moisterized.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used large amounts of honey in my bath water and not had this smell.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but the container and quality of the product are deserving.</li>
            <li>Wild Ferns Manuka Honey Cream Body Butter is well worth the try.</li>
            <li>but this really worked for her.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizing, could be also used as hand cream.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I also have several dogs with long nails and my arms have many cuts and scratches from them jumping on me and my playing with them........</li>
            <li>While on a  trip of a life time to New Zealand we found this product for sale everywhere.</li>
            <li>I went on vacation to New Zealand a couple years ago and bought this cream.  </li>
            <li>I discovered this product while on a trip to New Zealand and have been ordering it ever since.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling very soft &amp; silky.  </li>
            <li>Very thick and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized especially during the summer months when my skin gets so much sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>I bought some wild ferns manuka honey soap on vacation.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to odors and this never causes me any problems.</li>
            <li>I also have the Manuka Honey Wild Ferns Lotion and it works just as well and also stays all day.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll find it to be competitive if not less.</li>
            <li>My skin is still soft and smooth the next morning and no longer looks like a cracked, dried desert.  </li>
            <li>Really helps to relieve my winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li>We will reorder when the large jar is about 1/2 empty.</li>
            <li>Now it is a bit expensive but most decent</li>
            <li>Spoiled like I am, I was kinda hoping for something a little more flower-honey smelling and less medicinal-honey. &#x27;</li>
            <li>I am a guy and dry skin is normal for me.</li>
            <li>and this last over 24hours and keeps my skin hydrated soft and younger looking-</li>
            <li>I am 50+ and have very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff as always!</li>
            <li> I bought some wild ferns manuka honey soap on vacation. I loved the fragrance and the feel and wished I&#x27;d bought some lotion or cream. I was so pleased to find it available on Amazon and gave it a try.  It&#x27;s fabulous! The scent is light and lovely ( if you like honey) and it makes your skin feel like silk. I spoke to the people at Koru Naturals and they are extremely nice and helpful. Manuka honey is known world wide for its healing properties. Try this body butter, your skin will thank you!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this creme. It&#x27;s got the BEST light fragrance and goes on smoother than any lotion. Not too greasy, it makes my skin think I&#x27;ve been at the spa all day. Thank GOODNESS I stumbled upon someone&#x27;s recommendation!</li>
            <li> First time using this Manuka honey.  It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized especially during the summer months when my skin gets so much sun exposure.  Love the smell and it melts into your skin.  I will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> I am a guy and dry skin is normal for me. My wife 8ses other manuka products for her skin care and everything has been thrown away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a man saver in making my skin younger and I need it. We will reorder when the large jar is about 1/2 empty. Try it....no more shiney skin</li>
            <li> I am 50+ and have very dry, sensitive skin. I had read of the many benefits of Manuka Honey and wanted to try it myself. I adore this cream! It has a whipped texture that feels a lot like butter but lighter. At first it feels as if your skin will not absorb it. Your&#x27;s might not, but if you have seriously dry skin like I do, it just drank it right up and left my skin feeling soft, smooth, refreshed and nicely moisterized. After my shower while my skin was still damp, I slathered this on, rubbed it in well and felt just great. It has what I consider a light scent. Some might not want that in a body cream, but I love the light honey like scent of this cream. I really have nothing negative to say about this cream. I love it and will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> As a frequent swimmer who lives in a cold environment, I need a rich body moisturizer.  This fits the bill perfectly.  During the winter i also use it on my hands to keep the annoying cracked skin under control.</li>
            <li> I have really dry legs and this last over 24hours and keeps my skin hydrated soft and younger looking- Great for guys thick skin.</li>
            <li> This smell is so intoxicating but not overwhelming whatsoever. It&#x27;s very sweet, like honey of course! It leaves your skin so ridiculously smooth i absolutely love it! Now it is a bit expensive but most decent body butters are. What i always do to ensure the quantity of such minimal size lasts is just cut IT with some regular body lotion and this will still make you feel DIVINE!</li>
            <li> everythink i got on time and the quality is good. Thank you</li>
            <li> I love this body butter. Absorbs quickly, leaves no greasy feelings behind. Wonderful for dry skin. Mild smell like honey, but the smell dissipates quickly. I have been using this product since 2008. I am sensitive to odors and this never causes me any problems. All of this brands products I have used are now the only products I use.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  Mainly used on arms and lets and it&#x27;s gotten rid of all my &#x27;dry&#x27; spots, small abrasions, etc.  I will buy this product again not only for me but also for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Love it, Goes on very nicely, smells wonderful. Leaves skin feeling very soft &amp; silky.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> While on a  trip of a life time to New Zealand we found this product for sale everywhere. After testing it on our  trip we knew we had to take some home. Our whole family uses this product and since we&#x27;ve depleted our supply, I&#x27;ve purchased through Amazon (Amazon had the best price).  If your are considering this product, think about this: What one product has your entire family ever used (each member in mine reach for Manuka before anyother lotion)? Also check out the price and you&#x27;ll find it to be competitive if not less. Wild Ferns Manuka Honey Cream Body Butter is well worth the try.</li>
            <li> This body butter lotion is excellent quality and has a wonderful smooth texture. Highly recommended. It&#x27;s nice to see a moderately priced body butter work so effectively for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the ingredient list first. I cant believe they put blue #1 and Yellow #5 in this.&lt;br /&gt;It ruins what would be a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen and the skin on my arms is very thin....I also have several dogs with long nails and my arms have many cuts and scratches from them jumping on me and my playing with them........I use it on my arms where I have cuts and large scratches with great fast healing results</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite lotion.  I went on vacation to New Zealand a couple years ago and bought this cream.  I was ecstatic when I found it on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve ordered it more than once!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product while on a trip to New Zealand and have been ordering it ever since. It smells fabulous and is an awesome moisturizer. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  I actually like the honey scent, light and nice.  Certainly easy to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Really helps to relieve my winter dry skin.  Very thick and smells nice.  Arrives nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> First off - this stuff is amazingly creamy. Very little to no film left behind. Ingredients listed (among the stabilizing/binding agents) are jojoba oil, cocoa butter, shea butter, Manuka honey, sweet almond oil, and bees wax, but the amounts aren&#x27;t listed. Feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the smell - be prepared. I&#x27;ve used large amounts of honey in my bath water and not had this smell. It is definitely honey, but to me it smells like a lemon and honey cough drop. Spoiled like I am, I was kinda hoping for something a little more flower-honey smelling and less medicinal-honey. &#x27;Perfume&#x27; is listed as an ingredient, again not the amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally - this is good stuff. A little pricey, but the container and quality of the product are deserving. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is my preference for a more perfume-y body lotion.</li>
            <li> Bought this for me niece who just had a baby.  She said her skin was excessively dry but this really worked for her.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat that my my manukau honey makes a big difference in your skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick, but a tiny dab goes a long way. The skin feels very smooth for a while after a single use. Really moisturizing, could be also used as hand cream.</li>
            <li> I love the way it is absorbed into my skin.  Not greasy or oily at all.  I also like the mild, sweet smell.  Best product I have found for my dry skin.  I am considering purchasing as gifts for my sisters.</li>
            <li> Works and Helps dry skin. Have used it several years. It has improved the quality of my aging skin. Get the large size!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve liked all of the Wild Ferns manuka honey products. Smells nice. Not greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this in New Zealand three years ago and was happy to find the exact same jar online, technology is wonderful sometimes.</li>
            <li> she  loves  the  feel  on  her  skin  and  it smells great  ---no  need for  parfume, she  is  often  asked  what she  is  wearing</li>
            <li> The Manuka Honey cream body butter is excellent. It is so moist it works wonders on my dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I love this product - it&#x27;s rich and creamy, absorbs well into the skin and has only a very light, non cloying fragrence.  I will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just love the lotion.  Tea is ok. Would not order it again</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have very dry, sensitive skin.  This makes my skin soft and smooth and stays all day.  My skin is still soft and smooth the next morning and no longer looks like a cracked, dried desert.  I also have the Manuka Honey Wild Ferns Lotion and it works just as well and also stays all day.</li>
            <li> This is smooth, healing cream. I use it daily for myself. In addition, I use it on one of my dogs who has exposed healed skin from being burned by someone before she was rescued.</li>
