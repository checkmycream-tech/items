            <li>This polish is wonderful.</li>
            <li>this is the best.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT!!!  </li>
            <li>This is a very good nail polisher.</li>
            <li>I tossed that but still needed something to repair my superficial pride and joy.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Very nice nail treatment.</li>
            <li>:-P  </li>
            <li>Did not get this for me, but I was told it was good and</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>If you purchase this product, I hope it works much better for you!</li>
            <li>product works just perfect for me, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>moisturize my nails with a meyer lemon and olive oil blend that is a cooking oil, not specifically for nails, but the internet told me that was ok.</li>
            <li>All the women in my family love this stuff.</li>
            <li>One downer, though, is that I can&#x27;t seem to get any polish put on top of it to not bubble.</li>
            <li>After making sure that I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update the review when I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>, it makes your nails appear more smooth, it strengthens your nails and makes them grow faster.</li>
            <li>I bought SH shiny top coat to help and that stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Sally Hansen&#x27;s products (mostly base/top coats; I love Super Shine, for instance, which I just went back to) and I&#x27;ve been using them for years,</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails, but creates a great bond.</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly, and I could handle the smell when I first put it on, but eating anything for hours and hours to come makes me crinkle my nose.  </li>
            <li>She invited me to touch her nails, which I did, and I admit they were strong and smooth, with blue nail polish on top.</li>
            <li>My nails are still breaking beneath the quick.  </li>
            <li>This is the best and my favorite base coat that I own.  </li>
            <li>lady in the cosmetics section was quite proud of her nails, and swore up and down that this was the product to buy:  none of the $3 Sally Hansen solutions, no:  </li>
            <li>On top of that, even the polish remover didn&#x27;t remove it completely.</li>
            <li>Using this product my nails are much healthier and is the only way I can have a full set of nice nails.</li>
            <li>Just the same nail care solution, but with more moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>on my hands regularly, and I make sure to leave blobs of it on my nails and cuticles each</li>
            <li>Buy it and thank me later :)</li>
            <li>this product your nails will grow fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I love this because I&#x27;m not allowed to wear nail polish at my school and it makes my short stubby nails look really pretty....</li>
            <li>Twice as good compared to the green</li>
            <li>must say that this product does more than I expected.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>, so I haven&#x27;t pained my nails much since college.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and even my boyfriend has noticed how much of an improvement it&#x27;s been.  </li>
            <li>HAHAHA  </li>
            <li>used to get very upset when my nail&#x27;s got broke, but not any more.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I tried the SH Complete Care in a green bottle first, and that was truly amazing.</li>
            <li>tend to ruin even those professional manicures within 2 hours (and certainly within 2 days!)</li>
            <li>This is the main product I use on my nails.  </li>
            <li>On second thought, I used it for the first time together with a nail polish I also used for the first time...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought China Glaze before, but not this particular color.</li>
            <li>When I cut them down to the quick, they simply began to split beneath the quick!  </li>
            <li>So, to my horror, after months of well, frankly, abuse, my nails were splitting left and right.</li>
            <li>Left and right hand that is.</li>
            <li>I started using this stuff about two weeks ago and to my utter amazement, it started helping right away.</li>
            <li>First time I bought this at the local drugstore, I hesitated because of the price.  </li>
            <li>I think that polish might be doing it, unless the bubbles are created by the residue I couldn&#x27;t clean well enough last night.</li>
            <li>Then I found this one in a local pharmacy and decided why not -- the description looked promising.</li>
            <li>I like my fingernails natural looking, just glossy and clear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not even in the pool anymore, as it closed a couple of weeks ago - right when I started using this</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff and when it was new went on very nicely, but shelf life doesn&#x27;t seem to be as long as some other products I have used...what I have left is too thick now to use, but thankfully I don&#x27;t have a lot left</li>
            <li>I found a general rule about nails.  </li>
            <li>(Still have about 15 fun dark colors, but only for toes!)</li>
            <li>so when I saw something new, I jumped on it assuming it&#x27;ll be at least as good, if not superior.</li>
            <li>I wish I hadn&#x27;t tossed the box as I never expected such a result, but I&#x27;ll still attempt to return it</li>
            <li>I have thin, brittle nails that peel, warp, and break easily.</li>
            <li>My hands bring food to my face, which puts them beneath my nose, and the icky toxic solvent smells are strong for a long, long time.  </li>

            <li> This polish is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I tried the SH Complete Care in a green bottle first, and that was truly amazing. Then I found this one in a local pharmacy and decided why not -- the description looked promising. Just the same nail care solution, but with more moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that this product does more than I expected. It moisturizes very well, it makes your nails appear more smooth, it strengthens your nails and makes them grow faster. Twice as good compared to the green bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that two of my six friends who tried the treatment in a green bottle had the opposite effect: their nails became very fragile. Nobody of them had any problems with the &#x27;Extra Moisturizing&#x27; version so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works just perfect for me, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Did not get this for me, but I was told it was good and what she was looking for, so I guess it does the job.</li>
            <li> Always use as a base coat...keeps nail polish from chipping and nails from splitting. This is the only base coat I use....after trying several others..this is the best.</li>
            <li> I love it! This is a very good nail polisher. Dries fast. No air bubbles. This is a second time I purchase it.</li>
            <li> I typically only get manicures for job interviews, weddings, and funerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to ruin even those professional manicures within 2 hours (and certainly within 2 days!), so I haven&#x27;t pained my nails much since college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started exercising in a heavily chlorinated outdoor pool, however, and my nails started splitting.  When I cut them down to the quick, they simply began to split beneath the quick!  Even my toenails started to break.  I held them together with duct tape at the office, then ran out to the nearest drugstore to buy something - anything! - that would keep my protective nails intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lady in the cosmetics section was quite proud of her nails, and swore up and down that this was the product to buy:  none of the $3 Sally Hansen solutions, no:  this one!  She invited me to touch her nails, which I did, and I admit they were strong and smooth, with blue nail polish on top. (Hey, you go, granny! I think she said she was 80)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time of this review, this listing is under five bucks, while the drug store version was over 13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I&#x27;ve been putting one coat on per day, three days in a row, after which the nail polish mysteriously cracks off, and they all peel.  I don&#x27;t know why it does that!  The toenail polish stays on longer - over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even in the pool anymore, as it closed a couple of weeks ago - right when I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moisturize my nails with a meyer lemon and olive oil blend that is a cooking oil, not specifically for nails, but the internet told me that was ok. :-P  I also use [[ASIN:B005CPZFWQ Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Hand Cream, Fragrance-Free, 2 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] on my hands regularly, and I make sure to leave blobs of it on my nails and cuticles each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two big beefs with this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  My nails are still breaking beneath the quick.  They&#x27;re all shiny/purdy, but they&#x27;re still crack-a-lackin&#x27;like I&#x27;ve never seen before.  It&#x27;s absurd&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The.  SMELL.  It dries very quickly, and I could handle the smell when I first put it on, but eating anything for hours and hours to come makes me crinkle my nose.  My hands bring food to my face, which puts them beneath my nose, and the icky toxic solvent smells are strong for a long, long time.  We went out with friends yesterday, and I was still wrinkling my nose 4 hours after I painted my nails.  UGH.  I have ordered [[ASIN:B00CS3T4PY Piggy Paint MAKE IT LAST (2PK) - Basecoat and Topcoat Paired Up!]] and hope it will function better, or at least not smell so awful for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things this product does well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is pretty&lt;br /&gt;2.  It dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it. I&#x27;m still using it because I&#x27;m desperate, but I&#x27;m actively pursuing other options.  If you purchase this product, I hope it works much better for you!</li>
            <li> I have thin, brittle nails that peel, warp, and break easily. With any other polish or nail builder, my nails continue to be brittle and break. Using this product my nails are much healthier and is the only way I can have a full set of nice nails.</li>
            <li> Very nice nail treatment. Keeps it glossy while helping the nails at the same time. All the women in my family love this stuff.</li>
            <li> ** update - I am taking off a star as it makes any polish you put in it bubble severely. ** I&#x27;d take off another star but it does work so it is effective; just disappointing you can&#x27;t wear a polish with it. I have been very cruel to my nails over the last 8 mos or so. Lots and lots of glitter polish  (my mid-life crisis) and one gel manicure (wedding). So, to my horror, after months of well, frankly, abuse, my nails were splitting left and right. Left and right hand that is. I ditched the glitter polish but the nails were still breaking and splitting when to my horror, I noticed I&#x27;d been using an acetone remover. No wonder they were beat up. I tossed that but still needed something to repair my superficial pride and joy. I started using this stuff about two weeks ago and to my utter amazement, it started helping right away. One nail hasn&#x27;t been long in months (still isn&#x27;t) but the nail now feels like it finally has some strength again. One downer, though, is that I can&#x27;t seem to get any polish put on top of it to not bubble. I bought SH shiny top coat to help and that stuff is fantastic. Makes my nails look like they&#x27;re a gel manicure.</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS had very thin brittle nails that break and chip.  I could literally bend my nails.  I would go get gel manicure and get the overlays and my nails would still break and/or chip. So I gave up on that. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and even my boyfriend has noticed how much of an improvement it&#x27;s been.  And ladies, you know if a man notices, it&#x27;s gotta be a BIG difference.  Either that, or he noticed I&#x27;ve stopped complaining about another nail breaking. HAHAHA  Anyways, it works!!  My nails are stronger and I can no longer bend them, I can FINALLY file them without them splitting.  Buy it and thank me later :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the base and top coat for months and I LOVE IT!!!  I found a general rule about nails.  After making sure that I prep/prime my nails with a non-acetone nail or a primer, now I&#x27;m having a long lasting wear out of my nail polish.  This is the best and my favorite base coat that I own.  My polish dries faster and my nails are stronger.  The only thing that is a problem is that toward the end of the bottle the product gets thick.  I add some polish remover to the product to make it as thin as it was when i first bought it.  It still works.</li>
            <li> If you have a thin nails or not growing fast enough for you, this is the product i recommended!&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t be lazy with it....&lt;br /&gt;I gave someone to try it and after first time she put it on, then she&#x27;s got lazy and NOT put it on for couple of months, then she complained it&#x27;s not working....&lt;br /&gt;I used to get very upset when my nail&#x27;s got broke, but not any more.&lt;br /&gt;With this product your nails will grow fast!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my nails, but creates a great bond. This is my favorite base coat for the price. I paint my nails 2 -4 times a week, which can damage my nails. However, using this as a base coat minimizes dryness and cracking. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is the main product I use on my nails.  Makes them shiny, and lasts for around a week or so.  Low maintenance.</li>
            <li> Seems like it makes your nails grow but it just kept chipping of when I wash the dishes or taking a shower...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gunna rate it:&lt;br /&gt;Shiny Nails- 10&lt;br /&gt;Stronger Nails-8&lt;br /&gt;Faster Growing Nails-8&lt;br /&gt;Ridge Filling-7&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love this because I&#x27;m not allowed to wear nail polish at my school and it makes my short stubby nails look really pretty....I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like my fingernails natural looking, just glossy and clear.  First time I bought this at the local drugstore, I hesitated because of the price.  Now, it&#x27;s my go-to nail polish and can&#x27;t be without it.  It is longer lasting than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  (Still have about 15 fun dark colors, but only for toes!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Sally Hansen&#x27;s products (mostly base/top coats; I love Super Shine, for instance, which I just went back to) and I&#x27;ve been using them for years, so when I saw something new, I jumped on it assuming it&#x27;ll be at least as good, if not superior. This stuff is horrible!!! It creates some weird and huge bubbles. Your nails look as if you have leprosy! On top of that, even the polish remover didn&#x27;t remove it completely. I wish I hadn&#x27;t tossed the box as I never expected such a result, but I&#x27;ll still attempt to return it (I didn&#x27;t buy it from amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. On second thought, I used it for the first time together with a nail polish I also used for the first time... I&#x27;ve bought China Glaze before, but not this particular color. I think that polish might be doing it, unless the bubbles are created by the residue I couldn&#x27;t clean well enough last night. I&#x27;ll update the review when I&#x27;m sure. I really didn&#x27;t think that Sally Hansen would make something THAT bad. Maybe the polish is the culprit...</li>
