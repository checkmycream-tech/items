            <li>Lathers up very nicely.  </li>
            <li>but I got to say it is pleasant and smells great.</li>
            <li>The sticks lather up amazing!  </li>

            <li>Excellent producteven as cheap as they are.</li>
            <li>The Arko stick lasts for months and it&#x27;s a superior traveling soap.</li>
            <li>Good soap.</li>
            <li>Nothing, though, that some good aftershave/moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>Like I said its a good value but its nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li>Good lather, smell&#x27;s like PEZ candy sort</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the Valobra stick, but is also about 1/8 the price.</li>
            <li>If you want a good lather, Arko delivers.</li>
            <li>Good shave soap at a good price.</li>
            <li>when there is a good amount of stubble on my face.</li>
            <li>I think it smells good</li>
            <li>Cheap and excellent quality - smell like a man</li>
            <li>Arko, despite its wrapping and non-regal smell, shaves as good as anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Good for face lathering and travel.  </li>
            <li>arrived on time and in good shape.</li>
            <li>so this is a good value.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell too good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While lurking the forums Arko came up as being cheap, providing a great lather in all water types and great slickness.</li>
            <li>I have way too many really great smelling options to continue with this soap.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s OK since it coats well, for a great glide.</li>
            <li>Arko soap is a great bargain and one of my favorite soaps.  </li>
            <li>Arko would not be at the bottom of my list but not at the very top either.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this soap  gret value.</li>
            <li>Although I kind of like the smell of the soap, I did not find it to give a good shave.  </li>
            <li>But it does soap up good and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Creates a great lather, and it smells very clean.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, your brush, which has been soaking in a mug of hot water from the shower (shaving in the shower is best</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a stick or lathered on-face before but this stuff is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love the smell!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the scent!  </li>
            <li>I can best describe the smell as clean and lemony; if Ivory soap and lemon PEZ had a love child Arko shave soap would come out.</li>
            <li>Soap is easy to use and the lather is great but it provides zero protection.</li>
            <li>Worked great and really easy to do.</li>
            <li>Very cheap to obtain, and probably a good choice to take with you during your travels.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great cheap soap.</li>
            <li>The shave I get from the Arko is real smooth with no irritation.</li>
            <li>For me I personally liked the smell.  </li>
            <li>I run it under warm water, rub it on my face and head</li>
            <li>The lather is off the hook, and it protects my face nicely.</li>
            <li>but I find it nice.</li>
            <li>Nice stuff</li>
            <li>This is a water loving soap</li>
            <li>I figured it would make a nice travel size soap for when I&#x27;m on the road.</li>
            <li>or they just liked it and didnt care for the smell.  </li>
            <li>effective, and cost effective.</li>
            <li>Lather with cushion that is superior to many more-expensive products.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my face had a nice BBS feel with no razor burn.</li>
            <li>then I use my badger brush to get a nice foam.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll leave a clean smell, which won&#x27;t win any medals</li>
            <li>This shave soap lathers great and has a clean, no depth, soap smell.</li>
            <li>I had heard great things about Arko and they are true.</li>
            <li>I dries very quickly, and does not provide good protection.  </li>
            <li>no skin irritation like ussual and very easy to lather.</li>
            <li>I put it in a twist up stick container, it makes it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stink, doesn&#x27;t smell very good, but it certainly isn&#x27;t off-putting.  </li>
            <li>it was cheap and had good reviews.  </li>
            <li>so far this is the best thing for my face to shave with.</li>
            <li>Of all the shave soaps I&#x27;ve used this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shave soap I have ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried many of the most highly praised soaps)!  </li>
            <li>Rubbing some on my face and then using a soft synthetic bristle brush on my face has created a wonderful cushioning lather.</li>
            <li>of the reviews had mentioned that this soap could build a very rich, nicely foaming lather.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap and very easy to lather.</li>
            <li>Lathered up exceptionally easy!</li>
            <li>not overly perfumed good clean scent</li>
            <li>great soap, easy to lather, nice cushioning, great shave, especially for the cost.  </li>
            <li>Got what I paid for, pretty happy but it could be cheaper.</li>
            <li>These are very inexpensive and create a great lather very easily.  </li>
            <li>it is very cheap.</li>
            <li>I have mine mashed in a mug,and this lets me make a very smooth lather.</li>
            <li>used my Maggard MR6 razor with an Astra SP and the shave was very smooth.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light, not overbearing at all.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, economical, easy to use, performs well, looks and smells retro.</li>
            <li>, I would say that this product is great for someone with the right type of skin (oily) who is fine with its distinctive scent.</li>
            <li>I love shaving sticks</li>
            <li>Edwin Jagger razor, or a vintage Gem single-edge razor, and results are comparable to my favorite soap ([[ASIN:B000GHYXG4</li>
            <li>After reading a number of reviews, I decided to place an order, and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap, the way it lathers, and the cushion it provides.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>most of the disk of soap is still there</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Great Product, Fast S&amp;H.</li>
            <li>Also the lather itself was stiffer and more creamy than any glycerin based soap I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>For my money, Tallow based soaps are just better for lather</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>this is a top notch performer.</li>
            <li>I used this for years before discovering better soaps.</li>
            <li>i plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>i also use it as a soap in the shower love it</li>
            <li>but personally I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Better in every way, probably the best shaving product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also get 2 of them, probably last me a year, considering that i shave once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>Not even close :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even remember how Wms or Colgate soaps lathered, as they aren&#x27;t on the shelves around here any more.  </li>
            <li>Arko soap is okay for shaving.</li>
            <li>so be sure to use plenty when making lather.  </li>
            <li>more as an emergency backup.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed the smell of it as well.</li>
            <li>Cheap and effective.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth shave but does have a rather &amp;#34;industrial clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>:  No, it does not smell like TOBS, nor does it smell like any exotic scent of soap you might buy from an artisan soap maker.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, it just smells like soap.</li>
            <li>It lathers great and is very creamy.  </li>
            <li>Great soap, very &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>But I use this stuff more.</li>
            <li>use your favorite brush, get it damp by running it under some water.</li>
            <li>This may not be an issue for those with more oily skin however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend you buy more than 2 at a time to save even more.  </li>
            <li>Makes it even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive soap, and a great value.  </li>
            <li>Many people complain about the smell</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>There are many fancy smelling soaps out there, if that is your priority.</li>
            <li>Also the more product rubbed on the face... the thicker the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I happen to love the smell as well.  </li>
            <li>so I could use more (if that makes any sense).  </li>
            <li>You either love Arko or not.  </li>
            <li>In my case, it is one of my favorite shaving soaps.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it and will likely buy more after I run out.</li>
            <li>To me, this seller had the most convenient packaging of the Arko shave stick - a two pack.</li>
            <li>- just ok.  </li>
            <li>I have others I like better and those I wont use ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like someone said before, \\&quot;like magic, lather appears.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>think the Arko stick is better than the Palmolive stick.</li>
            <li>I find the Arko stick to produce more lather, dries out slower, thus be more slicker than the Palmolive.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>I have tried several soaps that are suppose to be the best of the best, but I always come back to this on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite in terms of lather texture or smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Arko for more than 4 months.</li>
            <li>- not that I am against that, it does have it&#x27;s place, but I wanted something economical and providing good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I started with the two pack.</li>
            <li>Bought a two pack to try and glad I did.</li>
            <li>Sure, I like Trumper&#x27;s almond cream -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps what I like most is that this stuff creates a slickness that the creams don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to try Arko after hearing so many compliments about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell is okay, but not aromatic.</li>
            <li>I have bought tons of shaving soap and cream from reputable makers.</li>
            <li>I get better lather.</li>
            <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I get an interesting smell and the smell of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even shaving cream in a can might be better.  </li>
            <li>i love that it&#x27;s a stick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible by any means.</li>
            <li>I keeps this on the top of my shower door and use it 1-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>I have been using shaving soap for many years and had never heard of this product, but I am glad that I discovered it.  </li>
            <li>I love these shaving sticks and find them waaaaay better than using a bowl with soap or cream.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive, but very effective.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of a clean cottony citrus like smell.</li>
            <li>Arko smells like a nice, clean soap.  </li>
            <li>Classic and great...</li>
            <li>That is what a good $30 double edged razor, a good $12-15 brush, and $15 for five years worth of good disposable blades has brought me to.</li>
            <li>However, if you are on a budget, or if you just need a nice soap for travel or to change it up a little bit, Arko is perfect.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d easily pay more if it had a pleasing sent.</li>
            <li>Builds an amazing lather fairly quick.</li>
            <li>If you like simple and effective, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>That said, it gives a very easy and clean shave without perfume smells.</li>
            <li>Excellent shaving soap, great value also, I have been using the first stick for a few months and it doesn&#x27;t seem like I have put a dent in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to make a good lather with this</li>
            <li>Nice rich lather and clean refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>It washes off fine after (without drying out my skin) and while it is there the razor just glides better.</li>
            <li>The Arko came super quick and in good shape.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good shave soap, especially when used with a pre-shave cream or oil.  </li>
            <li>It really is amazing and worth trying for this price.</li>
            <li>I think they are much better sticks out there even though this is really cheap.  </li>
            <li>The Arko sticks are also great for travel as they&#x27;re compact and can be applied directly to your face avoiding the need for a mug/bowl.</li>
            <li>Found great idea online where somebody used old deodorant dispensers to put Arko in.</li>
            <li>the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>If there was 4.5 stars this would better fit.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well and feels good on my face.</li>
            <li>To get a good lather, I use an inexpensive badger brush with the bulk of the water gently shaken out of it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth trying it no matter what kind of razor you are using.</li>
            <li>and right away they lathered amazingly on my face.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I&#x27;ll use original barbasol, which gives better protection than the arko.  </li>
            <li>The soap has a nice smell and the hot shaving soap on the brush really did feel good on my face.</li>
            <li>I still use a brush and bowl but have been getting excellent results by applying the stick to the more challenging areas on my chin and below the jaw line before lathering up as usual.</li>
            <li>This stuff is way cheaper than other products out there, with excellent performance.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>so well and so easy.</li>
            <li>This soap stick lathers easily.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 6 sticks for just under $12 including shipping and received my order very quickly.</li>
            <li>It lathers VERY quickly.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve ordered a couple of plastic twist up tubes in 2 oz size to place them in, so that is an easy fix.  </li>
            <li>Lathers quite easily.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat it being so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong Ivory soap smell, but if that doesn&#x27;t bother you, you should fare well.</li>
            <li>Very good product; I will probably be using it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li>Much better experience; the smell isn&#x27;t as strong, actually not to bad.</li>
            <li>After using it for the first time this morning, here is my honest assessment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell</li>
            <li>It is very good shaving soap one of the best in the world (5 stars),  the scent is ok after you get accustom to it; I would describe the scent as Odd Foreign, Lemony, flowery.</li>
            <li>A nice clean and fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>scent sort-of reminds me of some kind of cleaning solution or laundry soap - it is a clean fresh scent that I do like;</li>
            <li>Very good lather as others have stated, and the smell is somewhat antiseptic, but it does well, and doesn&#x27;t get dry and pasty as I shave like</li>
            <li>Cheap and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It lathers fine but not to the level of the Col. Conk product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, nice and slick plus a great lather easy to use</li>
            <li>Totally worth it to save some money and smell pretty good.</li>
            <li>smells like soap which is fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Lathers more quickly than a soap puck.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed trying this Turkish shaving stick product the very first time.</li>
            <li>No--there are better soaps available and you can certainly spend more to get what you like.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shave:  On the whole, Arko provides a nice, smooth glide for your razor.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this on a whim because of the reviews and the cheap pricing.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, especially for its price.</li>
            <li>If you can shave comfortably with just about anything, then 1)</li>
            <li>Fantastic must try product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard such great things about Arko,  I wanted to give Arko another try</li>
            <li>hopefully this review is helpful blades are equally important</li>
            <li>Mt DE blade glides smoothly across my face.  </li>
            <li>For me, the soap&#x27;s purpose is to give a smooth shave, which this does.  </li>
            <li>It smells like soap from a cheap hotel.  </li>
            <li>After that it just has a light soapy smell with just a hint of lemon.</li>
            <li>That enables me to enjoy Arko&#x27;s convenience and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However the shave is smooth and it does it&#x27;s job during the shave.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy, hope this helps.</li>
            <li>After 45 years of shaving you would think that I would have known about all shaving products available</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Its CHEAP, and to me it smells a bit like Ivory.</li>
            <li>but since then I have scaled back on the load time in the bowl and just worked on my face with great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tallow based product so it lubricates the skin making for a smooth shave and reduced nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>For shaving I make sure my skin is nice and wet and rub the stick all over (kind of like chapstick for your legs)...</li>
            <li>They are often available in packs of twelve</li>
            <li>old school good - cheap, performs, and clean</li>
            <li>Super uber performer, smell light not my favorite but disapates quickly</li>
            <li>It lathers really well and has a nice clean soapy scent to it.</li>
            <li>You will enjoy a rich lather every time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to create a lather, but it dries quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my go-to, but it lathers up to quickly and easily</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems that the lather dries out a bit quickly but that could easily be because of my inexperience with using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I found it not to be very worthwhile, you can get much better mug soaps for a similar price.  </li>
            <li>thing: you will need some kind of after shave lotion because the Arko soap does dry out the face somewhat, but any kind of soap will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good, thick foam with a pleasant odor.  </li>
            <li>Tabac Original By Maurer &amp; Wirtz For Men.</li>
            <li>at first i did not like the smell but after a day or two it smelled alot better</li>
            <li>Turning this into a puck inside a mug significantly improved my results.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered two sticks</li>
            <li>I recently purchased two sticks of this Arko shaving soap after reading some of the reviews as I was looking for a cheaply priced soap that would lather good and provide me with a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The price is great and the stick lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The Hungarian manufacturer got this very right.  </li>
            <li>It is a clean soapy smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean scent in my opinion and it doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering smell, so you can apply aftershave with no worries of contrasting smell.  </li>
            <li>I solved the problem with the purchase of a child size toothbrush from the dollar store and now that I have a safety razor I still use the brush to clean it and the blade after each use.</li>
            <li>I find it to be a clean, soapy scent</li>
            <li>most important point is that it lathers really well with a brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just rub the stick over my face and I&#x27;ll get a super smooth shave.</li>
            <li>and I find the soapy smell of it pleasant enough.</li>
            <li>Works as good or better as any other soap out there</li>
            <li>This shaving soap is pure magic.</li>
            <li>nothing special</li>
            <li>Lather that takes minimal effort to produce, which is great on a rushed weekday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just finished the job with my badger brush for a full lather shave.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, clean scent and provides a nice, slick lather that makes shaving easy.</li>
            <li>True to it&#x27;s reputation, this soap is a lather monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad at all but also not a manly musky smell either.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fast, easy, and provides a smooth shave (if the razor does its part).  </li>
            <li>Arko&#x27;s scent is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger too long once I finish my shave.  </li>
            <li>It has a sweet lemon scent to it that makes you feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many, many different shave soaps.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, this has the best traditional &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; smell ever!</li>
            <li>I use it weekday mornings to get a quick shave in before work.</li>
            <li>If you smash a stick of Arko into a bowl and lather directly on top of it, you will use more and it won&#x27;t last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its aroma requires a bit of forbearance, but fairly quickly, the shaver, if not the shaver&#x27;s wife, grows to accept it.  </li>
            <li>Mild soap and makes your razor glide over your skin.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong scent to it that makes me think of those &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; colognes like Brut or Old Spice.</li>
            <li>In short, while not luxurious it is very effective and very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a good dirt cheap soap.</li>
            <li>But aside from my crappy skin this soap does the job and is pretty cheap $$.</li>
            <li>Smells good, lathers well, the stick make it easy to apply whether you wet it and slap it on, or lather it up with a brush first.  </li>
            <li>You may find you have a new favorite soap, both in terms of price and shave quality.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use as is for face lathering, but if you prefer bowl lathering it is soft enough that it can easily be packed into your favorite shaving mug for easy loading of your brush.  </li>
            <li>THESE ARE A GREAT VALUE AND PROVIDE A SLICK SMOOTH SHAVE.</li>
            <li>this item works very well and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so strong that the whole bathroom has taken on its smell even though it is sitting in a medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>These little sticks are great for travel or when you need to shave quick.  </li>
            <li>It applies easily and within a few good brush strokes with your boar or badger whips into a substantial lather.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong at first but does go away.</li>
            <li>This soap is very quick to lather to making a nice lather for me very quickly like any other tallow soaps but of course you millage may very.</li>
            <li>Generates a very thick lather and provides excellent skin protection while promoting close shaves.  </li>
            <li>I use Arm N Hammer deodorant, the kind in the yellow dispenser.</li>
            <li>Why not go a step further and make your own shave stick.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>And yes I am using a nice genuine badger brush and a good mug, the problem is the soap, sadly.</li>
            <li>It was fun to try though.</li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street used to be my favorite until I decided to try Arko.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that its better to cut off a portion of it and lather in a cup, applying it directly to your face then brushing your face doesn&#x27;t work well even though that is what this soap is for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy, just a great product that is really inexpensive, and performs better than much more expensive products.  </li>
            <li>I mixed some with Almond oil, some with rose oil, and one with sandalwood oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read good reviews of Arko Shave stick on Redddit&#x27;s Wicked Edge: this product performs as expected.</li>
            <li>I worked up a good lather against my stubble field by rubbing the stick over my wet face.  </li>
            <li>Use a wet shaving brush to work up a good lather, using a circular motion over your face</li>
            <li>For the price this stuff is worth a try.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, Arko is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arko is worth trying if you use a shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of protecting you from the sharp blade you are dragging across your face.</li>
            <li>Based on other reviews around the web, it seemed that people either loved this stuff</li>
            <li>While my whole bathroom smelled like Arko when I first unwrapped it, the scent is now much more gentle and</li>
            <li>With a low cost and high performance, this product is superior to those overpriced soaps.</li>
            <li>right here, some people cut it up into there shave bowl and use the brush that way</li>
            <li>I hit it right</li>
            <li>Price is definitely right, too.</li>
            <li>It has a clean soap smell unlike the other soaps available, so you will read love it/</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the scent to be very strong and reminiscent of lemon-scented pledge.  </li>
            <li>I have used lots of brands in the past but this is the best so far it lathers quickly and very efficiently</li>
            <li>Does the easy lather, good cushion and slick part very well.</li>
            <li>This was my fist time using this soap and right from the first 90 seconds of working my brush</li>
            <li>The lather was strong enough to lubricate properly and ward off razor burn, which is more important to me.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the best-smelling stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried, but it&#x27;s clean, slightly medicinal, kind of citrus-lemony.</li>
            <li>It just takes a lot of water because this soap is kind of dry.</li>
            <li>The smell is rather strong - kinda like old fashioned Ivory Soap</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get as much lather from the arko, but it will make your skin feel a healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>The shaving stick format promotes easy lather technique directly on the face with shaving brush of choice.  </li>
            <li>You can of course just rub it directly on your face and lather up with a brush, but it&#x27;s neater/cleaner in the twist up dispenser (and smaller, which is good for travel).</li>
            <li>I cut a quarter inch slice of the soap, put it in a coffee mug, added a little hot water and worked up a good lather with the brush.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way for making a superb lather.</li>
            <li>I find that most scents come off after applying aftershave, so it is only something I consider during the shave.</li>
            <li>I was using a locally made specialty soap that cost more than three times what these sticks run.  </li>
            <li>Then, with warm and wet brush, rub that layer of goodness into your beard.</li>
            <li>I will definetly be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>I ended up pressing it into a bowl and loading my brush first.</li>
            <li>The first time i tried the puck and put it in my mug.</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li>Opened 1 stick and it lathers pretty well</li>
            <li>Still have just over 1/2 of the first stick.  </li>
            <li>I put a stick in a food processor then microwaved on low to heat it up to make it more pliable.</li>
            <li>I then put it in an empty cleaned deodorant container that twists up from the bottom and works nicely in the shower and for travel.</li>
            <li>It doesnt smell pretty.  </li>
            <li>It does not come in pretty packaging.  </li>
            <li>Prep your face with some hot water</li>
            <li>The first thing you immediately notice is the smell.</li>
            <li>Just tried Arko for the first time.</li>
            <li>When you first use the Arko shave soap you notice the smell.</li>
            <li>Im still on my first stick</li>
            <li>Nice lather, not much of an odor, smells like ivory bar soap.  </li>
            <li>Lathers very easily but is a bit dry compared to my home-grown shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I tried a single stick and liked it so much I bought a 12 pack.</li>
            <li>: when I was using a multi-track razor I often wished I had a brush to clean the blade of things that wouldn&#x27;t rinse out easily like soap residue or loose bristles from my shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Very clean smell that last well after the shower.</li>
            <li>Compared to some of the other soaps I have used this stuff lathers up really nice.</li>
            <li>While I absolutely love arko I had to take a star off as I noticed by the time you finish one side of your face the other side begins drying rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Just like what others have said, this stick does make a great lather quickly: just wet your face, rub this stick over the stubble, and swirl a wet shaving brush over your face to build the lather.  </li>
            <li>I will save my Trumper&#x27;s cream for special occasions, though I don&#x27;t know if I will order more when it runs out because I can get a dozen Arko sticks for less than one jar of Trumper&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Arko lathers wonderfully and you are only using a small amount!</li>
            <li>The positive aspects of this product outweigh the negatives for me.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very affordable and consistent.</li>
            <li>This stuff is dirt cheap and gives you a nice thick lather in a mug without a whole lot of effort.</li>
            <li>What is almost universally agreed upon is that it lathers easily.  </li>
            <li>It blows up with lather nice soap, I dont know it&#x27;s an odd lemon/lien smell...</li>
            <li>The proraso left my skin smooth, but not soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li>The very low price has no relation to the performance of this fine product.</li>
            <li>had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Proraso green in its little bowl, and it is excellent stuff, but quite pricey when you figure it all out.  </li>
            <li>Washes off easily with a few splashes and leave the face feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>A real shaving delight for those switching to a DE experience.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work too well for me this way.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t suds as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>But really had no problems.</li>
            <li>For me, It didn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>Any minimal remaining Pez scent is fully gone after your favorite aftershave is applied.</li>
            <li>I bought a straight razor and ordered this shaving soap, a badger brush and a strop.</li>
            <li>really a bargain.</li>
            <li>Created a thicker, richer lather than Williams and a MUCH richer thicker lather than Conks.</li>
            <li>I expected much more out of this shave soap than what I got.</li>
            <li>It tended to be very lacking in the lather dept.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for this much at all.</li>
            <li>the chemical spell really puts me off.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive and reliable.</li>
            <li>Well, since I born and raised in Turkey i know this product very well.</li>
            <li>I had an empty 5oz tub that I pressed the sticks into which works better for me.</li>
            <li>I use this with a safety razor and a straight razor.</li>
            <li>All said I really like Arko and will always have a stick in my travel kit when I don&#x27;t want to pack my Prorasso.</li>
            <li>That way it is also readily packable in a shaving kit or luggage.</li>
            <li>It is really quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather:  </li>
            <li>but I found if you unwrap the stick and leave it out for a couple of weeks whatever perfume it has outgassed into the atmosphere and the shaving soap doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can also cover the mug with a lid so my whole bathroom doesn&#x27;t smell like a barbershop.</li>
            <li>The shave is so much smoother with no irritation</li>
            <li>but I like it so much that I went ahead and ordered Amazons 12+3 stick package just in case</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to buy a whole box; so, I went with this seller.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not ready to call myself an &amp;#34;Arko man&amp;#34; or anything, but I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;m one of those people who don&#x27;t mind the scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I haven&#x27;t tried every soap out there, but you really can&#x27;t beat Arko when it comes to price, convenience and quality.</li>
            <li>Now, I am a very practical guy</li>
            <li>Where it really shined is when I got it to my face because it exploded like popcorn in a kettle.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>A bought this soap to use with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>Easy to lather, nice and slick, relatively protective.</li>
            <li>i really like it and find myself wanting to use it more than my other shaving creams and soaps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced more razor burn with this product than any other shave cream, including my other wet shaving soap which is proraso.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, especially for a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I happen to love that smell but have heard other people say they use it for the performance not the scent.</li>
            <li>Most other shaving soaps and creams are now ruined for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is such a great value for something that seems like is going to last a very long time.</li>
            <li>It smells clean, similar to Ivory soap</li>
            <li>Arko soap makes it easy to apply soap directly to my face, then lather with short circular brush strokes on my face.</li>
            <li>This is going to be short and sweet.  </li>
            <li>Easy to lather and quick slick.</li>
            <li>Nothing more nothing less.</li>
            <li>I would personally prefer a more traditional scent</li>
            <li>I expect that the tubes I received will last for many months and when they are gone, I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li>Far better than an empty can or even a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;m not one of the people that particularly minded the scent-</li>
            <li>; the wrapper back enough to expose the product, the wrap a rubber band around the wrapper at the bottom for a better grip.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly for travel and got a twist up tube to contain it from West Coast Shaving.</li>
            <li>Great for travel &amp; camping since you can just drag it across each cheek and build a lather without packing a bowl and barely getting soap wet.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I find this preferable because I don&#x27;t want a highly scented soap mixing with the aftershave products.  </li>
            <li>recommend this stuff highly.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need all the fancy high dollar stuff</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It produces tons of slick protective lather very easily.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft enough that the screw in the middle of the container went through pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Easily and quickly whips up into à thick, luxurious lather.</li>
            <li>And it tends to leave the soap residue and clog my DE razor much like dried soap-scum on a shower which wont easily clean out with just rinsing it in a sink of hot water.  </li>
            <li>The smell is kind of hard to describe.</li>
            <li>An Arko soap doesn&#x27;t care how hard your tap water is, what kind of skin you have or what type of brush</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m back to wet shaving again I&#x27;m glad I found this soap in USA thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li>It lathers reasonably well when I put it directly on my face.</li>
            <li>Get more coverage on the face and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>it is extremely important for the brush to be soaked in hot water for a few minutes then use brush and apply soap</li>
            <li>you have a true allergic reaction to the smell though, you might want to go else where since it (the smell) never completely disappears.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the extra time and energy.</li>
            <li>The straight razor is going to take a lot more than a strop to get it sharp enough to shave with</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel kind of guilty that all my more expensive soaps have kind of dropped out of the rotation and just sit there now.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll just continue using it til it&#x27;s time for a new slice.</li>
            <li>One other thing to mention is that the soap is fairly soft, so if you wanted you could put it in a bowl and press it to the bottom fairly easy.</li>
            <li>For anyone who wet shaves, regardless of your razor of choice, this soup has a classic, clean,  soft scent.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>After many months, still have an entire stick left for future use (bought two to begin).</li>
            <li>Given the cost per use and performance of Arko, I am not sure if there is a better shaving soap/cream value out there.</li>
            <li>, I got a tip from someone that just peels back a little bit of paper and runs the soap under hot water, then rubs the stick directly to the face and then uses a wet shave brush in circular motion to create a lather, had enough in the brush to do a 3 pass shave great stuff</li>
            <li>Some shavers will press this into a bowl, which is not hard to do because it&#x27;s soft.  </li>
            <li>lathers up OK smells like the cheapest of all cheap soaps leaves your skin extremely dry after not much good to say about it except it works to shave with</li>
            <li>New blade or old</li>
            <li>You basically use it like a roll of lifesavers, open the top, and tear down the package as you use it.  </li>
            <li>I was toying with the idea of getting the big pack of these, but for as long as two will last me, I figure I will want a break from this scent after the year or more</li>
            <li>I can usually get a good lather with other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>Previously, I have used Cremo shave cream in a tube and plain Dove soap, both of which did a good job on my beard.</li>
            <li>And this soap has lasted me the entire year so far shaving 5 times a week, and I am only on the first stick!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how thin soapy bubbles on the end of the brush explode into a creamy luxurious lather which keeps thickening as the brush sets inside a shaving bowl or mug.  </li>
            <li>I have found it easiest to use by inserting it into a 1 inch clear plastic mailing tube cut to length, then using it as a push-up.  </li>
            <li>I plan to mash one into an old tin and try it out like I would a puck.  </li>
            <li>also I have sensitive skin-</li>
            <li>I started with this shaving soap 27 years ago when i was 16 years old.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>To me it smells like the old fashioned soap bars, before they were routinely scented.  </li>
            <li>the plus side, I&#x27;d never used a shave stick before, and I found it really practical to use, especially while on the road.</li>
            <li>The added bonus is that this soap is inexpensive and a stick lasts a long time, 5 months for the first stick I bought.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen plenty of reviews of this product and I am actually surprised that it works as well as I&#x27;ve seen in videos.  </li>
            <li>And as far as the smell,it smells like soap.</li>
            <li>like any shave soap or cream, you need to learn how much water your brush holds and shake out enough to achieve the lather you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>I lather directly on my face -</li>
            <li>.. But not harsh on my skin in any way.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to figure out how much water to include in the lather, but once I figured it out, all I had left to do was figure out the logistics of the stick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product for anyone who wants to shave like a pro and save money at the same time!</li>
            <li>Lathers instantly and doesn&#x27;t use much water.&lt;br /&gt;Stays in my hygiene kit and goes with me to the field.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even have to grate it into a bowl, and rub it directly on brush and face.</li>
            <li>the Taylor Old Bond did.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps this was my fault for possibly loading it too much -</li>
            <li>I was surprised at</li>
            <li>and I can see one stick lasting a very longtime.</li>
            <li>Basically, smells like old barber&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li>And rub directly on your skin.</li>
            <li>If you use a shaving brush, this stuff is as old barber style as it gets.  </li>
            <li>This tallow based soap produces an amazingly thick lather but it takes a bit more work to do so than with a glycerine based soap or cream.</li>
            <li>Not very slick</li>
            <li>I however, love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several other soaps and creams (all more expensive), but none of them lather as easily or as much as my Arko stick.  </li>
            <li>This soap is extremely inexpensive, but available only by mail order whereupon shipping exceeds the cost of the item.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for less than a burger, fries, and a drink off a value menu.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit lemony, which I&#x27;m not crazy about, but other than that, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>, I can get three applications from the brush for first pass, second and third.</li>
            <li>My beard is very thick, and even curly, so if you have an average, easy beard, than this will probably be fine.  </li>
            <li>Yes the smell is different than normal</li>
            <li>THe lather is good, but not nearly as rich and thick as Arko&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find it requires a little more water than other soaps I have used</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to have wet enough lather--too dry</li>
            <li>This soap dried my face more than any other.</li>
            <li>You do have to be careful not to use too much water though.</li>
            <li>I have only used it 3 times so far</li>
            <li>but it is very pricey, and I went to DE wet shaving to save money.</li>
            <li>scent is a very basic soapy scent with a hint of masculine lemon.</li>
            <li>so I use it to shave my head as well), rub it on my shave brush in a circular motion for about 10 seconds, and then take the brush to my face/head to create a thick smooth lather.</li>
            <li>Smell is ok but not great.</li>
            <li>Arko quickly produces huge amounts of slick, protective lather with very little effort (the lather is similar in quality to Tabac).</li>
            <li>In less than a minute I have thick, slick, incredibly cushioning lather.</li>
            <li>The hype over the scent, well, it does have a strong soap scent that some either love, tolerate, or hate.</li>
            <li>one complaint is the fact that the simple wrapping doesn&#x27;t make it easy to travel with once you open a stick.</li>
            <li>For travelling, I use an old glue stick container and pressed soap into it and use that to rub on my wet face, and lather up with a brush directly on my face.</li>
            <li>If you are a wet shave enthusiast, It is by no means a replacement for Shave soap and and decent brush.</li>
            <li>Does dry out a bit quicker than some other soaps (mostly talking about glycerin soaps) but for the price and how far very little goes, it is a hell of a deal.</li>
            <li>I grabbed my boar brush and with a little water quickly mixed up a nice foam, even in the Phoenix hard water.</li>
            <li>Some say that is smells like urinal cakes and moldy tortillas and the like, but really, it just smells like plain old Ivory soap with a hint of a lemon.  </li>
            <li>The scent was a bit strong when first unwrapped but after cutting up and pressing one stick into a cup, it mellowed a bit.</li>
            <li>The lather was lackluster when I tried to flake this into a mug and build with it like other soaps, but it almost immediately produced an amazing lather when I coated a thin layer and face lathered.</li>
            <li>Whether I ever get the straight razor sharp enough to shave with or not I&#x27;m sticking with the shaving soap and brush.</li>
            <li>The lather lasted longer than both Williams and Conks, but nowhere near as long as Proraso&#x27;s cream.</li>
            <li>you prefer to bowl lather, you can wet the bowl, or stick and rub the inside of the bowl and then lather as normal.</li>
            <li>I pack this and the FrankShaving Travel Brush (Chrome Aluminum tube) in a plastic (covered) soap dish for travel, takes less room than a tub of shave soap, large brush, and razor.</li>
            <li>I prefer Taylor of Old Bond Street for everyday, but this is a decent alternative for travel.</li>
            <li>soap has become the benchmark for other soaps to test against and will be my main go to.</li>
            <li>It also did dry my face out considerably, but it&#x27;s nothing my aftershave couldn&#x27;t remedy.</li>
            <li>While this soap can be lathered on the face straight from the stick that seemed kind of awkward and messy for me because the whole stick got wet</li>
            <li>So as far as ease of use, long lasting basically anything relating to its use</li>
            <li>For anyone confused on how to use a shave stick it is pretty straight forward.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately I have sensitive skin and have to work a really strong lather to avoid irritation.</li>
            <li>clear positive is that the soap stayed hard after being used multiple times.</li>
            <li>I then slowly start swirling the brush over the whole face until the lather starts to build, then start moving more briskly until it becomes very thick.  </li>

            <li> The Arko stick is great.  </li>
            <li> These work great</li>
            <li> Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> Great product and price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and consider Arko to be a very good value.</li>
            <li> I used the Omega Bambino Brush in my travel kit and along with the Arko it made a very nice lather.</li>
            <li> Lathers up very nicely.  </li>
            <li> but I got to say it is pleasant and smells great.</li>
            <li> The sticks lather up amazing!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shaving creams and soaps in my life and this is the best!</li>
            <li> This a good product at a great price.  </li>
            <li> Great cheap soap, works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great aroma and a wonderful smooth shave.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend told me I smelt pleasant after the shave.</li>
            <li> It lathers easily and gave me an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to achieve perfect foam .</li>
            <li> Great smell, great post-shave and fantastic slickness!</li>
            <li> Lather is good -</li>
            <li> Excellent producteven as cheap as they are.</li>
            <li> The Arko stick lasts for months and it&#x27;s a superior traveling soap.</li>
            <li> Good soap.</li>
            <li> Nothing, though, that some good aftershave/moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> It smells good too.</li>
            <li> Like I said its a good value but its nothing to write home about.  </li>
            <li> Good lather, smell&#x27;s like PEZ candy sort</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as the Valobra stick, but is also about 1/8 the price.</li>
            <li> If you want a good lather, Arko delivers.</li>
            <li> Good shave soap at a good price.</li>
            <li> when there is a good amount of stubble on my face.</li>
            <li> I think it smells good</li>
            <li> Cheap and excellent quality - smell like a man</li>
            <li> Arko, despite its wrapping and non-regal smell, shaves as good as anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Good for face lathering and travel.  </li>
            <li> arrived on time and in good shape.</li>
            <li> so this is a good value.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While lurking the forums Arko came up as being cheap, providing a great lather in all water types and great slickness.</li>
            <li> I have way too many really great smelling options to continue with this soap.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s OK since it coats well, for a great glide.</li>
            <li> Arko soap is a great bargain and one of my favorite soaps.  </li>
            <li> Arko would not be at the bottom of my list but not at the very top either.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this soap  gret value.</li>
            <li> Although I kind of like the smell of the soap, I did not find it to give a good shave.  </li>
            <li> But it does soap up good and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Creates a great lather, and it smells very clean.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, your brush, which has been soaking in a mug of hot water from the shower (shaving in the shower is best</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a stick or lathered on-face before but this stuff is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love the smell!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the scent!  </li>
            <li> I can best describe the smell as clean and lemony; if Ivory soap and lemon PEZ had a love child Arko shave soap would come out.</li>
            <li> Soap is easy to use and the lather is great but it provides zero protection.</li>
            <li> Worked great and really easy to do.</li>
            <li> Very cheap to obtain, and probably a good choice to take with you during your travels.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is great cheap soap.</li>
            <li> The shave I get from the Arko is real smooth with no irritation.</li>
            <li> For me I personally liked the smell.  </li>
            <li> I run it under warm water, rub it on my face and head</li>
            <li> The lather is off the hook, and it protects my face nicely.</li>
            <li> but I find it nice.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff</li>
            <li> This is a water loving soap</li>
            <li> I figured it would make a nice travel size soap for when I&#x27;m on the road.</li>
            <li> or they just liked it and didnt care for the smell.  </li>
            <li> effective, and cost effective.</li>
            <li> Lather with cushion that is superior to many more-expensive products.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my face had a nice BBS feel with no razor burn.</li>
            <li> then I use my badger brush to get a nice foam.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll leave a clean smell, which won&#x27;t win any medals</li>
            <li> This shave soap lathers great and has a clean, no depth, soap smell.</li>
            <li> I had heard great things about Arko and they are true.</li>
            <li> I dries very quickly, and does not provide good protection.  </li>
            <li> no skin irritation like ussual and very easy to lather.</li>
            <li> I put it in a twist up stick container, it makes it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stink, doesn&#x27;t smell very good, but it certainly isn&#x27;t off-putting.  </li>
            <li> it was cheap and had good reviews.  </li>
            <li> so far this is the best thing for my face to shave with.</li>
            <li> Of all the shave soaps I&#x27;ve used this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> This is the best shave soap I have ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried many of the most highly praised soaps)!  </li>
            <li> Rubbing some on my face and then using a soft synthetic bristle brush on my face has created a wonderful cushioning lather.</li>
            <li> of the reviews had mentioned that this soap could build a very rich, nicely foaming lather.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap and very easy to lather.</li>
            <li> Lathered up exceptionally easy!</li>
            <li> not overly perfumed good clean scent</li>
            <li> great soap, easy to lather, nice cushioning, great shave, especially for the cost.  </li>
            <li> Got what I paid for, pretty happy but it could be cheaper.</li>
            <li> These are very inexpensive and create a great lather very easily.  </li>
            <li> it is very cheap.</li>
            <li> I have mine mashed in a mug,and this lets me make a very smooth lather.</li>
            <li> used my Maggard MR6 razor with an Astra SP and the shave was very smooth.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light, not overbearing at all.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, economical, easy to use, performs well, looks and smells retro.</li>
            <li> , I would say that this product is great for someone with the right type of skin (oily) who is fine with its distinctive scent.</li>
            <li> I love shaving sticks</li>
            <li> Edwin Jagger razor, or a vintage Gem single-edge razor, and results are comparable to my favorite soap ([[ASIN:B000GHYXG4</li>
            <li> After reading a number of reviews, I decided to place an order, and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap, the way it lathers, and the cushion it provides.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> most of the disk of soap is still there</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Fast S&amp;H.</li>
            <li> Also the lather itself was stiffer and more creamy than any glycerin based soap I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> For my money, Tallow based soaps are just better for lather</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> this is a top notch performer.</li>
            <li> I used this for years before discovering better soaps.</li>
            <li> i plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> i also use it as a soap in the shower love it</li>
            <li> but personally I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Better in every way, probably the best shaving product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also get 2 of them, probably last me a year, considering that i shave once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Not even close :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even remember how Wms or Colgate soaps lathered, as they aren&#x27;t on the shelves around here any more.  </li>
            <li> Arko soap is okay for shaving.</li>
            <li> so be sure to use plenty when making lather.  </li>
            <li> more as an emergency backup.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I also enjoyed the smell of it as well.</li>
            <li> Cheap and effective.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave but does have a rather &amp;#34;industrial clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> :  No, it does not smell like TOBS, nor does it smell like any exotic scent of soap you might buy from an artisan soap maker.  </li>
            <li> Love this soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, it just smells like soap.</li>
            <li> It lathers great and is very creamy.  </li>
            <li> Great soap, very &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> But I use this stuff more.</li>
            <li> use your favorite brush, get it damp by running it under some water.</li>
            <li> This may not be an issue for those with more oily skin however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend you buy more than 2 at a time to save even more.  </li>
            <li> Makes it even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive soap, and a great value.  </li>
            <li> Many people complain about the smell</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> There are many fancy smelling soaps out there, if that is your priority.</li>
            <li> Also the more product rubbed on the face... the thicker the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I happen to love the smell as well.  </li>
            <li> so I could use more (if that makes any sense).  </li>
            <li> You either love Arko or not.  </li>
            <li> In my case, it is one of my favorite shaving soaps.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it and will likely buy more after I run out.</li>
            <li> To me, this seller had the most convenient packaging of the Arko shave stick - a two pack.</li>
            <li> - just ok.  </li>
            <li> I have others I like better and those I wont use ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like someone said before, \\&quot;like magic, lather appears.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> think the Arko stick is better than the Palmolive stick.</li>
            <li> I find the Arko stick to produce more lather, dries out slower, thus be more slicker than the Palmolive.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> I have tried several soaps that are suppose to be the best of the best, but I always come back to this on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite in terms of lather texture or smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Arko for more than 4 months.</li>
            <li> - not that I am against that, it does have it&#x27;s place, but I wanted something economical and providing good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I started with the two pack.</li>
            <li> Bought a two pack to try and glad I did.</li>
            <li> Sure, I like Trumper&#x27;s almond cream -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps what I like most is that this stuff creates a slickness that the creams don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to try Arko after hearing so many compliments about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell is okay, but not aromatic.</li>
            <li> I have bought tons of shaving soap and cream from reputable makers.</li>
            <li> I get better lather.</li>
            <li> Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I get an interesting smell and the smell of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even shaving cream in a can might be better.  </li>
            <li> i love that it&#x27;s a stick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible by any means.</li>
            <li> I keeps this on the top of my shower door and use it 1-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using shaving soap for many years and had never heard of this product, but I am glad that I discovered it.  </li>
            <li> I love these shaving sticks and find them waaaaay better than using a bowl with soap or cream.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, but very effective.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of a clean cottony citrus like smell.</li>
            <li> Arko smells like a nice, clean soap.  </li>
            <li> Classic and great...</li>
            <li> That is what a good $30 double edged razor, a good $12-15 brush, and $15 for five years worth of good disposable blades has brought me to.</li>
            <li> However, if you are on a budget, or if you just need a nice soap for travel or to change it up a little bit, Arko is perfect.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d easily pay more if it had a pleasing sent.</li>
            <li> Builds an amazing lather fairly quick.</li>
            <li> If you like simple and effective, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> That said, it gives a very easy and clean shave without perfume smells.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving soap, great value also, I have been using the first stick for a few months and it doesn&#x27;t seem like I have put a dent in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to make a good lather with this</li>
            <li> Nice rich lather and clean refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> It washes off fine after (without drying out my skin) and while it is there the razor just glides better.</li>
            <li> The Arko came super quick and in good shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good shave soap, especially when used with a pre-shave cream or oil.  </li>
            <li> It really is amazing and worth trying for this price.</li>
            <li> I think they are much better sticks out there even though this is really cheap.  </li>
            <li> The Arko sticks are also great for travel as they&#x27;re compact and can be applied directly to your face avoiding the need for a mug/bowl.</li>
            <li> Found great idea online where somebody used old deodorant dispensers to put Arko in.</li>
            <li> the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> If there was 4.5 stars this would better fit.</li>
            <li> It lathers very well and feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> To get a good lather, I use an inexpensive badger brush with the bulk of the water gently shaken out of it.  </li>
            <li> Well worth trying it no matter what kind of razor you are using.</li>
            <li> and right away they lathered amazingly on my face.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I&#x27;ll use original barbasol, which gives better protection than the arko.  </li>
            <li> The soap has a nice smell and the hot shaving soap on the brush really did feel good on my face.</li>
            <li> I still use a brush and bowl but have been getting excellent results by applying the stick to the more challenging areas on my chin and below the jaw line before lathering up as usual.</li>
            <li> This stuff is way cheaper than other products out there, with excellent performance.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> so well and so easy.</li>
            <li> This soap stick lathers easily.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 6 sticks for just under $12 including shipping and received my order very quickly.</li>
            <li> It lathers VERY quickly.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve ordered a couple of plastic twist up tubes in 2 oz size to place them in, so that is an easy fix.  </li>
            <li> Lathers quite easily.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat it being so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong Ivory soap smell, but if that doesn&#x27;t bother you, you should fare well.</li>
            <li> Very good product; I will probably be using it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Much better experience; the smell isn&#x27;t as strong, actually not to bad.</li>
            <li> After using it for the first time this morning, here is my honest assessment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell</li>
            <li> It is very good shaving soap one of the best in the world (5 stars),  the scent is ok after you get accustom to it; I would describe the scent as Odd Foreign, Lemony, flowery.</li>
            <li> A nice clean and fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> scent sort-of reminds me of some kind of cleaning solution or laundry soap - it is a clean fresh scent that I do like;</li>
            <li> Very good lather as others have stated, and the smell is somewhat antiseptic, but it does well, and doesn&#x27;t get dry and pasty as I shave like</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It lathers fine but not to the level of the Col. Conk product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, nice and slick plus a great lather easy to use</li>
            <li> Totally worth it to save some money and smell pretty good.</li>
            <li> smells like soap which is fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Lathers more quickly than a soap puck.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed trying this Turkish shaving stick product the very first time.</li>
            <li> No--there are better soaps available and you can certainly spend more to get what you like.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave:  On the whole, Arko provides a nice, smooth glide for your razor.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim because of the reviews and the cheap pricing.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, especially for its price.</li>
            <li> If you can shave comfortably with just about anything, then 1)</li>
            <li> Fantastic must try product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard such great things about Arko,  I wanted to give Arko another try</li>
            <li> hopefully this review is helpful blades are equally important</li>
            <li> Mt DE blade glides smoothly across my face.  </li>
            <li> For me, the soap&#x27;s purpose is to give a smooth shave, which this does.  </li>
            <li> It smells like soap from a cheap hotel.  </li>
            <li> After that it just has a light soapy smell with just a hint of lemon.</li>
            <li> That enables me to enjoy Arko&#x27;s convenience and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However the shave is smooth and it does it&#x27;s job during the shave.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy, hope this helps.</li>
            <li> After 45 years of shaving you would think that I would have known about all shaving products available</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Its CHEAP, and to me it smells a bit like Ivory.</li>
            <li> but since then I have scaled back on the load time in the bowl and just worked on my face with great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tallow based product so it lubricates the skin making for a smooth shave and reduced nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> For shaving I make sure my skin is nice and wet and rub the stick all over (kind of like chapstick for your legs)...</li>
            <li> They are often available in packs of twelve</li>
            <li> old school good - cheap, performs, and clean</li>
            <li> Super uber performer, smell light not my favorite but disapates quickly</li>
            <li> It lathers really well and has a nice clean soapy scent to it.</li>
            <li> You will enjoy a rich lather every time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to create a lather, but it dries quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my go-to, but it lathers up to quickly and easily</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems that the lather dries out a bit quickly but that could easily be because of my inexperience with using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I found it not to be very worthwhile, you can get much better mug soaps for a similar price.  </li>
            <li> thing: you will need some kind of after shave lotion because the Arko soap does dry out the face somewhat, but any kind of soap will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good, thick foam with a pleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> Tabac Original By Maurer &amp; Wirtz For Men.</li>
            <li> at first i did not like the smell but after a day or two it smelled alot better</li>
            <li> Turning this into a puck inside a mug significantly improved my results.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered two sticks</li>
            <li> I recently purchased two sticks of this Arko shaving soap after reading some of the reviews as I was looking for a cheaply priced soap that would lather good and provide me with a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The price is great and the stick lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The Hungarian manufacturer got this very right.  </li>
            <li> It is a clean soapy smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean scent in my opinion and it doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering smell, so you can apply aftershave with no worries of contrasting smell.  </li>
            <li> I solved the problem with the purchase of a child size toothbrush from the dollar store and now that I have a safety razor I still use the brush to clean it and the blade after each use.</li>
            <li> I find it to be a clean, soapy scent</li>
            <li> most important point is that it lathers really well with a brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just rub the stick over my face and I&#x27;ll get a super smooth shave.</li>
            <li> and I find the soapy smell of it pleasant enough.</li>
            <li> Works as good or better as any other soap out there</li>
            <li> This shaving soap is pure magic.</li>
            <li> nothing special</li>
            <li> Lather that takes minimal effort to produce, which is great on a rushed weekday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just finished the job with my badger brush for a full lather shave.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, clean scent and provides a nice, slick lather that makes shaving easy.</li>
            <li> True to it&#x27;s reputation, this soap is a lather monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad at all but also not a manly musky smell either.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fast, easy, and provides a smooth shave (if the razor does its part).  </li>
            <li> Arko&#x27;s scent is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger too long once I finish my shave.  </li>
            <li> It has a sweet lemon scent to it that makes you feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many different shave soaps.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, this has the best traditional &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; smell ever!</li>
            <li> I use it weekday mornings to get a quick shave in before work.</li>
            <li> If you smash a stick of Arko into a bowl and lather directly on top of it, you will use more and it won&#x27;t last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its aroma requires a bit of forbearance, but fairly quickly, the shaver, if not the shaver&#x27;s wife, grows to accept it.  </li>
            <li> Mild soap and makes your razor glide over your skin.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong scent to it that makes me think of those &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; colognes like Brut or Old Spice.</li>
            <li> In short, while not luxurious it is very effective and very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a good dirt cheap soap.</li>
            <li> But aside from my crappy skin this soap does the job and is pretty cheap $$.</li>
            <li> Smells good, lathers well, the stick make it easy to apply whether you wet it and slap it on, or lather it up with a brush first.  </li>
            <li> You may find you have a new favorite soap, both in terms of price and shave quality.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use as is for face lathering, but if you prefer bowl lathering it is soft enough that it can easily be packed into your favorite shaving mug for easy loading of your brush.  </li>
            <li> THESE ARE A GREAT VALUE AND PROVIDE A SLICK SMOOTH SHAVE.</li>
            <li> this item works very well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is so strong that the whole bathroom has taken on its smell even though it is sitting in a medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> These little sticks are great for travel or when you need to shave quick.  </li>
            <li> It applies easily and within a few good brush strokes with your boar or badger whips into a substantial lather.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong at first but does go away.</li>
            <li> This soap is very quick to lather to making a nice lather for me very quickly like any other tallow soaps but of course you millage may very.</li>
            <li> Generates a very thick lather and provides excellent skin protection while promoting close shaves.  </li>
            <li> I use Arm N Hammer deodorant, the kind in the yellow dispenser.</li>
            <li> Why not go a step further and make your own shave stick.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> And yes I am using a nice genuine badger brush and a good mug, the problem is the soap, sadly.</li>
            <li> It was fun to try though.</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street used to be my favorite until I decided to try Arko.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that its better to cut off a portion of it and lather in a cup, applying it directly to your face then brushing your face doesn&#x27;t work well even though that is what this soap is for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, just a great product that is really inexpensive, and performs better than much more expensive products.  </li>
            <li> I mixed some with Almond oil, some with rose oil, and one with sandalwood oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read good reviews of Arko Shave stick on Redddit&#x27;s Wicked Edge: this product performs as expected.</li>
            <li> I worked up a good lather against my stubble field by rubbing the stick over my wet face.  </li>
            <li> Use a wet shaving brush to work up a good lather, using a circular motion over your face</li>
            <li> For the price this stuff is worth a try.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, Arko is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arko is worth trying if you use a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of protecting you from the sharp blade you are dragging across your face.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews around the web, it seemed that people either loved this stuff</li>
            <li> While my whole bathroom smelled like Arko when I first unwrapped it, the scent is now much more gentle and</li>
            <li> With a low cost and high performance, this product is superior to those overpriced soaps.</li>
            <li> right here, some people cut it up into there shave bowl and use the brush that way</li>
            <li> I hit it right</li>
            <li> Price is definitely right, too.</li>
            <li> It has a clean soap smell unlike the other soaps available, so you will read love it/</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the scent to be very strong and reminiscent of lemon-scented pledge.  </li>
            <li> I have used lots of brands in the past but this is the best so far it lathers quickly and very efficiently</li>
            <li> Does the easy lather, good cushion and slick part very well.</li>
            <li> This was my fist time using this soap and right from the first 90 seconds of working my brush</li>
            <li> The lather was strong enough to lubricate properly and ward off razor burn, which is more important to me.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the best-smelling stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried, but it&#x27;s clean, slightly medicinal, kind of citrus-lemony.</li>
            <li> It just takes a lot of water because this soap is kind of dry.</li>
            <li> The smell is rather strong - kinda like old fashioned Ivory Soap</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get as much lather from the arko, but it will make your skin feel a healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> The shaving stick format promotes easy lather technique directly on the face with shaving brush of choice.  </li>
            <li> You can of course just rub it directly on your face and lather up with a brush, but it&#x27;s neater/cleaner in the twist up dispenser (and smaller, which is good for travel).</li>
            <li> I cut a quarter inch slice of the soap, put it in a coffee mug, added a little hot water and worked up a good lather with the brush.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for making a superb lather.</li>
            <li> I find that most scents come off after applying aftershave, so it is only something I consider during the shave.</li>
            <li> I was using a locally made specialty soap that cost more than three times what these sticks run.  </li>
            <li> Then, with warm and wet brush, rub that layer of goodness into your beard.</li>
            <li> I will definetly be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I ended up pressing it into a bowl and loading my brush first.</li>
            <li> The first time i tried the puck and put it in my mug.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li> Opened 1 stick and it lathers pretty well</li>
            <li> Still have just over 1/2 of the first stick.  </li>
            <li> I put a stick in a food processor then microwaved on low to heat it up to make it more pliable.</li>
            <li> I then put it in an empty cleaned deodorant container that twists up from the bottom and works nicely in the shower and for travel.</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell pretty.  </li>
            <li> It does not come in pretty packaging.  </li>
            <li> Prep your face with some hot water</li>
            <li> The first thing you immediately notice is the smell.</li>
            <li> Just tried Arko for the first time.</li>
            <li> When you first use the Arko shave soap you notice the smell.</li>
            <li> Im still on my first stick</li>
            <li> Nice lather, not much of an odor, smells like ivory bar soap.  </li>
            <li> Lathers very easily but is a bit dry compared to my home-grown shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I tried a single stick and liked it so much I bought a 12 pack.</li>
            <li> : when I was using a multi-track razor I often wished I had a brush to clean the blade of things that wouldn&#x27;t rinse out easily like soap residue or loose bristles from my shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Very clean smell that last well after the shower.</li>
            <li> Compared to some of the other soaps I have used this stuff lathers up really nice.</li>
            <li> While I absolutely love arko I had to take a star off as I noticed by the time you finish one side of your face the other side begins drying rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Just like what others have said, this stick does make a great lather quickly: just wet your face, rub this stick over the stubble, and swirl a wet shaving brush over your face to build the lather.  </li>
            <li> I will save my Trumper&#x27;s cream for special occasions, though I don&#x27;t know if I will order more when it runs out because I can get a dozen Arko sticks for less than one jar of Trumper&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Arko lathers wonderfully and you are only using a small amount!</li>
            <li> The positive aspects of this product outweigh the negatives for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very affordable and consistent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is dirt cheap and gives you a nice thick lather in a mug without a whole lot of effort.</li>
            <li> What is almost universally agreed upon is that it lathers easily.  </li>
            <li> It blows up with lather nice soap, I dont know it&#x27;s an odd lemon/lien smell...</li>
            <li> The proraso left my skin smooth, but not soft and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> The very low price has no relation to the performance of this fine product.</li>
            <li> had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Proraso green in its little bowl, and it is excellent stuff, but quite pricey when you figure it all out.  </li>
            <li> Washes off easily with a few splashes and leave the face feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> A real shaving delight for those switching to a DE experience.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work too well for me this way.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t suds as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> But really had no problems.</li>
            <li> For me, It didn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> Any minimal remaining Pez scent is fully gone after your favorite aftershave is applied.</li>
            <li> I bought a straight razor and ordered this shaving soap, a badger brush and a strop.</li>
            <li> really a bargain.</li>
            <li> Created a thicker, richer lather than Williams and a MUCH richer thicker lather than Conks.</li>
            <li> I expected much more out of this shave soap than what I got.</li>
            <li> It tended to be very lacking in the lather dept.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this much at all.</li>
            <li> the chemical spell really puts me off.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and reliable.</li>
            <li> Well, since I born and raised in Turkey i know this product very well.</li>
            <li> I had an empty 5oz tub that I pressed the sticks into which works better for me.</li>
            <li> I use this with a safety razor and a straight razor.</li>
            <li> All said I really like Arko and will always have a stick in my travel kit when I don&#x27;t want to pack my Prorasso.</li>
            <li> That way it is also readily packable in a shaving kit or luggage.</li>
            <li> It is really quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather:  </li>
            <li> but I found if you unwrap the stick and leave it out for a couple of weeks whatever perfume it has outgassed into the atmosphere and the shaving soap doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can also cover the mug with a lid so my whole bathroom doesn&#x27;t smell like a barbershop.</li>
            <li> The shave is so much smoother with no irritation</li>
            <li> but I like it so much that I went ahead and ordered Amazons 12+3 stick package just in case</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy a whole box; so, I went with this seller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready to call myself an &amp;#34;Arko man&amp;#34; or anything, but I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;m one of those people who don&#x27;t mind the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I haven&#x27;t tried every soap out there, but you really can&#x27;t beat Arko when it comes to price, convenience and quality.</li>
            <li> Now, I am a very practical guy</li>
            <li> Where it really shined is when I got it to my face because it exploded like popcorn in a kettle.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> A bought this soap to use with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> Easy to lather, nice and slick, relatively protective.</li>
            <li> i really like it and find myself wanting to use it more than my other shaving creams and soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced more razor burn with this product than any other shave cream, including my other wet shaving soap which is proraso.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, especially for a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I happen to love that smell but have heard other people say they use it for the performance not the scent.</li>
            <li> Most other shaving soaps and creams are now ruined for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is such a great value for something that seems like is going to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> It smells clean, similar to Ivory soap</li>
            <li> Arko soap makes it easy to apply soap directly to my face, then lather with short circular brush strokes on my face.</li>
            <li> This is going to be short and sweet.  </li>
            <li> Easy to lather and quick slick.</li>
            <li> Nothing more nothing less.</li>
            <li> I would personally prefer a more traditional scent</li>
            <li> I expect that the tubes I received will last for many months and when they are gone, I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Far better than an empty can or even a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m not one of the people that particularly minded the scent-</li>
            <li> ; the wrapper back enough to expose the product, the wrap a rubber band around the wrapper at the bottom for a better grip.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly for travel and got a twist up tube to contain it from West Coast Shaving.</li>
            <li> Great for travel &amp; camping since you can just drag it across each cheek and build a lather without packing a bowl and barely getting soap wet.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I find this preferable because I don&#x27;t want a highly scented soap mixing with the aftershave products.  </li>
            <li> recommend this stuff highly.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need all the fancy high dollar stuff</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It produces tons of slick protective lather very easily.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft enough that the screw in the middle of the container went through pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Easily and quickly whips up into à thick, luxurious lather.</li>
            <li> And it tends to leave the soap residue and clog my DE razor much like dried soap-scum on a shower which wont easily clean out with just rinsing it in a sink of hot water.  </li>
            <li> The smell is kind of hard to describe.</li>
            <li> An Arko soap doesn&#x27;t care how hard your tap water is, what kind of skin you have or what type of brush</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m back to wet shaving again I&#x27;m glad I found this soap in USA thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li> It lathers reasonably well when I put it directly on my face.</li>
            <li> Get more coverage on the face and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> it is extremely important for the brush to be soaked in hot water for a few minutes then use brush and apply soap</li>
            <li> you have a true allergic reaction to the smell though, you might want to go else where since it (the smell) never completely disappears.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the extra time and energy.</li>
            <li> The straight razor is going to take a lot more than a strop to get it sharp enough to shave with</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel kind of guilty that all my more expensive soaps have kind of dropped out of the rotation and just sit there now.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll just continue using it til it&#x27;s time for a new slice.</li>
            <li> One other thing to mention is that the soap is fairly soft, so if you wanted you could put it in a bowl and press it to the bottom fairly easy.</li>
            <li> For anyone who wet shaves, regardless of your razor of choice, this soup has a classic, clean,  soft scent.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> After many months, still have an entire stick left for future use (bought two to begin).</li>
            <li> Given the cost per use and performance of Arko, I am not sure if there is a better shaving soap/cream value out there.</li>
            <li> , I got a tip from someone that just peels back a little bit of paper and runs the soap under hot water, then rubs the stick directly to the face and then uses a wet shave brush in circular motion to create a lather, had enough in the brush to do a 3 pass shave great stuff</li>
            <li> Some shavers will press this into a bowl, which is not hard to do because it&#x27;s soft.  </li>
            <li> lathers up OK smells like the cheapest of all cheap soaps leaves your skin extremely dry after not much good to say about it except it works to shave with</li>
            <li> New blade or old</li>
            <li> You basically use it like a roll of lifesavers, open the top, and tear down the package as you use it.  </li>
            <li> I was toying with the idea of getting the big pack of these, but for as long as two will last me, I figure I will want a break from this scent after the year or more</li>
            <li> I can usually get a good lather with other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> Previously, I have used Cremo shave cream in a tube and plain Dove soap, both of which did a good job on my beard.</li>
            <li> And this soap has lasted me the entire year so far shaving 5 times a week, and I am only on the first stick!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how thin soapy bubbles on the end of the brush explode into a creamy luxurious lather which keeps thickening as the brush sets inside a shaving bowl or mug.  </li>
            <li> I have found it easiest to use by inserting it into a 1 inch clear plastic mailing tube cut to length, then using it as a push-up.  </li>
            <li> I plan to mash one into an old tin and try it out like I would a puck.  </li>
            <li> also I have sensitive skin-</li>
            <li> I started with this shaving soap 27 years ago when i was 16 years old.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> To me it smells like the old fashioned soap bars, before they were routinely scented.  </li>
            <li> the plus side, I&#x27;d never used a shave stick before, and I found it really practical to use, especially while on the road.</li>
            <li> The added bonus is that this soap is inexpensive and a stick lasts a long time, 5 months for the first stick I bought.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen plenty of reviews of this product and I am actually surprised that it works as well as I&#x27;ve seen in videos.  </li>
            <li> And as far as the smell,it smells like soap.</li>
            <li> like any shave soap or cream, you need to learn how much water your brush holds and shake out enough to achieve the lather you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I lather directly on my face -</li>
            <li> .. But not harsh on my skin in any way.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to figure out how much water to include in the lather, but once I figured it out, all I had left to do was figure out the logistics of the stick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product for anyone who wants to shave like a pro and save money at the same time!</li>
            <li> Lathers instantly and doesn&#x27;t use much water.&lt;br /&gt;Stays in my hygiene kit and goes with me to the field.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even have to grate it into a bowl, and rub it directly on brush and face.</li>
            <li> the Taylor Old Bond did.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this was my fault for possibly loading it too much -</li>
            <li> I was surprised at</li>
            <li> and I can see one stick lasting a very longtime.</li>
            <li> Basically, smells like old barber&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li> And rub directly on your skin.</li>
            <li> If you use a shaving brush, this stuff is as old barber style as it gets.  </li>
            <li> This tallow based soap produces an amazingly thick lather but it takes a bit more work to do so than with a glycerine based soap or cream.</li>
            <li> Not very slick</li>
            <li> I however, love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several other soaps and creams (all more expensive), but none of them lather as easily or as much as my Arko stick.  </li>
            <li> This soap is extremely inexpensive, but available only by mail order whereupon shipping exceeds the cost of the item.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for less than a burger, fries, and a drink off a value menu.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit lemony, which I&#x27;m not crazy about, but other than that, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> , I can get three applications from the brush for first pass, second and third.</li>
            <li> My beard is very thick, and even curly, so if you have an average, easy beard, than this will probably be fine.  </li>
            <li> Yes the smell is different than normal</li>
            <li> THe lather is good, but not nearly as rich and thick as Arko&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find it requires a little more water than other soaps I have used</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s important to have wet enough lather--too dry</li>
            <li> This soap dried my face more than any other.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful not to use too much water though.</li>
            <li> I have only used it 3 times so far</li>
            <li> but it is very pricey, and I went to DE wet shaving to save money.</li>
            <li> scent is a very basic soapy scent with a hint of masculine lemon.</li>
            <li> so I use it to shave my head as well), rub it on my shave brush in a circular motion for about 10 seconds, and then take the brush to my face/head to create a thick smooth lather.</li>
            <li> Smell is ok but not great.</li>
            <li> Arko quickly produces huge amounts of slick, protective lather with very little effort (the lather is similar in quality to Tabac).</li>
            <li> In less than a minute I have thick, slick, incredibly cushioning lather.</li>
            <li> The hype over the scent, well, it does have a strong soap scent that some either love, tolerate, or hate.</li>
            <li> one complaint is the fact that the simple wrapping doesn&#x27;t make it easy to travel with once you open a stick.</li>
            <li> For travelling, I use an old glue stick container and pressed soap into it and use that to rub on my wet face, and lather up with a brush directly on my face.</li>
            <li> If you are a wet shave enthusiast, It is by no means a replacement for Shave soap and and decent brush.</li>
            <li> Does dry out a bit quicker than some other soaps (mostly talking about glycerin soaps) but for the price and how far very little goes, it is a hell of a deal.</li>
            <li> I grabbed my boar brush and with a little water quickly mixed up a nice foam, even in the Phoenix hard water.</li>
            <li> Some say that is smells like urinal cakes and moldy tortillas and the like, but really, it just smells like plain old Ivory soap with a hint of a lemon.  </li>
            <li> The scent was a bit strong when first unwrapped but after cutting up and pressing one stick into a cup, it mellowed a bit.</li>
            <li> The lather was lackluster when I tried to flake this into a mug and build with it like other soaps, but it almost immediately produced an amazing lather when I coated a thin layer and face lathered.</li>
            <li> Whether I ever get the straight razor sharp enough to shave with or not I&#x27;m sticking with the shaving soap and brush.</li>
            <li> The lather lasted longer than both Williams and Conks, but nowhere near as long as Proraso&#x27;s cream.</li>
            <li> you prefer to bowl lather, you can wet the bowl, or stick and rub the inside of the bowl and then lather as normal.</li>
            <li> I pack this and the FrankShaving Travel Brush (Chrome Aluminum tube) in a plastic (covered) soap dish for travel, takes less room than a tub of shave soap, large brush, and razor.</li>
            <li> I prefer Taylor of Old Bond Street for everyday, but this is a decent alternative for travel.</li>
            <li> soap has become the benchmark for other soaps to test against and will be my main go to.</li>
            <li> It also did dry my face out considerably, but it&#x27;s nothing my aftershave couldn&#x27;t remedy.</li>
            <li> While this soap can be lathered on the face straight from the stick that seemed kind of awkward and messy for me because the whole stick got wet</li>
            <li> So as far as ease of use, long lasting basically anything relating to its use</li>
            <li> For anyone confused on how to use a shave stick it is pretty straight forward.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I have sensitive skin and have to work a really strong lather to avoid irritation.</li>
            <li> clear positive is that the soap stayed hard after being used multiple times.</li>
            <li> I then slowly start swirling the brush over the whole face until the lather starts to build, then start moving more briskly until it becomes very thick.  </li>
            <li> Fellow wet shavers, dont expect much from this product other than a solid reliable shave soap.  </li>
            <li> I guess alot of people are so used to perfumey smells that they have forgotten what real and plain soap smells like.</li>
            <li> For ease of lathering, rich luxurious lather, and economy I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that using it in its natural shape as a dowel is somewhat difficult.  </li>
            <li> The soap is also very harsh, it dried my skin and made my aftershave burn particularly strongly.  </li>
            <li> I do my normal routine of showering and afterwards apply a little pre-shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may have to do with our hard water where I live but this leaves my face feeling dry and although clean it also feels somewhat like I have traces of hard water buildup left on my skin after the shave.  </li>
            <li> At least not moisturizing like the higher end soaps.</li>
            <li> I also tried to the technique of applying the stick directly to the face and building a lather that way, but had no success.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use at least the first stick and see if my opinion changes.</li>
            <li> The smell didn&#x27;t clash with my aftershave nor did it last long.  </li>
            <li> It should also last quite a long time with a face or hand method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and once these run out (it&#x27;s my understanding they&#x27;ll last a long time), I&#x27;ll buy</li>
            <li> /&gt;The stick will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> After a few seconds, you see the results: Rich, creamy, slick, protective lather.</li>
            <li> I normally use Proraso Green</li>
            <li> Since you rub the stick right on your face then lather with a brush, it saves a little time and mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products to a lesser extent during that time, but I estimate that a stick will last 3 months of daily use with the way I use it.</li>
            <li> These last a long time too!</li>
            <li> Seems to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The longtime traditional standby for shaving cream for wet shave with double edge razor.</li>
            <li> Just wet your face, then rub a white layer on your face like a big piece of chalk, then lather it up with your moistened shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> Single stick lasted me over 4 months of daily use.</li>
            <li> This can be either a positive or a negative.</li>
            <li> The wrapper is so cheesy, I just enjoy looking at it.  </li>
            <li> Whether at home or traveling and considering the cheap price you cannot go wrong with Arko.</li>
            <li> A solid choice for wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Couple months ago I spent 30+ dollars and get the Kent luxury shaving soap in a wooden bowl.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this shaving soap to any wet shaving beginner as a go to shave soap.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Arko&#x27;s going to be in my shaving kit for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> like I used to get, and it lasts a really long time.  </li>
            <li> Peel the end of the wrapper off to reveal the soap, do not completely remove the wrapper.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Not much for packaging, it comes wrapper in paper/foil (only reason I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars).</li>
            <li> Not awesome but not bad either (and not lasting).</li>
            <li> Cheap and a lather monster.smell is nice.not bad or great.easy to lather if your new to using a brush.i smash it in a mug tho</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean much to me as I&#x27;m in the US</li>
            <li> Out of 6 or 7 other soaps I have used before, I would rate this one in my number 1 or 2 spot on its overall value and usability,</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s actually an advantage as I can mix it with other soaps that don&#x27;t lather well.</li>
            <li> Since I recently started shaving with a Merkur DE razor I&#x27;m still trying out other shaving soaps and creams at this point.  </li>
            <li> It just has that old raw soap smell.</li>
            <li> Even after rinsing my face with water after the shave is still leaves my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> highly recommend you at least try this soap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the Williams puck in the past, Proraso tub and tube,  Col. Conks, Taylor Old Bond, and Art of Shaving.  </li>
            <li> Barely lathers and harsh on skin</li>
            <li> I award Arko all five stars, 4.5 for the soap&#x27;s overall quality and price and the remaining half star for the retro, swanky lathered-face guy on the wrapping.</li>
            <li> For ease of comparison, TOBS is the gold standard I judge other products to due to its feel, smell and value.</li>
            <li> Personally, it leaves the skin a little dry.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just a little larger than a roll of quarters.  </li>
            <li> Every time I have used it the lather was very thin and dried very quickly.</li>
            <li> If you switched to wet shaving to avoid razor burn, then I would stay away from this soap.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking into Arko you are probably OCDing on wet shaving like the rest of us.</li>
            <li> Wet your face and it glides effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I applied directly to my wet face and then used the brush to work up a lather.</li>
            <li> 75% Ivory soap, 25% pink urinal cake.</li>
            <li> but not a 1 inch foam like what was expected.</li>
            <li> It reduces razor drag to just about zero.</li>
            <li> scent which doesn&#x27;t bother me after a few initial shaves.</li>
            <li> Just wet your face, apply the stick, brush to a foam with a shaving brush, then shave.  </li>
            <li> Just unwrap, rub some on the areas you plan to shave of your wet face, and then use a wet brush to work up a lather.  </li>
            <li> Generously wet your face, and rub once over your beard, then</li>
            <li> Get out of the shower, leave my face wet, and rub this on my face then hit it with my shave brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was curious</li>
            <li> Rub the soap over your wet beard.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Every wet shaver should take the plunge and find out whether or not Arko agrees with them in some level.</li>
            <li> You can also buy empty twist up dispensers from Westcoastshaving(dot)com.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> looking at other options.</li>
            <li> It was pretty uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I use as face lather and also mix witg other soaps and creams that need added slickness ( arko on face and cream/soap in bowl)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first heard the praises of the followers of the cult of Arko shave stick.</li>
            <li> other shaving tip</li>
            <li> I have used one and given the other to a friend of mine -- they are as promised and work well.</li>
            <li> I see other reviews saying its somewhat chemical-like, but I don&#x27;t get that.</li>
            <li> And like I said, this stuff performs extremely well for me.</li>
            <li> It was based in part on the price and in part on the other customer reviews on this site.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling a little dry, but that&#x27;s comparing it to soap that costs 4x what this costs.</li>
            <li> A little wet brushing</li>
            <li> but I would venture to say that the two sticks will last me at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving soap is small, travels well, and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> , I use it on average 3 times a week, and the stick still looks brand new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only negative I have is that one stick still has bits of wrapping foil embedded in the soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes as pictured in stick form and is meant to be rubbed directly on your face, spreading a thin layer over the area in which you want to shave.</li>
            <li> People seem to love or hate the Arko smell</li>
            <li> The smell is love or hate.  </li>
            <li> Arko seems to be a love it or hate it type of product.  </li>
            <li> Reading the reviews, the majority either love it or hate it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought it was going to be, it does a really thick layer.</li>
            <li> Just a few swipes across my wet face and lather it up with a brush.</li>
            <li> Now you can rotate the base to get more soap as you use it</li>
            <li> Cleaned out dispenser and rolled the roller all the way down.</li>
            <li> The scent does die down after a week or so.</li>
            <li> Really dried my face out and left a soap scum film on my razor.</li>
            <li> Shave about 2 times per week sometimes less.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a half dozen soaps and creams.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But a big negative for me was how it dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I could care less about the ivory soap smell.</li>
            <li> I get less mess.</li>
            <li> Wish there was some sort of holder, as when the stick gets to about 1 inch long, it is hard to handle.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because I feel the shipping could be a little lower, but then with the product only costing a mere 75 cents, I suppose the price for shipping can be overlooked.</li>
            <li> I pressed mine into a small container and use it that way, with a wet shaving brush.</li>
            <li> To use this, I mushed my soap into a small cup and used it that way with a wet brush.</li>
            <li> Rub the shave stick in tight circles on your face.</li>
            <li> I usually use just my face soap to shave but if the blade is starting to dull a bit and start to pull hairs</li>
            <li> Initially, I cut off a thin slice and bowl lathered, then I tried brushing my brush on it then bowl lathering, then eventually just mashed it down into a puck of sorts in my shaving mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell leaves a little to be desired.</li>
            <li> There is little in between.  </li>
            <li> , I feel) shake a little off and start circular brushing your face where you applied the soap stick.  </li>
            <li> Smell is like ivory soap with a little lemon.</li>
            <li> I hate you, and 2) this will probably be fine.</li>
            <li> It does help to &amp;#34;season&amp;#34; Arko by soaking in water for a few minutes, taking it out, and then letting it sit for a day before you use it.  </li>
            <li> but I decided to pick up a few sticks of Arko to try out.</li>
            <li> a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some say it smells harsh.</li>
            <li> Arko is the least expensive of anything I have used  but gives  as close a shave as the most expensive of any product I have used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spend a few bucks and try some.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how quickly a thick, rich lather formed once I started swirling my shaving brush across my face.</li>
            <li> I went a little overboard and even taped the Arko wrapper to the container to give it a finished look.  </li>
            <li> The lather is thick and slick, and just a small amount of soap will make enough for at least three passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is hardly work down after a couple months of use.</li>
            <li> Arko is my everyday shave soap!</li>
            <li> I think next time ill go for the Arko in the bowl.     </li>
            <li> It is tallow based so it is extremely slick and cushioning.</li>
            <li> Was small in dia.</li>
            <li> It is slick till the end of the shave.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong especially with the price!</li>
            <li> For the price,  there is perhaps no better performer in the shaving soap world.  </li>
            <li> Some people just can&#x27;t seem to get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> I place it in a small ziploc bag and throw it in the luggage.  </li>
            <li> Just smells nice...like ordinary soap.</li>
            <li> and my wife likes it so not much more matters.</li>
            <li> It has somewhat of a limey wimey smell to it and was slick with a feather razor on a 34c HD.</li>
            <li> i usually shave with merkur 34c and astra blades.</li>
            <li> The only issue is the silly shipping.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you have a very heavy beard or stubble.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lather is actually so thick that I found it difficult to rinse off on my one razor with a smaller blade</li>
            <li> To me, it just smells like hotel hand soap, which I think is (boring, but) fine.</li>
            <li> Lathers well even with slightly hard water.</li>
            <li> Duh</li>
            <li> and you get thick, creamy, moist lather, almost like a meringue.  </li>
            <li> Thick, explosion of lather.  </li>
            <li> and you have a thick protective lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One stick lasted a year on my thick beard.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money !!</li>
            <li> Although it does lather rather well, it just isn&#x27;t very slick.  </li>
            <li> Very slick lather</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quite subtle.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this product is that I&#x27;ve been shaving for 40 years before I found about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about these other than the fact that you might not own one yet.</li>
            <li> Packaging makes it tough to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I should start by saying that my beard hair is very thick, and I am prone to irritation around my neck.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t see any lather, you are just basically applying a thin coating of soap to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Then rinse the brush out leaving a bit of water behind and start scrubbing as if you were applying lather with an already soaked brush.</li>
            <li> The lather was distinctly thin and lackluster, even when placed in a mug and using a badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li> The only reason why I am not rating this with five stars is because it smells like lemon dishwashing detergent, which is not a dealbreaker but is slightly annoying.</li>
            <li> The stick is a bit hard and in the stick format difficult to dampen unless one cuts off a piece to add to a shave bowl, which I think will be a bit inconvenient.</li>
            <li> but after a few days of shaving my skin was drier and I hate the smell</li>
            <li> pulling on the hairs and rubbing the skin uncomfortably.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the expensive shaving soaps.  </li>
            <li> You will want to use a brush on your face, or use your hands to lather up; merely putting the soap on isn&#x27;t as cushioning as working it with the water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nostalgic but not luxurious.</li>
            <li> This is unfair because I ordered these Arco sticks already as a believer.</li>
            <li> The razor glided across my face and I could hear my razor sing as it was cutting the hair.</li>
            <li> I can see that, but don&#x27;t find it unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Some of them have been very expensive.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> Thought how bad could it be.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad smell.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as annoying as others might say.</li>
            <li> Dont buy the gel crap in stores.</li>
            <li> hate it comments in the reviews.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s horrible</li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely horrible!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cheap and easy to use. Arko is a staple in my rotation. The scent is subjective. I find that most scents come off after applying aftershave, so it is only something I consider during the shave.</li>
            <li> Lather is good - I love shaving sticks but after a few days of shaving my skin was drier and I hate the smell</li>
            <li> Just used this soap stick it&#x27;s horrible don&#x27;t waste your money !! Barely lathers and harsh on skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely horrible!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  I ordered this on a whim because of the reviews and the cheap pricing.  I was using a locally made specialty soap that cost more than three times what these sticks run.  The sticks lather up amazing!  I&#x27;ve only used them as a shave stick and right away they lathered amazingly on my face. I plan to mash one into an old tin and try it out like I would a puck.  The smell I heard was a hit or miss thing I heard.  For me I personally liked the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. It smells like a lemon soap would.  The smell didn&#x27;t clash with my aftershave nor did it last long.  Excellent producteven as cheap as they are.</li>
            <li> The strength of the smell wanes over time, or maybe I just got used to it. Probably the best value for the money. The smell leaves a little to be desired. It&#x27;ll leave a clean smell, which won&#x27;t win any medals but it isn&#x27;t as annoying as others might say.</li>
            <li> This is the best value in shaving I&#x27;ve ever seen. Just rub this soap stick over your bristly beard to create a blanket. Then, with warm and wet brush, rub that layer of goodness into your beard. After a few seconds, you see the results: Rich, creamy, slick, protective lather. I use either a DE (double edge) Edwin Jagger razor, or a vintage Gem single-edge razor, and results are comparable to my favorite soap ([[ASIN:B000GHYXG4 Tabac Original By Maurer &amp; Wirtz For Men. Shaving Soap Bowl 4.4 Ounces]]). The Arko stick lasts for months and it&#x27;s a superior traveling soap. I wouldn&#x27;t say this is the best-smelling stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried, but it&#x27;s clean, slightly medicinal, kind of citrus-lemony. A real shaving delight for those switching to a DE experience. This is a great product, especially for its price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap for a number of reasons. After reading a number of reviews, I decided to place an order, and am glad I did. I love the smell of this soap, the way it lathers, and the cushion it provides. I will definetly be purchasing more in the future. I am now an Arko convert.</li>
            <li> Soap is easy to use and the lather is great but it provides zero protection. If you don&#x27;t mind getting cut this is the soap for you. I&#x27;ve used it  multiple times with always the same results. New blade or old it just don&#x27;t provide any protection.  The best soap I&#x27;ve found is Soap commander it works great and give the protection you should expect .</li>
            <li> This shave soap lathers great and has a clean, no depth, soap smell. Not very slick but it gets the job done and it this price, you should try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes as pictured in stick form and is meant to be rubbed directly on your face, spreading a thin layer over the area in which you want to shave. Then you hit it with your brush and work up a lather. It didn&#x27;t really work too well for me this way. I ended up pressing it into a bowl and loading my brush first.</li>
            <li> I think they are much better sticks out there even though this is really cheap.  Not for me.  Didn&#x27;t suds as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Awsome product, the only way to shave. Dont buy the gel crap in stores.</li>
            <li> this item works very well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Lathers more quickly than a soap puck.  Easy to use.  I think it&#x27;s important to have wet enough lather--too dry and I think blade snagging is an issue.  But really had no problems.</li>
            <li> For anyone who wet shaves, regardless of your razor of choice, this soup has a classic, clean,  soft scent. It applies easily and within a few good brush strokes with your boar or badger whips into a substantial lather. Washes off easily with a few splashes and leave the face feeling clean and moisturized. Arko Soap has won a permanent spot in my shaving arsenal.</li>
            <li> I should start by saying that my beard hair is very thick, and I am prone to irritation around my neck.  I bought this soap becuase it was cheap and had good reviews.  Although I kind of like the smell of the soap, I did not find it to give a good shave.  I dries very quickly, and does not provide good protection.  Although it does lather rather well, it just isn&#x27;t very slick.  I can feel both my safety razor and my shavette pulling on the hairs and rubbing the skin uncomfortably.  I&#x27;ve experienced more razor burn with this product than any other shave cream, including my other wet shaving soap which is proraso.  When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I&#x27;ll use original barbasol, which gives better protection than the arko.  I used this with a badger hair brush, and applied it by lathering in a mug a couple times, and lathering on my face a couple times.  My beard is very thick, and even curly, so if you have an average, easy beard, than this will probably be fine.  For me, It didn&#x27;t work very well.  I tried several different brands of blades, and kept getting irritation that I didn&#x27;t get with my proraso.  If you switched to wet shaving to avoid razor burn, then I would stay away from this soap.  If you can shave comfortably with just about anything, then 1) I hate you, and 2) this will probably be fine.</li>
            <li> This stuff is dirt cheap and gives you a nice thick lather in a mug without a whole lot of effort. You do have to be careful not to use too much water though. The Arko sticks are also great for travel as they&#x27;re compact and can be applied directly to your face avoiding the need for a mug/bowl. My wife says they smell like Pez (the candy). I would personally prefer a more traditional scent but whatever is not shaved off is washed off. Any minimal remaining Pez scent is fully gone after your favorite aftershave is applied. I expect that the tubes I received will last for many months and when they are gone, I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Compared to some of the other soaps I have used this stuff lathers up really nice. I run it under warm water, rub it on my face and head (im bald so I use it to shave my head as well), rub it on my shave brush in a circular motion for about 10 seconds, and then take the brush to my face/head to create a thick smooth lather. Does dry out a bit quicker than some other soaps (mostly talking about glycerin soaps) but for the price and how far very little goes, it is a hell of a deal. I have only used it 3 times so far but I would venture to say that the two sticks will last me at least 6 months. Not bad for less than a burger, fries, and a drink off a value menu. The smell is kind of hard to describe. It is kind of a clean cottony citrus like smell. Not bad at all but also not a manly musky smell either. Very clean smell that last well after the shower. Out of 6 or 7 other soaps I have used before, I would rate this one in my number 1 or 2 spot on its overall value and usability,</li>
            <li> I bought a straight razor and ordered this shaving soap, a badger brush and a strop. The straight razor is going to take a lot more than a strop to get it sharp enough to shave with but I decided to try the shaving soap and badger brush yesterday. I cut a quarter inch slice of the soap, put it in a coffee mug, added a little hot water and worked up a good lather with the brush. The soap has a nice smell and the hot shaving soap on the brush really did feel good on my face. Worked great and I&#x27;m looking forward to my next shave. I rinsed the brush and the mug. most of the disk of soap is still there so I&#x27;ll just continue using it til it&#x27;s time for a new slice. Whether I ever get the straight razor sharp enough to shave with or not I&#x27;m sticking with the shaving soap and brush.</li>
            <li> lots of lather.  really a bargain.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this product is that I&#x27;ve been shaving for 40 years before I found about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet your beard, work the stick into your face, and then hit it up with your brush and you get thick, creamy, moist lather, almost like a meringue.  Great lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stick will last you a month.  Just a bit of paper and foil to discard. Far better than an empty can or even a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Fantastic must try product.</li>
            <li> old school good - cheap, performs, and clean</li>
            <li> This is the second go around with Arcko. The first time i tried the puck and put it in my mug. Great lather not so great smell. It took over the bathroom and I tossed the puck  in the garbage. I&#x27;ve heard such great things about Arko,  I wanted to give Arko another try so I tried the stick version. Much better experience; the smell isn&#x27;t as strong, actually not to bad. Great lather and greatt protection. I use a  Merkur 34C.   Found great idea online where somebody used old deodorant dispensers to put Arko in. I use Arm N Hammer deodorant, the kind in the yellow dispenser. Cleaned out dispenser and rolled the roller all the way down. Took a couple sticks of Arko and grated them with a cheese grater. Then took the shavings and pressed them into dispenser. It works awesome. Get more coverage on the face and will last for a long time. May want to take label off of dispenser though so you don&#x27;t accidentally use Arko for pit stick...  If you are looking into Arko you are probably OCDing on wet shaving like the rest of us. Why not go a step further and make your own shave stick. Worked great and really easy to do.</li>
            <li> Simple and practical!</li>
            <li> It is very good shaving soap one of the best in the world (5 stars),  the scent is ok after you get accustom to it; I would describe the scent as Odd Foreign, Lemony, flowery.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, but not bad at all. LOTS of lather! I pressed mine into a small container and use it that way, with a wet shaving brush. The lather is off the hook, and it protects my face nicely. The scent is a bit lemony, which I&#x27;m not crazy about, but other than that, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great shaving soap. Wet your face and it glides effortlessly. A little wet brushing and you get great lather. There&#x27;s no need for a shaving bowl, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Really dried my face out and left a soap scum film on my razor. Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Fast S&amp;H.</li>
            <li> A solid choice for wet shaving. Lathers well and I find the soapy smell of it pleasant enough. The scent was a bit strong when first unwrapped but after cutting up and pressing one stick into a cup, it mellowed a bit. People seem to love or hate the Arko smell but I find it nice. For the price, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Arko is my everyday shave soap!</li>
            <li> Smells good, lathers well, the stick make it easy to apply whether you wet it and slap it on, or lather it up with a brush first.  lasts forever!  i really like it and find myself wanting to use it more than my other shaving creams and soaps.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time tonight. The stick is a bit hard and in the stick format difficult to dampen unless one cuts off a piece to add to a shave bowl, which I think will be a bit inconvenient. I applied directly to my wet face and then used the brush to work up a lather. It lathers fine but not to the level of the Col. Conk product. That said, it gives a very easy and clean shave without perfume smells. I am very pleased and consider Arko to be a very good value. The stick format is especially convenient for storage in a drawer and for travel.</li>
            <li> Super uber performer, smell light not my favorite but disapates quickly</li>
            <li> These are very inexpensive and create a great lather very easily.  I&#x27;ve seen some people complain about the smell but it just has a soapy smell to me and it doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin, especially if you apply any type of after shave.</li>
            <li> This was my fist time using this soap and right from the first 90 seconds of working my brush I could tell this was gonna overflow my bowl with lather. Created a thicker, richer lather than Williams and a MUCH richer thicker lather than Conks. Also the lather itself was stiffer and more creamy than any glycerin based soap I&#x27;ve tried. For my money, Tallow based soaps are just better for lather but that is just my opinion.     The lather lasted longer than both Williams and Conks, but nowhere near as long as Proraso&#x27;s cream. I didn&#x27;t use the \\&quot;rub the stick on your face\\&quot; method. I simply used a knife, cut a block from the stick, and dropped it in my bowl. I think next time ill go for the Arko in the bowl.     The scent? 75% Ivory soap, 25% pink urinal cake. Love it. Embrace it. Stop trying to smell like Justin Beiber.</li>
            <li> I expected much more out of this shave soap than what I got. It tended to be very lacking in the lather dept.Every time I have used it the lather was very thin and dried very quickly. I don&#x27;t really care for this much at all. And yes I am using a nice genuine badger brush and a good mug, the problem is the soap, sadly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fold you- this is a top notch performer. It is tallow based so it is extremely slick and cushioning. It does a good job of protecting you from the sharp blade you are dragging across your face. I used this for years before discovering better soaps. There is a con however- its smell. It smells like lemon cleaner i.e. ScrubbingBubbles. However it goes away just leave it unwrapped for like a month and eventually it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.However I&#x27;m not one of the people that particularly minded the scent- it is just that it is quite drying on the face. At least not moisturizing like the higher end soaps. Despite its protection I don&#x27;t feel it softens the beard much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh also I have sensitive skin- a lot of soap scents give me a burning feeling from their scents. Arko does not.</li>
            <li> it is very cheap. This is the highest praise i have for it. The slickness is there and the protection but the chemical spell really puts me off. I have left it out to see if the scent fades but we will see. I won&#x27;t buy it again once I am out. I have way too many really great smelling options to continue with this soap. It was fun to try though.</li>
            <li> Arko is a great soap. I find it requires a little more water than other soaps I have used but it makes a lot of lather. If you prefer not to face lather, you can grate it into a cup or slice it into a cup and it works great. Best lather I ever got from any soap.</li>
            <li> Was small in dia. about an inch.  But it does soap up good and has a nice smell. will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and reliable. Easy to lather and quick slick. The hype over the scent, well, it does have a strong soap scent that some either love, tolerate, or hate. It&#x27;s a subjective choice, but it does perform as it should.</li>
            <li> at first i did not like the smell but after a day or two it smelled alot better or maybee i got used to it . so far this is the best thing for my face to shave with. no skin irritation like ussual and very easy to lather. i plan on buying more. with the price its a great deal. the most comfortable shave i ever got.&lt;br /&gt;the smell diminishes with time.</li>
            <li> smells great and makes very good and plentiful lather i also use it as a soap in the shower love it</li>
            <li> Cheap and a lather monster.smell is nice.not bad or great.easy to lather if your new to using a brush.i smash it in a mug tho</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shaving creams and soaps in my life and this is the best! If I could only have one shave soap for the rest of my life this would be it. Some object to the scent but personally I love it. It has a sweet lemon scent to it that makes you feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I had never done the face lather technique before, always in a bowl.  Arko soap makes it easy to apply soap directly to my face, then lather with short circular brush strokes on my face. Great for my travel kit, no bowl required.  Not a voluminous lather, but that&#x27;s OK since it coats well, for a great glide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read the reviews about how great Arko was and its polarizing scent. Thought how bad could it be. Well, lesson learned there. Does the easy lather, good cushion and slick part very well. The scent does die down after a week or so.</li>
            <li> Excellent lather and slickness. Easy to use, especially for a new shaver. This product fragrance is a like or leave it propitiation. The very low price has no relation to the performance of this fine product.</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street used to be my favorite until I decided to try Arko.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better in every way, probably the best shaving product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also get 2 of them, probably last me a year, considering that i shave once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Well, since I born and raised in Turkey i know this product very well. I started with this shaving soap 27 years ago when i was 16 years old. Now that I&#x27;m back to wet shaving again I&#x27;m glad I found this soap in USA thanks to Amazon. Couple months ago I spent 30+ dollars and get the Kent luxury shaving soap in a wooden bowl. Not even close :) Nothing beats Arko&#x27;s smell and cost.Leathers so well and so easy. Do not hesitate and buy this. There is no 10 stars so it is 5.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and very easy to lather. I would definitely recommend this shaving soap to any wet shaving beginner as a go to shave soap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s some of the best lather I&#x27;ve used. Lathered up exceptionally easy!</li>
            <li> Wow. This is a great performing soap. I had heard great things about Arko and they are true. This is probably the slickest soap that I have used. It is slick till the end of the shave. I had an empty 5oz tub that I pressed the sticks into which works better for me. I have heard people give a potpourri of opinions on the scent so I&#x27;ll give mine. It is a clean soapy smell. I would liken it to Ivory soap. I happen to love that smell but have heard other people say they use it for the performance not the scent. I use it for both. If you are on the fence about purchasing this I say go for it. The performance is one of the best around and the price point can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Lathers very easily but is a bit dry compared to my home-grown shaving soap. I don&#x27;t even remember how Wms or Colgate soaps lathered, as they aren&#x27;t on the shelves around here any more.  I&#x27;ve never tried the expensive shaving soaps.  Badger brush is everything, don&#x27;t skimp be a pimp.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff right here, some people cut it up into there shave bowl and use the brush that way, I got a tip from someone that just peels back a little bit of paper and runs the soap under hot water, then rubs the stick directly to the face and then uses a wet shave brush in circular motion to create a lather, had enough in the brush to do a 3 pass shave great stuff</li>
            <li> Started using this on Dec 26, 2014.  Shave about 2 times per week sometimes less.  It smells like ivory soap like some people have said.  Opened 1 stick and it lathers pretty well but not a 1 inch foam like what was expected. If there was 4.5 stars this would better fit. Still have just over 1/2 of the first stick.  Two months of use and going well.  Yes, I will recommend.  Purchase again....looking at other options.</li>
            <li> Great cheap soap, works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Arko soap is okay for shaving. It lathers reasonably well when I put it directly on my face. I prefer Taylor of Old Bond Street for everyday, but this is a decent alternative for travel.</li>
            <li> I found that its better to cut off a portion of it and lather in a cup, applying it directly to your face then brushing your face doesn&#x27;t work well even though that is what this soap is for. but I think it would work well for travel,</li>
            <li> Awesome soap! Can&#x27;t go wrong especially with the price! Great buy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many different shave soaps.  Some of them have been very expensive.  Of all the shave soaps I&#x27;ve used this is by far the best.  It does help to &amp;#34;season&amp;#34; Arko by soaking in water for a few minutes, taking it out, and then letting it sit for a day before you use it.  It seems to soften the soap.  I do not use this as a stick.  I press it into a bowl or mug so I can use my brush to apply to my face.  This is a water loving soap so be sure to use plenty when making lather.  Lastly, this has the best traditional &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; smell ever!</li>
            <li> I bought these as a backup.....more as an emergency backup. I was surprised at how well they lathered my wet face. I just finished the job with my badger brush for a full lather shave.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. The price is great. It lathers very well and feels good on my face. Some people complain about the way it smells but I absolutely love it. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have used lots of brands in the past but this is the best so far it lathers quickly and very efficiently it is extremely important for the brush to be soaked in hot water for a few minutes then use brush and apply soap hopefully this review is helpful blades are equally important I use feather on my safety razor the smell some reviews have mentioned it smells like soap to me and the wife</li>
            <li> This is going to be short and sweet.  Probably the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  Lasts a long time.  Get a shave stick holder to make it easier to use.  Deserves 5 stars, but I am deducting one because it smells like ivory soap.  I use this with a safety razor and a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Creates a great lather, and it smells very clean. If you are one who doesn&#x27;t like the smell of a bar of soap you may not like this shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Good soap. I use it weekday mornings to get a quick shave in before work. Personally, it leaves the skin a little dry. Nothing, though, that some good aftershave/moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I normally use Proraso Green but I decided to pick up a few sticks of Arko to try out. I figured it would make a nice travel size soap for when I&#x27;m on the road. I must say I was impressed with the lather Arko produces. I used the Omega Bambino Brush in my travel kit and along with the Arko it made a very nice lather. I also enjoyed the smell of it as well. I read reviews that said it smelled like a &amp;#34;urinal cake,&amp;#34; but I didn&#x27;t find it to be that at all. It&#x27;s a clean scent in my opinion and it doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering smell, so you can apply aftershave with no worries of contrasting smell.  All said I really like Arko and will always have a stick in my travel kit when I don&#x27;t want to pack my Prorasso.</li>
            <li> This shaving soap is pure magic. It reduces razor drag to just about zero. It smells good too. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For the price,  there is perhaps no better performer in the shaving soap world.  The smell is love or hate.  It grew on me.</li>
            <li> This soap stick lathers easily.  I&#x27;ve also tried the Williams puck in the past, Proraso tub and tube,  Col. Conks, Taylor Old Bond, and Art of Shaving.  This soap is extremely inexpensive, but available only by mail order whereupon shipping exceeds the cost of the item.  It&#x27;s amazing how thin soapy bubbles on the end of the brush explode into a creamy luxurious lather which keeps thickening as the brush sets inside a shaving bowl or mug.  I happen to like the fragrance, but I  don&#x27;t believe it is scented.  To me it smells like the old fashioned soap bars, before they were routinely scented.  Some reviewers have noted that it smells like an industrial soap that custodians use.  I can see that, but don&#x27;t find it unpleasant.  For ease of lathering, rich luxurious lather, and economy I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that using it in its natural shape as a dowel is somewhat difficult.  I have found it easiest to use by inserting it into a 1 inch clear plastic mailing tube cut to length, then using it as a push-up.  That way it is also readily packable in a shaving kit or luggage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell but it&#x27;s quite subtle. That&#x27;s actually an advantage as I can mix it with other soaps that don&#x27;t lather well. Arko seems to lather well under just about any conditions and it great for travel.</li>
            <li> Cheap and effective. It&#x27;s not the best lathering shave soap I&#x27;ve ever used but I got to say it is pleasant and smells great.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave but does have a rather &amp;#34;industrial clean&amp;#34; scent which doesn&#x27;t bother me after a few initial shaves. Mt DE blade glides smoothly across my face.  Packaging makes it tough to use in the shower. I put a stick in a food processor then microwaved on low to heat it up to make it more pliable. I then put it in an empty cleaned deodorant container that twists up from the bottom and works nicely in the shower and for travel.</li>
            <li> Arko seems to be a love it or hate it type of product.  Some people just can&#x27;t seem to get past the smell.  What is almost universally agreed upon is that it lathers easily.  After using it for the first time this morning, here is my honest assessment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  No, it does not smell like TOBS, nor does it smell like any exotic scent of soap you might buy from an artisan soap maker.  Arko smells like a nice, clean soap.  Some say that is smells like urinal cakes and moldy tortillas and the like, but really, it just smells like plain old Ivory soap with a hint of a lemon.  Not lemon peel, not lemon zest, not fresh-squeezed juice, but rather a lemon/citronella mix.  It is really quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather:  Once the soap is on your face and you hit it with the brush, it just explodes with lather.  The lather is thick and slick, and just a small amount of soap will make enough for at least three passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave:  On the whole, Arko provides a nice, smooth glide for your razor.  Again, it is nothing fancy, but it just works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Arko become my every day soap?  No--there are better soaps available and you can certainly spend more to get what you like.  However, if you are on a budget, or if you just need a nice soap for travel or to change it up a little bit, Arko is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arko Shaving Soap Stick for about two years.  Yes the smell is different than normal but I found if you unwrap the stick and leave it out for a couple of weeks whatever perfume it has outgassed into the atmosphere and the shaving soap doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving soap is small, travels well, and lasts a long time.  I find the shaving soap doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and seems to give it a bit of protection from the wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arko&#x27;s going to be in my shaving kit for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Great lather. Great smell.  My wife says my bathroom smells like a barbershop.  A little goes a long way for making a superb lather. Perfect for travel,  no mug needed, just brush.</li>
            <li> Got what I paid for, pretty happy but it could be cheaper.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This stuff is just great.  Forget all those foo foo fancy shaving creams and lotions because all you need is this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, nice and slick plus a great lather easy to use</li>
            <li> This stuff is very affordable and consistent. It lathers easily and gave me an excellent shave. It puts Williams to shame in this price bracket. The positive aspects of this product outweigh the negatives for me. It does indeed have a peculiar lemon-and-wax smell, but it fades after washing it off. It also did dry my face out considerably, but it&#x27;s nothing my aftershave couldn&#x27;t remedy. The lather was strong enough to lubricate properly and ward off razor burn, which is more important to me. The lather was lackluster when I tried to flake this into a mug and build with it like other soaps, but it almost immediately produced an amazing lather when I coated a thin layer and face lathered. It should also last quite a long time with a face or hand method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*April Update: Turning this into a puck inside a mug significantly improved my results. It just takes a lot of water because this soap is kind of dry. I can also cover the mug with a lid so my whole bathroom doesn&#x27;t smell like a barbershop. The smell is growing on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a half dozen soaps and creams. This soap dried my face more than any other. It was pretty uncomfortable. Arko enjoys a reputation for an explosive lather. I didn&#x27;t find this, though perhaps my technique was off. I can usually get a good lather with other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I&#x27;d never used a shave stick before, and I found it really practical to use, especially while on the road.</li>
            <li> Like I said its a good value but its nothing to write home about.  You can shave with it, it smells like your grandmas white bar soap though.</li>
            <li> This is currently the only shaving soap I use.  Reading the reviews, the majority either love it or hate it.  There is little in between.  I happen to be in the &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; camp.  It&#x27;s not horrible, it just smells like soap. A nice clean and fresh smell.  It lathers great and is very creamy.  For me, the soap&#x27;s purpose is to give a smooth shave, which this does.  I can get all the smells I want from the aftershave lotion.  I find this preferable because I don&#x27;t want a highly scented soap mixing with the aftershave products.  The added bonus is that this soap is inexpensive and a stick lasts a long time, 5 months for the first stick I bought.  I ended up buying a box of 12.  Some shavers will press this into a bowl, which is not hard to do because it&#x27;s soft.  I prefer to rub the stick on my face as intended.  To get a good lather, I use an inexpensive badger brush with the bulk of the water gently shaken out of it.  I then slowly start swirling the brush over the whole face until the lather starts to build, then start moving more briskly until it becomes very thick.  Check out the 2oz twist-up container at westcoastshaving.  It is a perfect container for this.  I went a little overboard and even taped the Arko wrapper to the container to give it a finished look.  The wrapper is so cheesy, I just enjoy looking at it.  If you like simple and effective, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great soap, very &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; smell. Lathers well even with slightly hard water. Lasts forever!</li>
            <li> This is great cheap soap. I face lather, and this soap always gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> This soap is definitely one I recommend It is a lather monster and is the slickest soap I have ever used and I don&#x27;t have to worry about wasting it because it is under $1 an ounce. This soap is very quick to lather to making a nice lather for me very quickly like any other tallow soaps but of course you millage may very.</li>
            <li> Fellow wet shavers, dont expect much from this product other than a solid reliable shave soap.  It doesnt smell pretty.  It actually reminds me of ivory soap.  It does not come in pretty packaging.  You basically use it like a roll of lifesavers, open the top, and tear down the package as you use it.  I actually use this soap for when i travel..  I place it in a small ziploc bag and throw it in the luggage.  TSA agent Barney Fife wont bother you over this solid...</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, just a great product that is really inexpensive, and performs better than much more expensive products.  I put it in a twist up stick container, it makes it very easy to use.  It makes a great lather. I rotate between this stick, Taylor of Bond Street crème, the Art of Shaving Sandalwood crème, and Mitchells Wool fat shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;I like them all. But I use this stuff more.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a recommendation and have to say i am impressed.  I&#x27;ll never go back to foams or gels again.  The shave is so much smoother with no irritation like I used to get, and it lasts a really long time.  Just wet your face, apply the stick, brush to a foam with a shaving brush, then shave.  It really is amazing and worth trying for this price.</li>
            <li> Good lather, smell&#x27;s like PEZ candy sort of,&lt;br /&gt; O.K. I guess doesn&#x27;t bother me at all</li>
            <li> This is such a great value for something that seems like is going to last a very long time. For anyone confused on how to use a shave stick it is pretty straight forward. Prep your face with some hot water so your face is damp but not dripping with water. Rub the shave stick in tight circles on your face. You won&#x27;t see any lather, you are just basically applying a thin coating of soap to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now use your favorite brush, get it damp by running it under some water. Then rinse the brush out leaving a bit of water behind and start scrubbing as if you were applying lather with an already soaked brush. You will see the lather spring up!</li>
            <li> Lathers up great and prevents bumps.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in order to compare shaving soap to shaving cream. The first thing you immediately notice is the smell. This can be either a positive or a negative. It has a very strong scent to it that makes me think of those &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; colognes like Brut or Old Spice. It is so strong that the whole bathroom has taken on its smell even though it is sitting in a medicine cabinet. I didn&#x27;t mind the smell, but I didn&#x27;t like it either. When I shaved before I showered, it didn&#x27;t linger on the skin so this aspect of the product can be mitigated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A clear positive is that the soap stayed hard after being used multiple times. It seems this will continue into the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to create a lather, but it dries quickly and I found my self having to reuse the brush a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a big negative for me was how it dried out my skin. After shaving, the skin around my jaw felt like it was tightening even though I added cream to my face after shaving. This may not be an issue for those with more oily skin however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I would say that this product is great for someone with the right type of skin (oily) who is fine with its distinctive scent.</li>
            <li> Just tried Arko for the first time. This is the best shave soap I have ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried many of the most highly praised soaps)!  Arko&#x27;s scent is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger too long once I finish my shave.  Arko quickly produces huge amounts of slick, protective lather with very little effort (the lather is similar in quality to Tabac). Wonderful soap!</li>
            <li> Arko soap is a great bargain and one of my favorite soaps.  It produces tons of slick protective lather very easily.  It is easy to use as is for face lathering, but if you prefer bowl lathering it is soft enough that it can easily be packed into your favorite shaving mug for easy loading of your brush.  Some people complain about the scent but I actually like it, it smells like soap with a touch of lemon.  I recommend you buy more than 2 at a time to save even more.  I ordered 6 sticks for just under $12 including shipping and received my order very quickly.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Nothing more nothing less.</li>
            <li> Best lather yet. I mixed some with Almond oil, some with rose oil, and one with sandalwood oil. Makes it even better.</li>
            <li> First off, don&#x27;t let the picture fool you, the product is small.  Only 75grams each.  That doesn&#x27;t mean much to me as I&#x27;m in the US but it&#x27;s just a little larger than a roll of quarters.  Anyway, they say size doesn&#x27;t matter...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget the size.  This stuff is awesome.  I&#x27;ve seen plenty of reviews of this product and I am actually surprised that it works as well as I&#x27;ve seen in videos.  Just unwrap, rub some on the areas you plan to shave of your wet face, and then use a wet brush to work up a lather.  It lathers VERY quickly.  Thick, explosion of lather.  I had enough lather made for 4 passes with my razor.  Good stuff.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it and once these run out (it&#x27;s my understanding they&#x27;ll last a long time), I&#x27;ll buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the smell....some people like it, others don&#x27;t.  It smells like soap from a cheap hotel.  Doesn&#x27;t stink, doesn&#x27;t smell very good, but it certainly isn&#x27;t off-putting.  Just smells nice...like ordinary soap.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too overpowering, but it is definitely present. With a low cost and high performance, this product is superior to those overpriced soaps.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!  After many months, still have an entire stick left for future use (bought two to begin).</li>
            <li> Lathers up very nicely.  Very inexpensive soap, and a great value.  I would describe the scent as a lemony scented Ivory soap bar.</li>
            <li> I recently tried another more expensive soap,and it still cant compare to arko.I have mine mashed in a mug,and this lets me make a very smooth lather.I recommend this to anyone.And as far as the smell,it smells like soap.I guess alot of people are so used to perfumey smells that they have forgotten what real and plain soap smells like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought it was going to be, it does a really thick layer.</li>
            <li> Excellent and convenient</li>
            <li> Works as good or better as any other soap out there and you can not beat the price. Many people complain about the smell but I do not mind it. After you open the wrapper the smell fades away in about a week anyway. After that it just has a light soapy smell with just a hint of lemon.</li>
            <li> Great soap. I use as face lather and also mix witg other soaps and creams that need added slickness ( arko on face and cream/soap in bowl)</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Just a few swipes across my wet face and lather it up with a brush. Great aroma and a wonderful smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Probably the best buy in shaving soap. Easy to lather, nice and slick, relatively protective. Not as good as the Valobra stick, but is also about 1/8 the price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first heard the praises of the followers of the cult of Arko shave stick. I used it with an open mind. When you first use the Arko shave soap you notice the smell. It isn&#x27;t a bad smell. It simply smells like soap. There are many fancy smelling soaps out there, if that is your priority. If you want a good lather, Arko delivers. I was shocked at how quickly a thick, rich lather formed once I started swirling my shaving brush across my face. If soap smelling like soap doesn&#x27;t bother you, Arko is an excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. Generously wet your face, and rub once over your beard, then lather.&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer to bowl lather, you can wet the bowl, or stick and rub the inside of the bowl and then lather as normal.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say... this gives me the &amp;#34;least expensive&amp;#34; and creamiest lather on the market. The scent (which some folks have an issue with) is that of Ivory soap. Get out of the shower, leave my face wet, and rub this on my face then hit it with my shave brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like any shave soap or cream, you need to learn how much water your brush holds and shake out enough to achieve the lather you&#x27;re looking for. Also the more product rubbed on the face... the thicker the lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I hit it right, I can get three applications from the brush for first pass, second and third. Turned my Son onto this product and he likes it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; the wrapper back enough to expose the product, the wrap a rubber band around the wrapper at the bottom for a better grip.</li>
            <li> Arko&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;Made in Turkey and excellent Lather.</li>
            <li> Good shave soap at a good price.</li>
            <li> I shave with a brush but had never heard of Arko sticks before I saw them on Amazon. I still use a brush and bowl but have been getting excellent results by applying the stick to the more challenging areas on my chin and below the jaw line before lathering up as usual. Arko has become a valuable and time saving tool by reducing the need for repeated lathering and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other shaving tip I&#x27;d like to share: when I was using a multi-track razor I often wished I had a brush to clean the blade of things that wouldn&#x27;t rinse out easily like soap residue or loose bristles from my shaving brush. I solved the problem with the purchase of a child size toothbrush from the dollar store and now that I have a safety razor I still use the brush to clean it and the blade after each use.</li>
            <li> I had never used a shaving stick before this. I was curious so I ordered a couple of sticks.  Based on other reviews around the web, it seemed that people either loved this stuff or they just liked it and didnt care for the smell.  I however, love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several other soaps and creams (all more expensive), but none of them lather as easily or as much as my Arko stick.  And I happen to love the smell as well.  It smells clean, similar to Ivory soap but with a hint of lemon.  The soap stick itself lasts forever.  Ive actually been trying to use it up so I could use more (if that makes any sense).  Im still on my first stick, I use it on average 3 times a week, and the stick still looks brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel kind of guilty that all my more expensive soaps have kind of dropped out of the rotation and just sit there now.  I originally ordered two sticks but I like it so much that I went ahead and ordered Amazons 12+3 stick package just in case they stop selling it for some reason and also because its so inexpensive.  I think I now have enough of this soap to last me for the next 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you at least try this soap.  You may find you have a new favorite soap, both in terms of price and shave quality.</li>
            <li> Great for travel &amp; camping since you can just drag it across each cheek and build a lather without packing a bowl and barely getting soap wet. Drop it in a ziplock and pack it away. Some don&#x27;t like the smell, it smells like soap. Duh</li>
            <li> This a good product at a great price.  Nice lather, not much of an odor, smells like ivory bar soap.  I&#x27;ll be getting this again.</li>
            <li> You either love Arko or not.  In my case, it is one of my favorite shaving soaps.  I lather directly on my face - it&#x27;s fast, easy, and provides a smooth shave (if the razor does its part).  Recommended.</li>
            <li> i watched a video on YouTube in which some guy demonstrated shaving using the Arko Shaving Stick. I was intgrigued.  He recommended you also purchase, from West Coast Shaving, a &amp;#34;push-up&amp;#34; container, like cylindrical anti-perspirant would come in, for best managing the soap stick.  I got one.  You gently but firmly shove the soap stick on the plastic screw in the middle of the device.  Now you can rotate the base to get more soap as you use it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what about the shave itself?  You smear the stick all over your beard.  Meanwhile, your brush, which has been soaking in a mug of hot water from the shower (shaving in the shower is best, I feel) shake a little off and start circular brushing your face where you applied the soap stick.  BEST LATHER I HAVE YET EXPERIENCED IN ALMOST 40 YEARS OF SHAVING.  The Hungarian manufacturer got this very right.  I use Pace 6 cartridges and I got the closest shave I think I have ever had.  Yes, I have a &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; beard so I have to make multiple passes over any part of my face, but the combination of this soap and the Pace 6 (I am not shilling for them) make for the best shave I&#x27;ve yet had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Proraso green in its little bowl, and it is excellent stuff, but quite pricey when you figure it all out.  THe lather is good, but not nearly as rich and thick as Arko&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing: you will need some kind of after shave lotion because the Arko soap does dry out the face somewhat, but any kind of soap will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this stuff highly.  Price is definitely right, too.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased two sticks of this Arko shaving soap after reading some of the reviews as I was looking for a cheaply priced soap that would lather good and provide me with a comfortable shave. I&#x27;m very happy with it and will likely buy more after I run out. It lathers really well and has a nice clean soapy scent to it. A little goes a long way so I don&#x27;t anticipate needing to buy anymore anytime soon. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because I feel the shipping could be a little lower, but then with the product only costing a mere 75 cents, I suppose the price for shipping can be overlooked.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap stick! Well worth trying it no matter what kind of razor you are using.</li>
            <li> To me, this seller had the most convenient packaging of the Arko shave stick - a two pack. I didn&#x27;t want to buy a whole box; so, I went with this seller.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read good reviews of Arko Shave stick on Redddit&#x27;s Wicked Edge: this product performs as expected. I worked up a good lather against my stubble field by rubbing the stick over my wet face.  I added sparring amounts of water to a brush and went to work. After 3 passes I still had sufficient lather on my brush. The smell is rather strong - kinda like old fashioned Ivory Soap.. But not harsh on my skin in any way. Product seems to work best (for me, anyway) when there is a good amount of stubble on my face. The soap has something to grab onto.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I have is that one stick still has bits of wrapping foil embedded in the soap. I find myself having to pick out the foil.Thus the 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to save money on shaving cream. It took me a while to figure out how much water to include in the lather, but once I figured it out, all I had left to do was figure out the logistics of the stick. Initially, I cut off a thin slice and bowl lathered, then I tried brushing my brush on it then bowl lathering, then eventually just mashed it down into a puck of sorts in my shaving mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for anyone who wants to shave like a pro and save money at the same time!</li>
            <li> I like the Arko puck version the best (the kind that goes in a mug), but this is great to use while traveling and any time you might be in a hurry. It has a nice, clean scent and provides a nice, slick lather that makes shaving easy. Try this, and you&#x27;ll never go back to the canned foamy stuff. It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, so in case you may be unfamiliar with this product here&#x27;s how to use it:&lt;br /&gt;1. Peel the end of the wrapper off to reveal the soap, do not completely remove the wrapper.&lt;br /&gt;2. Rub the soap over your wet beard.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use a wet shaving brush to work up a good lather, using a circular motion over your face</li>
            <li> Greatest soap for shaving in the field. Put this in a deodorant tube with a twist extractor. Lathers instantly and doesn&#x27;t use much water.&lt;br /&gt;Stays in my hygiene kit and goes with me to the field.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now ,and I was using proraso before it. The proraso left my skin smooth, but not soft and healthy feeling. You won&#x27;t get as much lather from the arko, but it will make your skin feel a healthy and soft. The shave I get from the Arko is real smooth with no irritation. For the price this stuff is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Some say Arko smells like a hotel maid&#x27;s cleaning cart. Some say it smells harsh. I think it smells good and my wife likes it so not much more matters. It lathers well and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready to call myself an &amp;#34;Arko man&amp;#34; or anything, but I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;m one of those people who don&#x27;t mind the scent. To me, it just smells like hotel hand soap, which I think is (boring, but) fine. That enables me to enjoy Arko&#x27;s convenience and performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get yourself some twist up tubes from westcoastshaving, and you&#x27;ll be all set. It&#x27;s not my go-to, but it lathers up to quickly and easily and I use it for my &amp;#34;quicky&amp;#34; shaves, and I keep smaller tubes of it in my travel kit, as well as any house where I occasionally spend the night and may want to shave. And at this price... Why not? Every wet shaver should take the plunge and find out whether or not Arko agrees with them in some level.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE A GREAT VALUE AND PROVIDE A SLICK SMOOTH SHAVE. IT DOES HAVE A SORT OF LEMON SCENT. I LIKE TO INAGINE IT AS A LEMON PEZ OR LEMON MERANG PIE</li>
            <li> (My wife an I share this account so it not her writing the review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arko is - well - just ok.  Since I recently started shaving with a Merkur DE razor I&#x27;m still trying out other shaving soaps and creams at this point.  Arko would not be at the bottom of my list but not at the very top either.  I may use this a a traveling option.  I have others I like better and those I wont use ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may have to do with our hard water where I live but this leaves my face feeling dry and although clean it also feels somewhat like I have traces of hard water buildup left on my skin after the shave.  Even after rinsing my face with water after the shave is still leaves my skin feeling dry. And it tends to leave the soap residue and clog my DE razor much like dried soap-scum on a shower which wont easily clean out with just rinsing it in a sink of hot water.  However the shave is smooth and it does it&#x27;s job during the shave.  But for me it lacks any skin moisturizing effect like others I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent sort-of reminds me of some kind of cleaning solution or laundry soap - it is a clean fresh scent that I do like; but, I would prefer a different scent for shaving soap. However, It&#x27;s not a big deal because it gets shaved off anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still use Arko it but only occasionally.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed trying this Turkish shaving stick product the very first time. It has somewhat of a limey wimey smell to it and was slick with a feather razor on a 34c HD. My girlfriend told me I smelt pleasant after the shave. To use, splash face with water, rub stick on hairs, and then lather face with a brush. Like someone said before, \\&quot;like magic, lather appears.\\&quot; Very cheap to obtain, and probably a good choice to take with you during your travels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap doesn&#x27;t appear to have any Paraben in it. There is a list of supposed translated ingredients found on Shave My Face Forum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the Arko stick is better than the Palmolive stick. I find the Arko stick to produce more lather, dries out slower, thus be more slicker than the Palmolive. The Arko is definitely stronger in smell, and will make your entire medicine cabinet smell like it. You don&#x27;t even have to grate it into a bowl, and rub it directly on brush and face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I haven&#x27;t tried every soap out there, but you really can&#x27;t beat Arko when it comes to price, convenience and quality. Couldn&#x27;t ask for much more. Nice rich lather and clean refreshing scent. Great!</li>
            <li> This works great.  Couldn&#x27;t believe it considering the price.  Buy this instead of those over priced creams at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Cheap and excellent quality - smell like a man</li>
            <li> Arko is the greatest economy shaving soap. The smell was never offensive at all to me and actually has grown on me a lot since I started using it. I can best describe the smell as clean and lemony; if Ivory soap and lemon PEZ had a love child Arko shave soap would come out. This tallow based soap produces an amazingly thick lather but it takes a bit more work to do so than with a glycerine based soap or cream. While this soap can be lathered on the face straight from the stick that seemed kind of awkward and messy for me because the whole stick got wet so I just cut a chunk off, put it into a shave bowl then lather my brush from there. The price is great and the stick lasts a long time. I award Arko all five stars, 4.5 for the soap&#x27;s overall quality and price and the remaining half star for the retro, swanky lathered-face guy on the wrapping. In my opinion, Arko is definitely worth a try. For ease of comparison, TOBS is the gold standard I judge other products to due to its feel, smell and value. Arko, despite its wrapping and non-regal smell, shaves as good as anything I have ever used. Enjoy, hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Excellent, cost effective and great quality.</li>
            <li> Very slick lather not overly perfumed good clean scent I like it !!!</li>
            <li> Good for face lathering and travel.  I pack this and the FrankShaving Travel Brush (Chrome Aluminum tube) in a plastic (covered) soap dish for travel, takes less room than a tub of shave soap, large brush, and razor.</li>
            <li> Great smell, great post-shave and fantastic slickness! Do it!</li>
            <li> Great Travel Stick, lathers great. Smell is ok but not great.</li>
            <li> After 45 years of shaving you would think that I would have known about all shaving products available but I had never knew that there was any such a thing as &amp;#34;SHAVING SOAP STICK&amp;#34;. I wish now that I had discovered this sooner though because this is the best shaving lubricant that money can buy...and it&#x27;s cheap. Who would have thought it??</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the scent. I have tried several soaps that are suppose to be the best of the best, but I always come back to this on.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and in good shape. I have used one and given the other to a friend of mine -- they are as promised and work well.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling a little dry, but that&#x27;s comparing it to soap that costs 4x what this costs. Great budget shave soap!</li>
            <li> effective, and cost effective.</li>
            <li> Great soap for the money but it smells like the bathroom cleaner we use at my job. Other than that it&#x27;s a good dirt cheap soap.</li>
            <li> This is a great shave soap but unfortunately I have sensitive skin and have to work a really strong lather to avoid irritation. But aside from my crappy skin this soap does the job and is pretty cheap $$.</li>
            <li> These little sticks are great for travel or when you need to shave quick.  If you are a wet shave enthusiast, It is by no means a replacement for Shave soap and and decent brush. But is does a good job of prepping the skin for a shave!</li>
            <li> Distinctive scent. Some folks may not like it. Great lather. Definitely would buy again. Very pleased with this soap  gret value.</li>
            <li> An Arko soap doesn&#x27;t care how hard your tap water is, what kind of skin you have or what type of brush you&#x27;re using it with. You will enjoy a rich lather every time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel.  It works great because of it&#x27;s ease with traveling.  It&#x27;s not my favorite in terms of lather texture or smell but it is still my go-to for travel.</li>
            <li> This soap finally did it. Most other shaving soaps and creams are now ruined for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get out of the shower and rub the stick of Arko all over my beard growth. Then I start to lather with a pre-soaked brush. In less than a minute I have thick, slick, incredibly cushioning lather. Lather with cushion that is superior to many more-expensive products. Lather that takes minimal effort to produce, which is great on a rushed weekday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Arko for more than 4 months. I&#x27;ve used other products to a lesser extent during that time, but I estimate that a stick will last 3 months of daily use with the way I use it. If you smash a stick of Arko into a bowl and lather directly on top of it, you will use more and it won&#x27;t last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like the scent, I can say that it does diminish greatly in time once you have a stick of Arko unwrapped. While my whole bathroom smelled like Arko when I first unwrapped it, the scent is now much more gentle and something that I only smell when I am lathering. I find it to be a clean, soapy scent and I actually like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arko is worth trying if you use a shaving brush. If you don&#x27;t, I suggest getting one and getting some Arko. I haven&#x27;t found anything that comes out of a can to work as well. Given the cost per use and performance of Arko, I am not sure if there is a better shaving soap/cream value out there.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving soap, great value also, I have been using the first stick for a few months and it doesn&#x27;t seem like I have put a dent in it. The scent grows on you after awhile. Note: I mash it up in a mug, I do not use it in stick form.</li>
            <li> I have tried shaving soaps and creams from all over the world. Arko is the least expensive of anything I have used  but gives  as close a shave as the most expensive of any product I have used.</li>
            <li> lathers well. Its CHEAP, and to me it smells a bit like Ivory. I see other reviews saying its somewhat chemical-like, but I don&#x27;t get that. This is my travel stick that i put in a twist up container. it&#x27;s soft enough that the screw in the middle of the container went through pretty easily. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it exclusively as I like to try various products but it&#x27;s definitely my go-to for travel.</li>
            <li> While I absolutely love arko I had to take a star off as I noticed by the time you finish one side of your face the other side begins drying rather quickly. Not that big of a deal still a great buy it&#x27;s just that that makes it a 4 star instead of a 5 star product. YMMV.</li>
            <li> Very good product; I will probably be using it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> The Arko came super quick and in good shape. It&#x27;s very good shave soap, especially when used with a pre-shave cream or oil.  Packaging is funky, but works.  I sometimes just rub some on my beard, then lather it up with the brush, skipping the mug/bowl routine entirely.</li>
            <li> Very good lather as others have stated, and the smell is somewhat antiseptic, but it does well, and doesn&#x27;t get dry and pasty as I shave like the Taylor Old Bond did.  The smell does go away after shaving so this is a good value.</li>
            <li> I have been lurking on different shave forums for opinions on various products since starting my DE journey about three months ago. I had been using Van Der Hagen scented luxury soap (which is a very good soap with a great smell) that I picked up from Walmart, but decided to experiment. Now, I am a very practical guy and I don&#x27;t need all the fancy high dollar stuff - not that I am against that, it does have it&#x27;s place, but I wanted something economical and providing good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While lurking the forums Arko came up as being cheap, providing a great lather in all water types and great slickness. The biggest drawback that was repeated from some folks was the smell of the soap. It does have a strong Ivory soap smell, but if that doesn&#x27;t bother you, you should fare well. One other thing to mention is that the soap is fairly soft, so if you wanted you could put it in a bowl and press it to the bottom fairly easy. I have mine in a plastic salsa bowl from Walmart that I bought for $1.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I do my normal routine of showering and afterwards apply a little pre-shave. I grabbed my boar brush and with a little water quickly mixed up a nice foam, even in the Phoenix hard water. Where it really shined is when I got it to my face because it exploded like popcorn in a kettle. I had foam falling off the brush and on to my chest or being flung against the adjacent wall. Perhaps this was my fault for possibly loading it too much - I don&#x27;t know, but since then I have scaled back on the load time in the bowl and just worked on my face with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my Maggard MR6 razor with an Astra SP and the shave was very smooth. I suffered no nicks or cuts. The razor glided across my face and I could hear my razor sing as it was cutting the hair. Afterwards, my face had a nice BBS feel with no razor burn. I applied some witch hazel, tea tree and vitamin E oil as an after shave balm and felt great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap has become the benchmark for other soaps to test against and will be my main go to.</li>
            <li> The longtime traditional standby for shaving cream for wet shave with double edge razor.The shaving stick format promotes easy lather technique directly on the face with shaving brush of choice.  Easily and quickly whips up into à thick, luxurious lather. Great for travelling. I purchased push up plastic tubes from westcoastshaving for further convenience</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was exactly as described. I bought this for my husband and he loves it. It&#x27;s a tallow based product so it lubricates the skin making for a smooth shave and reduced nicks and cuts. It has a manly scent &amp; smells like soap with no fancy frangrances. A very good shaving soap!</li>
            <li> But..., that smell does fade. One reviewer suggested two weeks. I didn&#x27;t count, but that seems about right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a true allergic reaction to the smell though, you might want to go else where since it (the smell) never completely disappears. After a while it begins to smell a lot like barber shops smelled 50 years ago (and, yes, I remember that smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important point is that it lathers really well with a brush. You rub it on and you smush it around with a shaving brush for a couple of minutes and you have a thick protective lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which, in the end, is the key idea!</li>
            <li> It blows up with lather nice soap, I dont know it&#x27;s an odd lemon/lien smell... it holds up to its reputation as a lather monster just wish the scent was a bit different is all...</li>
            <li> Classic and great...cant beat it.</li>
            <li> It is like a cylinder of Dove soap.  Excellent for my travel shave kit.</li>
            <li> True to it&#x27;s reputation, this soap is a lather monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a stick or lathered on-face before but this stuff is pretty awesome. The lather is actually so thick that I found it difficult to rinse off on my one razor with a smaller blade gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that the lather dries out a bit quickly but that could easily be because of my inexperience with using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this specifically to put into a twist-up container for travel so I don&#x27;t have to take my lather bowl and I think this will be perfect for that.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, economical, easy to use, performs well, looks and smells retro. What&#x27;s not to like? Just wet your face, then rub a white layer on your face like a big piece of chalk, then lather it up with your moistened shaving brush.  I used to wish I didn&#x27;t have to shave every day, but now if I have the time, I wish I could shave twice a day. That is what a good $30 double edged razor, a good $12-15 brush, and $15 for five years worth of good disposable blades has brought me to. I love it!  I was toying with the idea of getting the big pack of these, but for as long as two will last me, I figure I will want a break from this scent after the year or more it will take me to go through them both. I&#x27;m glad I started with the two pack.</li>
            <li> Bought a two pack to try and glad I did. Sure, I like Trumper&#x27;s almond cream - it is luxurious and smells awesome but it is very pricey, and I went to DE wet shaving to save money. The Arko stick is great.  Smell is like ivory soap with a little lemon. Not awesome but not bad either (and not lasting). Since you rub the stick right on your face then lather with a brush, it saves a little time and mess. I was surprised at how well it lathers up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps what I like most is that this stuff creates a slickness that the creams don&#x27;t. It washes off fine after (without drying out my skin) and while it is there the razor just glides better. In short, while not luxurious it is very effective and very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is the fact that the simple wrapping doesn&#x27;t make it easy to travel with once you open a stick. But I&#x27;ve ordered a couple of plastic twist up tubes in 2 oz size to place them in, so that is an easy fix.  I will save my Trumper&#x27;s cream for special occasions, though I don&#x27;t know if I will order more when it runs out because I can get a dozen Arko sticks for less than one jar of Trumper&#x27;s. And like I said, this stuff performs extremely well for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to make a good lather with this and I can see one stick lasting a very longtime. The scent is very light, not overbearing at all. Excellent shaving soap</li>
            <li> Works. Doesn&#x27;t smell too good.</li>
            <li> Some people complain about the smell, personally I do not give a rats mass about it. I love the smell! And this soap has lasted me the entire year so far shaving 5 times a week, and I am only on the first stick! Totally worth it to save some money and smell pretty good. Give a 8/10 lather. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A solid, inexpensive soap stick. I bought it mainly for travel and got a twist up tube to contain it from West Coast Shaving. The smell is pretty strong at first but does go away.</li>
            <li> These work great and I LOVE the scent!  For shaving I make sure my skin is nice and wet and rub the stick all over (kind of like chapstick for your legs)... then I use my badger brush to get a nice foam.  These last a long time too!</li>
            <li> Previously, I have used Cremo shave cream in a tube and plain Dove soap, both of which did a good job on my beard. Then I decided to try Arko after hearing so many compliments about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stick will last me a long time. Rubbing some on my face and then using a soft synthetic bristle brush on my face has created a wonderful cushioning lather. You will want to use a brush on your face, or use your hands to lather up; merely putting the soap on isn&#x27;t as cushioning as working it with the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a very basic soapy scent with a hint of masculine lemon. It will not interfere with your aftershave or cologne.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Not the best fragrance though.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known about this earlier. Actually makes a closer shave. I actually got 83 trounced to arko from a safety razor starter kit and bought these to give to friends to try. I think it&#x27;s worth the extra time and energy.</li>
            <li> Smell is okay, but not aromatic. Basically, smells like old barber&#x27;s soap. Nostalgic but not luxurious. Lathers quite easily. Lathers a lot. Great price. Can be rubbed on and lathered on the face, applied to the bristles and lathered on face or cup or smashed into a bowl to use like a shaving soap puck. After purchasing this to try it out, I bought the 12+3 deal.</li>
            <li> I tried a single stick and liked it so much I bought a 12 pack. Single stick lasted me over 4 months of daily use. This stuff is way cheaper than other products out there, with excellent performance. No, it doesn&#x27;t smell like a urinal puck. It has a clean soap smell unlike the other soaps available, so you will read love it/hate it comments in the reviews. The smell does not linger, and if product is left unwrapped fragrance will fade away. Not much for packaging, it comes wrapper in paper/foil (only reason I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars). To use this, I mushed my soap into a small cup and used it that way with a wet brush. For travelling, I use an old glue stick container and pressed soap into it and use that to rub on my wet face, and lather up with a brush directly on my face. You can also buy empty twist up dispensers from Westcoastshaving(dot)com. You can of course just rub it directly on your face and lather up with a brush, but it&#x27;s neater/cleaner in the twist up dispenser (and smaller, which is good for travel).</li>
            <li> Generates a very thick lather and provides excellent skin protection while promoting close shaves.  Its aroma requires a bit of forbearance, but fairly quickly, the shaver, if not the shaver&#x27;s wife, grows to accept it.  Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Great product and price. I could care less about the ivory soap smell. I grew up using ivory soap. The ivory soap smell does not linger. Arko lathers wonderfully and you are only using a small amount! Whether at home or traveling and considering the cheap price you cannot go wrong with Arko.</li>
            <li> I have bought tons of shaving soap and cream from reputable makers. I purchased this stick on a leap of faith. I am extremely impressed. I get better lather. I get easier lather. I get less mess. This beats anything I have ever bought or used. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t smell pine, or roses, or rum, or lavender, or almonds...get the picture? I get an interesting smell and the smell of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend a few bucks and try some. If you don&#x27;t end up agreeing with me, well, you are only out the cost of a Big mac meal.</li>
            <li> lathers up OK smells like the cheapest of all cheap soaps leaves your skin extremely dry after not much good to say about it except it works to shave with that&#x27;s about it nothing special whatsoever I guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> A bought this soap to use with a straight razor.  It was based in part on the price and in part on the other customer reviews on this site.  I&#x27;ve been using the soap for about two weeks now and my review is based on that experience so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the reviews had mentioned that this soap could build a very rich, nicely foaming lather.  I found this not the be the case.  The lather was distinctly thin and lackluster, even when placed in a mug and using a badger hair brush.  I also tried to the technique of applying the stick directly to the face and building a lather that way, but had no success.  Maybe if you have a very heavy beard or stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the scent to be very strong and reminiscent of lemon-scented pledge.  I didn&#x27;t mind it in this case, but some people might object to it. The soap is also very harsh, it dried my skin and made my aftershave burn particularly strongly.  I&#x27;ll give it another week or two and see if my skin adjusts, but I&#x27;ll mostly likely have to use some sort of aftershave balm or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found it not to be very worthwhile, you can get much better mug soaps for a similar price.  Even shaving cream in a can might be better.  I&#x27;ll continue to use at least the first stick and see if my opinion changes.</li>
            <li> i love that it&#x27;s a stick. Seems to last a very long time. I usually use just my face soap to shave but if the blade is starting to dull a bit and start to pull hairs I&#x27;ll just rub the stick over my face and I&#x27;ll get a super smooth shave. So as far as ease of use, long lasting basically anything relating to its use it is 5 stars. It just has that old raw soap smell. Not too pleasing. I took one star off just because of its smell. It&#x27;s not horrible by any means. But I&#x27;d easily pay more if it had a pleasing sent. But all the fancy soaps require a brush, cup etc. this you just tear an end off. And rub directly on your skin. Can&#x27;t beat it being so easy to use. I keeps this on the top of my shower door and use it 1-3 times a week. It is hardly work down after a couple months of use. Lasts a loooooong time.</li>
            <li> great soap, easy to lather, nice cushioning, great shave, especially for the cost.  smells like soap which is fine for me.  i usually shave with merkur 34c and astra blades.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as advertised.  I have been using shaving soap for many years and had never heard of this product, but I am glad that I discovered it.  Good, thick foam with a pleasant odor.  Wish there was some sort of holder, as when the stick gets to about 1 inch long, it is hard to handle.  I warmed it up and put the remaining portion into a shaving mug; that worked well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel so I would not need to pack canned shave gel or a shaving soap puck and bowl.  Just like what others have said, this stick does make a great lather quickly: just wet your face, rub this stick over the stubble, and swirl a wet shaving brush over your face to build the lather.  The only reason why I am not rating this with five stars is because it smells like lemon dishwashing detergent, which is not a dealbreaker but is slightly annoying.</li>
            <li> Mild soap and makes your razor glide over your skin. Easy to achieve perfect foam .</li>
            <li> Great soap! Builds an amazing lather fairly quick. However, the biggest issue with this product is the scent. It smells like cleaning supplies.</li>
            <li> If you use a shaving brush, this stuff is as old barber style as it gets.  Very inexpensive, but very effective.  One stick lasted a year on my thick beard.  The only issue is the silly shipping.  They are often available in packs of twelve so consider that when you buy and pass them around to friends to mitigate shipping.</li>
            <li> This is unfair because I ordered these Arco sticks already as a believer. I&#x27;ve used Arco for years and my last stick lasted over a year - literally. I love these shaving sticks and find them waaaaay better than using a bowl with soap or cream. I have nothing bad to say about these other than the fact that you might not own one yet. Get yourself a safety razor and an Arco stick. Thank me later.</li>
