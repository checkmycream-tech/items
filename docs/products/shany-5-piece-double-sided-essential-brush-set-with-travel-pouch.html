            <li>well, just cute for principiantes, tthe brushes don&#x27;t leave a nice finish, as would the brushes of natural hair but are beautiful and have great quality</li>

            <li>Very cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>they are perfect and stylish,  brushes are very soft,  ideal for my teen.</li>
            <li>it should be able to provide some sort of security as to the application.  </li>

            <li>This Shany 6 Piece Double Sided Travel Brush Set is perfect for any girls make-up needs and can be used all the time, not just for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to put the pouch inside a makeup bag to make sure that doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to Lancome and nicer brushes, but thought the colors were cute and wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li>i love them just like the pic</li>
            <li>There are High Quality brush sets for a lot more but this is quality work for quality product, I&#x27;m happy and I&#x27;m sure you will be also.</li>
            <li>very soft.. great addition to my makeup tools</li>
            <li>These are worth way more that $9.95!</li>
            <li>I loved them so much).</li>
            <li>Wow .. very colorful and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Excellent, super soft and full my expectations</li>
            <li>you haven&#x27;t discovered SHANY and their fantastic brushes and really tremendous eyeshadow palettes, you should definitely give them a try, and this brush collection is the perfect place to start</li>
            <li>Fits easily in my makeup kit.</li>
            <li>Also I wanted to add this very important fact : Shany is a PETA member and cruelty free products am happy since I deeply respect Animal rights!!!</li>
            <li>These are cute and not bad for the price ...</li>
            <li>Vibrant, soft, and excellent application with these brushes.  </li>
            <li>, my eye shadow clings to the brushes just fine and transfers onto my skin</li>
            <li>these are my new favorite things to own.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft, easy to use, and the fact that they&#x27;re double-ended makes them feel like you&#x27;re getting a really good value.</li>
            <li>Definitely a huge difference in quality.</li>
            <li>You get 12 brushes that only take up the room of 6, which is a great space-saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Compact and light.</li>
            <li>They are also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>considering it was... cheap.</li>
            <li>Soft, loved them.</li>
            <li>Just so much fun!</li>
            <li>Kinda small but perfect to carry around in my purse if I need to touch up on anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with these brushes I use them every time I apply my make up and wash them after and theirs still like brand new!!</li>
            <li>Overall I would say this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice &amp; soft and all of the brushes were sturdy &amp; well made.</li>
            <li>Very small and perfect for when I go out!</li>
            <li>Brushes are so soft and I love the fun colors!</li>
            <li>I am in love with these brushes and I&#x27;ve already have had them for a year and they still look like new.  </li>
            <li>Super soft and cute colors.</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s a small addition to your kit that gives you the versatility of 12 fabulous brushes for a great price (I got mine for right around $17).</li>
            <li>Soft bristles and the colors are adorable.</li>
            <li>they are worth the money and didn&#x27;t cost me a arm and leg</li>
            <li>These are by far my favorite pens in the world</li>
            <li>I was looking for a nice set of make up brushes that I could take with me on a recent trip.</li>
            <li>The colors are fun, too.  </li>
            <li>I used some Shany products before mainly makeup they are fine too</li>
            <li>The bristles are incredibly soft, and it makes makeup application super easy.</li>
            <li>Hope they bring out the flat foundation brushes in colorful patterns makes putting on makeup that much more fun!</li>
            <li>Other than that these are a great price and are high quality.</li>
            <li>Super cute, I only use them when I travel</li>
            <li>These brushes are very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>E.L.F. (studio) brushes are almost high end quality and each is 2 to 3 dollars, they are a much better cheap option than a set like this (Except they are regular size).</li>
            <li>but I am surprised at how good the brushes are they are better than some of the most expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>very little i love them its ok</li>
            <li>Its my first time buying Shany products..</li>
            <li>Exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually used these brushes with makeup yet, but I&#x27;ve had them for about a week, and I love almost everything about them.</li>
            <li>The bristles are supersoft, I love the colors, each of the brushes are labeled with a number and the set comes with a key that tells you which brush is which.</li>
            <li>She absolutely LOVES them!</li>
            <li>they are soo soft and makeup goes on soooo smooth</li>
            <li>I really like this set!  </li>
            <li>They tend to shed the first week of using.</li>
            <li>These brushes are pretty but don&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if that is a good thing because to hold products like liquid or cream</li>
            <li>The powder and blush brushes are a little small, so you have to make sure you blend a lot, but this is a great set for traveling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of the SHANY brand - they consistently deliver quality products at great prices with only the occasional miss.  </li>
            <li>Very nice..very pretty and simple and fun!</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and the colors make them fun.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>I just look in my makeup bag, look for the color which is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Saves so much space.</li>
            <li>The dual ends are very convenient and I don&#x27;t have to bring a bunch of brushes.</li>
            <li>They apply makeup very well and effortlessly.</li>
            <li>For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>But just because they didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean that they aren&#x27;t good brushes.</li>
            <li>The vibrant colors look muddy now thanks to my makeup</li>
            <li>but I have a feeling I won&#x27;t be let down :)</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that the foundation brush has some of the bristles randomly falling out but the fact that they&#x27;re all so soft and pretty and perfect...</li>
            <li>I ended up liking these more than my previous brushes and use them exclusively now.  </li>
            <li>Decent brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>The materials used are high quality.</li>
            <li>I also wish it had a flat top brush for foundation, but its not a big deal to bring my foundation brush.  </li>
            <li>The brushes arrived on time, the bristles are really really soft, it seems to be much softer than Eco-tools brushes i bought off of amazon.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really soft and pick up colour really well.  </li>
            <li>, it looked to be the normal sized brushes..</li>
            <li>Love these brushes they were not small at all they are the exact same size as other makeup brushes i have gotten and are soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking for a new brush holder.</li>
            <li>The brushes, especially the thicker ones, can&#x27;t fit back into the holders in the case.</li>
            <li>the material is very soft and removes makeup instead of place it .</li>
            <li>all, this is a cute brush set but no more than that.</li>
            <li>They stand out when I go to the gym, but the bag it comes with is cheap and won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Great quality no hairs fell out like I was afraid of.</li>
            <li>Since they didn&#x27;t meet my needs,  I decided to give them to my 13 year old daughter who had been wanting some make up brushes.</li>
            <li>Surprised by the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft and have not shed.  </li>
            <li>These are much smaller than I thought but still very functional</li>
            <li>So far no shedding.</li>
            <li>to soft for and eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft, and work wonders.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding and they are SO soft.</li>
            <li>Brushes are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>So soft on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them for a young girl or for use with halloween makeup ... not for glamour makeup</li>
            <li>These brushes are ok for on the go types of things, and to use if you don&#x27;t have a regular everyday set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the Shany 6 Piece Double Sided Travel Brush Set &amp; I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Very soft, softer then my older, more expensive travel set.</li>
            <li>The larger brushes just weren&#x27;t large enough for my needs.</li>
            <li>They are also soft making blending easy with no red marks from too hard of bristles.</li>
            <li>..makes trying to get a precise line hard.</li>
            <li>I use it constantly and is soft to the touch but delivers, I barely feel I have makeup on when I use this set.</li>
            <li>soft - powder brush looses bristles occasionally and eyeshadow brush doesn&#x27;t deposit colour</li>
            <li>I thought the brushes were bigger, I was quite surprised when they arrived</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s certainly not limited for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally worth about 5 dollars but no more than that.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a cute little black patent leather case that rolls up and has a grey rope to wrap around it to fasten it.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I cannot get them to look clean.  </li>

            <li> : it&#x27;s a small addition to your kit that gives you the versatility of 12 fabulous brushes for a great price (I got mine for right around $17).</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and the colors are adorable.</li>
            <li> they are worth the money and didn&#x27;t cost me a arm and leg</li>
            <li> These are by far my favorite pens in the world</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice set of make up brushes that I could take with me on a recent trip.</li>
            <li> The colors are fun, too.  </li>
            <li> I used some Shany products before mainly makeup they are fine too</li>
            <li> The bristles are incredibly soft, and it makes makeup application super easy.</li>
            <li> Hope they bring out the flat foundation brushes in colorful patterns makes putting on makeup that much more fun!</li>
            <li> Other than that these are a great price and are high quality.</li>
            <li> Super cute, I only use them when I travel</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> E.L.F. (studio) brushes are almost high end quality and each is 2 to 3 dollars, they are a much better cheap option than a set like this (Except they are regular size).</li>
            <li> but I am surprised at how good the brushes are they are better than some of the most expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> very little i love them its ok</li>
            <li> Its my first time buying Shany products..</li>
            <li> Exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used these brushes with makeup yet, but I&#x27;ve had them for about a week, and I love almost everything about them.</li>
            <li> The bristles are supersoft, I love the colors, each of the brushes are labeled with a number and the set comes with a key that tells you which brush is which.</li>
            <li> She absolutely LOVES them!</li>
            <li> they are soo soft and makeup goes on soooo smooth</li>
            <li> I really like this set!  </li>
            <li> They tend to shed the first week of using.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty but don&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if that is a good thing because to hold products like liquid or cream</li>
            <li> The powder and blush brushes are a little small, so you have to make sure you blend a lot, but this is a great set for traveling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the SHANY brand - they consistently deliver quality products at great prices with only the occasional miss.  </li>
            <li> Very nice..very pretty and simple and fun!</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and the colors make them fun.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> I just look in my makeup bag, look for the color which is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Saves so much space.</li>
            <li> The dual ends are very convenient and I don&#x27;t have to bring a bunch of brushes.</li>
            <li> They apply makeup very well and effortlessly.</li>
            <li> For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> But just because they didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean that they aren&#x27;t good brushes.</li>
            <li> The vibrant colors look muddy now thanks to my makeup</li>
            <li> but I have a feeling I won&#x27;t be let down :)</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that the foundation brush has some of the bristles randomly falling out but the fact that they&#x27;re all so soft and pretty and perfect...</li>
            <li> I ended up liking these more than my previous brushes and use them exclusively now.  </li>
            <li> Decent brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> The materials used are high quality.</li>
            <li> I also wish it had a flat top brush for foundation, but its not a big deal to bring my foundation brush.  </li>
            <li> The brushes arrived on time, the bristles are really really soft, it seems to be much softer than Eco-tools brushes i bought off of amazon.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really soft and pick up colour really well.  </li>
            <li> , it looked to be the normal sized brushes..</li>
            <li> Love these brushes they were not small at all they are the exact same size as other makeup brushes i have gotten and are soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking for a new brush holder.</li>
            <li> The brushes, especially the thicker ones, can&#x27;t fit back into the holders in the case.</li>
            <li> the material is very soft and removes makeup instead of place it .</li>
            <li> all, this is a cute brush set but no more than that.</li>
            <li> They stand out when I go to the gym, but the bag it comes with is cheap and won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Great quality no hairs fell out like I was afraid of.</li>
            <li> Since they didn&#x27;t meet my needs,  I decided to give them to my 13 year old daughter who had been wanting some make up brushes.</li>
            <li> Surprised by the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and have not shed.  </li>
            <li> These are much smaller than I thought but still very functional</li>
            <li> So far no shedding.</li>
            <li> to soft for and eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft, and work wonders.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding and they are SO soft.</li>
            <li> Brushes are extremely soft.</li>
            <li> So soft on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them for a young girl or for use with halloween makeup ... not for glamour makeup</li>
            <li> These brushes are ok for on the go types of things, and to use if you don&#x27;t have a regular everyday set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the Shany 6 Piece Double Sided Travel Brush Set &amp; I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very soft, softer then my older, more expensive travel set.</li>
            <li> The larger brushes just weren&#x27;t large enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> They are also soft making blending easy with no red marks from too hard of bristles.</li>
            <li> ..makes trying to get a precise line hard.</li>
            <li> I use it constantly and is soft to the touch but delivers, I barely feel I have makeup on when I use this set.</li>
            <li> soft - powder brush looses bristles occasionally and eyeshadow brush doesn&#x27;t deposit colour</li>
            <li> I thought the brushes were bigger, I was quite surprised when they arrived</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s certainly not limited for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally worth about 5 dollars but no more than that.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a cute little black patent leather case that rolls up and has a grey rope to wrap around it to fasten it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I cannot get them to look clean.  </li>
            <li> Recommended for personal use, not professional use.</li>
            <li> I found the little bag in it kind of useless</li>
            <li> they are not very soft though...</li>
            <li> Because they are double headed I think putting them back in the case over time might mess the head up of the larger  brush.</li>
            <li> Case is bigger than I expected but it fits in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> They came a day earlier than expected</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that one of the loops in the carry case wasn&#x27;t properly stitched and was coming loose when I opened the package, but I was already planning to move them to a separate case anyway</li>
            <li> in the case that it comes when you put it back iy get messy and it damege the brushes.</li>
            <li> But the eyebrow brush is softer than expected.</li>
            <li> I used them for a recent round of swatching for a blog post</li>
            <li> should have expected them to be the way they are.</li>
            <li> All the other brushes that i might need during my trip are here.</li>
            <li> To small it for a little girl who&#x27;s starting to play with make up.</li>
            <li> The one major thing i dont like is how small the brushes are, its like really small.  </li>
            <li> the bristles are dense and thick which makes for difficult application so, unless you are a regular makeup user with moderate skills, it will give you trouble blending in the products enough to avoid streakiness or patches.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I bought these to take on an overseas trip with me thinking the double-headed style would take up less room.  </li>
            <li> I am not much of a makeup professional - just a casual sometimes-user.  </li>
            <li> Unless I&#x27;m missing something.</li>
            <li> well I can deal with a couple missing bristles.</li>
            <li> but this crap is cheap as hell</li>
            <li> Item was too small,don&#x27;t buy waste of money..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re stiff and synthetic.</li>
            <li> I did not expect them to be this small like reallll small</li>
            <li> and I saw the small size</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a small collection of brushes</li>
            <li> you can get really thin lines with eyeliner brush.</li>
            <li> The rest are way too dense for their size which makes for difficult application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not a fan (and it smells weird, well, like plastic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love these brushes they were not small at all they are the exact same size as other makeup brushes i have gotten and are soft</li>
            <li> Dont you dare complain about &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; these were $9!!!! Super cute, I only use them when I travel so they&#x27;re not my every day use brushes but they are awesome when Im away from home and have a convenient carry case! Soft bristles and the colors are adorable.</li>
            <li> To small it for a little girl who&#x27;s starting to play with make up.</li>
            <li> Its my first time buying Shany products..so here goes my honest review.  The brushes arrived on time, the bristles are really really soft, it seems to be much softer than Eco-tools brushes i bought off of amazon. I am not sure if that is a good thing because to hold products like liquid or cream it should be able to provide some sort of security as to the application.  The one major thing i dont like is how small the brushes are, its like really small.  I did not expect them to be this small like reallll small, it looked to be the normal sized brushes..However i do like them, also i will purchase from Shany again to get more brushes</li>
            <li> These brushes are ok for on the go types of things, and to use if you don&#x27;t have a regular everyday set. I don&#x27;t love them, but I do like them.  Personally worth about 5 dollars but no more than that.</li>
            <li> they are perfect and stylish,  brushes are very soft,  ideal for my teen.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and the colors make them fun. I found the little bag in it kind of useless (I wish I had it now, it would keep my brushes all in one place instead of scattered around my makeup bag)&lt;br /&gt;but these are definitely a good buy</li>
            <li> Love them. Very small and perfect for when I go out!</li>
            <li> Exactly like the picture.  These brushes are prefect when your contouring and highlighting</li>
            <li> I bought them for my girlfriend and she loves them great for the price quality 2 thumbs up</li>
            <li> the material is very soft and removes makeup instead of place it . in the case that it comes when you put it back iy get messy and it damege the brushes.</li>
            <li> Soft, loved them. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used these brushes with makeup yet, but I&#x27;ve had them for about a week, and I love almost everything about them. The bristles are supersoft, I love the colors, each of the brushes are labeled with a number and the set comes with a key that tells you which brush is which. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the case they came in seems to be not reuseable at all. Unless I&#x27;m missing something. The brushes, especially the thicker ones, can&#x27;t fit back into the holders in the case. I&#x27;d ruin the brush trying to get it back in there. Also, it&#x27;s not a case, it&#x27;s a flimsy plastic wrap with a flimsy plastic cord that doesn&#x27;t keep the brushes protected, as it&#x27;s open on both ends. the brushes keep sliding out. i&#x27;m going to have to buy a separate case and use that instead. I really wish I&#x27;d gotten the &#x27;double trouble&#x27; instead of the &#x27;Luna&#x27; because the case looks sturdier. But I need these for a wedding I&#x27;m leaving for in 2 days, so I don&#x27;t have time to return them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft and smooth. They seem to be good quality. Great price and they were delivered on time. The only issue I have is the case they come in.Its a roll open case with loop holes to slide the brush in. Because they are double headed I think putting them back in the case over time might mess the head up of the larger  brush. I&#x27;ll be looking for a new brush holder. Overall I would say this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> They are of nice quality. But the eyebrow brush is softer than expected. Nice size as well. Recommended for personal use, not professional use.</li>
            <li> these are so cute and blend really well i love them and i love shany. they came on time as well!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes I still wanna buy a full set but for now these will do great for traveling too I love them they are worth the money and didn&#x27;t cost me a arm and leg</li>
            <li> These are by far my favorite pens in the world and I haven&#x27;t seen them in stores in years! I was elated when I saw them on here. Love them. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice set of make up brushes that I could take with me on a recent trip. When I got them, my first thought was that they were too small. The bristles are nice &amp; soft and all of the brushes were sturdy &amp; well made. The colors are fun, too.  Since they didn&#x27;t meet my needs,  I decided to give them to my 13 year old daughter who had been wanting some make up brushes. She absolutely LOVES them! She uses them all the time now. I use make up brushes to apply my mineral foundation, blush, powder, and eye shadows. The larger brushes just weren&#x27;t large enough for my needs. But just because they didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean that they aren&#x27;t good brushes.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price!</li>
            <li> Very nice..very pretty and simple and fun! Do wish the brush hair was softer more absorbent to eye-shadow . when I I try using eye-shadow it kind of dose not set into the brushes..think it&#x27;s because the brush is to silky idk..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description close enough but the product is what it states:  cosmetic brushes</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these, dear god these are my new favorite things to own. The only problem I have is that the foundation brush has some of the bristles randomly falling out but the fact that they&#x27;re all so soft and pretty and perfect...well I can deal with a couple missing bristles.</li>
            <li> great set, easy to carry! and bright colors make it better! perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these brushes I use them every time I apply my make up and wash them after and theirs still like brand new!!</li>
            <li> Excellent, super soft and full my expectations</li>
            <li> Love it. The brushes feel amazing. Case is bigger than I expected but it fits in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done! Great product and so cute</li>
            <li> The brushes are great.  They&#x27;re really soft and pick up colour really well.  Would buy Again.</li>
            <li> Wow .. very colorful and beautiful. As a beginner I see that you can use it for every thing.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!!  The roll up case is great for keeping them organized- at home &amp; while traveling.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I hoped for, but they do the job.</li>
            <li> some of the best brushes i have ever had!!!!!!! i will be getting again when the time comes they are soo soft and makeup goes on soooo smooth you can get really thin lines with eyeliner brush. i am really happy to find these:)</li>
            <li> Purchased for my nieces who are all ballerinas who perform and compete.  They are happy with the appearance, utility and durability.  Great price for so many configurations of brushes.</li>
            <li> I love them! Great for traveling and I requested them to get here earlier and they did. I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the SHANY brand - they consistently deliver quality products at great prices with only the occasional miss.  These brushes are absolutely adorable!  The fibers are brightly colored and attractive, and they are very soft to the touch.  I used them for a recent round of swatching for a blog post and they didn&#x27;t shed and held up to being cleaned and reused in a short amount of time.  My only complaint is that one of the loops in the carry case wasn&#x27;t properly stitched and was coming loose when I opened the package, but I was already planning to move them to a separate case anyway so it didn&#x27;t affect me, and it looks like it was just a defect with that one product and not a design problem.  You get 12 brushes that only take up the room of 6, which is a great space-saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t discovered SHANY and their fantastic brushes and really tremendous eyeshadow palettes, you should definitely give them a try, and this brush collection is the perfect place to start: it&#x27;s a small addition to your kit that gives you the versatility of 12 fabulous brushes for a great price (I got mine for right around $17).</li>
            <li> The sizes are perfect, the fact that they are two-ended makes it that much more appealing.  There is a chart to help you identify which brush end is for what.  My only criticism/wish is that there was an eyebrow brush for grooming your brows.</li>
            <li> Just so much fun! I love the colored dipped brushes! Colors just start the rainbow in my day!</li>
            <li> Surprised by the quality of these brushes. Very soft, softer then my older, more expensive travel set. The size is excellent for tossing in my purse with my on the go palette, definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes for the price. Great quality no hairs fell out like I was afraid of. I just look in my makeup bag, look for the color which is very helpful. Also they are double sided. Saves so much space.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  They are perfect for travel.  These brushes are soft and have not shed.  The dual ends are very convenient and I don&#x27;t have to bring a bunch of brushes.</li>
            <li> These are much smaller than I thought but still very functional</li>
            <li> soft - powder brush looses bristles occasionally and eyeshadow brush doesn&#x27;t deposit colour that well</li>
            <li> I am in love with these brushes and I&#x27;ve already have had them for a year and they still look like new.  Props to Shany Cosmetics</li>
            <li> I really like this set!  The powder and blush brushes are a little small, so you have to make sure you blend a lot, but this is a great set for traveling.  I also wish it had a flat top brush for foundation, but its not a big deal to bring my foundation brush.  All the other brushes that i might need during my trip are here.</li>
            <li> Very cute looking set, nice size and the quality of the product is very good it works efficiently I use it constantly and is soft to the touch but delivers, I barely feel I have makeup on when I use this set. I used some Shany products before mainly makeup they are fine too but I am surprised at how good the brushes are they are better than some of the most expensive ones.  I am recommending this set and the Shany brand to friends and family members!!! Also I wanted to add this very important fact : Shany is a PETA member and cruelty free products am happy since I deeply respect Animal rights!!!</li>
            <li> This is a terribly cute set! the colors are bright and pretty and the brushes are a good size for travel purposes however their quality leaves lots to be desired:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushes:&lt;br /&gt;1. the bristles are dense and thick which makes for difficult application so, unless you are a regular makeup user with moderate skills, it will give you trouble blending in the products enough to avoid streakiness or patches.&lt;br /&gt;2. the best brushes are the blush brush and he powder brush. The rest are way too dense for their size which makes for difficult application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pouch: we could say this is an extra but this set comes with a vinyl like plastic wrap pouch. I was not a fan (and it smells weird, well, like plastic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, this is a cute brush set but no more than that. I would NOT recommend this FOR BEGINNERS since it would just hinder their learning by making application difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative? E.L.F. (studio) brushes are almost high end quality and each is 2 to 3 dollars, they are a much better cheap option than a set like this (Except they are regular size).</li>
            <li> The travel brush set arrived with five brushes instead of six.  Will return.</li>
            <li> Vibrant, soft, and excellent application with these brushes.  Hope they bring out the flat foundation brushes in colorful patterns makes putting on makeup that much more fun!</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice, in the pictures they are more brighter but that&#x27;s ok. So far no shedding. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the eyebrow brush...it&#x27;s wayyy to soft for and eyebrow brush. ..makes trying to get a precise line hard. Will update with another review</li>
            <li> For the price these brushes are great. They&#x27;re soft, and work wonders. They tend to shed the first week of using.</li>
            <li> LOVE the colors, but the brushes don&#x27;t hold a lot of product.</li>
            <li> These are worth way more that $9.95! I could see them being a $30 set. They came a day earlier than expected and I am so impressed!! Since I got them last night, I have washed and used them once. I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding and they are SO soft. 100% suggest that you get them. They are also great for travel!</li>
            <li> Brushes are so soft and I love the fun colors!</li>
            <li> Brushes are extremely soft. Compact and light. Fits easily in my makeup kit. I haven&#x27;t actually used the brushed but I have a feeling I won&#x27;t be let down :)</li>
            <li> I am not much of a makeup professional - just a casual sometimes-user.  Before I was using the $1pp ELF brushes.  I bought these to take on an overseas trip with me thinking the double-headed style would take up less room.  I ended up liking these more than my previous brushes and use them exclusively now.  My only complaint is that I cannot get them to look clean.  The vibrant colors look muddy now thanks to my makeup and it makes them seem so gross. I almost returned them because of this, but I was out of my return window.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes most of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I thought the brushes were bigger, I was quite surprised when they arrived and I saw the small size, they do not lift the powder or blush well, just cute for principiantes, tthe brushes don&#x27;t leave a nice finish, as would the brushes of natural hair but are beautiful and have great quality</li>
            <li> really cute brushes...works great</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes! They are sturdy and have no bristle fall out. They are also easy to clean. I like the bristles being colored, helps me to remember which one I use for what. Ex. I use the biggest brush with the yellow tip for bronzer and the red one for blush. They are also soft making blending easy with no red marks from too hard of bristles.</li>
            <li> Decent brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Kinda small but perfect to carry around in my purse if I need to touch up on anything. Super soft and cute colors.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought.  Functional and not too cheapy considering it was... cheap.</li>
            <li> ilike the colors but this crap is cheap as hell</li>
            <li> This Shany 6 Piece Double Sided Travel Brush Set is perfect for any girls make-up needs and can be used all the time, not just for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned when I purchased this set that I would possibly have bristle fallout. I am here to testify these brushes are of quality work and I have had no bristle fallout whatsoever (this is actually my 2nd set I loved them so much). I read that someone had problems with product not adhering to the bristles but I have not had this problem, my eye shadow clings to the brushes just fine and transfers onto my skin easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes with 6 brushes (all different sizes/shapes/thickness) and each one is a double-sided/2-in-1 brush. It also comes with a cute little black patent leather case that rolls up and has a grey rope to wrap around it to fasten it. It&#x27;s perfect for traveling when you don&#x27;t have much room to spare but it&#x27;s certainly not limited for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the Shany 6 Piece Double Sided Travel Brush Set &amp; I highly recommend. There are High Quality brush sets for a lot more but this is quality work for quality product, I&#x27;m happy and I&#x27;m sure you will be also.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a small collection of brushes these are the ones to buy. The bristles are incredibly soft, and it makes makeup application super easy. I am not a fan of the pouch, however, because the brushes slip out of it. I&#x27;m going to put the pouch inside a makeup bag to make sure that doesn&#x27;t happen. Other than that these are a great price and are high quality.</li>
            <li> These are... Okay. They&#x27;re synthetic soI should have expected them to be the way they are. Gets the job done though.</li>
            <li> Very cheap brushes. They&#x27;re stiff and synthetic. I&#x27;m used to Lancome and nicer brushes, but thought the colors were cute and wanted to give it a try. Definitely a huge difference in quality. I still like the colors. They stand out when I go to the gym, but the bag it comes with is cheap and won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> very soft.. great addition to my makeup tools</li>
            <li> Item was too small,don&#x27;t buy waste of money..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these brushes! So soft on sensitive skin. And best of all....is travel friendly.</li>
            <li> i love them just like the pic</li>
            <li> very little i love them its ok</li>
            <li> These are cute and not bad for the price ... they are not very soft though... I would recommend them for a young girl or for use with halloween makeup ... not for glamour makeup</li>
            <li> I loved these. My bf got them for me. The materials used are high quality. This is a must have!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. These brushes are pretty but don&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my fiancée because she intends to DIY her wedding makeup and she loves them. They&#x27;re soft, easy to use, and the fact that they&#x27;re double-ended makes them feel like you&#x27;re getting a really good value. They apply makeup very well and effortlessly. For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
