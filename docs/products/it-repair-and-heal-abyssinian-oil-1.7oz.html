            <li>/&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>I received this product for a discount for my honest review.</li>
            <li>the instructions, it says to warm the oil in your palm before applying it in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and gives my hair amazing, healthy volume.</li>
            <li>I also put some on my ends to lock in moisture, and it applies very easily.</li>
            <li>It did have my hair looking nice and healthy and did not leave it overly oily, but I can see how you can have this happen.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product and how nice my hair feels when using.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I have to say this product smells GREAT.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products that claim this or that</li>
            <li>but I have to say I love these drops.  </li>
            <li>I have never gotten as many compliments as I did when I used this product.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I mostly use this on my bangs and front of hair.</li>
            <li>Also, it was more silky and shiny, reducing the frizz.</li>
            <li>I love this product and plan to order more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting more when I run</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>get a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>One important factor to remember is DO NOT USE A LOT OF THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>and this one is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some hair loss after recent surgeries, and this product has been wonderful while I&#x27;m waiting for some regrowth.</li>
            <li>You can always put more in.</li>
            <li>It makes it look more polished.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>that it is the summer time, and my hair gets more brittle and dull.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the morning my hair is a lot thicker feeling and will hold a style better</li>
            <li>It is not expensive, and it lasts a good 6 months or so.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited I found this stuff, I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>I love how easy this oil is to use since it comes with a dispenser.</li>
            <li>My hair felt really nice after using it, and it was smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on the huge amount of reviews and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am a curly haired girl and this helped tons, my hair stayed frizz free and the curls stayed defined, what more can I ask for in the Summer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to massage into hair after washing &amp; before blow drying.</li>
            <li>Smoothes my hair like no product before also seems to strengthen it because it doesn&#x27;t break as easily anymore</li>
            <li>I apply a generous amount to my hair from root to tip, and it leaves my hair shiny and soft when I blow it out straight, or with perfect ringlets when I diffuse it.</li>
            <li>Well, the stories were true, this is definitely a pretty good oil to have.</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff is amazing!.  </li>
            <li>My husband says i look beautiful and that my hair looks so different.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair, and my hair loves any oil.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I even got more compliments on my hair colour, because this product just made EVERYTHING better.</li>
            <li>This will give your hair great shine instantly.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>cannot say enough great things about this oil.</li>
            <li>so I am always looking for something to help keep it smooth.  </li>
            <li>and it kept my unruly curls frizz free.  </li>
            <li>My hair stayed smooth and not oily at all</li>
            <li>Also, no one seems to mention how fantastic this stuff smells.</li>
            <li>have received free products to help facilitate my review</li>
            <li>It works great on her honey blonde hair!</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>find it very useful now</li>
            <li>a we were at a reunion all day and the humidity was so high and hot!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a very strong citrusy scent, so if that&#x27;s not your thing, then I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this oil.</li>
            <li>Really worth the money!</li>
            <li>I just use a small amount after I shampoo and it makes my hair look great!</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li>I love this product as it makes my fine hair much fuller.</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair</li>
            <li>a clean</li>
            <li>Pure Argan oil is much better for longer hair.</li>
            <li>Next to a good haircut and hairspray, a woman with thinning hair needs texture.</li>
            <li>Besides the fact that it smells amazing, it makes my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine, dry hair and this product worked great.  </li>
            <li>Really good for flat ironing hair</li>
            <li>Received this quickly, immediately tried it after my shower this evening.</li>
            <li>So, this is actually a good value given how long the bottle lasts!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more once this gone!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent either, it&#x27;s light and natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But upon &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; the oil first before applying it to the hair actually made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is really light to begin with, so you do not need to put more than one pump.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t pure abyssinian oil, it contains mineral oil as the primary ingredient.</li>
            <li>This has a light herbal like scent and is a very watery, yet oily consistency.</li>
            <li>Use lightly otherwise very greasy looking hair.  </li>
            <li>I use with my hot rollers to give my hair full body.</li>
            <li>but it was soft and smooth from the beginning to end !</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several repair oils, mostly from big brands like Pantene and L&#x27;Oreal, yet I can say I&#x27;m much more pleased by the effects noticed by this product.</li>
            <li>but it is worth the change.</li>
            <li>I love it when people tell me that my hair looks so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I took a photo of my hair before, a photo right after I put it in my hair, and a photo after I used a straighter on it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a pump that dispenses the right amount of product, the bottle is made of glass</li>
            <li>gives my hair the right shine, making it look healthier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though I put a little amount on my hair it does amazing things!</li>
            <li>The next day, I had three different people, at three different times comment on how beautiful and healthy my hair looked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, in the front my hair starting to grow back.</li>
            <li>super fast</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth and gives me more volume than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It adds so much great style and texture that I hardly have to do anything else.</li>
            <li>I would suggest you use very little initially and figure out what is best for you.</li>
            <li>Not only does my hair look so healthy and shiny but the smell is so yummy.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it revitalizes the hair follicles and makes me feel so much younger.</li>
            <li>Whatever was left is what I used on my hair, mostly on the ends.</li>
            <li>of the immediate effects that I noticed after first use:&lt;br</li>
            <li>After blow drying my hair feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>No girl wants split ends!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I have used many different products in my hair over the years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all the first ingredient which means its the &amp;#34;main&amp;#34; ingredient.</li>
            <li>I said, my hair is fine and is weighed down easily.</li>
            <li>No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li>and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li>first, I didnt really followed that</li>
            <li>I emailed the company and asked if it was a pure abyssinian oil but never received a reply</li>
            <li>My hair went from flyaway frizz to shiny and soft with the very first use.</li>
            <li>, I personally do not mind as the scent isnt really that strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>For the last week or so I&#x27;ve been using it every couple days and each time my hair it super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It left my hair with a very pretty shine without a oily look or feel, it actually looks healthy to me and feel softer.</li>
            <li>I have finely textured blonde, straight hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine being without it as it&#x27;s made a real difference in the way my hair looks.</li>
            <li>Adds so much volume.</li>
            <li>Compliments when I wear a curly or straight look.</li>
            <li>I used a whole pump and ended up using it on my elbow, knees and legs.</li>
            <li>IT Repair &amp; Heal Abyssinian Oil really made my hair transform.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The consistency is very lightweight and thin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very lightweight oil</li>
            <li>This was really tested yesterday</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I have learned not to use too much for it to give the results intended.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use much to get the control and style I want.</li>
            <li>I said to my family as much.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of split ends and have been using this oil on my ends instead of trimming as my beautician always seems to trim a bit too much to my liking</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried oils, creams, leave in treatments, the whole nine, so I was eager to see what It Repair &amp; Heal offered.</li>
            <li>It absolutely reduced the appearance of frizz and flyaways, and gave my hair</li>
            <li>Too much, and your hair can feel greasy.</li>
            <li>The fact that this oil doesn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel greasy is another reason why I like it so much because I can&#x27;t stand my hair being/looking greasy.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try this</li>
            <li>That was the real test for the Abyssinian Oil: could it take my frizzy hair of doom?</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li>and I am good to go for at least 10 hours.</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many other products</li>
            <li>The oil has a light, natural scent, and even though it says fragrance as the last ingredient, you really can’t tell that there is any fragrance in it.</li>
            <li>Most products weigh it down, but I use just a pea sized amount on my hair from about midway to the tips</li>
            <li>Most oils will make my curls separate and weigh down, but this works like a serum.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair looking so shiny and healthy with out weighing  down.</li>
            <li>I put it on my hair before starighting it helps all my frizzes lay down :)</li>
            <li>It looks shiny and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>The main difference being is that the substance is absorbed by the hair and does not leave a greasy residue which often happens with similar products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine, dry, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>and since I personally don&#x27;t normally use sulfate shampoos I had to add another wash step into my normal shampoo routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product does not leave my hair feeling stiff and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I can absolutely tell a major difference!</li>
            <li>It made my naturally curly hair very soft and the shine lasts all day!</li>
            <li>It was able to control my hair and even make it smoother and fuller after a few weeks!</li>
            <li>My only con about this product though is that it&#x27;s first ingredient is mineral oil...and in order to thoroughly remove mineral oil from your hair you have to use a sulfate shampoo</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel velvety soft, shiny and not greasy or any residue!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s left my hair pretty greasy.</li>
            <li>after using this product it looked better and looked heathier then usual.</li>
            <li>This bottle makes it easy to pump out as much or as little oil that I need.</li>
            <li>I do apply it there only to help tame those gorgeous gray hairs and it adds such a luster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really fine easily breakable hair, plus it&#x27;s dry, and to top that off its low porosity, so it can drive me crazy, but this oil has a light fragrance and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>I also love that you can use this oil on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>There is a scent to this oil but for me personally it&#x27;s not too strong or over powering but gives my hair a little extra fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I take care of my insides with vitamins and natural supplements.  </li>
            <li>I have received many compliments and questions about what I have been using on my hair lately.</li>
            <li>This has helped with my dead ends and makes it look so smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li>If you want soft shiny hair try this.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and took away the frizz.</li>
            <li>This product makes the hair soft, repaired &amp; refreshed.</li>
            <li>and I bought this because my naturally curly hair can be frizzy at times.  </li>
            <li>I have a few low rating about this oil, but upon trying the product, I actually love it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>My hair is always super frizzy and wavy, especially if I let it air dry or don&#x27;t straighten it.</li>
            <li>The key is to give it a quick blow dry</li>
            <li>This oil makes my hair soft and shiny while keeping my curls smooth with very little frizz.</li>
            <li>refreshing (yet subtle) scent</li>
            <li>highly recommend using it prior to blowdrying hair</li>
            <li>Flat irons alone can cause enough damage with how hot they can get.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for those avid flat iron users.</li>
            <li>and you probably will not need a whole pump to apply to your dampened or dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have to get just the right amount to avoid weighing hair down.</li>
            <li>This isn’t as messy to apply as other oils, which is one of the better reasons to get it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My Hair becomes very dry when I am out in the sun to much.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful not to use too much or your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li>This should do great on my daughter&#x27;s crazy curly hair and my dry hair.</li>
            <li>It’s very light and doesn’t weigh down my hair, and it not very greasy like other oils.</li>
            <li>The ends are usually where hair is damaged, and using this--or any product--near the root will just weigh hair down, making it look flat and oily, and also requiring more frequent washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This Repair &amp; Heal Abyssinian Oil actually tames my frizz massively and makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>highly recommend giving this a try even if you have fine or very thin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you can let it completely air dry</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair - but lots of it.</li>
            <li>I apply to clean wet hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent, it reminds me of baby food, but the product is amazing.</li>

            <li> I received this product for a discount for my honest review.</li>
            <li> the instructions, it says to warm the oil in your palm before applying it in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and gives my hair amazing, healthy volume.</li>
            <li> I also put some on my ends to lock in moisture, and it applies very easily.</li>
            <li> It did have my hair looking nice and healthy and did not leave it overly oily, but I can see how you can have this happen.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and how nice my hair feels when using.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I have to say this product smells GREAT.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products that claim this or that</li>
            <li> but I have to say I love these drops.  </li>
            <li> I have never gotten as many compliments as I did when I used this product.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I mostly use this on my bangs and front of hair.</li>
            <li> Also, it was more silky and shiny, reducing the frizz.</li>
            <li> I love this product and plan to order more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be getting more when I run</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> get a nice smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> One important factor to remember is DO NOT USE A LOT OF THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> and this one is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some hair loss after recent surgeries, and this product has been wonderful while I&#x27;m waiting for some regrowth.</li>
            <li> You can always put more in.</li>
            <li> It makes it look more polished.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> that it is the summer time, and my hair gets more brittle and dull.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the morning my hair is a lot thicker feeling and will hold a style better</li>
            <li> It is not expensive, and it lasts a good 6 months or so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited I found this stuff, I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I love how easy this oil is to use since it comes with a dispenser.</li>
            <li> My hair felt really nice after using it, and it was smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the huge amount of reviews and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am a curly haired girl and this helped tons, my hair stayed frizz free and the curls stayed defined, what more can I ask for in the Summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to massage into hair after washing &amp; before blow drying.</li>
            <li> Smoothes my hair like no product before also seems to strengthen it because it doesn&#x27;t break as easily anymore</li>
            <li> I apply a generous amount to my hair from root to tip, and it leaves my hair shiny and soft when I blow it out straight, or with perfect ringlets when I diffuse it.</li>
            <li> Well, the stories were true, this is definitely a pretty good oil to have.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is amazing!.  </li>
            <li> My husband says i look beautiful and that my hair looks so different.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair, and my hair loves any oil.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I even got more compliments on my hair colour, because this product just made EVERYTHING better.</li>
            <li> This will give your hair great shine instantly.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> cannot say enough great things about this oil.</li>
            <li> so I am always looking for something to help keep it smooth.  </li>
            <li> and it kept my unruly curls frizz free.  </li>
            <li> My hair stayed smooth and not oily at all</li>
            <li> Also, no one seems to mention how fantastic this stuff smells.</li>
            <li> have received free products to help facilitate my review</li>
            <li> It works great on her honey blonde hair!</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> find it very useful now</li>
            <li> a we were at a reunion all day and the humidity was so high and hot!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a very strong citrusy scent, so if that&#x27;s not your thing, then I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> Really worth the money!</li>
            <li> I just use a small amount after I shampoo and it makes my hair look great!</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this product as it makes my fine hair much fuller.</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair</li>
            <li> a clean</li>
            <li> Pure Argan oil is much better for longer hair.</li>
            <li> Next to a good haircut and hairspray, a woman with thinning hair needs texture.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that it smells amazing, it makes my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine, dry hair and this product worked great.  </li>
            <li> Really good for flat ironing hair</li>
            <li> Received this quickly, immediately tried it after my shower this evening.</li>
            <li> So, this is actually a good value given how long the bottle lasts!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more once this gone!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent either, it&#x27;s light and natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But upon &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; the oil first before applying it to the hair actually made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is really light to begin with, so you do not need to put more than one pump.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t pure abyssinian oil, it contains mineral oil as the primary ingredient.</li>
            <li> This has a light herbal like scent and is a very watery, yet oily consistency.</li>
            <li> Use lightly otherwise very greasy looking hair.  </li>
            <li> I use with my hot rollers to give my hair full body.</li>
            <li> but it was soft and smooth from the beginning to end !</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several repair oils, mostly from big brands like Pantene and L&#x27;Oreal, yet I can say I&#x27;m much more pleased by the effects noticed by this product.</li>
            <li> but it is worth the change.</li>
            <li> I love it when people tell me that my hair looks so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I took a photo of my hair before, a photo right after I put it in my hair, and a photo after I used a straighter on it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a pump that dispenses the right amount of product, the bottle is made of glass</li>
            <li> gives my hair the right shine, making it look healthier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though I put a little amount on my hair it does amazing things!</li>
            <li> The next day, I had three different people, at three different times comment on how beautiful and healthy my hair looked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, in the front my hair starting to grow back.</li>
            <li> super fast</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth and gives me more volume than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It adds so much great style and texture that I hardly have to do anything else.</li>
            <li> I would suggest you use very little initially and figure out what is best for you.</li>
            <li> Not only does my hair look so healthy and shiny but the smell is so yummy.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it revitalizes the hair follicles and makes me feel so much younger.</li>
            <li> Whatever was left is what I used on my hair, mostly on the ends.</li>
            <li> of the immediate effects that I noticed after first use:&lt;br</li>
            <li> After blow drying my hair feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> No girl wants split ends!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have used many different products in my hair over the years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all the first ingredient which means its the &amp;#34;main&amp;#34; ingredient.</li>
            <li> I said, my hair is fine and is weighed down easily.</li>
            <li> No compensation for a positive review was provided.</li>
            <li> and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> first, I didnt really followed that</li>
            <li> I emailed the company and asked if it was a pure abyssinian oil but never received a reply</li>
            <li> My hair went from flyaway frizz to shiny and soft with the very first use.</li>
            <li> , I personally do not mind as the scent isnt really that strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> For the last week or so I&#x27;ve been using it every couple days and each time my hair it super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It left my hair with a very pretty shine without a oily look or feel, it actually looks healthy to me and feel softer.</li>
            <li> I have finely textured blonde, straight hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine being without it as it&#x27;s made a real difference in the way my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Adds so much volume.</li>
            <li> Compliments when I wear a curly or straight look.</li>
            <li> I used a whole pump and ended up using it on my elbow, knees and legs.</li>
            <li> IT Repair &amp; Heal Abyssinian Oil really made my hair transform.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The consistency is very lightweight and thin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very lightweight oil</li>
            <li> This was really tested yesterday</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I have learned not to use too much for it to give the results intended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use much to get the control and style I want.</li>
            <li> I said to my family as much.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of split ends and have been using this oil on my ends instead of trimming as my beautician always seems to trim a bit too much to my liking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried oils, creams, leave in treatments, the whole nine, so I was eager to see what It Repair &amp; Heal offered.</li>
            <li> It absolutely reduced the appearance of frizz and flyaways, and gave my hair</li>
            <li> Too much, and your hair can feel greasy.</li>
            <li> The fact that this oil doesn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel greasy is another reason why I like it so much because I can&#x27;t stand my hair being/looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this</li>
            <li> That was the real test for the Abyssinian Oil: could it take my frizzy hair of doom?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use much.</li>
            <li> and I am good to go for at least 10 hours.</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many other products</li>
            <li> The oil has a light, natural scent, and even though it says fragrance as the last ingredient, you really can’t tell that there is any fragrance in it.</li>
            <li> Most products weigh it down, but I use just a pea sized amount on my hair from about midway to the tips</li>
            <li> Most oils will make my curls separate and weigh down, but this works like a serum.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair looking so shiny and healthy with out weighing  down.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hair before starighting it helps all my frizzes lay down :)</li>
            <li> It looks shiny and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The main difference being is that the substance is absorbed by the hair and does not leave a greasy residue which often happens with similar products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine, dry, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> and since I personally don&#x27;t normally use sulfate shampoos I had to add another wash step into my normal shampoo routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product does not leave my hair feeling stiff and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I can absolutely tell a major difference!</li>
            <li> It made my naturally curly hair very soft and the shine lasts all day!</li>
            <li> It was able to control my hair and even make it smoother and fuller after a few weeks!</li>
            <li> My only con about this product though is that it&#x27;s first ingredient is mineral oil...and in order to thoroughly remove mineral oil from your hair you have to use a sulfate shampoo</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel velvety soft, shiny and not greasy or any residue!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s left my hair pretty greasy.</li>
            <li> after using this product it looked better and looked heathier then usual.</li>
            <li> This bottle makes it easy to pump out as much or as little oil that I need.</li>
            <li> I do apply it there only to help tame those gorgeous gray hairs and it adds such a luster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really fine easily breakable hair, plus it&#x27;s dry, and to top that off its low porosity, so it can drive me crazy, but this oil has a light fragrance and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I also love that you can use this oil on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> There is a scent to this oil but for me personally it&#x27;s not too strong or over powering but gives my hair a little extra fresh smell.</li>
            <li> I take care of my insides with vitamins and natural supplements.  </li>
            <li> I have received many compliments and questions about what I have been using on my hair lately.</li>
            <li> This has helped with my dead ends and makes it look so smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li> If you want soft shiny hair try this.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and took away the frizz.</li>
            <li> This product makes the hair soft, repaired &amp; refreshed.</li>
            <li> and I bought this because my naturally curly hair can be frizzy at times.  </li>
            <li> I have a few low rating about this oil, but upon trying the product, I actually love it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> My hair is always super frizzy and wavy, especially if I let it air dry or don&#x27;t straighten it.</li>
            <li> The key is to give it a quick blow dry</li>
            <li> This oil makes my hair soft and shiny while keeping my curls smooth with very little frizz.</li>
            <li> refreshing (yet subtle) scent</li>
            <li> highly recommend using it prior to blowdrying hair</li>
            <li> Flat irons alone can cause enough damage with how hot they can get.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for those avid flat iron users.</li>
            <li> and you probably will not need a whole pump to apply to your dampened or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have to get just the right amount to avoid weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> This isn’t as messy to apply as other oils, which is one of the better reasons to get it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My Hair becomes very dry when I am out in the sun to much.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to use too much or your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li> This should do great on my daughter&#x27;s crazy curly hair and my dry hair.</li>
            <li> It’s very light and doesn’t weigh down my hair, and it not very greasy like other oils.</li>
            <li> The ends are usually where hair is damaged, and using this--or any product--near the root will just weigh hair down, making it look flat and oily, and also requiring more frequent washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This Repair &amp; Heal Abyssinian Oil actually tames my frizz massively and makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> highly recommend giving this a try even if you have fine or very thin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can let it completely air dry</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair - but lots of it.</li>
            <li> I apply to clean wet hair and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent, it reminds me of baby food, but the product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Just a tint bit really does go a long way, so start with less than you think you&#x27;ll need</li>
            <li> You really only need one drop, as directed, so this bottle should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Although I stopped dyeing it about 5 or so years ago, I still do damage to it by using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use it with my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Even having hair as long as I do, it only took 3 drops, and that was rubbed vigorously between my hands and then running my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li> I use a hairdryer, flat Iron, hairspray, etc.</li>
            <li> I put a little less in than what&#x27;s recommended because my hair is fine, and it&#x27;s also less than medium-length.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that will help my hair look no so dry but will not make it look oily at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have super thin hair</li>
            <li> Generally my hair would be a big frizzy mess</li>
            <li> The name is so hard to say but my hair is very manageable now and I am thankful.</li>
            <li> Then, I put my head upside down, blow-dry my hair on low with a diffuser attachment, and finger-comb at the same time.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to try this product because others I have tried left my hair looking extremely greasy, but this hair oil surprised me.</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and used it in my hair after I washed it and allowed it to dry naturally</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way with this little bottle as you don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li> Since you only have to use a few drops for it to work, this bottle will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The IT oil not only protects the hair from heat damage, but I find it to give a volume boost and leaves the hair extremely</li>
            <li> All I have to do is blow dry it</li>
            <li> I use this product every day before I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> so it takes forever to blow dry it.. and</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry for a while and then finish it off with a dryer</li>
            <li> As a gal with hair that goes all the way down my back, which is color treated, I am forever looking for ways to improve its health.</li>
            <li> pump is all that you need, a little definitely goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I have used it both on wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Moroccan oil previously and different argan oils.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily in place of a volumizing spray, leave in conditioner AND hair gel that I previously used.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry</li>
            <li> I used a pea sized amount and my hair looks a little oily today after washing it before bed last night.</li>
            <li> I only do a little pump of the oil,rub it around my hands and then rub it through my hair.</li>
            <li> use this oil after I wash and condition on damp, but mostly wet hair, so I put it on before my styler.</li>
            <li> A few drops was enough for my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few It products and when I saw the Repair &amp; Heal Abyssinian Oil I definitely wanted to give it a try as well.</li>
            <li> I have been desperately trying to find an oil that I could use on my fine hair that wouldn&#x27;t weigh it down or leave it greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I have long thick curly hair that frizzes big time</li>
            <li> A little of the oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just remember, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This oil is extremely lightweight, almost runny if you will.</li>
            <li> This not only stopped the frizz, it added unbelievable sheen.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When you pump it in your hand it will run down your hand.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh it down</li>
            <li> kept my hair from getting too frizzy without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for something that smooths it out without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning after showering while my hair is still damp, then dry and style as usual.</li>
            <li> I put two drops in my palm and rub my hands together; then, I run my hands through the bottom half of my hair.</li>
            <li> You can buy it on eBay for half a price.</li>
            <li> My hair is really long, and really thick</li>
            <li> My hair did not feel heavy or weighed down on use</li>
            <li> Makes my daughters hard to take, dry, unruly hair feel and look.</li>
            <li> and I’ve never stayed longer than just a few months, but I’ve been using this for half a year now</li>
            <li> I have thick curly wavy hair that can feel dry and crack.</li>
            <li> Just a little massage</li>
            <li> I was not excited about this product because of it&#x27;s flammability and</li>
            <li> It makes my hair have a little weight instead of being so blown up by the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It has helped tame the frizzy mess I get on humid days</li>
            <li> how heavy it felt on my hair.  </li>
            <li> the put some on and blow dried my hair.</li>
            <li> Its too heavy and makes hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I had the driest hair from over processing it everyday.  </li>
            <li> or it may remain slightly stiff.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use it everyday either.great for all weather!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The number one ingredient is mineral oil which is not a favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount on the hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like it.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount and rub into my hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that makes sense to everyone.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been hard to manage.</li>
            <li> Like that oil is really thick.</li>
            <li> This is very thin and you can&#x27;t tel it&#x27;s distributing well when your hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I used just a small amount (I have very thick hair) and distributed evenly through my hair.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using it for the past 6 months, its done wonders to my thin hair</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I have very thick kinky hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> and it didn’t fail to disappoint me.</li>
            <li> Just one to two drops and your hair is silly and shiny.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I have done quite a bit of damage to it over the years.</li>
            <li> but sadly I&#x27;ll either have to trash it or give it away.</li>
            <li> I began using it on my hair and in no time I noticed that my hair was no longer limp and boring.</li>
            <li> I can’t say anything bad about it; I’d recommend it to my friends in no time!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed to see that this product has mineral oil in it.</li>
            <li> Loves how it doesnt leave it greasy or nasty after use!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome product. A little goes a very long way and I don&#x27;t have to use it everyday either.great for all weather!</li>
            <li> I am recommending this to my family and friends that have hair.  Not only does my hair look so healthy and shiny but the smell is so yummy.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick kinky hair.  I have tried so many products that claim this or that but I have to say I love these drops.  The name is so hard to say but my hair is very manageable now and I am thankful.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it makes my fine hair much fuller. It&#x27;s easy to massage into hair after washing &amp; before blow drying. Can&#x27;t imagine being without it as it&#x27;s made a real difference in the way my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Well, the stories were true, this is definitely a pretty good oil to have. Rubbing it on hair produces a really nice effects.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten as many compliments as I did when I used this product.</li>
            <li> I’ve used a lot of hair products before and I’ve never stayed longer than just a few months, but I’ve been using this for half a year now and it didn’t fail to disappoint me. I’ll definitely be using this again in the future.</li>
            <li> I put about a dime size on my palm for my shoulder length hair. Adds so much volume.</li>
            <li> I have finely textured blonde, straight hair, but a lot of it. Most products weigh it down, but I use just a pea sized amount on my hair from about midway to the tips and I have been very impressed. My hair actually looks thicker and the product tames the flyaway.</li>
            <li> I take care of my insides with vitamins and natural supplements.  Why would I not do the same for my hair?  I love this product because it revitalizes the hair follicles and makes me feel so much younger.</li>
            <li> I use with my hot rollers to give my hair full body.</li>
            <li> Lots of shine, manageable, and my hair keeps its shape.</li>
            <li> My hair has become fuller and bounces every time I move. It’s absolutely lovely!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! I apply to clean wet hair and a little goes a long way. No need for sticky hair gel. My hair keeps its bounce and curls all day. Compliments when I wear a curly or straight look.</li>
            <li> This isn’t as messy to apply as other oils, which is one of the better reasons to get it in my opinion. Really worth the money!</li>
            <li> Excellent oil… I really like using it</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way. I mostly use this on my bangs and front of hair. It adds so much great style and texture that I hardly have to do anything else. Great product.</li>
            <li> All I do is to massage it in my hair after showering. Just a little massage and it would make me feel great already! All I have to do is blow dry it and it comes out just as perfectly.</li>
            <li> I use just a dab before blow drying.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been hard to manage. This product however changed that! It was able to control my hair and even make it smoother and fuller after a few weeks! I can’t say anything bad about it; I’d recommend it to my friends in no time!</li>
            <li> I just use a small amount after I shampoo and it makes my hair look great!</li>
            <li> I use this every morning after showering while my hair is still damp, then dry and style as usual. It has a nice scent and gives my hair amazing, healthy volume. My stylist even commented today when I went for a cut that my hair seemed thicker than before. I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
            <li> This has a light herbal like scent and is a very watery, yet oily consistency. When you pump it in your hand it will run down your hand. There is a pump which is nice and you probably will not need a whole pump to apply to your dampened or dry hair. I used a whole pump and ended up using it on my elbow, knees and legs. Whatever was left is what I used on my hair, mostly on the ends. It did have my hair looking nice and healthy and did not leave it overly oily, but I can see how you can have this happen. I would suggest you use very little initially and figure out what is best for you. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
            <li> I think my before and after photo speaks for itself! These photos were taken about 10 seconds apart. I applied only a couple drops to my hands, rubbed them together, then ran my fingers through my hair (but not at the roots). Instantly, my hair had added luster, shine, and brightness. Also, it was more silky and shiny, reducing the frizz. IT Repair &amp; Heal Abyssinian Oil really made my hair transform. I didn&#x27;t use any heat products. I can only imagine the improvement if I had straightened my hair! Since you only have to use a few drops for it to work, this bottle will last for a long time. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Just one to two drops and your hair is silly and shiny. It has a great smell too. Disclaimer: I got a discount in order to review fairly.</li>
            <li> Smoothes my hair like no product before also seems to strengthen it because it doesn&#x27;t break as easily anymore</li>
            <li> Having used several dyes on my hair from my teenage years on, I have done a massive amount of damage overall to it. Although I stopped dyeing it about 5 or so years ago, I still do damage to it by using a flat iron. Flat irons alone can cause enough damage with how hot they can get. Since using this oil on my hair, I have noticed a difference in how it feels. It doesn&#x27;t look lifeless anymore. It looks shiny and vibrant. I love this product and plan to order more when it&#x27;s all gone. Definitely recommend for those avid flat iron users. *Received for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I was not excited about this product because of it&#x27;s flammability and how heavy it felt on my hair.  I just didn&#x27;t do enough reading about the product before I bought it.  I emailed the company and asked if it was a pure abyssinian oil but never received a reply and I bought it anyway.  My mistake!&lt;br /&gt;The number one ingredient is mineral oil which is not a favorite of mine.  I&#x27;ll probably donate it to the women&#x27;s shelter where they will not be as picky as I am.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair, and my hair loves any oil. This bottle makes it easy to pump out as much or as little oil that I need. The ingredients are great; some people may not be okay with the mineral oil, but I have no problem with it. The oil has a light, natural scent, and even though it says fragrance as the last ingredient, you really can’t tell that there is any fragrance in it. The consistency is very lightweight and thin.&lt;br /&gt;I use this oil after I wash and condition on damp, but mostly wet hair, so I put it on before my styler. I also put some on my ends to lock in moisture, and it applies very easily. Most oils will make my curls separate and weigh down, but this works like a serum. It’s very light and doesn’t weigh down my hair, and it not very greasy like other oils. This oil makes my hair soft and shiny while keeping my curls smooth with very little frizz. I can’t confirm how great it protects or restores my hair, but I’m sure that it’ll do great with the ingredients it contains.</li>
            <li> This will give your hair great shine instantly. It&#x27;s a very lightweight oil so it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all. A few drops was enough for my medium length hair. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent either, it&#x27;s light and natural. It made my naturally curly hair very soft and the shine lasts all day! Because the oil is so lightweight it works well as a heat protectant. My only con about this product though is that it&#x27;s first ingredient is mineral oil...and in order to thoroughly remove mineral oil from your hair you have to use a sulfate shampoo and since I personally don&#x27;t normally use sulfate shampoos I had to add another wash step into my normal shampoo routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW. MY OPINIONS OF THIS PRODUCT ARE BASED ON MY OWN HONEST AND UNBIASED EXPERIENCE USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> i love this product and works great with my hair.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this oil! Besides the fact that it smells amazing, it makes my hair super soft and shiny. A little of the oil goes a long way. I usually only use one pump of the oil for the ends. This also helps protect your hair from heat. I&#x27;ve only used this for a week and I&#x27;m already a fan of this. I&#x27;ll be getting more when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, in the front my hair starting to grow back.</li>
            <li> My Hair becomes very dry when I am out in the sun to much. I have been looking for a product that will help my hair look no so dry but will not make it look oily at the same time. This product was for sure it! My hair looks great when I use it and I have received several compliments</li>
            <li> This was really tested yesterday a we were at a reunion all day and the humidity was so high and hot!!!! Generally my hair would be a big frizzy mess but it was soft and smooth from the beginning to end ! Honestly I don&#x27;t take great care of my hair and don&#x27;t keep it trimmed like I should but,  Five stars is just not enough for this product!</li>
            <li> Makes my daughters hard to take, dry, unruly hair feel and look. Amazing. Received discounted for review</li>
            <li> i love it. its perfect and i bought at discount price. Should try it.</li>
            <li> Received this quickly, immediately tried it after my shower this evening. Made my hair feel velvety soft, shiny and not greasy or any residue! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product! i just started using it and i can feel the difference in my hair already!!</li>
            <li> Just a small amount on the hair and it already looks stunning!</li>
            <li> Product works great and I have learned not to use too much for it to give the results intended.</li>
            <li> Just a dime sized amount is good.</li>
            <li> It adds volume and shine.</li>
            <li> This product is very kind to my hair and very effective. I don&#x27;t need to use much to get the control and style I want. It leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I said to my family as much. This is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and I use this to give it a thicker appearance&lt;br /&gt;and volume.</li>
            <li> this oil is great my hair stay shiny all day. Like that oil is really thick. Really good for flat ironing hair get a nice smooth finish. Was bought on discount for honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! My hair is always super frizzy and wavy, especially if I let it air dry or don&#x27;t straighten it. I was a little nervous to try this product because others I have tried left my hair looking extremely greasy, but this hair oil surprised me. It only took two pumps to cover my entire hair, it almost instantly started to straighten my hair out and take away the frizz. It left my hair with a very pretty shine without a oily look or feel, it actually looks healthy to me and feel softer. I&#x27;m so excited I found this stuff, I will be purchasing again! I can&#x27;t wait to try it out when I go to the beach later this week because my hair freaks out with the slightest humidity, but I think this product will pass the test.  I took a photo of my hair before, a photo right after I put it in my hair, and a photo after I used a straighter on it. I can absolutely tell a major difference!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product but i cant wait to get it. This should do great on my daughter&#x27;s crazy curly hair and my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I am always getting my hair bleached and straightened so it&#x27;s always in need of extra moisturizer and oils. So when I was offered this It Repair &amp; Healing for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it. I ordered and the day it arrived I washed my hair the put some on and blow dried my hair. For the last week or so I&#x27;ve been using it every couple days and each time my hair it super soft and smooth. I definitely recommend this It Repair &amp; Healing product.</li>
            <li> I have been desperately trying to find an oil that I could use on my fine hair that wouldn&#x27;t weigh it down or leave it greasy looking. After all these years...yes, years...I finally found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough great things about this oil. I have used it both on wet and dry hair. It has helped tame the frizzy mess I get on humid days and it makes my hair SHINE! My husband even noticed that my hair looked great. I have received many compliments and questions about what I have been using on my hair lately. It is that great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, my hair is fine and is weighed down easily. I put two drops in my palm and rub my hands together; then, I run my hands through the bottom half of my hair. I do not apply it to the roots. I am also getting some unruly gray hairs at my temples. I do apply it there only to help tame those gorgeous gray hairs and it adds such a luster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend giving this a try even if you have fine or very thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was received either at no or low cost for review and inspection purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have to say this product smells GREAT. It&#x27;s has a fresh citrusy scent perfect for the summer. I&#x27;ve received several compliments when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several repair oils, mostly from big brands like Pantene and L&#x27;Oreal, yet I can say I&#x27;m much more pleased by the effects noticed by this product. The main difference being is that the substance is absorbed by the hair and does not leave a greasy residue which often happens with similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend using it prior to blowdrying hair -which is what damaged my hair. The IT oil not only protects the hair from heat damage, but I find it to give a volume boost and leaves the hair extremely shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the immediate effects that I noticed after first use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Great Shine&lt;br /&gt;-Reduced frizz&lt;br /&gt;-Increased body and volume&lt;br /&gt;-Smooths hair&lt;br /&gt;-Pleasant refreshing (yet subtle) scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see the improvements in my hair as I continue to use this product. I&#x27;ve already received several compliments since I began using it. Highly recommend, and I know I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and how nice my hair feels when using.  My hair is very dry so I am always looking for something to help keep it smooth.  My hair did not feel heavy or weighed down on use and it kept my unruly curls frizz free.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> You really only need one drop, as directed, so this bottle should last a long time.  My hair felt really nice after using it, and it was smooth and frizz free. I really enjoy using oils in my hair, and this is great to keep it in good shape, without damage from heat. Very nice product, and nice packaging.</li>
            <li> A must have. Works wonders. I had a lot of split ends and have been using this oil on my ends instead of trimming as my beautician always seems to trim a bit too much to my liking so I recieved this oil and wanted to try a different approach. So far so good. Leaves my hair looking so shiny and healthy with out weighing  down. I highly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Hair products are addicting and getting to try out this IT repair serum for the price was great. My hair stayed smooth and not oily at all so that was a plus. Seller shipped out item super fast that was a good thing</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. You have to be careful not to use too much or your hair will look greasy. But I used a frutis frizz product similar and this stuff knocks it out of the water. I will be using this form now on. I put it on my hair before starighting it helps all my frizzes lay down :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s left my hair pretty greasy. I&#x27;m not sure I like it. We&#x27;ll see if anything changes as weeks go by.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t miraculous.  Use lightly otherwise very greasy looking hair.  I use it with my flat iron.  Been using for a couple months.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount and rub into my hair. It gives an added fullness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price but does the job on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have to get just the right amount to avoid weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day before I blow dry my hair. It&#x27;s one of the best things that&#x27;s ever happened to me. I apply a generous amount to my hair from root to tip, and it leaves my hair shiny and soft when I blow it out straight, or with perfect ringlets when I diffuse it. When I first started using it, I even got more compliments on my hair colour, because this product just made EVERYTHING better. Also, no one seems to mention how fantastic this stuff smells.</li>
            <li> I used this product after I towel-dried my hair. I used just a small amount (I have very thick hair) and distributed evenly through my hair. I used the blow-dryer to finish drying it. The next day, I had three different people, at three different times comment on how beautiful and healthy my hair looked. I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent, it reminds me of baby food, but the product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair - but lots of it. My hair is also short. It does not weigh it down and I use a pin head amount.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth and gives me more volume than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair. This has helped with my dead ends and makes it look so smooth and shinny. The smell of the product is great just alil strong. I like the smell of my shampoo so don&#x27;t like that it takes over but it is worth the change. My husband says i look beautiful and that my hair looks so different.</li>
            <li> It is not expensive, and it lasts a good 6 months or so.  I have super thin hair and it is a necessity!</li>
            <li> Loves how it doesnt leave it greasy or nasty after use! Helps keep my hair oh so beuatiful!</li>
            <li> Even though I put a little amount on my hair it does amazing things! I can keep curls on my hair bouncy all the time. There is no need for using things such as oils and hair gels ever again.</li>
            <li> Does great things for my hair. It adds fullness without leaving a residue. After blow drying my hair feels soft and smooth. Can&#x27;t go without it!</li>
            <li> I began using it on my hair and in no time I noticed that my hair was no longer limp and boring. It had a body and was bouncy! I can’t be happier with the results! It’s amazing indeed!</li>
            <li> I have really fine easily breakable hair, plus it&#x27;s dry, and to top that off its low porosity, so it can drive me crazy, but this oil has a light fragrance and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> It gives volume, yet helps control frizz.</li>
            <li> I use this oil daily as a sealer for my Shea Moisture hair milk. It does an excellent job for keeping the moisture in and making my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> Its too heavy and makes hair greasy. Didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t pure abyssinian oil, it contains mineral oil as the primary ingredient. You can buy it on eBay for half a price. Pure Argan oil is much better for longer hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is really long, and really thick so it takes forever to blow dry it.. and from blow drying it so often my hair has become a bit dried out but thanks to this IT Repair my hair is now once again sleek and shiny and gorgeous! After using it for one week I can no longer see split ends when I check the ends of my hair and let&#x27;s be honest.. No girl wants split ends! This is definitely a great product that I would recommend to all of my friends :)</li>
            <li> I received this to review. It smells really good but it makes my scalp itch.</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and used it in my hair after I washed it and allowed it to dry naturally and I must say it is keeping my hair tamed. I have straight, fine, dry hair and this product worked great.  kept my hair from getting too frizzy without weighing it down. I will try to use it when i am straightening my hair to see how it goes with the heat- hopefully it&#x27;ll be amazing! Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As a gal with hair that goes all the way down my back, which is color treated, I am forever looking for ways to improve its health. I&#x27;ve tried oils, creams, leave in treatments, the whole nine, so I was eager to see what It Repair &amp; Heal offered. This oil is extremely lightweight, almost runny if you will. It&#x27;s got a very strong citrusy scent, so if that&#x27;s not your thing, then I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this oil. One important factor to remember is DO NOT USE A LOT OF THIS PRODUCT! Even having hair as long as I do, it only took 3 drops, and that was rubbed vigorously between my hands and then running my hands through my hair. I&#x27;d also advise to avoid the root area at all costs, because then the effects are the opposite, and your hair looks greasy. Overall, I am pleased with the product. It absolutely reduced the appearance of frizz and flyaways, and gave my hair a clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;Discounted for evaluation</li>
            <li> My hair gets dried out sometimes from too much coloring and processing. I&#x27;m always looking for something that smooths it out without weighing it down. These shine drops were immediately rejuvenating. Just a tint bit really does go a long way, so start with less than you think you&#x27;ll need (you can always add more if you need it!). My hair went from flyaway frizz to shiny and soft with the very first use. I would definitely use this again and keep it on hand for untameable hair days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Moroccan oil previously and different argan oils. This is very thin and you can&#x27;t tel it&#x27;s distributing well when your hair is wet. I used a pea sized amount and my hair looks a little oily today after washing it before bed last night. I have shoulder length hair, if that matters, but I&#x27;ve never had issues with hair oils before. The oil itself smells very nice and the pump works well.    *I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> I have used many different products in my hair over the years. and this one is one of the better ones. I have thick curly wavy hair that can feel dry and crack. after using this product it looked better and looked heathier then usual. I even recommend it my friends and to all over you.</li>
            <li> I am a curly haired girl and this helped tons, my hair stayed frizz free and the curls stayed defined, what more can I ask for in the Summer. I will continue to use this, because it also makes my hair shine</li>
            <li> This stuff gives my hair a sinful amount of body. I&#x27;ve had some hair loss after recent surgeries, and this product has been wonderful while I&#x27;m waiting for some regrowth. I put a little less in than what&#x27;s recommended because my hair is fine, and it&#x27;s also less than medium-length. Then, I put my head upside down, blow-dry my hair on low with a diffuser attachment, and finger-comb at the same time. Just remember, a little goes a long way. Too much, and your hair can feel greasy. You can always put more in. Absolutely worth it!</li>
            <li> This product has been doing wonderful things to my hair. It makes it look healthier, fuller and even more beautiful.</li>
            <li> My friend uses this product. It works great on her honey blonde hair! She totally recommends it.</li>
            <li> OMG!! This product is wonderful. I had the driest hair from over processing it everyday.  I use a hairdryer, flat Iron, hairspray, etc. and I have tried so many other products but this is without a doubt the best.  If you want soft shiny hair try this.  It makes my hair so soft and shiny. I love it when people tell me that my hair looks so soft and shiny.  I&#x27;ve had people ask if they can touch touch it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite a while. I have very fine straight hair and it helps my hair to look fuller.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using it for the past 6 months, its done wonders to my thin hair</li>
            <li> The fullness that it adds to my hair is just wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have fine, dry, naturally curly hair. I bought this product based on the huge amount of reviews and am glad I did. I use this product daily in place of a volumizing spray, leave in conditioner AND hair gel that I previously used. I let my hair air dry for a while and then finish it off with a dryer and I am good to go for at least 10 hours. This product does not leave my hair feeling stiff and I love the smell. The key is to give it a quick blow dry I don&#x27;t think you can let it completely air dry or it may remain slightly stiff. All in all, a great product.</li>
            <li> Every day for me now is a great hair day! I’m impressed at how this product can make my hair appear gorgeous in no time!</li>
            <li> My stylist used it last time I got a cut and I haven&#x27;t looked back! It makes my hair have a little weight instead of being so blown up by the blow dryer. Not sure if that makes sense to everyone. It makes it look more polished. Smells SO good!</li>
            <li> It’s become one of my favourite hair products!</li>
            <li> It adds volume to my hair and absorbs well so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day. I tried styling my hair without this and I noticed a difference in my hair volume.</li>
            <li> Did not work as well on my hair as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few It products and when I saw the Repair &amp; Heal Abyssinian Oil I definitely wanted to give it a try as well. I have long thick curly hair that frizzes big time and unfortunately I have done quite a bit of damage to it over the years. This Repair &amp; Heal Abyssinian Oil actually tames my frizz massively and makes my hair shiny and soft. I love how easy this oil is to use since it comes with a dispenser. A little does go a long way with this little bottle as you don&#x27;t need much at all. I only do a little pump of the oil,rub it around my hands and then rub it through my hair. I also love that you can use this oil on wet or dry hair. The fact that this oil doesn&#x27;t make my hair look or feel greasy is another reason why I like it so much because I can&#x27;t stand my hair being/looking greasy. There is a scent to this oil but for me personally it&#x27;s not too strong or over powering but gives my hair a little extra fresh smell. I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> Just like another product I Just reviewed I am very disappointed to see that this product has mineral oil in it. It&#x27;s all the first ingredient which means its the &amp;#34;main&amp;#34; ingredient. I do not use products that have this ingredient in my hair or skin. I really wanted to try this but sadly I&#x27;ll either have to trash it or give it away. I received this product for a discount for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Love it. It made my hair soft and took away the frizz. Plus it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use a lot of product, but my hair is curly and tends to be pretty frizzy on the days I wash it. That was the real test for the Abyssinian Oil: could it take my frizzy hair of doom? It could and it did and I am so relieved to have finally found a product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy but that tames the frizz while giving some shiny awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hints, tips, tricks: you don&#x27;t need a lot (this is great because it lasts longer). Seriously. Don&#x27;t use much. I used a tiny drop and worked it into my hair after I got out of the shower. Focus on the ends rather than the root. The ends are usually where hair is damaged, and using this--or any product--near the root will just weigh hair down, making it look flat and oily, and also requiring more frequent washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a great experience with this product. I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have a few low rating about this oil, but upon trying the product, I actually love it.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very simple and straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a pump that dispenses the right amount of product, the bottle is made of glass and it is transparent.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that since it&#x27;s easier to see if the product is almost gone or whatnot.&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself has an orange-y scent, I personally do not mind as the scent isnt really that strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;One pump is all that you need, a little definitely goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;In the instructions, it says to warm the oil in your palm before applying it in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;At first, I didnt really followed that and my hair looked a bit &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;But upon &amp;#34;warming&amp;#34; the oil first before applying it to the hair actually made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is really light to begin with, so you do not need to put more than one pump.&lt;br /&gt;I find it very useful now that it is the summer time, and my hair gets more brittle and dull.&lt;br /&gt;It gives my hair the right shine, making it look healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and lastly, I suggest that you only apply halfway towards the ends, it gives you the tousled look.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this using a promo code for testing.</li>
            <li> A+ for the effectiveness of the product. It actually does what it says. &amp; it nourishes Hair, giving back the enrichment we all desire. This product makes the hair soft, repaired &amp; refreshed.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is amazing!.  I thought my hair was shiny before...and I bought this because my naturally curly hair can be frizzy at times.  This not only stopped the frizz, it added unbelievable sheen.  And even better, it has a great scent, and make your hair smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this &amp;#34;It Repair and Heal Abyssinian Oil&amp;#34;!  It smells amazing and my hair is loving it too! Thank you for letting me review this wonderful product...  I will definitely be buying more once this gone!</li>
            <li> I apply it at night after showering and towel drying my hair. In the morning my hair is a lot thicker feeling and will hold a style better</li>
            <li> I use it after every shampoo before styling to give body and fullness to my hair.</li>
            <li> Just a pea-sized amount is all I need. So, this is actually a good value given how long the bottle lasts!</li>
            <li> Next to a good haircut and hairspray, a woman with thinning hair needs texture. This product does it.</li>
