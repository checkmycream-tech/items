            <li>If youre easy with them, you wont need closing pliers to reclose the rings.</li>
            <li>I lost my original opening pliers in moving, ordered these</li>

            <li>This tool does exactly what it says, it opens stubborn segment rings and CBRs.</li>
            <li>Bought this because i knew i was going to need it for my higher gauge piercings, mainly segment rings and captive beads.</li>
            <li>I wear 7/16&#x27;&#x27; silicone &amp;#34;skins&amp;#34; with 8g captive ball rings run thru them.</li>
            <li>Well built and very functional.</li>

            <li>Due to the low selling price of these pliers, I wasn&#x27;t sure that I was going to get a decent set of pliers.</li>
            <li>picture is miss leading and as all items were separably posted NOT cost effective at all, not happy.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to go to the piercer every time you need to remove certain more difficult rings.</li>
            <li>This company totally replaced it for free with little to no argument.  </li>
            <li>Love these pliers no longer standing around fighting with a suborn ring or yelling for help from the other half.</li>
            <li>They make it really simple to open a stubborn captive bead ring.</li>

            <li> These are perfect for body jewlery.  I got these for a segmented hoop I wear in my nose.  100% thumbs up!</li>

            <li> If you have anything from 14-4&#x27;s and you wear captives, this will work like a champ for you. Easy to use and seems to be pretty decent quality. Mine have worked more than well for me.</li>

            <li> I love these! I finally can get my body jewelry to open and close as it needs to.</li>
            <li> Pliers worked exactly as advertised. Quality construction - no complaints. I don&#x27;t see using these constantly, but they are nice to have around when you need them.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I needed it for. It opens the Rings I need to put in without messing up the jewlery.</li>
            <li> My package was lost or stolen somewhere.  This company totally replaced it for free with little to no argument.  All I can say is great company.  With out them I could have never replaced my balls on my bcrs.  They didn&#x27;t look to good as a part ring thru my ears. Thank you again if I need any thing else in your line of products. I will be getting them thru you. Thanks so very much!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Well built and very functional.</li>
            <li> This tool does exactly what it says, it opens stubborn segment rings and CBRs. It does not close them back up, so you will need another tool for that. This was not constructed to also close the rings, so I definitely won&#x27;t doc my rating because of that.</li>
            <li> Love these pliers no longer standing around fighting with a suborn ring or yelling for help from the other half. Easy to use makes getting those suborn rings out easy and fast.</li>
            <li> Bought these so I could change out my nose ring by myself instead of paying a piercer $20 to do it every time. Works perfectly - just like the tool they use in a shop. Great price and great quality.</li>
            <li> Perfect for opening rings so you don&#x27;t have to go to the piercer every time you need to remove certain more difficult rings.</li>
            <li> These ring opening pliers are great if you like captive bead ring jewelry. They make it really simple to open a stubborn captive bead ring. Decent price, as well.</li>
            <li> These are great opening pliers.  I would definitely order them again.  I lost my original opening pliers in moving, ordered these and they work great</li>
