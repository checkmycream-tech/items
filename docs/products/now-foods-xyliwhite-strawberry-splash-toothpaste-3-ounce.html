            <li>My children enjoy the flavor of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>that is flouride free and contains xylitol.  </li>
            <li>fluoride free</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy it at first, but She liked it so much</li>
            <li>My little one loved it!</li>
            <li>Other than her opinion on the taste it is a great product.</li>
            <li>love it for our 18 month old...</li>
            <li>We started her off with Spry Xylitol, and &#x27;graduated&#x27; her to a more adult toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Not at all concerned about my 2 yr old swallowing since the ingredients are perfectly safe.</li>
            <li>(other children toothpaste products don&#x27;t make a good foam</li>

            <li>My children really like to brush their teeth with this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I first took him in</li>
            <li>HE USES MY ADULT ECO FRIENDLY TOOTHPASTE</li>
            <li>I bought it because his teeth were becoming very discolored with his standard children&#x27;s toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I wanted to find a toothpaste with Xylitol for my little one that is fluoride free and this fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Now brand is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Will order again online as it is much cheaper using Amazon.</li>
            <li>so much &amp; won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>Kids don&#x27;t like it as much as we thought they would.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>and some of that is due to using things in it with xylitol! :)</li>
            <li>I bought this for my two year old granddaughter, she really likes it to the point she would rather just eat it than brush her teeth with it.</li>
            <li>We also tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine Fluoride Free Children&#x27;s Toothpaste in Silly Strawberry, but the XyliWhite foams much nicer and has a better flavor than the Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li>The lid is also somewhat hard for them to open, though fortunately it can be unscrewed like a huge cap.  </li>
            <li>NO doctors visits for my kids in the 3 years they&#x27;ve been alive!</li>
            <li>Costs a little more than your regular children&#x27;s toothpaste or even adult toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Our 3 year old enjoys brushing her teeth with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I am caring for my now 3 year old nephew.  </li>

            <li>My 4 year old loves the flavor.</li>
            <li>My 2 yr old son loves it...</li>
            <li>I really like too actually.  </li>
            <li>My daughter doesn&#x27;t really like the flavor of this toothpaste which is why I only gave it four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li>Color me surprised.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old that cannot use fluoride loves this.  </li>
            <li>My very finicky son has sensory issues and he will only use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>, I did a search and tried this one, my 2 and 4 yrs old like it</li>
            <li>highly recommended, definitely will buy again.</li>

            <li> highly recommended, definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste my 4 year old will use.</li>
            <li> You just have to start with a very small dab at first.</li>
            <li> She actually lets me brush her teeth now because it makes some bubbles which the other one didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks his teeth are back to white using XyliWhite.</li>
            <li> Half of the battle is related to the taste.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s harder to find in a kids&#x27; toothpaste than it should be.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the tube design, however, because it springs back into shape, making it hard for my kids to get the toothpaste out when it&#x27;s nearly empty.  </li>
            <li> Not sure of the long term use pros or cons yet.</li>
            <li> well though so sometimes I add a little baking soda.</li>
            <li> (check out other items with xylitol in them like Xclear nasal spray!!</li>
            <li> all the other toothpastes we&#x27;ve tried previously that were strawberry flavored they always complained about the taste, but not with this brand.</li>
            <li> For use with our small children.  </li>
            <li> he was sick so much from daycare.  </li>
            <li> And unlike many other  brands of fluoride-free that I find at Wal-Mart or grocery stores, it&#x27;s not full of nasty chemicals you don&#x27;t want your kids swallowing, dyes or artificial flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The kids didn&#x27;t care for the taste and it left a bad mess in the bathroom including stains.</li>
            <li> Never had a complaint.</li>
            <li> Brushing teeth is a serious challenge.</li>
            <li> Too bad the kid&#x27;s version only comes in Strawberry.</li>
            <li> Totally keeps my kids from getting sick!</li>
            <li> I picked this one since it does not have all that nasty stuff such as flouride.</li>
            <li> There is no fluoride, which is a dangerous chemical, and we should avoid it.</li>
            <li> (yeah I had to test it out), and the xylitol kills bacteria to also help kiddos not get sick</li>
            <li> and they are a bit disappointed).</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My children enjoy the flavor of this toothpaste. Dental appointments have been going well with their daily use of this product. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a toothpaste with Xylitol for my little one that is fluoride free and this fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves the taste and I like knowing that he actually takes the time to brush his teeth as opposed to rushing through the process.</li>
            <li> My children really like to brush their teeth with this toothpaste! Taste is great, and it is as healthy a toothpaste as I can find.</li>
            <li> My kids like the taste of this toothpaste</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter who does not like the taste of mint toothpaste.  I like that is flouride free and contains xylitol.  She likes the taste.</li>
            <li> Our 3 year old enjoys brushing her teeth with this toothpaste. Never had a complaint.</li>
            <li> My son likes it and not all the chemicals</li>
            <li> My son LOVES this tooth paste. I bought it because his teeth were becoming very discolored with his standard children&#x27;s toothpaste. Within a few weeks his teeth are back to white using XyliWhite.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my two year old granddaughter, she really likes it to the point she would rather just eat it than brush her teeth with it. I like it because it is safe for her to use.</li>
            <li> My kids love it.  It contains xylitol, which has been shown to kill plaque bacteria because they can&#x27;t digest it.  I don&#x27;t like the tube design, however, because it springs back into shape, making it hard for my kids to get the toothpaste out when it&#x27;s nearly empty.  The lid is also somewhat hard for them to open, though fortunately it can be unscrewed like a huge cap.  Too bad the kid&#x27;s version only comes in Strawberry.</li>
            <li> love it for our 18 month old...great flavor</li>
            <li> Great product. My son likes the flavor And it doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride  Makes brushing a toddlers teeth easier for sure.</li>
            <li> Our grandkids love this toothpaste and I love the Xylitol which helps fight bacteria.  The Now brand is much cheaper.  The orange flavor&lt;br /&gt;is a big hit too.  Will order again online as it is much cheaper using Amazon.</li>
            <li> The kids will brush with this paste, it doesn&#x27;t have flouride and it does contain xylitol - which some say helps reduce harmful bacteria. Works for us.</li>
            <li> Boy do the kids love this stuff! I don&#x27;t think it cleans that well though so sometimes I add a little baking soda.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste was all they stated it would be. My daughter loves it and uses it daily. the really nice part is I don&#x27;t have to worry about her getting fluoride from this product as it is harmful for the body.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this toothpaste.  We started her off with Spry Xylitol, and &#x27;graduated&#x27; her to a more adult toothpaste.  She loves the fact that it is bit foamy, and I&#x27;m happy with the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> MY CHILD HATES THIS PRODUCT , WOULD NOT REPURCHASE OR RECOMMEND . INSTEAD OF THIS PRODUCT HE USES MY ADULT ECO FRIENDLY TOOTHPASTE</li>
            <li> This is an awesome toothpaste for kids I even tried it and it taste great, plus if kids eat it they don&#x27;t get poisoned</li>
            <li> I have two boys...one loves it...one hates it.</li>
            <li> The kids love the flavor</li>
            <li> My daughters love this toothpaste! It&#x27;s nice to know how good it is for their teeth with the xylitol without any worries of fluoride!</li>
            <li> Great taste (yeah I had to test it out), and the xylitol kills bacteria to also help kiddos not get sick (check out other items with xylitol in them like Xclear nasal spray!! Totally keeps my kids from getting sick! NO doctors visits for my kids in the 3 years they&#x27;ve been alive! and some of that is due to using things in it with xylitol! :)</li>
            <li> I am caring for my now 3 year old nephew.  I got this for him with the thought of xylitol killing germs to prevent sickness.&lt;br /&gt;When I first took him in he was sick so much from daycare.  He passed everything to me.  Since I have been using xyltol&lt;br /&gt;toothpaste sickness is almost erradicated.  I&#x27;m very happy with this toothpaste so I have purchased an adult version for&lt;br /&gt;myself.</li>
            <li> My son has some sensory issues and the texture and flavor he gags with every time. I just started using for my kiddos so we will see by the end of the tube. Every other part of the purchase was great!</li>
            <li> My kids love this toothpaste! And unlike many other  brands of fluoride-free that I find at Wal-Mart or grocery stores, it&#x27;s not full of nasty chemicals you don&#x27;t want your kids swallowing, dyes or artificial flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids like it so much &amp; won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> My kids love this toothpaste- all the other toothpastes we&#x27;ve tried previously that were strawberry flavored they always complained about the taste, but not with this brand.</li>
            <li> Great chemical free option for kids. My son likes the taste too</li>
            <li> My little one loved it! highly recommended, definitely will buy again. I have tried with some others but this one is the best</li>
            <li> I love the all natural ingredients and the high amount of Xylitol. My 4 year old loves the flavor. We tried Jason Kids Only toothpaste (which my 7 year used) and he didn&#x27;t care for the taste. We also tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine Fluoride Free Children&#x27;s Toothpaste in Silly Strawberry, but the XyliWhite foams much nicer and has a better flavor than the Tom&#x27;s of Maine. Now both my kids use this one. Okay, I confess, I use it too.</li>
            <li> My son likes this.  It has a very nice flavor. I have used too and thought it was pretty good. This is a good toothpaste that is ok if swallowed. My son knows how to spit out his toothpaste now but still likes this one. Costs a little more than your regular children&#x27;s toothpaste or even adult toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My 2 yr old son loves it...I really like too actually.  It has a very very very light spiciness to it. You just have to start with a very small dab at first. Great product!</li>
            <li> Kids don&#x27;t like it as much as we thought they would.  It&#x27;s okay though and they still use it and it does the job.</li>
            <li> I had been buying another kids&#x27; toothpaste made of xylitol but it was more expensive and my daughter was just ok with it. This one she loves. She actually lets me brush her teeth now because it makes some bubbles which the other one didn&#x27;t. And she loves the taste.</li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t really like the flavor of this toothpaste which is why I only gave it four stars instead of five. Other than her opinion on the taste it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Three kids with sensory issues two with autism. Brushing teeth is a serious challenge. Half of the battle is related to the taste. This stuff? All three love. They actually volunteer to brush now. Color me surprised. I feel much better giving them this too.</li>
            <li> My child loves this toothpaste. I was hesitant to buy it at first, but She liked it so much I ordered the grown-up version for myself. There is no fluoride, which is a dangerous chemical, and we should avoid it. Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I picked this one since it does not have all that nasty stuff such as flouride. My daughter loves the strawberry flavor!</li>
            <li> Kids love the taste and how it foams up (other children toothpaste products don&#x27;t make a good foam and they are a bit disappointed). I love the ingredients. I wish it came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old likes this, great non fluoride tooth paste!</li>
            <li> we have been searching for kids toothpaste that uses simple ingredients and does not contain yucky stuff. This one is a hit with our kid.</li>
            <li> Will buy again and again. My kids love the taste. Not at all concerned about my 2 yr old swallowing since the ingredients are perfectly safe. Will buy again and again</li>
            <li> For use with our small children.  The flavor is good but the kids don&#x27;t have the desire to &amp;#34;eat it like candy.&amp;#34;  Comforting to have options that do not include fluoride.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old that cannot use fluoride loves this.  I am so glad I found this stuff for him</li>
            <li> and no fluoride. That&#x27;s harder to find in a kids&#x27; toothpaste than it should be. My very finicky son has sensory issues and he will only use this toothpaste. So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Kids love its strawberry flavor</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste my 4 year old will use.</li>
            <li> We recently switched from Tom&#x27;s of Maine silly strawberry to this brand while I do more research about fluoride in toothpaste. Not sure of the long term use pros or cons yet.</li>
            <li> The kids didn&#x27;t care for the taste and it left a bad mess in the bathroom including stains.</li>
            <li> Excellent healthy choice for kids fluoride free, I did a search and tried this one, my 2 and 4 yrs old like it and I have peace of mind not letting fluoride get in their system. Recommended!</li>
