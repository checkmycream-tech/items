            <li> Very rich cream with glycolic acid....excellent for maturing skin. The texture and appearance of my skin has improved. If you usually use Retin A, this cream is a good alternative . There is a slight tingling to it when first applied but not bothersome.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite night face cream ever.  It has hydrates and exfoliates your skin when you are sleeping.  It is magic to your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but when I went to reorder recently I found everyone has tripled the prices. I&#x27;ve been using Vivite since the turn over from MD Forte, used MD Forte for years. I am now in search of something new and less expensive.  I&#x27;m not paying over a hundred dollars for this product when I bought it for less then 50 dollars.</li>

            <li> One word for this product...Amazing!</li>
            <li> my very favorite higher priced  skin product. ive used them all. this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product was repackaged, I have bought vivite products before and the cream looked like it had been stirred. Typically vivite lotions are firm and have a barrier between the lid and cream. Product seemed to be ok but as I got to the bottom of the jar it is not the same cream.</li>
