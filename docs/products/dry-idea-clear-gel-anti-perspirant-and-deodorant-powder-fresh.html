            <li>Great deal.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so great to find it on Amazon because she can&#x27;t always find it in the drug store when she needs it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just that good.</li>
            <li>We are very satisfied &amp; will purchase again.</li>
            <li>Was very happy to find the product as I have been using the powder fresh for years.</li>
            <li>Even better I found this scented one, the unscented worked just as great.</li>

            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I really liked this deodorant.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s nice to buy these in bulk.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>What more can you want from deodorant?</li>
            <li>My favorite in a value priced multi pack.</li>
            <li>The fact is, this is one of the two brands and type of deodorant that I like the most and look for on the shelves.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to find this item on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the gel to the dry stuff and this works perfectly!  </li>
            <li>Great price for the 6 pack.great antiperspirant.i have sensitive skin and this does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly too and doesn&#x27;t leave a mark!</li>
            <li>Works great, time after time, and I prefer gel to solid or roll-on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it is still an effective anti-perspirant, but I couldn&#x27;t suffer through a whole stick.  </li>
            <li>An excellent deal on this hard to find at stores</li>
            <li>I love this product so much, I tried it while I was in America in 2011, so because I love it so much</li>
            <li>So smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>It is no longer marketed in WalMart, and ShopCo is now carrying a new scent that I think is more to the feminine market.  </li>
            <li>I have the unscented too, but I found I still have a bit of reek after using that one, but with this one, I just smell powdery fresh.  </li>
            <li>The only way I can describe the fragrance is that is very vegetal, but not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different deodorants.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I kept telling my husband</li>
            <li>Love this product, received a number of them together for the future.</li>
            <li>Who wants to run out!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it had always done for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to certain smells and most women&#x27;s deodorant seems to have that same, distinct floral - I&#x27;m just trying to cover up something foul - scent.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand by a long shot, hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li>and they were pure liquid.  </li>
            <li>Gel is hard to try but smells good.</li>
            <li>Clear Gel Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Powder Fresh, 3-Ounce Tube (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li>Hopefully it  works because I bought a whole pack of this stuff.</li>
            <li>both of which I like as much.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t cause any allergies and works very well--holds up during 12 hours shifts at the hospital.</li>
            <li>I absolutely would not buy this item again.</li>
            <li>and it is not a strongly feninine scent, is effective, and doesn&#x27;t leave residue build-up in my tee shirts.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, product new as described.  </li>
            <li>It is very scarce where I live.  </li>
            <li>Prior to being applied it smells pretty normal.  </li>
            <li>I do love to use this because it really hard to find anywhere at stores.</li>
            <li>Arrid Extra Dry Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Clear Gel, Morning Clean, 2.6 oz (73 g)</li>
            <li>It always works; I have been using it for nearly 20 yrs.</li>
            <li>Same product as in the stores and reasonable pricing.  </li>
            <li>I have found this is the only antiperspirant that really works for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the clinical strength secret before trying this thinking it would help, but this just works much better at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>B00AD5B6KK Arrid Extra Dry Antiperspirant Deodorant, Clear Gel, Cool Shower, 2.6 Oz (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li>I have been using Dry Idea unscented for several years with success.  </li>
            <li>I would not hesitate to buy again, as long a price remains reasonable.</li>
            <li>is my first day of use but let me tell you if you are expecting  a baby powder sent it seems nothing like baby powder or any other type of powder.</li>
            <li>Will use no other brand</li>
            <li>As the other reviewers indicate, these Dry Idea Gels are becoming increasingly harder to find.</li>
            <li>I had been use this for long time and it is work well so far.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different deodorants.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to certain smells and most women&#x27;s deodorant seems to have that same, distinct floral - I&#x27;m just trying to cover up something foul - scent. In comes this powder scent. Absolutely love it. I have the unscented too, but I found I still have a bit of reek after using that one, but with this one, I just smell powdery fresh.  The first time I used this, I kept telling my husband I smelled dryer sheets not even thinking it might be me! Lol. Don&#x27;t know about you, but smelling like a dryer sheet after some mega sweating deserves giving this deodorant 5 stars! I&#x27;ve tried the clinical strength secret before trying this thinking it would help, but this just works much better at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes. I am pleased.</li>
            <li> excellent product, would recommend to anyone that has problems with allergies.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this in my hometown anymore so I purchased it though Amazon instead.  It works great and smells wonderful.  Just like baby powder.</li>
            <li> Gel is hard to try but smells good.</li>
            <li> I really liked this deodorant. after years of use it disappeared from all the store shelves. This was the only place i could find it!</li>
            <li> Very happy you carry this product!  We are very satisfied &amp; will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Whether or not it&#x27;s for women, I will continue to use this product because IT IS THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT WORKS!</li>
            <li> Works great, time after time, and I prefer gel to solid or roll-on.  Fragrance very subtle to unnoticeable.  What more can you want from deodorant?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best smelling deodorant on the market. It always works; I have been using it for nearly 20 yrs.</li>
            <li> My favorite in a value priced multi pack. Love this product, received a number of them together for the future.</li>
            <li> Happy to find it on Amazon in the Subscribe and Save program.  No complaints from anyone so I assume it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> Just what I want and need.</li>
            <li> Same product as in the stores and reasonable pricing.  I would not hesitate to buy again, as long a price remains reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have found this is the only antiperspirant that really works for me. One underarm application last for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> ...but the clicker at the bottom only works half the time I get these things.  I guess the packaging is crappy, but it drives me nuts because it makes the thing worthless if you can&#x27;t get the product out.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, product new as described.  An excellent deal on this hard to find at stores item.[[ASIN:B001J6O5Y6 Dry Idea Clear Gel Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Powder Fresh, 3-Ounce Tube (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li> The verdict is still out on the effectiveness of the product being this is my first day of use but let me tell you if you are expecting  a baby powder sent it seems nothing like baby powder or any other type of powder. My pits smell like plastic mixed with hair spray. Hopefully it  works because I bought a whole pack of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great price for the 6 pack.great antiperspirant.i have sensitive skin and this does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Was very happy to find the product as I have been using the powder fresh for years. Was disappointed to find 2 unscented conveniently hidden between the powder fresh. Will reorder, but will check carefilly thisvtime.</li>
            <li> I prefer the gel to the dry stuff and this works perfectly!  It dries quickly too and doesn&#x27;t leave a mark!</li>
            <li> My very favorite!!! I&#x27;ve used this product for at least ten years if not longer and I love it! Thank God they have never changed it and I hope they never do!!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Very good deodorant. Keeps you smelling good, and gel has a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand by a long shot, hope they never stop making it. I would recommend it to any man.</li>
            <li> Minor purchase but it is always nice when things are handled the way they are promised with no hitches. Great job.</li>
            <li> As the other reviewers indicate, these Dry Idea Gels are becoming increasingly harder to find. The fact is, this is one of the two brands and type of deodorant that I like the most and look for on the shelves. Amazon is therefore providing a great service for some of us. It&#x27;s nice to buy these in bulk. Who wants to run out! Their price is competitive also. The last time I needed deodorant, I bought a 6-Pack of [[ASIN:B001E7BAG6 Arrid Extra Dry Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Clear Gel, Morning Clean, 2.6 oz (73 g) (Pack of 6)]] and a 4-Pack of [[ASIN:B00AD5B6KK Arrid Extra Dry Antiperspirant Deodorant, Clear Gel, Cool Shower, 2.6 Oz (Pack of 4)]] both of which I like as much. A great way of stocking up for months!</li>
            <li> Hands up best deodorant ever. Even better I found this scented one, the unscented worked just as great. No residue or icky feel and a little goes a long way, lasts all day into the next day if needed. Great deal.</li>
            <li> Great product. My wife loves this and won&#x27;t use anything else. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so great to find it on Amazon because she can&#x27;t always find it in the drug store when she needs it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It is very scarce where I live.  Hard to find in the powder scent.  It works.</li>
            <li> Have been using for years...clear/unscented....doesn&#x27;t cause any allergies and works very well--holds up during 12 hours shifts at the hospital.</li>
            <li> I think this is marketed as a women&#x27;s product, but I&#x27;ve used it for some time now and it is not a strongly feninine scent, is effective, and doesn&#x27;t leave residue build-up in my tee shirts.  It is no longer marketed in WalMart, and ShopCo is now carrying a new scent that I think is more to the feminine market.  I was pleased to find this item on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, I tried it while I was in America in 2011, so because I love it so much I have it sent to me in Australia it&#x27;s just that good.</li>
            <li> Will use no other brand</li>
            <li> Love this product.  So smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> I bought six and they were pure liquid.  I absolutely would not buy this item again.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it had always done for me. Just I get 6 at a time for a little less money and I don&#x27;t have to go to the store to get it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dry Idea unscented for several years with success.  I ordered the &amp;#34;powder fresh&amp;#34; scent by mistake, but thought I would give it a try.  This has the strangest scent I have ever encountered.  Prior to being applied it smells pretty normal.  After application, however, the scent seems to change immediately; I take it it&#x27;s a reaction to the air.  The only way I can describe the fragrance is that is very vegetal, but not in a good way.  It&#x27;s offensive, but that could be just my sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is still an effective anti-perspirant, but I couldn&#x27;t suffer through a whole stick.  Unfortunately I order a six-pack, so now have to find a way to get rid of the remaining five sticks.</li>
            <li> I do love to use this because it really hard to find anywhere at stores. But only amazon.com does have it for who have hard time to find what item do they want to use. I had been use this for long time and it is work well so far. I do recommend anyone can find what items on amazon.com what they want to.</li>
