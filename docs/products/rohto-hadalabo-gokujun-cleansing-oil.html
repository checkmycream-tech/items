            <li>Good oil cleanser.</li>
            <li>So lovely!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It cleans my face very well and the best thing about it is that it does not have a scent.</li>

            <li>I love the pump and the size</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It removes most of the waterproof eyeliner and mascara, although I would still prefer and suggest a separate eye makeup remover for that.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>pleased with this find</li>
            <li>I love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered it more than 5 times.</li>
            <li>Love it --</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t love the price.</li>
            <li>I like this brand , but this cleansing oil is just okay.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>and they looked pretty safe for me.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean</li>
            <li>For this very reason, I was able to massage and remove make-up more gently than the DHC&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I got it so fast, I love it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>so sometimes I would just skip it and go right to my foam cleanser.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anyone who is looking for a product that removes make-up including foundation and mascara and feels completely clean after.  </li>
            <li>Similar to DHC but with olive oil, jojoba oil and Hado Labo&#x27;s signature hyarulonic acid (I love their gokujyn</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good, if not better, than DHC&#x27;s cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m almost certain</li>
            <li>I really like Rohto Hadalabo products and the one that got me started on their products</li>
            <li>consistency of this product is much lighter and thinner than DHC</li>
            <li>Very cost efficient, probably a dupe for the dhc.</li>
            <li>but so far this cleanser has kept my skin clean and clear.</li>
            <li>More oily and lightweight than some other cleansing oils like the Boscia one.</li>
            <li>so 1 squirt is actually more than enough to cover my entire face and neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I brought this having high hopes for it</li>
            <li>lotion).I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This cleansing oil does not dry my face too much.</li>
            <li>This cleansing oil manages to remove even my waterproof mascara with minimal rubbing and emulsifies quickly with water for removal.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Oilier types might still need one, but I found that using this with a second cleanser was just too much.</li>
            <li>but it is to complete the make-up removal process and to prep my skin for a toner that give plenty of moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li>I had tried different brands, but this is what I prefer to use so far!</li>
            <li>does the exact same thing as the DHC cleansing oil and maybe even better because it does not feel thick and heavy on your skin and no residue after rinsing</li>
            <li>Gentle on the eyes and takes off practically all my make-up with a pump/pump and a half.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product for a great price. Removed makeup entirely.</li>
            <li> So lovely! More oily and lightweight than some other cleansing oils like the Boscia one. I love the pump and the size and it&#x27;s lasted me quite a while.  Gentle on the eyes and takes off practically all my make-up with a pump/pump and a half. Would definitely get again once I run out!</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive, acne prone skin. This works wonders taking off ALL of my makeup before I wash. Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out but also doesn&#x27;t remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try DHC cleansing oil but read it contained rosemary oil that can be an irritant. I found the ingredients online and they looked pretty safe for me. Similar to DHC but with olive oil, jojoba oil and Hado Labo&#x27;s signature hyarulonic acid (I love their gokujyn lotion).I have very sensitive skin and this does not irritate me at all. Its serious stuff that removes everything including waterproof mascara with by just gently massaging it in, no tugging and no wiping off. The trick to it is to put it on dry, massage in in your skin and eyelashes and then rinse it off. Thats it. It rinses clean so I don&#x27;t need a second cleanser. Oilier types might still need one, but I found that using this with a second cleanser was just too much.</li>
            <li> I really like Rohto Hadalabo products and the one that got me started on their products is their lotion/&#x27;toner which is now a staple in my skincare routine. I brought this having high hopes for it but it&#x27;s rather disappointing. I use one pump for my face and just massage it on. There is not lather or bubbles. Then I follow it with my foam cleanser. Not sure if I will repurchase this as I didn&#x27;t really see any differences so sometimes I would just skip it and go right to my foam cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It leaves my face clean and fresh. I use it in the morning and at night.  Apply and massage while the face is dry then wet the hands and massage the face with your wet hands then rinse with water.  I bought the hada labo  foaming cleanser too but that tends to cause dry patches on my face even though I apply moisturizer afterwards.  This cleansing oil does not dry my face too much. I am going to use this as part of my regimen.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Have been using it for 3 or so months, will repurchase. It&#x27;s just as good, if not better, than DHC&#x27;s cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> This vs DHC cleansing oil.&lt;br /&gt;Have used DHC for a while.. and then it got expensive so tried to find an alternative.  This is it.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this product is much lighter and thinner than DHC so 1 squirt is actually more than enough to cover my entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;It does the exact same thing as the DHC cleansing oil and maybe even better because it does not feel thick and heavy on your skin and no residue after rinsing it.&lt;br /&gt;It removes most of the waterproof eyeliner and mascara, although I would still prefer and suggest a separate eye makeup remover for that.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this find and i think Im sticking with this one.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil manages to remove even my waterproof mascara with minimal rubbing and emulsifies quickly with water for removal. I would recommend using a second cleanser afterwards if you are prone to oily skin. My skin was breaking out from my previous oil cleanser but so far this cleanser has kept my skin clean and clear.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil dried out and stripped my skin. I now use it to wash of mineral sunscreen from my hands.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. It cleans my face very well and the best thing about it is that it does not have a scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted a cleansing oil but did not want to pay for DHC cleansing oil.  I have used DHC cleansing oil before and I knew that was a good product but in my mind it was overpriced.  So I went to look for an alternative that is a similar quality with a cheaper price.  My impression is Rhoto Hadalabo clensing oil is a little lighter oil cleansing than DHC&#x27;s and feels lighter on my skin as well.  For this very reason, I was able to massage and remove make-up more gently than the DHC&#x27;s.  I highly recommend anyone who is looking for a product that removes make-up including foundation and mascara and feels completely clean after.  I do use face wash after I remove makeup with this cleansing oil but it is to complete the make-up removal process and to prep my skin for a toner that give plenty of moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li> I got it so fast, I love it.</li>
            <li> Great for removing sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My holy grail. I love. I&#x27;ve ordered it more than 5 times. Very cost efficient, probably a dupe for the dhc. I honestly, prefer this over the dhc. And it doesn&#x27;t break me out. I will continue to keep using this product. Hope it works out for y&#x27;all!</li>
            <li> Good oil cleanser. Can also use for facial massage oil. Seems expensive for what it is. I have combination skin and this does not cause breakouts. As described, it does not leave an oily residue after cleansing. Love it -- don&#x27;t love the price.</li>
            <li> Great Make up remover! I had tried different brands, but this is what I prefer to use so far! will but again!</li>
            <li> This felt stripping on my skin and broke me out even though it didn&#x27;t feel like there was any residue left.  Ingredients are not in English description says it&#x27;s olive oil based but I&#x27;m almost certain this had mineral oil in it.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> so so... Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations of Japanese product. I like this brand , but this cleansing oil is just okay.</li>
