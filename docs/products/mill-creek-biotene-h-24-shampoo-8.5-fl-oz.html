            <li>and I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Biotin is so important for thinning hair</li>

            <li>Highly recommend !!!</li>

            <li>My scalp was very sensitive and easily irritated.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li>I wanted so very much for this to be the answer to my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo feels very gentle, and it has also helped my hair to become fuller.</li>
            <li>Cheaper on Amazon than where I first purchased it at GNC.</li>
            <li>After using this and the conditioner my hair was so soft and full</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair really clean and soft and it really brings out the fullness.</li>
            <li>brought this along with the conditioner for my client who absolutely loves and reccommneds this shampoo to me all the time</li>
            <li>My hair smells fresh, but soft and silky feeling.</li>
            <li>I really doubt there is anything out there that will help.  </li>
            <li>but it dosent help as much.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair clean, shiny, and with extra body.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will never switch.  </li>
            <li>and it even softened the new growth that I had.</li>
            <li>I think my scalp is getting use to the new product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to get this product in my area, and I was very pleased that Amazon carries it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>May be it&#x27;s a good shampoo, but when I received the product, there was only  a half bottle left.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair and have tried TONS of different shampoos to make my hair full and sheen-</li>
            <li>but I cannot stand the new scent they added to this and the conditioner, smells like baby powder, much preferred the earlier version with no scent added.</li>
            <li>And it happens to be natural too-</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that my scalp is very itchy after two or three days of me washing my hair.</li>

            <li>Did absolutely nothing but dry my hair and scalp out.</li>
            <li>For my hair this shampoo feels pretty normal nothing bad, but nothing outstanding either.</li>
            <li>I tend to do the hot oil treatment using Black Castro Oil, then I wash it out using the Biotene Shampoo, I noticed my hair grew healthier and stronger.</li>

            <li> Got this for thinning hair a few in my family have used it works well didn&#x27;t like the smell reminded me of dish detergent but my understanding is most shampoos with Biotene does have some smell other than that my husband likes it have noticed his hair is thicker and grows fast because he is getting his hair cut more often than before he tried this.</li>
            <li> brought this along with the conditioner for my client who absolutely loves and reccommneds this shampoo to me all the time</li>
            <li> I love this product, the shampoo and rinse.  I&#x27;ve not tried the 3rd one.  A friend recommended it so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I was so pleased; I&#x27;ve not used anything else since.  I did run out one time and had to use another brand.  I could sure tell the difference.  This product (shampoo and rinse) is so condensed and you need only a small amount; consequently, it&#x27;s going to take you a long, long time to get to the bottom. I highly recommend this product and will never switch.  You know something is good if you&#x27;ve stuck with it for over 25-years!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo and conditioner hoping to achieve the total efficient effect of this product.  Unfortunately I had to use a T-gel for dandruff before the shampoo which seems like it dried my hair even more.  Either this product just doesn&#x27;t work for me or the combination is incorrect.  I can&#x27;t wait to find a product that works for my thin, dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair and have tried TONS of different shampoos to make my hair full and sheen- and this is the ONLY one that works for me- my hair has never been so beautiful, full and shiny! You wont be disappointed with this one! And it happens to be natural too- double plus!</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning and I was told from my friend to use this product. So far so good I hope to see the result soon.</li>
            <li> I tend to do the hot oil treatment using Black Castro Oil, then I wash it out using the Biotene Shampoo, I noticed my hair grew healthier and stronger. My hair smells fresh, but soft and silky feeling. I also had trouble with my edges, so I started shampooing my hair and I notices that my edges grew back healthier.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing but dry my hair and scalp out. Maybe you need the conditioner as well which I didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker and better now. This shampoo is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It leaves my hair really clean and soft and it really brings out the fullness. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. My hair appears healthier..and well as full. I was so impressed I ordered some for a friend who complained of thinning hair..and its helped them out as well. This shampoo is our the only shampoo I&#x27;ll use. Cheaper on Amazon than where I first purchased it at GNC.</li>
            <li> This product, along with the conditioner, has made my hair shiny and healthier. It has also made my hair grow faster!</li>
            <li> Works well but I cannot stand the new scent they added to this and the conditioner, smells like baby powder, much preferred the earlier version with no scent added.</li>
            <li> It takes time, but it works.  Biotin is so important for thinning hair and I found this product and have been using it ever since.  Nota miracle cure, but it sure does help with time and consistency.</li>
            <li> May be it&#x27;s a good shampoo, but when I received the product, there was only  a half bottle left. For the price I paid I would expect a full bottle and better packaging.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo because it leaves my very fine hair with a bit more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to get this product in my area, and I was very pleased that Amazon carries it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has an old-fashioned smell, but it works well to give your hair volume and strength. Need to use a conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair clean, shiny, and with extra body.  Good product</li>
            <li> I have had some issues with hair thinning due to some medical issues.  Since beginning the Biotene regimine about six months ago, my hair has thickened up tremendously !!  Highly recommend !!!</li>
            <li> I am completely pleased with my purchase. It was just what I was looking for. Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li> I wanted so very much for this to be the answer to my thinning hair.  It was not.  While it smelled really good, and lathered really good, my flyaway hair remained the same.  I really doubt there is anything out there that will help.  Sorry, but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, it will help with hair thickness, and it does feel much better than my old shampoo.  I am losing hair so I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I have Discoid Lupus which causes red spots on my scalp and hair loss.  This product brings relief to the itch and my hair loss seems to be slowed way down!</li>
            <li> Looking through all different reviews it seems that every shampoo works very differently on different types of hair.  My hair is not too oily fairly short and relatively thick.  For my hair this shampoo feels pretty normal nothing bad, but nothing outstanding either.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of them and this is by far the best. hair thinning this product will do a great job helping. this is all I buy now.</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that hair should be cared for like a fine silk shirt and that is one of the reasons I use this shampoo. It does not strip the moisture from the hair,. Actually, it seems to encourage moisture and silky smoothness. My wife colors her hair and has found that this shampoo allows the tint to last far longer than other shampoos. We are totally sold on this product.</li>
            <li> At first,I really liked this shampoo. It smells great, and make my hair very bouncy and fuller. However, it made it alot drier looking than my other shampoos. I read up on it, and that&#x27;s how it makes your hair look thicker. Whatever is in the shampoo strips your hair, making it drier, hence making it look thicker. So at first, my hair looked thick but it was just looking too dry and was even more brittle looking. So I&#x27;ll be throwing it out.</li>
            <li> I got this product after reading several reviews. My scalp was very sensitive and easily irritated. This shampoo feels very gentle, and it has also helped my hair to become fuller. I simply love this product and recommend it to anyone looking to enhance the health of their scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> Love the the smell of the shampoo and together the shampoo &amp; concitioner work well.  My hair feels and looks thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li> Been using since got sample in mail from mill Creek many years ago. My all time favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product, and I know I&#x27;ll buy it again.  This is the ONLY shampoo and conditioner I have ever used that actually changed the texture and thickness of my baby-fine, stick-straight, barely-there hair.  If you have hair like mine, biotin is truly the way to go!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It is the best that I have ever used. I am African American and I have fine hair. I have never heard of this product until I decided to check out biotin benefits in shampoo. It is the best discovery. I had to use this product more than once before I could give an honest review. After using this and the conditioner my hair was so soft and full and it even softened the new growth that I had. I have never been able to run a comb through my hair never,,,no lie. After using this product I have been able to comb and run my fingers through my hair with no problems. I have great fullness and great body..and I love body. I have experienced less breakage and shedding. My hair is stronger but I still have to moisturize it after blow drying though which is a must anyway for African American hair. The only issue I have is that my scalp is very itchy after two or three days of me washing my hair. Its not a drastic itch its just that Ive found myself scratching my scalp here and there...My scalp never itched before unless it was time for a relaxer no matter what product I use. I oil my scalp but it dosent help as much. I wash my hair once a week but now I think I may have to cowash every three days to help with this issue. I might even add peppermint or tea tree oil to it to see if that helps. I think my scalp is getting use to the new product. But regardless I am still going to use it and not stop unless something drastic occurs, which I doubt will happen. Love it, Love it.</li>
            <li> Can you use Biotene H24 on relaxed hair?</li>
            <li> good product. made my hair stronger</li>
