            <li>I saw this at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, I think, and then again at a pharmacy, and I was in love the 1st time I used it!!!!  </li>
            <li>The smell is not the best</li>
            <li>Very good Shampoo which leaves a pleasant sensation on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li>The site I ordered it from is great my product got to my on time.</li>
            <li>This is easily the best shampoo that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Good value for money.    </li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>I like them all, and they are all effective against my brand of dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>[2] Coal tar concentrations between 0.5% and 5% are safe and effective for psoriasis and that no scientific evidence suggests that the coal tar in the concentrations seen in non-prescription treatments is carcinogenic.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really is an outstanding product, and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Are there any better shampoos out there?  </li>
            <li>It appears more like the 2 in 1 that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they still sell this stuff.</li>
            <li>So happy to find it available on line and at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to get the Therapeutic Coal Tar Formula.</li>
            <li>Its better then t-gel.     </li>
            <li>Therefore, I am thrilled that it is still available to me through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo for my husband, who has suffered from exzema and psoriasis for most of his life.  </li>
            <li>Mostly, I like the way it works.  </li>
            <li>Denorex is simply the best on the market today.  </li>
            <li>I hope to keep being able to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to find it elsewhere, either.</li>
            <li>Probably this is more toxic fallout from the over-zealous anti-cancer regulations in California--those regulations caused Tegrin to be pulled from the market by the manufacturer, also.</li>
            <li>It works better than anything else on the market.  </li>
            <li>This a stronger coal tar formula shampoo than any of the stores in my area carry, and it is also a much better value.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it treats my husband&#x27;s scalp condition better than anything else he has tried.</li>
            <li>very lucky cause</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell to it also, but I like the smell</li>
            <li>Of the coal tar shampoos available, I&#x27;ve used MG-217, Betatar, and Denorex.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my scalp free of itching and flakes and that is what I want in a dandruff shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great Service will be back to shop again.</li>
            <li>My local Walgreen&#x27;s stores have stopped carrying this very effective anti-psoriasis shampoo---nothing else currently available works.</li>
            <li>This original shampoo is rarely available in the stores.  </li>
            <li>When I ran across the original Denorex I bought two bottles immediately.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B001OI8FHM Denorex Dandruff Shampoo for Therapeutic Dandruff Protection, Original Strength - 12 Oz</li>
            <li>Thank you for re-sell the original formula</li>
            <li>Its a great product I have been using Denorex for many years everyday Its all I will ever use.</li>
            <li>My barber recommended Denorex and in about three weeks time, my scalp was healthy and ready for another seventy years.  </li>
            <li>After using all three on a rotational basis for several months, I&#x27;d have to declare Denorex as my favorite, mostly because it also contains menthol.  </li>
            <li>We are so grateful to be able to purchase this product,   have not been able to locate it in the local stores.    </li>
            <li>I am so thrilled Denorex brought back the original coaltar formula.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please be aware that this is the \\&quot;original formula\\&quot;, which is a coal-tar based solution.  </li>
            <li>I was hooked on Denorex when it turned out the only shampoo that effectively stopped the itching and scaling.  </li>
            <li>I have used Denorex for years and highly recommend it to those who need a strong dandruff shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I loved the other product.  </li>
            <li>When combined with denorex i notice improvment right away.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist told me to use this 15 years ago, got rid of my dandruff right away.</li>
            <li>Funny smell but its worth it.</li>
            <li>its use by the feeling of freshness.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair soft and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>It was as good as I remembered and is worth the extra money to me to finally have control of my dandruff again.</li>
            <li>He has tried many different prescriptions and has not found any relief.  </li>
            <li>Avoid getting any of this shampoo in your eyes - it really stings!.</li>
            <li>In reading about the therapeutic shampoo, I thought it was the original one that I used for many years, yet it doesn&#x27;t have that dark tint in it</li>
            <li>This is and always has been a very high quality anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really like coal tar shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I really would like to know.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Or, there may be no way to really take care of his problem.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with the shipping by Pricebully.</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to the National Psoriasis Foundation and the FDA, coal tar is a valuable, safe and inexpensive treatment option for millions of people with psoriasis and other scalp conditions.</li>
            <li>This particular Denorex shampoo contains 2.5% coal tar, which is equivalent to 12.5% coal tar solution (sometimes referred to as coal tar USP).  </li>
            <li>so just make sure you get the Denorex with COAL TAR (usually a blue label) and not salicylic acid (usually a red label) because that one didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this highly as it is one of the onlly things that has helped.</li>
            <li>I found this stuff a few years ago and it was absolutely amazing, because something was finally working.</li>
            <li>Other shampoos seem to come in smaller quantities (or maybe I use more of them to shampoo).  </li>
            <li>I switched to using the new Denorex everyday instead of 2-3 times a week with the original Denorex.  </li>
            <li>I notice a considerable difference between the times that I use Denorex and the times that I do not.  </li>
            <li>This is the only dandruff shampoo that really controls the itching and flakes for me.  </li>
            <li>Being an old man, I had scabs on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>no other option (Head and Shoulders was particularly ineffective, maybe due to its main ingredient).  </li>
            <li>This shampoo, with the original formula with Coal Tar, can be applied as a topical or lotion and injuries caused by the psoriasis disappear within a few days.</li>
            <li>So far, I would not consider this to be the same stuff I used before.  </li>
            <li>However, I continued to use the new Denorex with the new active ingredient because I felt I had</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like coal tar shampoos.  Thankfully, several manufacturers have not been frightened off by a few California shyster lawyers (can you say barratry?). Of the coal tar shampoos available, I&#x27;ve used MG-217, Betatar, and Denorex.  I like them all, and they are all effective against my brand of dermatitis.  After using all three on a rotational basis for several months, I&#x27;d have to declare Denorex as my favorite, mostly because it also contains menthol.  Whether menthol is therapeutic or not, I don&#x27;t know.  All I know is that it is wonderfully comforting and cooling.  This really is an outstanding product, and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why these three shampoos?  Because they have therapeutic levels of coal tar.  This particular Denorex shampoo contains 2.5% coal tar, which is equivalent to 12.5% coal tar solution (sometimes referred to as coal tar USP).  Don&#x27;t be fooled at the local drug store by products with 2.5% coal tar solution.  They only have about 0.5% coal tar. In other words, they are 100% lamesauce.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best shampoo that I have ever used.  I was a swimmer when I was younger, and I have had dandruff problems ever since.  I notice a considerable difference between the times that I use Denorex and the times that I do not.  Are there any better shampoos out there?  I really would like to know.</li>
            <li> I was hooked on Denorex when it turned out the only shampoo that effectively stopped the itching and scaling.  However, I continued to use the new Denorex with the new active ingredient because I felt I had no other option (Head and Shoulders was particularly ineffective, maybe due to its main ingredient).  I switched to using the new Denorex everyday instead of 2-3 times a week with the original Denorex.  When I ran across the original Denorex I bought two bottles immediately.  So far, I would not consider this to be the same stuff I used before.  I do not have the tingle I remember, nor is it taking care of the dandruff as well as it used to.  I am going to give this some more time, but so far, am disappointed.</li>
            <li> We are so grateful to be able to purchase this product,   have not been able to locate it in the local stores.    Delivery was expedient, just sorry it doesn&#x27;t qualify for free shipping.   This product medicinally helps my husband who suffers from psoriasis.   And seems to be one of very few items that dothe trick.   Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo on the market.  I am so thrilled Denorex brought back the original coaltar formula.</li>
            <li> In reading about the therapeutic shampoo, I thought it was the original one that I used for many years, yet it doesn&#x27;t have that dark tint in it like it use to. It appears more like the 2 in 1 that I don&#x27;t like. I still have itching with this one. RATS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they still sell this stuff. It is the only shampoo that can keep my dandruff under control. I hope it doesn&#x27;t give me cancer.</li>
            <li> This original shampoo is rarely available in the stores.  So happy to find it available on line and at such a great price.  This is the only dandruff shampoo that really controls the itching and flakes for me.  Thanks</li>
            <li> For years, I have had bad dandruff. I tried everything and even the T-Gel stuff didn&#x27;t work for me. I found this stuff a few years ago and it was absolutely amazing, because something was finally working. But for whatever reason, when I went back to buy another bottle, I couldn&#x27;t find it in *any* local store. I put off ordering it because it is so much more expensive online, but I finally caved after a year of pesky dandruff and ordered it. It was as good as I remembered and is worth the extra money to me to finally have control of my dandruff again. It&#x27;s the *coal tar* in it that makes it work so well, so just make sure you get the Denorex with COAL TAR (usually a blue label) and not salicylic acid (usually a red label) because that one didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and t-sal alone wont cut it. When combined with denorex i notice improvment right away. Be sure to get the Therapeutic Coal Tar Formula. Its better then t-gel.     I would recommend this highly as it is one of the onlly things that has helped.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001OI8FHM Denorex Dandruff Shampoo for Therapeutic Dandruff Protection, Original Strength - 12 Oz (Pack of 4)]]  This shampoo, with the original formula with Coal Tar, can be applied as a topical or lotion and injuries caused by the psoriasis disappear within a few days. The itching stops almost instantly. Thank you for re-sell the original formula</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Denorex for years and I like using this product without the conditioner added to it.  You can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> This product cannot be found in any of the stores in my area. Therefore, I am thrilled that it is still available to me through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband, who has suffered from exzema and psoriasis for most of his life.  He has tried many different prescriptions and has not found any relief.  So, I thought I&#x27;d buy this shampoo for him to try.  He has been using it 2 or 3 times a week for about a month.  He has noticed some improvement in his lesions, but they are still there.  Perhaps the treatment needs to take place longer.  Or, there may be no way to really take care of his problem.</li>
            <li> I have used Denorex for years and highly recommend it to those who need a strong dandruff shampoo.  It is a coal-tar formula, which some buyers may find objectionable.  It has a strong smell to it also, but I like the smell and so does my wife.  Mostly, I like the way it works.  It keeps my scalp free of itching and flakes and that is what I want in a dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware that this is the \\&quot;original formula\\&quot;, which is a coal-tar based solution.  Denorex also comes in a non-coal tar formulation which I find does not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Denorex was taken off the market for a time due to health concerns about exposure to coal tar.  I found the following on Wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, preparations that include more than 5 percent of crude coal tar are Group 1 carcinogens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the National Psoriasis Foundation and the FDA, coal tar is a valuable, safe and inexpensive treatment option for millions of people with psoriasis and other scalp conditions. [2] Coal tar concentrations between 0.5% and 5% are safe and effective for psoriasis and that no scientific evidence suggests that the coal tar in the concentrations seen in non-prescription treatments is carcinogenic.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply this medication to your hair and scalp about 2-3 times a week.  This medicated shampoo is for use on the scalp and hair only. Do not use if you have open skin (e.g., sores/wounds) on your scalp. Avoid getting any of this shampoo in your eyes - it really stings!. Since the shampoo is brown in color, it has the potential to stain your bath towel if you spill some on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this information from a health center site:&lt;br /&gt;SIDE EFFECTS: Minor skin/scalp irritation or darkened/stained skin may occur. If any of these effects persist or worsen, notify your doctor promptly. Tell your doctor immediately if any of these serious side effects occur: large and/or painful skin sores/pimples on the scalp. An allergic reaction to this product is unlikely, but seek immediate medical attention if it occurs. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include: rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, trouble breathing. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a problem using Denorex Coal-Tar Shampoo.  That is not to say you will not.  It works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Koenigeaction to this product is unlikely, but seek immediate medical attention if it occurs.

            <li> Within a couple weeks of daily use, all psoriasis was gone:  the only clue remaining is that the skin of those areas is a teeny bit darker (pink on white skin) than the rest.  Have been using 2-3 times a week and have never had a resumption of any itching, flaking, or other problems in over a decade EXCEPT when traveling and forgot to bring it along.  Amazing.  And, unlike the extra strength (red cap), the odor is not overpowering.  Just hope the stuff doesn&#x27;t turn out to be carcinogenic someday.</li>
            <li> Coal tar shampoo is getting harder and harder to find with this concentration.  Denorex is simply the best on the market today.  I hope to keep being able to find it on Amazon.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years since I quit paying for a prescription coal tar shampoo.  Works great to control my psoriasis!</li>
            <li> My local Walgreen&#x27;s stores have stopped carrying this very effective anti-psoriasis shampoo---nothing else currently available works. I have not been able to find it elsewhere, either. Probably this is more toxic fallout from the over-zealous anti-cancer regulations in California--those regulations caused Tegrin to be pulled from the market by the manufacturer, also. I appreciate having a source for this product and I appreciate the prompt delivery!</li>
            <li> Works for me.  I used it occasionally when I start to get an itchy scalp.  One wash usually does the trick.</li>
            <li> Being an old man, I had scabs on my scalp.  My barber recommended Denorex and in about three weeks time, my scalp was healthy and ready for another seventy years.  I only wish it grew hair.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is and always has been a very high quality anti-dandruff shampoo. The 2.5% coal tar is the selling point here.     Good value for money.    I was very dissapointed with the shipping by Pricebully. They hadn&#x27;t sealed the lids properly so I ended up with a package with multiple bottles that had spilt. So I lost some money on this purchase. Stupid Pricebully. Consequently, will not be buying this product from the Amazon website.</li>
            <li> Its a great product I have been using Denorex for many years everyday Its all I will ever use. The site I ordered it from is great my product got to my on time. Great Service will be back to shop again.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve used that works well.  Other shampoos seem to come in smaller quantities (or maybe I use more of them to shampoo).  Denorex is the one I like best.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to use this 15 years ago, got rid of my dandruff right away. I have used different products and none work only this. I did not know that the Extra Strength was not using the tar anymore, i kept using it and my dandruff was not going away. I hope this product is always for sale, its the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using Denorex Therapeutic Shampoo for years.  It works better than anything else on the market.  The problems is finding this shampoo.  Anyone have any ideas.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is THE ONLY that ever worked for my dandruff.  None of the Head &amp; Shoulders stuff, much less any other &#x27;dandruff&#x27; shampoos you can buy at Wal-Mart or wherever, ever worked for me.  None of them!  I saw this at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, I think, and then again at a pharmacy, and I was in love the 1st time I used it!!!!  Seriously, if you have bad dandruff, or even get bumps, etc., then you really need to try this shampoo!!  Life saver!</li>
            <li> Does the job for my cousin.</li>
            <li> Very good Shampoo which leaves a pleasant sensation on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend its use by the feeling of freshness.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair soft and easy to comb. I will buy another shampoo Denorex.</li>
            <li> This a stronger coal tar formula shampoo than any of the stores in my area carry, and it is also a much better value. The smell is not the best but I think that is unavoidable with coal tar shampoo. Anyway, it treats my husband&#x27;s scalp condition better than anything else he has tried.</li>
            <li> I started using Denorex and my scalp cleared up i give it 5 stars for that however i went and had my hair highlighted and it had a bad chemical reaction my head started burning so my beautician checked and there was a lot of heat coming from the foils so she rinsed my hair and it was literally smoking my hair is very dry and brittle i got very lucky cause i because i said something about the abnormal heat if i hadnt my hair would have probally fallen out and because of that i give this product a 2 star rating</li>
            <li> I used the one that is two in one.  I loved the other product.  For those with psorisis try this product.  Funny smell but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product over the years for my wife&#x27;s psoriasis condition...shame I can no longer get this as they have banned the use of coal tar...wife feels this is bull as it&#x27;s the only thing that helps her and she has used it for over 30 years...can&#x27;t use this product as the small amount of coal tar MAY cause cancer but cigarettes are known to actually give you cancer but we all can still buy cigarettes !</li>
