            <li>Very good dry skin lotion.</li>
            <li>It smooth&#x27;s the skin and enhances it.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I even started  putting it on my forehead and right on the top of my cheekbones...  </li>
            <li>and it is significantly cheaper and easier to purchase.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product for my dry, chapped winter skin.  </li>
            <li>The other great thing about this product is that it is affordable.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU VERY MUCH!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not scented so far as I can tell, and smells pretty neutral (important for me, as sometimes strong scents can aggravate my migraines).</li>
            <li>Very good for extra dry skin (even cracking!)</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing several more bottles.</li>

            <li>The face moisturizers are the only thing I&#x27;ve been able to use regularly and boy have a reaction.</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t use it daily, because I am worried about developing an allergy to the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever been able to use on my face.</li>
            <li>My older Aunt uses to hydrate twice a day.</li>
            <li>I using for years , is a good product , no easy to find in the local store.</li>
            <li>Like others here, we&#x27;ve found that you can purchase these for $1 at the dollar store, or in a case of 12 on Dollar Tree&#x27;s website (for $12, naturally); the pricing here isn&#x27;t really all that competitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I mean the kind you put in your gas tank.</li>
            <li>hard to get last 1/3 out, good lotion</li>
            <li>Just happened to snag a large tube on major sale while shopping, hadn&#x27;t used it in years - was very happily surprised</li>
            <li>I also was lucky enough to find a small bottle of Dermasil oil free face cream for day and one for night.</li>
            <li>I buy multiple bottles at a time and my whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin on my my face.  </li>
            <li>more expensive with the shipping charges but still worth it.</li>
            <li>I swim, get too much sun, probably don&#x27;t drink enough water and certainly have dry skin anyway, but put this on after showering and</li>
            <li>Really helps dry skin.  </li>
            <li>* (including her face, which I&#x27;ve thus far avoided), and we&#x27;ve gotten in the habit of buying several of these at a time.</li>
            <li>has just a faint scent of the rose water and glycerin that my mom bought and used when I was a kid.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any issues with it, and it certainly does work as well as any other lotion</li>

            <li>I was disappointed as the lotion had a grittier aspect to the lotion that I haven&#x27;t experienced before with this prooduct.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good dry skin lotion. My podiatrist recommended it for my feet. I use it every night to moisten my tired and dry feet. The temporary cooling effect helps me fall asleep. The whole transaction went perfect.</li>
            <li> It is just what the doctor ordered.The only product that my wife will use because it is the only one that works.</li>
            <li> I never used to use any moisturizing lotion of any sort. Then I moved to Utah with my girlfriend, and winters here changed everything - they&#x27;re so insanely dry, and this stuff is a lifesaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredibly effective, and not really cheap feeling at all - the lotion is surprisingly thick. It&#x27;s not scented so far as I can tell, and smells pretty neutral (important for me, as sometimes strong scents can aggravate my migraines). I&#x27;ve never had any issues with it, and it certainly does work as well as any other lotion I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend - much, much more experienced than I with such products - sings it&#x27;s praises. She uses this *everywhere* (including her face, which I&#x27;ve thus far avoided), and we&#x27;ve gotten in the habit of buying several of these at a time. Like others here, we&#x27;ve found that you can purchase these for $1 at the dollar store, or in a case of 12 on Dollar Tree&#x27;s website (for $12, naturally); the pricing here isn&#x27;t really all that competitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that, instead of purchasing these, buy the 10oz tubes. They&#x27;re a slightly better deal (both are sold for $1 at the dollar store), and are also slightly easier to use.</li>
            <li> I using for years , is a good product , no easy to find in the local store.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed as the lotion had a grittier aspect to the lotion that I haven&#x27;t experienced before with this prooduct.</li>
            <li> Bought this stuff at the Dollar Tree, on a whim. So far so good.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion!  It is both non-greasy, and non-sticky.  Love the light rose scented smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> It was for my dad. And he loved the results of it. Thank you</li>
            <li> this is a great product for my dry, chapped winter skin.  great as a face lotion also.  smells great with no horrid perfume smell or sensitivity.  has just a faint scent of the rose water and glycerin that my mom bought and used when I was a kid.  unable to find this product in the stores here, I had to order it.  more expensive with the shipping charges but still worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is so very good.  It is not too heavy like other lotions.  It smooth&#x27;s the skin and enhances it. I recommend it as the number one lotion to use.  Try it and you will understand.  It truly helps to give your skin a refreshing and healing look !</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and suffer from bad eczema in the winter. This lotion moistens the outer layer of my hands and moistens them. Without the use of this product, my hands would have discoloration and hurt from dryness. The other great thing about this product is that it is affordable.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and Dermasil is the only thing that keeps my skin soft all day long. On my calves my skin is so dry it looks almost scaly. I buy multiple bottles at a time and my whole family uses it. It&#x27;s thick but it&#x27;s not greasy and there is no smell. I also was lucky enough to find a small bottle of Dermasil oil free face cream for day and one for night. I have extremely sensitive skin on my my face.  I literally can&#x27;t touch my face during the day or I will break out or I will have an allergic reaction.  I&#x27;ve used many dermatologist recommended face washes  and creams and all of them I&#x27;ve had a reaction to. Almost all sensitive skin products have at least one oil in then which my skin can&#x27;t tolerate. The face moisturizers are the only thing I&#x27;ve been able to use regularly and boy have a reaction. I still don&#x27;t use it daily, because I am worried about developing an allergy to the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever been able to use on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to have to rain on this Dermasil Lovefest, but the last two bottle of this (different dates) that I&#x27;ve purchased have smelled a lot like&lt;br /&gt;petroleum, and I mean the kind you put in your gas tank. In addition, these bottles have had a thinner, soup-like consistency. What&#x27;s up with this? Up until these last two bottles, I would&#x27;ve joined in with a Five Star Rating as well. Now, however, I cannot, and still be honest.</li>
            <li> Great lotion!! My older Aunt uses to hydrate twice a day. She now has me using it and I love it!</li>
            <li> I use this all winter and winter has been long cold and dry. Any &amp;#34;old person&amp;#34; patches of dry spots are taken care of in just a few days. No cracking, no dry skin. I use it year round in Maine.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS GREAT AND FAST SHIPPING. WILL BUY AGAIN! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT IS IN DERMASIL BUT IT KEEPS MY GRANDDAUGHTERS&#x27; FACE VERY MOIST AND WE LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I swim, get too much sun, probably don&#x27;t drink enough water and certainly have dry skin anyway, but put this on after showering and the next morning you are still moisturized..you can feel the difference on your skin!  I even started  putting it on my forehead and right on the top of my cheekbones...  Anywhere lower I may break out so haven&#x27;t tried there but I would if I could!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I use this for my eczema and for my skincare regimen. It&#x27;s actually overpriced here, on Amazon. I literally pay $1 at dollar tree. I buy them,in quantities of 5 because this lotion is that good and I&#x27;m on the go often. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I recall reading about it on an eczema forum and I saw it at the Dollar Store. I moisturize several times throughout the day and this is what I use. Keeps my skin supple when my eczema is under control.  The EFAs included are what eczema sufferers need in their skin. I will be purchasing several more bottles. I like this better than Renew Intensive Skin Therapy from Melaleuca and it is significantly cheaper and easier to purchase.  Trust me, I buy just about anything recommended for eczema and have wasted a lot of money.  Great product. Do not be scared of the low price.</li>
            <li> Some of the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! Just happened to snag a large tube on major sale while shopping, hadn&#x27;t used it in years - was very happily surprised how well it works! Absorbs well &amp; helps retain moisture! Very good for extra dry skin (even cracking!)</li>
            <li> BEST HAND LOTION EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy after its rubbed in well &amp; no greasy hand or arm marks left on the leather in my car. :)</li>
            <li> My husband works with his hands and needed something to make them softer not like brillo pads.  This lotion works miracles. You must try it.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I&#x27;m getting different results from this product. The bottle I had was awesome but these seem to be a different product, unable to use, causes skin breakouts.</li>
            <li> Very good for my skin.</li>
            <li> hard to get last 1/3 out, good lotion</li>
            <li> Not sold in stores any more but its a great product.  Really helps dry skin.  So thankful I found this on Amazon.</li>
