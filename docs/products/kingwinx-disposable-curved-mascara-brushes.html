            <li>they do exactly what they are supposed to would absolutely recommend  them.  </li>
            <li>thanks so much !</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m not as pleased with this purchase after only a few days the rose color is fading off.</li>
            <li>You could very well insert the wand into the mascara tube and pull out a stump because the brush has slipped out and is now stuck inside the container forever.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful when your mascara clumps.  </li>
            <li>Straight</li>
            <li>I received straight.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I ordered the curved mascara wands and received straight ones.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very convinient, I like them.</li>
            <li>They come straight, but you can bend the brush part to the curvature you want.</li>
            <li>I love the slight curve in them, as it helps to lift lashes.</li>
            <li>They are not curved, which was the main reason for purchase.</li>
            <li>So far these brushes are doing the job, I also I like to use the brush just to &#x27;comb&#x27; my eyebrows, it really puts each hair where it should be.</li>
            <li>I have long lashes and do not need mascara for lengthening, but they are naturally a combination of blond and light brown shades.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and thick.  </li>
            <li>Using a mascara free, dedicated brush helps achieve crisp application at the roots...which gives the illusion of thick, full, long lashes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty durable and I&#x27;ve ended up reusing the same ones.</li>
            <li>They came much faster than expected in protective packaging.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for professional and personal use.  </li>
            <li>With a little investment up front, I am going to save at least $300 to $500 a year doing it all on my own.  </li>
            <li>I could have purchased the straight brushes for less and received the same product.</li>
            <li>I totally love the other two versions but this one is not good.</li>

            <li> I kept getting sick from all the germy growth that goes on inside the mascara once the brush has been used.  I thought these disposable wands would be better and so they are!  I insert it only once in the mascara tube, replace the cap, apply the disposable wand to my lashes and toss it.  My mascara is still going strong and I have not had any sinus issues at all.  These wands would be perfect except for the brush.  The brush screws in to the wand via a twisty wire, and very poorly.  You could very well insert the wand into the mascara tube and pull out a stump because the brush has slipped out and is now stuck inside the container forever.  Also when applying mascara, if you like to twist the wand in your lashes to distribute mascara through you might have a hard time with this.  The mascara brush will twirl in the wand under the grip of your lashes and stick in place.  The brush isn&#x27;t attached so well.  I&#x27;m shopping for another type but these will do for now.</li>
            <li> I mean... what is there to say? They&#x27;re mascara wands.. They serve their purpose. I only use them to dip into essential oils and apply to my lashes. I do not use these for applying mascara.</li>
            <li> they do exactly what they are supposed to would absolutely recommend  them.  i also got the straight ones they are good too</li>
            <li> That wear mascara all the time that may clump a tad bit. Or great for those stubborn lashes that just don&#x27;t want to act right. The value for how many you get was fab!!!</li>
            <li> I love it cause you can use a new one each time.  Sometimes I switch between brown or black mascara.  It separates the lashes and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Great makeup tool  Very helpful when your mascara clumps.  Works like a charm and you can reuse them, at least I did!!</li>
            <li> Great disposable masacara brushes, just use one and throw away.</li>
            <li> Not curved . Straight</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get curved I received straight.  I would have given 5 stars if I had received  what I asked for!</li>
            <li> Awesome I love these. They work great and price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> These really are great I use them to separate my lashes and get  little clumps in between coats of mascara when .</li>
            <li> I bought these to put EO on my lashes and brows to help them grow and thicken. These are very nice brushes.</li>
            <li> I have both the silver and yellow gold over silver versions of this ring so I decided to get the rose color. Well I&#x27;m not as pleased with this purchase after only a few days the rose color is fading off. I totally love the other two versions but this one is not good.</li>
            <li> this wands are even better than the ones that come with any mascara. i got a mix of coconut oil and almond oil (50%-50%) to moisturize and grow my eyelashes and eyebrows. this wand is th best way to apply this mixture at nights.</li>
            <li> This pack of mascara brushes are great for traveling on long getaways or for quick weekend trips! They&#x27;re pretty durable and I&#x27;ve ended up reusing the same ones. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great design, good quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered the curved mascara wands and received straight ones. That&#x27;s why I rated four star</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t curved. Would have been perfect if curved.</li>
            <li> These are NOT curved. Why are they advertised as CURVED mascara wands? Really annoyed with this purchase now.</li>
            <li> These brushes are ready handy! I like to use them to tame fly aways. They are great for grooming eyebrows too! The size is perfect and the pack will last a long time!</li>
            <li> These wands are great. I love the slight curve in them, as it helps to lift lashes. I use them to apply mascara as well as to comb through any clumps and to separate lashes. They hold up great and I have never had any problems with them. They came much faster than expected in protective packaging. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very convinient, I like them.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Use these to apply eyelash dye and seperate lashes when using mascara. Also good for eyebrow shaping .</li>
            <li> This product came in handy when I hated the wand from my new mascara.  Very inexpensive and easily ordered.  My shipment came quickly with no issue!</li>
            <li> They are not curved, which was the main reason for purchase.</li>
            <li> I used to pay a salon to wax my face, dye my eye lashes and brows.  With a little investment up front, I am going to save at least $300 to $500 a year doing it all on my own.  Practice makes perfect so be patient.  Don&#x27;t forget you need the liquid oxidant to activate the dye.  I only wish I started doing this two years ago!</li>
            <li> Brushes arrived fairly quickly, HOWEVER, they were not curved as in the picture. I&#x27;m disappointed that I paid a few dollars extra for what were supposed to be angled brushes. I could have purchased the straight brushes for less and received the same product. I am giving this a low score solely because of item misrepresentation.</li>
            <li> These almost seem too nice to just throw away after one use.  The brushes are nice and thick.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> they are not actually curved. They come straight, but you can bend the brush part to the curvature you want.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t what to say. Tried one and get rid of the rest of them. Totally wasting money..so disappoint!! No good</li>
            <li> Perfect for eyelashes and eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, I order &amp;#34;CURVE&amp;#34; and I received straight mascara brush.</li>
            <li> thanks! these little brushes are great for brows, lashes, and blending. even for touching up roots! thanks so much !</li>
            <li> I like the curve of the wands.  I recommend this product for professional and personal use.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a homemade hair growth serum (scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes) I needed something to apply this with. So far these brushes are doing the job, I also I like to use the brush just to &#x27;comb&#x27; my eyebrows, it really puts each hair where it should be.</li>
            <li> I am a Great Lash kind of girl; mascara is my one daily routine where makeup is concerned. These wands are great and are a must have for consistently achieving the perfect eyelashes. I have long lashes and do not need mascara for lengthening, but they are naturally a combination of blond and light brown shades. Therefore, the length can go unnoticed. The wands help smooth out clumps and separate the lashes. Using a mascara free, dedicated brush helps achieve crisp application at the roots...which gives the illusion of thick, full, long lashes. A great beauty bargain for a very low price.</li>
