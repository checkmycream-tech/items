            <li>Also, my skin did not feel as smooth as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>but I have found a product just as good at a big box store.</li>
            <li>I love this sugar scrub, it is great to use on dry skin and smells terrific.</li>

            <li> LOVE this stuff but it&#x27;s way too expensive. You can find it much cheaper at Target or Walmart.</li>
            <li> This is the best body wash. It smells wonderful and does a great job exfoliating.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! It smells fantastic, and you really do get a whole lot of it compared to others you can buy in the store for the same price. It makes my skin so soft after using it. It&#x27;s a great exfoliator, I will most certainly get more when I run out!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend - she likes it - so I guess the product is good but, it is less than half the price Amazon is charging for it at your local Walmart.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel amaaaaaazing!!! It seriously does. I use it before I shave too just to sloth off any dead skin for a better shave. Smells fantastic. Cheaper at Walmart!</li>
            <li> This is a great product</li>
            <li> The amount this person is charging you can buy two jars from.walmart you can save way more and stock up</li>
            <li> I had really dry, itchy, flakey winter skin and needed something to help get rid of the dry patches on my arms. This helped almost instantly. It didn&#x27;t get rid of the patches, but really helped to smooth them out. I used a soothing lotion afterwards (Aveeno was my choice), worked like a dream. I absolutely love how soft my skin feels after using this. Also, it smells amaaaazing :) It&#x27;s a great size too.</li>
            <li> This really has been helpful with my dry skin.  I can then moisturize my skin and I do not look so flaky.</li>
            <li> Using this scrub really makes my sking feel good. After using I apply lotion and my skin is in great shape.</li>
            <li> I love the way Shea Sugar smells but don&#x27;t like way its sting when gets into my eyes. The scrub works fine.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin super soft and clean!</li>
            <li> Love love &amp; smells so good it&#x27;s a great product for the money I use once aweek don&#x27;t need much. My skin is beautiful I&#x27;m 59 complements from my hubby all the time. 😀 Would buy again</li>
            <li> I love body scrub. It smells great and it refreshes the skin. I plan on buying more once I use it all up.</li>
            <li> I have never used a body scrub before, however I sure will in the future.  My legs felt so smooth and my suntan lotion went on so smoothly.  A real winner.</li>
            <li> Feels great and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this sugar scrub, it is great to use on dry skin and smells terrific.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites and I&#x27;ve used many that are more expensive.  Great smell, also.  I&#x27;ve tried the almond honey (or something like that) and like that smell also but the coconut lime is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!!!!  The texture isn&#x27;t overly rough, and the scrub just glides right on. My skin is remarkably soft after using this -- hasn&#x27;t felt like this since I was an infant! And hubby just loves the Coconut Lime scent. I&#x27;m convinced enough now with this brand to try the other scents as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Note: As someone else said in another review, you can find this MUCH cheaper elsewhere. I haven&#x27;t checked Walmart, but I did snag a jar of this from my local Harris Teeter for half the price listed here. Shop around!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Okay but I have found a product just as good at a big box store.</li>
            <li> absolutely love it !!</li>
            <li> I purchased this scrub from a local store based on some great reviews I read. It may be a good scrub but, it didn&#x27;t meet the expectations. I tried the Bodycology scrub 1st and liked it. Then, after reading all the good reviews on Tree Hut, I thought it would be better than the Bodycology. However, that was not the case. The Coconut Lime was the only scent that smelled decent to me. The others were very strong or smelt bad. This scrub did not leave my skin feeling moisturized afterwards. It was dry and ashy. I still had to use oil or lotion after this scrub. Also, my skin did not feel as smooth as I thought it would. With the Bodycology, my skin was left with moisture, no oil or lotion need afterwards, and it was smooth. I will be going back to Bodycology.</li>
            <li> Love the product and will order again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Damn, I thought I ordered scrub. Lol.</li>
