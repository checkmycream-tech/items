            <li> Too bad it is starting to get difficult to find this product...&lt;br /&gt;I fell in love with it 15 years ago, and still have it on my shelve.  Every time I use it, I get a complement on the perfume I am wearing. It is sporty and light.  I wear it during the day or evening at the club.  Great with jeans, leggings, or BEBE style.  Not for classical cocktail parties or black-tie events.</li>
            <li> The service was great and the fragrance very nice</li>
            <li> Just to let everyone know, it is the black bottle BUT, to my surprise it is the SAME one as the silver bottle. I was obsessed with this cologne when i was 13. So when I received it in the mail and smelled it, I was instantly transported back in time! It&#x27;s like a time portal! This IS the original stuff. I made sure it was because I was a little mad when I seen that black bottle(Because back then I could only get the chrome bottle). I will be stocking up on this and Aqua Di Gio. EVERYONE comments how good I smell. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Came home quick would recommend ðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li> This did not seem authentic. Quite literally only 15 minutes after applying it, I could no longer smell it (not even with my nose right against my wrist). I don&#x27;t know if it was &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; or what, but for the price I expected it to last as long as it used to (4-5 hours at least!)</li>
            <li> Excelent service and good product.</li>
            <li> Product without original packaging.</li>
            <li> a lemon tinge...the smell is very freshening...</li>
            <li> Very Light cool summer Scent</li>
            <li> best Cologne I ever used.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the scent of this cologne. I am a female and wore this a few years back until they discontinued this item. So glad it is back. Not too overpowering like some male colognes on the market today. A little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in Spain like 9 years ago.. I remember it used to smell different... itÂ´s me or this product has changed its formula?  Because the one that I bought now smells soo different&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I was forgetting, the seller was good, I got the product on time and in good conditions.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this fragrance 20 years ago. I still love it!</li>
            <li> I love this perfum, but i received the wrong item, turns out I&#x27;m in Dominican Republic and returning the item back it&#x27;s kinda expensive for me.</li>
            <li> Expected the old aluminum bottle. It still reminds me of when  first smelled it almost 10 years ago while on vacation.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t explain the smell very well - too fragrant for my taste</li>
            <li> I remember a long time ago this perfume have stronger odor. A good one.&lt;br /&gt;This version is OK. I really expect more. Still I like it</li>
            <li> Nice cologne. Father in law enjoyed it and said he got compliments!</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICES NICE AND FASTER SHIPPING, WE RECOMENT ALLWAYS, FIVE STARS +++++A+A+A+A+A+A+A</li>
