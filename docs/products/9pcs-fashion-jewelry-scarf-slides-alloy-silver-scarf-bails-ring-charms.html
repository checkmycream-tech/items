            <li>Love the scarf jewelry!  </li>
            <li>Nice variety of slides.</li>
            <li>It is too warm to wear a scarf now.</li>
            <li>Got this for a gift for my daughter, she said she really liked it, although I haven&#x27;t seen her wear it yet.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing a gold tone set and more when I find them.</li>
            <li>BUT love them now.  </li>
            <li>So glad I have them</li>
            <li>I started out loving them, but then as I started to show them to my Hubby the 2 large ones came apart.</li>
            <li>Also the seller is fabulous to work with.</li>
            <li>The 3 larger pieces with bails are made of nice, heavy silver - very nice quality and great detail.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>These are like the gold colored only in silver, and they too, are just as good,</li>
            <li>Fun jewelry.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly pleased and surprised at the quality of these.  </li>
            <li>Simple and nice.  </li>
            <li>Here, everyone wears scarves, but I never could tie them right...</li>
            <li>First of all, retail....</li>
            <li>These slides will be very versatile for my scarves and will go well with scarves that I make for gifts for friends and family!  </li>
            <li>more than I expected your product is awsome</li>
            <li>Better quality than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have such fun with these, and there are plenty of pretty pieces you can hang from them as pendants.  </li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable and I was concerned due to the economical price that the product would be subpar</li>
            <li>I received some small pieces more like hookups for keys.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>You really wouldn&#x27;t want these 6 pieces to be heavy anyway since they will mostly be used as the slides along the sides of the scarf and would therefore make your scarf too heavy on the sides and would cause them to pull off your neck.  </li>
            <li>The other 6 pieces are plastic, but unless you are looking very close, you can&#x27;t tell that they aren&#x27;t silver.  </li>

            <li> Prompt delivery.  Nice variety of slides.</li>
            <li> These are way too small for the scarves I planned to use them for.</li>
            <li> Fun jewelry.  I was not disappointed.  This set has lots of versatility.  I would like to find the same in gold.</li>
            <li> I showed these to my friends...they loved them.  Here, everyone wears scarves, but I never could tie them right...now I don&#x27;t have to worry about tying.  I have shared these with my friends, also!</li>
            <li> I like these scarf slides but have not worn them yet. It is too warm to wear a scarf now.</li>
            <li> Love the scarf jewelry!  I have shopped retail for a while for this type of jewelry.  First of all, retail.... it&#x27;s few &amp; far between to even FIND these types of pieces.  Even at Michael&#x27;s + Hobby Lobby I had no luck.  Went to a local fabric store and found a few separate pieces but they ended up costing about 5 x the price of these so I returned those (never used them) once I discovered this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice quality!  If you&#x27;re looking for silver scarf jewelry you&#x27;ll probably love this set!!</li>

I&#x27;m going to have such fun with these, and there are plenty of pretty pieces you can hang from them as pendants.  I like the elephants, gem stones, and such.  Will be purchasing a gold tone set and more when I find them.</li>

            <li> Better quality than I expected.  Thank you!</li>

            <li> Disappointed when noticed some are plastic..</li>
            <li> These are sturdy and well made. Great way to extend the ways to wear my scarves. Also the seller is fabulous to work with. I initially received the wrong item and the seller replaced with correct item immediately. I will purchase from this seller again in the future.</li>
            <li> I love these!!! I wore a scarf yesterday and put a charm on each end and wore it with a wrap in front. The charms held it in place very nicely. They are lightweight but sturdy. They arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I would buy from seller again</li>
            <li> A lot of beautiful pieces, I just love them.  They was a circle (ring) on two of the pieces and I didn&#x27;t know what they were for so I cut them off.  Did like the look of that circle on them BUT love them now.  So glad I have them</li>
            <li> on time and as expected</li>
