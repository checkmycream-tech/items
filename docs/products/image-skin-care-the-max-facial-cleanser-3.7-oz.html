            <li> I received the wrong item twice.  Not sure why.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a year. It makes your face feel really healthyand  really clean (but not  stripped) including eye makeup. I would  recommend it to anyone with over 50 skin or maybe even under 50 skin.  It was recommended to me by my esthetician. A really good skin cleaner.</li>
            <li> I Love Skin care Product, it clean off makeup off leaving your skin feeling great, help with break outs too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will improve each morning you get up, and you will see the differents.</li>
            <li> Great product!! It&#x27;s the only cleanser that really works!!  My cosmetician friend recommended it to me, and I haven&#x27;t stopped using it since then!!</li>
            <li> I like to change up my cleansers. I alternate this with the Vital C and Ormedic cleansers. Gives me good results!</li>
            <li> IT WAS PERFECT JUST WHAT I WANTED THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and recently started using it with a Clarisonic facial cleanser and I love it!</li>
            <li> Just a pea size amount goes a long way! Cleans well doesn&#x27;t irritate at all! Does not seem to dry my skin either!</li>
            <li> After spending lots of money on this line at my cosmetologist, I found this here. I remember long time ago this line could be sold only by professionals, so I was surprised to find it online... It works well.</li>
            <li> Expensive but valuable product. My face always feels clean and clear.  My pores are noticeably smaller. Not sure what more to say.</li>
            <li> I still like Image Skin Care Vital C Hydrating Facial Cleanser Better. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and cleans my skin really well. It leaves my skin looking really clean, bright and younger!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for one year and love the Ageless product line. This cleanser can be used in the morning and evening for an overall excellent clean facial care.</li>
            <li> This face wash is wonderful except the new bottle (not the one pictured) makes more product come out per &amp;#34;squeeze&amp;#34; than the pump bottle (pictured). I am not sure why the company changed the bottle, but my guess is that the new bottle encourages more of the product to come out causing you to use it up quicker and then buy more. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the best cleanser ever! I highly recommend this product! Leaves skin very smooth and hydrated and also removes stubborn make-up!</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser and the Vital C cleanser.  I just switch between the two whenever I feel like it. I have many of the Image Skincare products because this line is fabulous! I am 49 years old and I have seen some very nice changes to my face, neck and chest area. Today I received the Cell.U.Lift firming body creme and can&#x27;t wait to start using that one so I don&#x27;t use my facial products on my arms and legs and butt. And yes the facial products have made a difference there too! But back to the image Skincare The Max Cleanser...wonderful product! Your face feels super-clean and refreshed after using it. It takes off your makeup very well. What I especially love about this cleanser is that a little goes a very long way! I will certainly continue to buy this, well heck I just received another one today along with the Cell.U.Lift (which is a big tube 5 fl oz.) and I also purchased the Ageless total retinol-A creme from Image. Anyway, buy this cleanser. You won&#x27;t regret it...I promise!</li>
            <li> Great product. Half the price of the retailers in town. I use the whole line of Image products and I find them to be beneficial to my skin.</li>
