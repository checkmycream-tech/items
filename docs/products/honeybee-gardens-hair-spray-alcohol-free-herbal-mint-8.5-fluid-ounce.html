    <ol>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have the best smell ..</li>
            <li>Works best if sprayed 8-12 inches from hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!  </li>
            <li>I love it!!!</li>
            <li>my curls are amazing!!  </li>
            <li>- do&#x27;t expect to have a great deal of movement in your hair after using.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any hairspray in over 10 years because I just haven&#x27;t needed it, but I tried this just to see how it worked, and am using this now, lol.</li>
            <li>This hairspray works well, although I&#x27;ve experienced a bit of flaking</li>
            <li>This one does, works great as a styling gel ,too.</li>
            <li>It works great, is not sticky and holds my hair well without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Works well and great for skin allergy sufferers.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product!!  </li>
            <li>This one has a pleasant unobtrusive scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.... got very good toxicity rating on EWG.org</li>
            <li>takes longer time to set but works well...leaves very strong hold !</li>
            <li>good hold</li>
            <li>This product is good.  </li>
            <li>This hair spray has good hold, but when you spray it, it sprays chunks of stuff onto your hair.</li>
            <li>Wished it would have worked better!</li>
            <li>I use this on my toodler&#x27;s curly hair, so I love that it doesn&#x27;t have alot of chemicals!</li>
            <li>I liked the hairspray</li>
            <li>But product gets good EWG rating in terms of non-toxic and healthy to use, so I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Excellent product if used VERY sparingly.</li>
            <li>absolutely the best chemical free hairspray which I have found!  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product Nice hair spray hold without the damaging effects of the alcohol.</li>
            <li>Has a very very light pleasant minty smell when you first spray it, but it disappears within seconds to a minute.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with my hair my entire life...and now that I&#x27;m using the Deva Curl Low-Poo, Deva Curl One Condition, and THIS AWESOME STUFF</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I like how it sprays out better...)  </li>
            <li>I find I have to hold it farther away and let most of the product &#x27;miss&#x27;.</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about this product, mostly because I had never heard of it, however, I will purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I tend to like hairspray with more holding strength.</li>
            <li>If I can&#x27;t find anything I like better, I&#x27;d still use this.</li>
            <li>I think this is pretty good hairspray</li>
            <li>Nice product with quick shipping</li>
            <li>I love that it is alcohol free</li>
            <li>Has a nice fresh scent, not overpowering that disapears when it dries.</li>
            <li>Dries very quickly if used as directed.</li>
            <li>Gives a light-to-medium hold and has a very light, fresh minty scent.</li>
            <li>I had been using an alcohol free hairspray for years when the company stopped making it.</li>
            <li>A lot of alcohol free hairsprays don&#x27;t work well or are too sticky.</li>
            <li>My issue is with the sprayer and that I have to clean the cap before use...</li>
            <li>Anyway, I really do recommend you try this if you want something healthy to put on your hair day after day.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, holds my hair in place and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds my baby fine hair very well.</li>
            <li>I will probably use up what I have just to get my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>I like a bit more of a natural hold.</li>
            <li>love the smell and it works well for a natural hairspray</li>
            <li>I was looking for a non-aerosol, more natural hairspray</li>
            <li>, so I use this for work when I just need my &#x27;do to stay put, but when I go out and want to look extra nice, I use my alcohol-laden, aerosol spray.</li>
            <li>Honeybee Gardens is worth it.</li>
            <li>You can brush through it pretty easily if you want to, and if you need to use the curling iron over it, it holds very well.</li>
            <li>Well I thought I&#x27;d be smart and change the spray nozzle with my old Pantene nozzle which does work better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more pricey (a couple dollars more) than the store-bought stuff in drug stores, but I can&#x27;t use that stuff, so...</li>
            <li>I rinse the sprayer with hot water to keep it from getting clogged.  </li>
            <li>But be prepared because for some reason this hairspray really shoots out!</li>
            <li>but I want more of a light mist that holds my curls without making them crunchy an stiff.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this if you have mcs or are looking for a natural, toxic free hair spray.</li>
            <li>All in all, I needed a spray that didn&#x27;t dry my hair out too much, and there really aren&#x27;t many alcohol-free options out there</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a hairspray without alcohol that works!</li>
            <li>I really do.</li>
            <li>no smell really)</li>
            <li>If you are just spraying it on straight hair, it creates a bit of a helmet effect</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>It really works,</li>
            <li>Really lik product.</li>
            <li>It is sticky if you use too much and can build up.</li>
            <li>id rather make my own next time with water and sugar and an essential oil for smell (lavender)</li>
            <li>The is an {MCS} Multiple Chemical Sensitivity user friendly Item.</li>
            <li>As long as you are careful not to over-spray, the product will work fairly well.</li>
            <li>I have many health issues and wanted to find a product that would be less toxic for my body.  </li>
            <li>Since I have been using my alcohol free hairspray, I notice my hair doesnt seem as dry.  </li>
            <li>and that was my main reason for purchase.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this hair spray, have been using it for a while now.</li>
            <li>For being an all natural product with no chemicals, this hairspray works really well.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure that it is better than the others.</li>
            <li>I have tried two bottles of it, thinking the first was a fluke, but both bottles had the same problem.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, but don&#x27;t like the way it makes my hair very stiff.  </li>
            <li>I am all for the all natural beauty produts but this stuff will stick to everything and make it feel sticky all day.</li>
            <li>I believe it was 16 to 18&amp;#34;, so, arm&#x27;s length, so, as far as your arm will extend to spray, basically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried to find a natural hairspray that works.</li>
            <li>However, I have to be very careful not to over-spray my hair; it lets out a strong spray which tends to make the hair wet; when this happens, the hair gets stuck together and one has to wait a long time for it to dry; then it brushes out easily, without leaving any traces--such as white specks, etc.--Bottom line:  </li>
            <li>I needed a hair spray that had hold, shine, and did not make my forehead break out in a rash of some sort (I&#x27;ve developed a sensitivity to regular hair spray), and looked for an alcohol-free, natural hair spray.</li>
            <li>In any case, the smell is interesting when applied - a little bit of a &#x27;wheat&#x27; smell for those who have ever smelled dried wheat stocks.</li>
            <li>So the trick is to use short, quick bursts and only use half as much as regular hairspray.</li>
            <li>Does not dry the hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does not dry the hair.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I know that it is nearly impossible to make a natural product have a long-lasting scent without comprising it&#x27;s quality, so I am okay with that.</li>
            <li> If enough of this is used to hold hair in place, hair has a &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; feel, not soft.</li>
            <li> A tiny spray goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find another as can&#x27;t do without hairspray since my hair is very fine and just flops in my face without spray.</li>
            <li> I live in Louisiana, HEAVY humidity and</li>
            <li> I find that the pump gums up and sticks easily making it difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> This bottle should last me a very long time!</li>
            <li> But after 3 months or so of use,my hair is so incredibly dry that it is like hay.</li>
            <li> I knew that this spray would take longer to dry.  </li>
            <li> (I did find that I like to pour some in a smaller travel Tresemme bottle (the black one) and</li>
            <li> I use it instead of mousse on wet hair and for hold on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda like a \\&quot;spray gel\\&quot; when I put it on my wet hair to scrunch it.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a pump spray, so I expected that.  </li>
            <li> only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; feeling, but not as much as other sprays.</li>
            <li> It works well with other products as well.  </li>
            <li> Will probably try other high-rated EWG products before ordering this one again.</li>
            <li> EWG.org/SkinDeep gives it a score of 1 for Low Hazard, or least toxic.</li>
            <li> As the day wears on, the product does weigh down your hair</li>
            <li> in fact I use less of this stuff than I did the salon brand.</li>
            <li> I saw in previous reviews that this product sprays a lot when pumped.</li>
            <li> The pump spray does distribute quite a bit of product - a little heavy for my taste.</li>
            <li> I simply had given up on Hair Spray for years &amp; now I have something I can use without getting Dizzy or Nauseated.</li>
            <li> medium hold..if I spray alot hair becomes stiff..</li>
            <li> Hard to find stuff without chemicals and lasts forever</li>
            <li> Well, 0 would be least toxic, I guess, and that is equivalent to water.  </li>
            <li> Broken ends, crusty hair strands....</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this one didn&#x27;t work well for me and my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Or worse, you go out into the wind and you get a crazy, truly windblown look for the day.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this product! I really do. Once it is is my hair!  I love that it is alcohol free and that was my main reason for purchase.  My issue is with the sprayer and that I have to clean the cap before use... every time... as it gets all sticky and clogged up.</li>
            <li> I am all for the all natural beauty produts but this stuff will stick to everything and make it feel sticky all day. Hair, makeup, and face.</li>
            <li> medium hold..if I spray alot hair becomes stiff..good hold but I want more of a light mist that holds my curls without making them crunchy an stiff. doesn&#x27;t have the best smell ..no smell really) id rather make my own next time with water and sugar and an essential oil for smell (lavender)</li>
            <li> Nice product with quick shipping</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!  I am on my second bottle now.  I was searching for something alcohol-free that I could use on my curly/wavy hair.  I have struggled with my hair my entire life...and now that I&#x27;m using the Deva Curl Low-Poo, Deva Curl One Condition, and THIS AWESOME STUFF my curls are amazing!!  It&#x27;s kinda like a \\&quot;spray gel\\&quot; when I put it on my wet hair to scrunch it.  It&#x27;s not \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; at all.  I love the smell.  I rinse the sprayer with hot water to keep it from getting clogged.  (I did find that I like to pour some in a smaller travel Tresemme bottle (the black one) and I like how it sprays out better...)  Anyway, I really do recommend you try this if you want something healthy to put on your hair day after day.  I will keep buying this!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Too gummy and sticky.  Wished it would have worked better!</li>
            <li> The product works meaning it holds your hair. But after 3 months or so of use,my hair is so incredibly dry that it is like hay. Broken ends, crusty hair strands....</li>
            <li> One of the ingredients is a resin...didn&#x27;t expect that in a spray touted as organic. In any case, the smell is interesting when applied - a little bit of a &#x27;wheat&#x27; smell for those who have ever smelled dried wheat stocks. It goes away in about 30 minutes or so. The pump spray does distribute quite a bit of product - a little heavy for my taste. I find I have to hold it farther away and let most of the product &#x27;miss&#x27;. As the day wears on, the product does weigh down your hair and I lost curl definition. If you are just spraying it on straight hair, it creates a bit of a helmet effect - do&#x27;t expect to have a great deal of movement in your hair after using. I will probably use up what I have just to get my money&#x27;s worth but I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about this product, mostly because I had never heard of it, however, I will purchase it again.  I use it instead of mousse on wet hair and for hold on dry hair.  It works well with other products as well.  It is non-aerosol and not a concern if accidentally inhaled.  Works best if sprayed 8-12 inches from hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.... got very good toxicity rating on EWG.org so I gave it a shot.  I find that the pump gums up and sticks easily making it difficult to use.  Love the smell, but don&#x27;t like the way it makes my hair very stiff.  I like a bit more of a natural hold.</li>
            <li> takes longer time to set but works well...leaves very strong hold !</li>
            <li> This product is good.  Does not dry the hair.  However, I have to be very careful not to over-spray my hair; it lets out a strong spray which tends to make the hair wet; when this happens, the hair gets stuck together and one has to wait a long time for it to dry; then it brushes out easily, without leaving any traces--such as white specks, etc.--Bottom line:  As long as you are careful not to over-spray, the product will work fairly well.</li>
            <li> love the smell and it works well for a natural hairspray</li>
            <li> It has butane as a propellant, so is stickier than I would like.  It doesn&#x27;t always spray out evenly resulting in clumps that feel like &amp;#34;helmut hair.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my brother because he has been using Tresemme toxic spray, and having chemical sensitivities, I cannot tolerate it. I haven&#x27;t used any hairspray in over 10 years because I just haven&#x27;t needed it, but I tried this just to see how it worked, and am using this now, lol. It&#x27;s great! Has a very very light pleasant minty smell when you first spray it, but it disappears within seconds to a minute. It does not linger at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds my baby fine hair very well. Just hold it out away from you like it says to......I believe it was 16 to 18&amp;#34;, so, arm&#x27;s length, so, as far as your arm will extend to spray, basically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; feeling, but not as much as other sprays. It holds all day too. You can brush through it pretty easily if you want to, and if you need to use the curling iron over it, it holds very well. Dries very quickly if used as directed. No issues there for me. I will be purchasing this from now on to keep on hand when I, or anyone staying with me needs hairspray.  I highly recommend trying this if you have mcs or are looking for a natural, toxic free hair spray. EWG.org/SkinDeep gives it a score of 1 for Low Hazard, or least toxic. Well, 0 would be least toxic, I guess, and that is equivalent to water.  :)</li>
            <li> For being an all natural product with no chemicals, this hairspray works really well. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold my style.  I really wanted to like it. I tend to like hairspray with more holding strength.</li>
            <li> The is an {MCS} Multiple Chemical Sensitivity user friendly Item. I simply had given up on Hair Spray for years &amp; now I have something I can use without getting Dizzy or Nauseated. K</li>
            <li> I liked the hairspray but I have an allergy which I thought was alcohol.  But wasn&#x27;t so this hairspray is still bothering me&lt;br /&gt;when I use it.  Sorry but I can&#x27;t use it. Shirley A. Gerrard.</li>
            <li> This hairspray works well, although I&#x27;ve experienced a bit of flaking and I wish the scent lasted longer. That being said, I know that it is nearly impossible to make a natural product have a long-lasting scent without comprising it&#x27;s quality, so I am okay with that. Gives a light-to-medium hold and has a very light, fresh minty scent.</li>
            <li> If enough of this is used to hold hair in place, hair has a &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; feel, not soft. But product gets good EWG rating in terms of non-toxic and healthy to use, so I purchased it. Will probably try other high-rated EWG products before ordering this one again. If I can&#x27;t find anything I like better, I&#x27;d still use this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I found it on the Skin Deep website, it was rated a 0 on their scale for safety, whereas the spray I was using prior was a 10.  I have many health issues and wanted to find a product that would be less toxic for my body.  It really works, in fact I use less of this stuff than I did the salon brand.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold my hair at all &amp; left it feeling gunky &amp; sticky.  I&#x27;m trying to get away from hair sprays with no alcohol but haven&#x27;t found one yet that works.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using my alcohol free hairspray, I notice my hair doesnt seem as dry.  Really lik product.</li>
            <li> I have tried to find a natural hairspray that works. This one does, works great as a styling gel ,too. Will definatley keep reordering as needed!</li>
            <li> I had been using an alcohol free hairspray for years when the company stopped making it. I was desperate to find another as can&#x27;t do without hairspray since my hair is very fine and just flops in my face without spray. A lot of alcohol free hairsprays don&#x27;t work well or are too sticky. I found Honeybee Gardens Hair Spray and decided to give it a try. It works great, is not sticky and holds my hair well without drying it out. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a hairspray without alcohol that works!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a non-aerosol, more natural hairspray but unfortunately this one didn&#x27;t work well for me and my thick hair.</li>
            <li> you have check for bubbles and pat them, otherwise you&#x27;ll look like you have dandruff.  But it&#x27;s a pump spray, so I expected that.  You also can&#x27;t spray a lot, or your hair will be sticky for way longer than you&#x27;re used to it being with a traditional hairspray, and your hair can look like a matted-down helmet.  Or worse, you go out into the wind and you get a crazy, truly windblown look for the day.  But it&#x27;s alcohol-free, so I knew that this spray would take longer to dry.  All in all, I needed a spray that didn&#x27;t dry my hair out too much, and there really aren&#x27;t many alcohol-free options out there, so I use this for work when I just need my &#x27;do to stay put, but when I go out and want to look extra nice, I use my alcohol-laden, aerosol spray.</li>
            <li> I think this is pretty good hairspray but I&#x27;m not sure that it is better than the others. if it is then I would order from this company again</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product Nice hair spray hold without the damaging effects of the alcohol. Highly recommend this hair spray, have been using it for a while now.</li>
            <li> I needed a hair spray that had hold, shine, and did not make my forehead break out in a rash of some sort (I&#x27;ve developed a sensitivity to regular hair spray), and looked for an alcohol-free, natural hair spray. This one has a pleasant unobtrusive scent. I spray it into my hands and run it through my hair. Shine and hold and no break-outs! It&#x27;s just what I needed from a product. It&#x27;s a little more pricey (a couple dollars more) than the store-bought stuff in drug stores, but I can&#x27;t use that stuff, so... Honeybee Gardens is worth it.</li>
            <li> Works well and great for skin allergy sufferers. Hard to find stuff without chemicals and lasts forever</li>
            <li> absolutely the best chemical free hairspray which I have found!  I have bought it again and again, and will continue to do so!</li>
            <li> I love it!!! It is without chemicals and actually works.  I live in Louisiana, HEAVY humidity and this spray holds my hair in place without using a ton of it.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I saw in previous reviews that this product sprays a lot when pumped. Well I thought I&#x27;d be smart and change the spray nozzle with my old Pantene nozzle which does work better. But be prepared because for some reason this hairspray really shoots out! It is sticky if you use too much and can build up. So the trick is to use short, quick bursts and only use half as much as regular hairspray. This bottle should last me a very long time! Has a nice fresh scent, not overpowering that disapears when it dries.</li>
            <li> This hair spray has good hold, but when you spray it, it sprays chunks of stuff onto your hair. I have tried two bottles of it, thinking the first was a fluke, but both bottles had the same problem. I won&#x27;t order a third one!</li>
            <li> Smells good, holds my hair in place and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this on my toodler&#x27;s curly hair, so I love that it doesn&#x27;t have alot of chemicals!</li>
            <li> Excellent product if used VERY sparingly. A tiny spray goes a long way.</li>
