            <li>I purchased this item as a gift for my sister and she is in love</li>
            <li>I will be buying more as gifts.</li>
            <li>The dryer is fabulous!</li>
            <li>This nail care system is better than most &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; nail care sets that we have purchased over the years.  </li>
            <li>Love the built in nail dryer.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, works with an outlet, lots of cool accessories!</li>

            <li>I used to own one of the about ten years ago but lost it in my last move.</li>
            <li>This is powerful and the fact that it charges with a cord instead of being battery operated makes a big difference.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have never had my feet done professionally but knew they needed some help.</li>
            <li>I used it the last few days and my hands, mainly my nails, look so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Pretty pink color.  </li>
            <li>I am very worried about long term use and if it does break I will come back to update me review.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My daughter loves this nail dryer.  It&#x27;s also a manicure set, and it can be used for gel and regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> Great product. Does everything its advertised to do. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought it 3 months ago. Got it for 40$ and its not worth of 40$ . I guess 25$ is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Truly high speed and more on the professional level.</li>
            <li> I used to own one of the about ten years ago but lost it in my last move. Since then, my nails have not been the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for the nail care only, not for the air dryer part. I don’t paint my nails but do like to have healthy looking hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing about this unit, if you get cuticle issues or the tips of your fingernails get caught on things, this will take care of it! I used it the last few days and my hands, mainly my nails, look so smooth and soft. My feet, I would probably made a pedicure person cry had I not used this. I have never had my feet done professionally but knew they needed some help. I worked on them last night and I am now wearing a pair of sandals, comfortably mind you, for the first time in months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is honestly the best if you care about your nails and the skin around it. The only con I can mention, the insert on the device is very cheaply made. I think I am going to break it each time I place an insert in it. I am very worried about long term use and if it does break I will come back to update me review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome! Just what I need! I love that it has 12 attachments as well! The travel pouch makes it easy to take with you!</li>
            <li> Wow! everything you could want for a manicure or pedicure all in a compact holder.</li>
            <li> Great quality item with many useful attachments.  I like the linear attachments - an extra plus since most manicure machines only have a rotary attachment.  Pretty pink color.  Item arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  You will enjoy using this.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of power in the manicure tools even on it&#x27;s lowest setting, which is great!  The built in dryer is amazing.  I purchased this item as a gift for my sister and she is in love and I am only mad that I did not get one for myself as well.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really nice got it for my mom for her birthday :)</li>
            <li> I really like this as it uses a cord. The nail dryer works great. The only drawback is that there are too many attachments for artificial nails. I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I&#x27;d realized that, but the attachments I can use work well. It seems a little flimsy, but it works for my needs.</li>
            <li> One of presents for my daughter for Christmas .I know she will like it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, very sharp in features! Professional look and style,  works very well, beautiful pink color and good quality item.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!! I will be buying more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, works with an outlet, lots of cool accessories! The dryer is fabulous! It&#x27;s my favorite primping toy! Love it!</li>
            <li> works great on my nails</li>
            <li> so cute! ty and works great!</li>
            <li> This nail care system is better than most &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; nail care sets that we have purchased over the years.  I also like the fact that it comes with a travel case that will carry everything except for the nail dryer.</li>
            <li> This is powerful and the fact that it charges with a cord instead of being battery operated makes a big difference. Love the built in nail dryer.</li>
