            <li>I love this brow wiz.</li>
            <li>I tried the &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34; buy NYX and even though I love it, it does not compare to the brow wiz.</li>
            <li>Most.</li>
            <li>this pencil literally make a full transformation on them!</li>
            <li>Its is easy to use and it stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>I love that you can layer the colour for a more dramatic look, and the built- in spoolie wand is perfect for smoothing out and blending in pencil lines.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for those who have very little hair</li>
            <li>The brow wiz is my first love üòç</li>
            <li>Is a good brow liner and color is perfect for by dark brown almost black hair.</li>
            <li>so i would use a black eyebrow pencil because all of the colors i would find would be wayyyy to light for my eyebrows, so I&#x27;m really glad that I was able to find this ebony color.</li>
            <li>Best eyebrow pencil- very thin point enables you to use easily.</li>
            <li>Love natural too</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>and I love that there are so many shades to choose from compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use, a very precise and light tip, not too harsh making the brows look very natural!</li>
            <li>The brow brush was wonderful however the actual eyeliner sucks!</li>
            <li>it is not the real Anastasia Brow Wiz.</li>
            <li>Plus, the color is great if you have dark brown or black brows.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect blendable shade for my skin and hair (other colors are too brown or too dark and black)</li>
            <li>I have eyebrows and they look very natural.</li>
            <li>I have always used a pencil with a brush at the end for my eyebrows, but this ebony color is great and not too dark and thick when I apply it to the part of my eyebrows nearest the nose.</li>
            <li>Looks natural.</li>
            <li>My eyebrow looks natural even when i wear this.</li>
            <li>I have very little, think, light hairs on my eyebrows and</li>
            <li>A lot of dark brown pencils/powders were just too light for me, and blacks were far too dark.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup and my eyebrows are a hot mess, and I was fighting doing anything with makeup</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Using for 2 weeks and it hasn&#x27;t lasted all day as others have told me, but then, I don&#x27;t use the stencil to create the eyebrows, I fill in the brows because age has thinned them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup and my eyebrows are a hot mess, and I was fighting doing anything with makeup but  I have to say that this eyebrow pencil is awesome!  It goes on smoothly and evenly.  The spoolie thingie helps blend it with your eyebrows so it doesn&#x27;t look like someone took a crayon and drew harsh lines above your eyes.  Its is easy to use and it stays on all day.  I find that removing it is easiest when I use lotion or coconut oil.  I would definitley buy this again and I would buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in the shade &amp;#34;ebony.&amp;#34; i was having a lot of trouble with other brow pencils being too oily or too hard. This product is a perfect balance. You have to push down a bit but not too hard. Plus, the color is great if you have dark brown or black brows. It&#x27;s dark but you don&#x27;t look like you have sharpie in your brows. A lot of dark brown pencils/powders were just too light for me, and blacks were far too dark. The shipping was fast, product was amazing, and price was great. Overall i am very happy.</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow pencil- very thin point enables you to use easily.Black matches my eyebrows well.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I will order more. ...</li>
            <li> I love this brow wiz. I tried the &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34; buy NYX and even though I love it, it does not compare to the brow wiz. Eyebrows on Fleek ‚úÖ every time. The brow wiz is my first love üòç</li>
            <li> Love it! Perfect perfect perfect.</li>
            <li> The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because the dang filler falls out of the pencil all of the time. It works great but I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great color not overbearing</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow pencil I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow pencil!!</li>
            <li> I never really have gotten to use it because I was sent the wrong color, and I haven&#x27;t had any clients that are better suited for it. I wanted to return it, but i just put it in my make up kit hoping I&#x27;ll use it on someone.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love! I have always used a pencil with a brush at the end for my eyebrows, but this ebony color is great and not too dark and thick when I apply it to the part of my eyebrows nearest the nose. I have naturally dark brown hair so i would use a black eyebrow pencil because all of the colors i would find would be wayyyy to light for my eyebrows, so I&#x27;m really glad that I was able to find this ebony color. I have always seen girls with perfect eyebrows and now I can say that my eyebrows are on fleek too! ahah :p I am definitely more than happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The brow brush was wonderful however the actual eyeliner sucks! Liner color appeared ashy and didn&#x27;t draw on well.</li>
            <li> This is amazing to fill in brows without overdoing it.  Looks natural.</li>
            <li> I have eyebrows!!!!  I watched a utube video that showed me how to fill in my eyebrows and this pencil is perfect and inexpensive.  It has the brush on the other end to help with the blending.  I have eyebrows and they look very natural.</li>
            <li> I have very little, think, light hairs on my eyebrows and this pencil literally make a full transformation on them! It was very easy to use, a very precise and light tip, not too harsh making the brows look very natural! It blew me away! It is perfect for those who have very little hair</li>
            <li> Broken pieces when I got it. Too little product for price. Is a good brow liner and color is perfect for by dark brown almost black hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing and I love it! I have a greasy face and this stays put all day. Love natural too</li>
            <li> My favorite for my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> The product was deilverd to me dry and broken</li>
            <li> Waste of money doesnt stay its the worst buy ive made makeupwise it was broken when I got it</li>
            <li> I love Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Wiz! It is the perfect blendable shade for my skin and hair (other colors are too brown or too dark and black) and I love that there are so many shades to choose from compared to other brands. I love that you can layer the colour for a more dramatic look, and the built- in spoolie wand is perfect for smoothing out and blending in pencil lines. I haven&#x27;t found another eyebrow pencil/powder that is as good as this one.</li>
            <li> This was a fake it is not the real Anastasia Brow Wiz.</li>
            <li> i personally didn&#x27;t like this it did not last long , I rather use eyeshadow on my brows lasts longer</li>
            <li> The best eyebrow filler I have ever used. My eyebrow looks natural even when i wear this. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> The. Most. Amazing. Eyebrow. Liner. Ever.&lt;br /&gt; it&#x27;s a little pricey but it&#x27;s totally worth it. I bought 6 back-ups. Yes I&#x27;m that obsessed.</li>
            <li> bought for my mom, she LOVES this brow pencil.</li>
            <li> best eyebrow pencil out there! changed my life.</li>
