            <li> Nice gem to carry around in your purse. I love the scents, and how there&#x27;s two rollerballs. I bought this as a Christmas gift to myself and I still have a little less than half even with using it most of the time. I definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I thought they meant two separate roller balls. Title is misleading.</li>
            <li> So glad I could find this!  Amazon is always my go to  place!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it,  both scents are amazing! Can never decide which side to use their that good!</li>

            <li> I received poppy blossom perfume for Christmas and love it and when I saw that it was also available along with Coach Poppy in a rollerball I was &amp;#34;in&amp;#34;.  I still love the blossom best but I like the option of also wearing Poppy and it is very convenient to have both together in a handy little want that is perfect for purse or travel.  Very, very happy to have discovered this perfume and also this clever little rollerball version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, no complaints, cute and convenient packaging and great for travel.  I would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I wanted the Coach Poppy perfume for so long, and my brother got me this dual rollerball for Christmas last year, and I LOVE it. It&#x27;s a really great value for your money, especially if you know you love the Coach scents and you don&#x27;t want to break your budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one and only downside I have with this rollerball is that it will not stand up on its own. My rollerball collection was all standing in a row, and this was the only one that needed to lay on its side on my perfume tray. However, I just got a really beautiful glass contained and started keeping my rollerballs in there instead. .</li>
            <li> It only had 1 scent when I thought they were supposed to have 2. But other than that, it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Great smells from both, very happy I bought!</li>
            <li> i like the freesia blossom best these are only a tad bit stronger in fragrance strength but doable especially for a corporate environment.</li>
            <li> Received in just a few days and it is such a wonderful scent!</li>
            <li> I like the perfumes very much, and they last all day. Only problem is my husband is not a fan. Bummer there.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter. She loves both scents.</li>
            <li> I love that this came with two scents  and the size is exactly what I was hoping for. Easy to throw in your purse or bag.</li>
