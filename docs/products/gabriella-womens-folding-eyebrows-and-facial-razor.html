    <ol>
            <li>Greatest shaver for women!</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>I am using a Tria laser hair remover and these razor&#x27;s are perfect to use all over the face before a treatment.</li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really great.</li>
            <li>Works great and is nice because it closes.</li>
            <li>I returned and purchased KAI brand which is WAY superior.</li>
            <li>The ones I had before were very safe and never scratched or nicked your skin.</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>The three pack makes it nice to have one in my travel bag as well as at home.</li>
            <li>The folding razors are nice to travel with and are nice because the razor part is covered when not in used.</li>
            <li>I use moisturizing gel before shaving to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;Price wise, I used to buy these from stores each for 3 dollar and buying 3 of them here for a good price over here is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re HUGE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Be sure to soap your face before using &amp; use a lotion afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, no problems so far!</li>
            <li>I know, I imagined trying it and becoming one of those bearded ladies, but that was not the case at all.</li>
            <li>SO Easily with no irritation.</li>
            <li>If you decide to be brave and try it, these are definitely sharp enough and the price is great!</li>
            <li>But these are smooth.</li>
            <li>These are great facial razors.</li>
            <li>However, they are GREAT for facial or body razors!</li>
            <li>Not as precise as the Feather Flamingo brand.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this product for some time and was happy to finally find it.</li>
            <li>The Gabriella razors are available in folding and non-folding razors.  </li>
            <li>Blades aren&#x27;t dull and they are the perfect size for storage.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me - constantly battling facial hair in every available method - these items are perfect.</li>
            <li>Apparently shaving your face is a great, natural way to exfoliate and prevent bacteria buildup and breakouts (and the lack of peach fuzz makes face creams and makeup go on smoother and easier).  </li>
            <li>Anyway, these little razors are great for both of those uses.</li>
            <li>These are amazing for removing facial hair</li>
            <li>They do a really nice job on your brows because you can hold the razor in different directions and</li>
            <li>The price is nice compared to what they charge at the beauty stores I find locally.</li>
            <li>Handy for facial hair</li>
            <li>By far my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>Gabriella facial razors are great for removing unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li>but if you are careful not to cut yourself after second use it is normal and perfectly working.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as described/displayed.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>They remove the hair easily without pulling and are not rough on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Do you want to go down this road?&amp;#34; These little razors are perfect.</li>
            <li>These little razors are amazing for facial hair clean up!</li>
            <li>These are handy little razors that do what they need to do.  </li>
            <li>They have good quality and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Seems a bit rough at first</li>
            <li>More trouble than it&#x27;s worth to return.</li>
            <li>No, seriously.</li>
            <li>(every woman with facial hair has experienced this at least once).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them to get rid of the blond peach fuzz on the face.</li>
            <li>No longer do I have to stare at the normal razor in the shower wondering, &amp;#34;Should</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was worried but no problems!</li>
            <li>These are easy to use and you can keep one in your car since that is where you see all the little hairs.</li>
            <li>I used to use these little razors for cleaning up my eyebrows, but a friend of mine informed me that she had had AMAZING results from using them to actually shave her entire face.</li>
            <li>I  purchased a different brand from Sally&#x27;s, but they were rough on my skin, pulled the facial hair and did not remove it cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other woman&#x27;s razors that were a very rough/ridged shave.</li>
            <li>Not sharp enough, I think.</li>
            <li>Although these are small and easy to use, I found the blades to be a bit too rough for my skin.  </li>
            <li>They work, but be careful if you use them for your eyebrows; I accidentally cut some of my eyelash off because the blade portion is quite long / large.</li>
            <li>I had red marks that took a long some time to clear up.</li>

            <li> Greatest shaver for women!</li>
            <li> this works so well! i love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Not too sharp or rough for my face and it gets the job done. I&#x27;ve used other woman&#x27;s razors that were a very rough/ridged shave. But these are smooth. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>

            <li> No, seriously. If you&#x27;re like me - constantly battling facial hair in every available method - these items are perfect. No more do I have to go to the salon to get my hair and skin ripped off only to have the hair back a week later (every woman with facial hair has experienced this at least once). No longer do I have to stare at the normal razor in the shower wondering, &amp;#34;Should I? Do you want to go down this road?&amp;#34; These little razors are perfect. They work on facial hair all over your face, including your eyebrows. They do a really nice job on your brows because you can hold the razor in different directions and it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re contemplating buying these, do it. You won&#x27;t regret it. They&#x27;re really great.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!

            <li> Takes a bit for delivery but works well.</li>
            <li> They work, but be careful if you use them for your eyebrows; I accidentally cut some of my eyelash off because the blade portion is quite long / large. Handy for facial hair (ugh) though.</li>
            <li> These little razors are amazing for facial hair clean up!</li>
            <li> These are great facial razors. By far my favorite brand. They are just sharp enough without being abrasive. Great buy!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all.  It was like just running plastic along your eyebrows.  Highly do NOT recommend.  Bad product.</li>
            <li> These are handy little razors that do what they need to do.  I highly recommend them to get rid of the blond peach fuzz on the face.</li>
            <li> These are not for eyebrows, too big. However, they are GREAT for facial or body razors! They&#x27;re HUGE! Great quality, no problems so far!</li>
            <li> Although these are small and easy to use, I found the blades to be a bit too rough for my skin.  Be sure to soap your face before using &amp; use a lotion afterwards.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> Not as precise as the Feather Flamingo brand.</li>
            <li> These are amazing for removing facial hair</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product for some time and was happy to finally find it. The ones I had before were very safe and never scratched or nicked your skin. These however scratched every time I used them. I had red marks that took a long some time to clear up. I wish they had left well enough alone :-(</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a long time. They have good quality and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Seems a bit rough at first but if you are careful not to cut yourself after second use it is normal and perfectly working. I use it for face hair and my lands. I use moisturizing gel before shaving to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;Price wise, I used to buy these from stores each for 3 dollar and buying 3 of them here for a good price over here is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Facial fuzz is not pleasant. These get rid of it SO Easily with no irritation. I have sensitive skin and was worried but no problems!</li>

            <li> Disposable -- inexpensive - small.  Works for me.</li>
            <li> Gabriella facial razors are great for removing unwanted facial hair.  They remove the hair easily without pulling and are not rough on the skin.  I  purchased a different brand from Sally&#x27;s, but they were rough on my skin, pulled the facial hair and did not remove it cleanly.  They did not work as well as the Gabriella razors.  The Gabriella razors are available in folding and non-folding razors.  I have used both.  The folding razors are nice to travel with and are nice because the razor part is covered when not in used.</li>
            <li> I ordered these but received the ones that do not fold instead. More trouble than it&#x27;s worth to return.</li>
            <li> I guess they work IF you work at it and work at it and work at it.....Not sharp enough, I think.</li>
