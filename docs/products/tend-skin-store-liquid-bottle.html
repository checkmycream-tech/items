            <li>The smell is very strong and makes my eyes water, smells like pure alcohol.</li>
            <li>Good for Brazilian waxers, just make sure to be totally dry after shower...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff so much!  </li>
            <li>And as a matter of fact, I&#x27;m about to place another order just to make sure I keep my own personal stock.</li>
            <li>I found I can make my own similar stuff that works better.</li>
            <li>I am surprised more people don&#x27;t use this!</li>

            <li>and this is good for back of the neck flare ups.  </li>

            <li>and we found it quickly</li>
            <li>It takes away the razor burn after shaving pretty well!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best stuff to get rid of little bumps.</li>
            <li>As another poster said it&#x27;s worth it to me to have the smoother skin.  </li>
            <li>Probably the only thing that I really liked about it was the gold cap</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I helps so much so worth the money</li>
            <li>but the results are totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and exactly as described</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>deeper bumps/ ingrown hairs will have a higher degree of stinging).</li>
            <li>Tend skin does exactly what you want - soothes razor burn and smooths any bumps or ingrowing hairs.</li>
            <li>I bought the big economy size as it made more sense .</li>
            <li>Make sure to use cotton ball or something similar along with this product.  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>At first I was worried because it smells like straight rubbing alcohol!</li>
            <li>However, in my personal experience, this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used to calm razor bumps down for me.</li>
            <li>Yes, it pretty much works</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be super sensitive against razors and hair removal items -and</li>
            <li>but I ordered this for my son who tends to get ingrown hairs from a very thick beard and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It is a little expense, but is the only thing that works for me and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li>but sometimes it really burns for a minute).  </li>
            <li>And I have tried dozens of products all in chasing and trying to achieve a much smoother appearance around my neckline.</li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>absolutely works to keep away razor burn or bumps</li>
            <li>Really does the job.</li>
            <li>It used to be a real problem for me.</li>
            <li>Other brands have done better job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will dry up and exfoliate the top few layers of your skin where you apply it leaving it super soft and bump free.</li>
            <li>The burn does quickly diminish, and it has helped prevent razor burn breakout (use it daily and don&#x27;t skip application after hair removal).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li>After working for literally all of my adult life to fight these things I have used this product to kill of another large chunk of these bumps.  </li>
            <li>Overall definitely worth trying if you have a problem with ingrowns.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any red bumps in quite some time and rarely get ingrown hairs anymore.  </li>
            <li>When applying right after shaving, etc., it will burn similar to rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Still a few marks, but overall it does a nice job.</li>
            <li>African Amaerican Skin here, which can be HIGHLY irritated by blade shaving and is very prone to the development of razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>This product is very high quality and would like to see it sold at the local stores.</li>
            <li>Clear Skin</li>
            <li>Only thing that really works.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works and I jumped on Amazon to buy a big bottle!  </li>
            <li>He goes into complete panic if he gets close to running out.  </li>
            <li>I do not know if anything can claim it completely gets rid of razor bumps (maybe laser or electrolysis).</li>
            <li>Burns a little right out of the shower but works miracles!</li>
            <li>It is great for reducing/eliminating those red bumps after cutting my hair, or what hair I have left.</li>
            <li>Recently I began shaving again and developed the dreaded and unsightly razor bumps.</li>
            <li>There is a little burn after application, but if you follow the instructions properly (apply on dry clean skin, NOT WET)</li>
            <li>It does tend to sting for a little bit when you first apply it-</li>
            <li>The best deals are online, whereas in store it is very expensive for only a small bottle.</li>
            <li>the stinging that people complain about is mild for me, and to me depends on the level of your problem (i.e. a few bumps/ ingrown hair is not much stinging.</li>

            <li> and we found it quickly</li>
            <li> It takes away the razor burn after shaving pretty well!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best stuff to get rid of little bumps.</li>
            <li> As another poster said it&#x27;s worth it to me to have the smoother skin.  </li>
            <li> Probably the only thing that I really liked about it was the gold cap</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I helps so much so worth the money</li>
            <li> but the results are totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and exactly as described</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> deeper bumps/ ingrown hairs will have a higher degree of stinging).</li>
            <li> Tend skin does exactly what you want - soothes razor burn and smooths any bumps or ingrowing hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought the big economy size as it made more sense .</li>
            <li> Make sure to use cotton ball or something similar along with this product.  </li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> At first I was worried because it smells like straight rubbing alcohol!</li>
            <li> However, in my personal experience, this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used to calm razor bumps down for me.</li>
            <li> Yes, it pretty much works</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be super sensitive against razors and hair removal items -and</li>
            <li> but I ordered this for my son who tends to get ingrown hairs from a very thick beard and it works great.  </li>
            <li> It is a little expense, but is the only thing that works for me and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li> but sometimes it really burns for a minute).  </li>
            <li> And I have tried dozens of products all in chasing and trying to achieve a much smoother appearance around my neckline.</li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> absolutely works to keep away razor burn or bumps</li>
            <li> Really does the job.</li>
            <li> It used to be a real problem for me.</li>
            <li> Other brands have done better job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will dry up and exfoliate the top few layers of your skin where you apply it leaving it super soft and bump free.</li>
            <li> The burn does quickly diminish, and it has helped prevent razor burn breakout (use it daily and don&#x27;t skip application after hair removal).  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> After working for literally all of my adult life to fight these things I have used this product to kill of another large chunk of these bumps.  </li>
            <li> Overall definitely worth trying if you have a problem with ingrowns.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any red bumps in quite some time and rarely get ingrown hairs anymore.  </li>
            <li> When applying right after shaving, etc., it will burn similar to rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Still a few marks, but overall it does a nice job.</li>
            <li> African Amaerican Skin here, which can be HIGHLY irritated by blade shaving and is very prone to the development of razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> This product is very high quality and would like to see it sold at the local stores.</li>
            <li> Clear Skin</li>
            <li> Only thing that really works.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works and I jumped on Amazon to buy a big bottle!  </li>
            <li> He goes into complete panic if he gets close to running out.  </li>
            <li> I do not know if anything can claim it completely gets rid of razor bumps (maybe laser or electrolysis).</li>
            <li> Burns a little right out of the shower but works miracles!</li>
            <li> It is great for reducing/eliminating those red bumps after cutting my hair, or what hair I have left.</li>
            <li> Recently I began shaving again and developed the dreaded and unsightly razor bumps.</li>
            <li> There is a little burn after application, but if you follow the instructions properly (apply on dry clean skin, NOT WET)</li>
            <li> It does tend to sting for a little bit when you first apply it-</li>
            <li> The best deals are online, whereas in store it is very expensive for only a small bottle.</li>
            <li> the stinging that people complain about is mild for me, and to me depends on the level of your problem (i.e. a few bumps/ ingrown hair is not much stinging.</li>
            <li> I bought the large bottle to refill my small rollerball bottle which makes it a snap to apply in areas such as your bikini or underarm.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only had one minor issue since.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for several months and as long as I continue routine usage, i don&#x27;t suffer from ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this if you get razor bumps or small pimples</li>
            <li> but I use to disinfect scraps, cuts, or anything that looks like it might be prone to minor infection - if I don&#x27;t have something else.  </li>
            <li> It will dry your poor fingers right up.</li>
            <li> If you put it on about 3 min after shaving (once skin is dry)</li>
            <li> /&gt;only apply to a totally dry skin area.</li>
            <li> It does contain alcohol so it tends to dry out your skin, so moisturize after use.</li>
            <li> I get little bumps on the back of my arms.  </li>
            <li> I use it for 3 days prior to waxing and a few days afterward.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, and it&#x27;s addictive.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected.  </li>
            <li> Pretty expensive</li>
            <li> No more skin irritation when shaving daily.</li>
            <li> Forget all other ingrown/razor burn/bump products.  </li>
            <li> it reduces the bumps, etc significantly (come on, it has too if it&#x27;s that expensive!).</li>
            <li> this item truly does make the razor burn go away on your neck after you shave and other areas.</li>
            <li> A small bottle can last months.</li>
            <li> Extremely helpful on my ingrowns</li>
            <li> Without fail, my razor bumps were completely gone within about 2 weeks of using tend skin (an I only use it after shaving).</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have heard some people complain of burning or stinging, but those type results typically occur if the product is used incorrectly.</li>
            <li> I like the solution, I have less ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend Bump Patrol and Skin Tight</li>
            <li> when I applied it  it did sting a little but nothing that you cant handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey too.</li>
            <li> but that got all CRUSTY after a few uses because the alcohol literally ate off some of the gold paint.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with ingrown hairs on my neck.  </li>
            <li> I started using Tend Skin a few months ago</li>
            <li> I used to use this product a few years ago</li>
            <li> or you will waste it.</li>
            <li> My husband uses everyday.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money?</li>
            <li> /&gt;a few tips:</li>
            <li> I tried plain alcohol and witch hazel</li>
            <li> The smell was not strong like everyone says.</li>
            <li> It is hard to remember to use this product everyday, but the few days I have used it on my arms</li>
            <li> a single thin layer of the product to the area.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using this product ingrown hairs are a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> The small bottles cost $15.</li>
            <li> No more razor rash or bumps.</li>
            <li> It usually takes 3 to 4 days for the bumps to go away.</li>
            <li> There is no better product out there to prevent bumps from shaving/waxing.  </li>
            <li> Test it out on a small patch of skin and see how your body reacts to it</li>
            <li> I found this product for my husband in the late 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> A hidden secret unfortunately.</li>
            <li> bottle because it&#x27;s a rip-off.  </li>
            <li> *** out of your skin and if anything makes it worse.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Well I was wrong!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s how bad you want it;</li>
            <li> My husband used to get really bad ingrown hairs and someone let him use some of this.</li>
            <li> Shocked how well this works for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but it burns something HORRIBLE.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I get razor bumps a lot so I tried this cuz it had good reviews. I didn&#x27;t use it every day but I would notice my skin would improve when I used it.</li>
            <li> African Amaerican Skin here, which can be HIGHLY irritated by blade shaving and is very prone to the development of razor bumps.  After working for literally all of my adult life to fight these things I have used this product to kill of another large chunk of these bumps.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products with wild and varying claims but this one worked within a day or two which I was pretty impressed with.  If you put it on about 3 min after shaving (once skin is dry) I find it to be very effective but it will STING.  As another poster said it&#x27;s worth it to me to have the smoother skin.  I put it on before bed and after shaving.  The before bed application (use a cotton ball) does not sting at all so it&#x27;s the just shaved skin that gets stung.  Pretty expensive but I can&#x27;t argue with the results.  I also have the shaved head look and this is good for back of the neck flare ups.  I don&#x27;t rate too many products but had to chime in on this one.  Hopefully it can help someone else.</li>
            <li> Has not been effective in preventing or curing in grown hairs.  Other brands have done better job.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> This is some of the best skin care I ever used works immediately once applied. Very happy with the results after shaving.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  No more skin irritation when shaving daily.</li>
            <li> Clear Skin ok but this is the best to keep those itchy unsightly bumps at bay.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a year now.  Yes, it pretty much works but it burns something HORRIBLE.  I literally need to prepare for it.  Also, I don&#x27;t understand how I am supposed to use it on my neck!  I guess they want me to use a cotton ball or pour it onto my hand and slap it on there like after shave???  Probably the only thing that I really liked about it was the gold cap but that got all CRUSTY after a few uses because the alcohol literally ate off some of the gold paint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months.  I tried plain alcohol and witch hazel but I do think this product is better.  It sometimes stings but not enough that it matters.  It definitely reduces the redness and seems to exfoliate my skin which I imagine is what prevents the ingrowns.  Overall definitely worth trying if you have a problem with ingrowns.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference. It is hard to remember to use this product everyday, but the few days I have used it on my arms I haven&#x27;t seen much difference. The smell is very strong and makes my eyes water, smells like pure alcohol.</li>
            <li> Great product to prevent razor burn. Nothing compares. Originally recommended to me by a friend who is an Academy Award winning make up artist.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this product ingrown hairs are a thing of the past.  I use it every day after I shower and before lotion.    Forget all other ingrown/razor burn/bump products.  This is the only one that works!</li>
            <li> this is a good product. it reduces the bumps, etc significantly (come on, it has too if it&#x27;s that expensive!). the stinging that people complain about is mild for me, and to me depends on the level of your problem (i.e. a few bumps/ ingrown hair is not much stinging. a lot of deeper bumps/ ingrown hairs will have a higher degree of stinging). i personally think you just have to bear it if you want to get rid of those bumps. it&#x27;s how bad you want it; no pain, no gain. i&#x27;m beginnging to think i need to stock up on this stuff. will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Tend skin does exactly what you want - soothes razor burn and smooths any bumps or ingrowing hairs. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever. Even my plastic surgeon recommends it for acne.  It is by far the best product I have ever found for preventing ingrown hairs after shaving. Everyone should have some in their medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Works great! Just started shaving my head a couple weeks ago and used this from the start.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it has virtually removed any razor bumps and blemishes after I shave.  My skin looks cleaner and fresher!</li>
            <li> Good for Brazilian waxers, just make sure to be totally dry after shower...ouch!!</li>
            <li> Ladies and gentlemen,  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years since I started waxing, and after I recommended it to a male model who shaves his chest, he thanked me when his redness and bumps ceased to exist.  I use it for 3 days prior to waxing and a few days afterward.  You&#x27;ll have no bumps and will get every last hair.  As for shaving, it&#x27;s amazing (but sometimes it really burns for a minute).  It is unscented and leaves your skin feeling softer.  The downsides of this product:  1) It&#x27;s not cheap, and it&#x27;s addictive.  Don&#x27;t buy the 4 oz. bottle because it&#x27;s a rip-off.  2) Last winter I used it for a week and my entire hand (which I used to apply it) peeled... so be warned. It hasn&#x27;t happened since.</li>
            <li> Only thing that really works.  I now have to add more words so here they are.  Go Seahawks! Tend Skin is great!</li>
            <li> this item truly does make the razor burn go away on your neck after you shave and other areas.</li>
            <li> It takes away the razor burn after shaving pretty well! Still a few marks, but overall it does a nice job.</li>
            <li> Does the job as advertised.</li>
            <li> I use this a lot .Especially because I wax my hairs away. I find this to ease the irritation and sooth the treated areas. I bought the big economy size as it made more sense . The small bottles cost $15.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost 6 months now and it works amazingly well.  I haven&#x27;t had any red bumps in quite some time and rarely get ingrown hairs anymore.  I bought the large bottle to refill my small rollerball bottle which makes it a snap to apply in areas such as your bikini or underarm.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with ingrown hairs on my neck.  I&#x27;ve tried several products that claim to solve the problem, but I kept getting them.  I started using Tend Skin a few months ago and I&#x27;ve only had one minor issue since.  I will keep using this product.  It works great.</li>
            <li> does not work at all. do not recommend it. All it does is burn the s*** out of your skin and if anything makes it worse.</li>
            <li> love this product. i order it every time i begin to run low. i highly recommend this if you get razor bumps or small pimples</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY thing I use after shaving. It resolves skin irritation as well as helps to eliminat hair bumps.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I use on adult acne as well as mosquito bites (the best)</li>
            <li> So I used this in conjunction with Body Boudoir Coochy Rash-free Body Shave Crème and I&#x27;ve got awesome results.  I have zero razor rash/burn/irritation.  This product is great for protecting my skin from ingrown hairs regularly!  Thank you!  I&#x27;m quite sure i&#x27;m a life time subscriber!</li>
            <li> I used to use this product a few years ago and then I dropped off when I started waxing only. Recently I began shaving again and developed the dreaded and unsightly razor bumps. Without fail, my razor bumps were completely gone within about 2 weeks of using tend skin (an I only use it after shaving). Great product, tried and tested.</li>
            <li> Great!! Been using it for over ten years!!</li>
            <li> Great. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I use this twice every day and razor bumps do not exist! A small bottle can last months. You don&#x27;t need much for it to do its magic!</li>
            <li> works good ,using the product for 2weeks still have bumps, but mutch better. works better than anything at the drug store.</li>
            <li> works good no issues works as advertised been using this product for a while does help with in grown hair,</li>
            <li> Its the only product I use now for after shave skin care. Works great irritation and redness is cleared with one application.</li>
            <li> I use this product every time I shave, works great!  No more razor rash or bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this will sound like I am feeding or perhaps increasing the hype around this particular product. However, in my personal experience, this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve used to calm razor bumps down for me. And I have tried dozens of products all in chasing and trying to achieve a much smoother appearance around my neckline. I am a 40+ African-American male who shaves with a razor. But, using this product, made all the difference. It&#x27;s strong, but it works! I use it every day. And as a matter of fact, I&#x27;m about to place another order just to make sure I keep my own personal stock. This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> as soon as it arrived I tried it out. when I applied it  it did sting a little but nothing that you cant handle. The smell was not strong like everyone says. since I just started I haven&#x27;t seen any difference. I will update later.</li>
            <li> I have been using this tend skin for a while and it really works.  I am happy with this product</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product!  It is worth every penny.  He gets ingrown hairs put if he uses this on a regular basis it cuts them back dramatically.</li>
            <li> This product is one of my favorites. I always keep a bottle of Tend Skin in stock in my shelf. I am a male and shave my chest once and a while in order to look good when I know I am going to be showing my body like at the pool. Tend Skin makes sure that my clean shave stays that way by prevent ingrown hairs which I am prone to. It is a little expense, but is the only thing that works for me and it does a great job. There is a little burn after application, but if you follow the instructions properly (apply on dry clean skin, NOT WET) your skin will get used to it after multiple applications. This product is very high quality and would like to see it sold at the local stores.</li>
            <li> Helped with razor bumps and ingrown hairs!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best stuff to get rid of little bumps. razor burn, zits, ingrown hairs etc...&lt;br /&gt;It will dry up and exfoliate the top few layers of your skin where you apply it leaving it super soft and bump free. I use it every day. With that said, I also wear rubber gloves when applying it. It will dry your poor fingers right up. Also I only use a cotton ball or the tend skin deodorant roller thing or you will waste it.</li>
            <li> absolutely works to keep away razor burn or bumps</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while for razor burn. I thought that maybe it was in my head how well it was working, so when I ran out, I didn&#x27;t purchase more immediately and used rubbing alcohol instead. Boy, was I wrong. This stuff really works and I jumped on Amazon to buy a big bottle!  I wont go without it now!</li>
            <li> This product works great! I use anywhere I shave, wax, pluck or thread! Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is a life saver. Really does the job. I highly recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> great stuff&lt;br /&gt;we use it all the tyme in our salon!</li>
            <li> it works well for me.</li>
            <li> Extremely helpful on my ingrowns</li>
            <li> INSANEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE IT IS AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING - Best thing I have ever purchased, if you are thinking about purchasing it stop THINKING and just buy - best decision I have ever made. My skin tends to be super sensitive against razors and hair removal items -and it is great to finally find a product that works perfectly to remove all the razor bumps and burns</li>
            <li> This stuff works GREAT! Awesome for bikini line and for my son&#x27;s ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Shocked how well this works for ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Best solution for ingrown hairs that I&#x27;ve been able to find. Just make sure that you apply it twice a day, and moisturize!</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever. It is just too damn pricey.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised .</li>
            <li> Best product.  My husband uses everyday.  He use to suffer from razor burn and ingrown hairs.  Using this has had a positive impact greatly reducing any problems.  Does not burn like an aftershave.  He won&#x27;t shave if he dies not gave his Tend skin to use after.  Ladies, fantastic  for bikini line!</li>
            <li> This worked so well on my bikini area. I had so many ingrowns from waxing. Over about a month, it brought all the hairs to the surface so I could extract them. I recommend this to all my friends!</li>
            <li> definitely a Winner!!!!!! It works</li>
            <li> Fine results. Needs constance.</li>
            <li> I helps so much so worth the money</li>
            <li> Ottimo. Funziona veramente</li>
            <li> I have never had anything work before this product. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> It is great for reducing/eliminating those red bumps after cutting my hair, or what hair I have left. I have used this product off and on for seven years. When I use the product, no bumps. When I don&#x27;t use the products, bumps are back. It usually takes 3 to 4 days for the bumps to go away. With Tend Skin, no problemo!</li>
            <li> Its not working with all</li>
            <li> If you have any type of red bumps/ razor burn or ingrown hairs, this is the best product on the market.  It does tend to sting for a little bit when you first apply it- but the results are totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The product got to my home very quickly but did not take away any razor bumps.  Waste of money?</li>
            <li> I found this product for my husband in the late 90&#x27;s and he has used it since then.  It is the only product we have ever found that helps.  He goes into complete panic if he gets close to running out.  So glad I can now get it on Amazon with my Prime membership!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it on my face and the razor bumps are gone. A lot of people try to downgrade the product but not everything works for everybody just keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> works just as good as alcohol</li>
            <li> this is a good product, it works really well if used correctly.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i have heard some people complain of burning or stinging, but those type results typically occur if the product is used incorrectly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;a few tips: &lt;br /&gt;only apply to a totally dry skin area. &lt;br /&gt;dont use too much(apply a single thin layer of the product to the area.  i like to use a cotton ball as an applicator) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;if you follow my tips, the product should work great for you.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this after every shave. I use it under my arms and bikini area after shaves. No rash. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Been using it for years and takes the bumps away when I shave</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  Make sure to use cotton ball or something similar along with this product.  It does contain alcohol so it tends to dry out your skin, so moisturize after use.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I use it for everything!  They don&#x27;t state it as part of what it does but I use to disinfect scraps, cuts, or anything that looks like it might be prone to minor infection - if I don&#x27;t have something else.  I get little bumps on the back of my arms.  I don&#x27;t know from what and this takes care of them.  I guess just clogged pores.  If i&#x27;ve got a blemish I put this on it.  Seems to kill the germs that cause acne.  Basically, this stuff is a chemical exfoliant but the ingredients kill germs too!  I&#x27;ve used this for years and there is no substitute for it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves tend skin and this large bottle of it was a great bargain! I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to trying this out.  I heard very good things about this product.  I am glad I was able to purchase online.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the summer for shaving my bikini line but I ordered this for my son who tends to get ingrown hairs from a very thick beard and it works great.  No nasty smell either.  This product has been around  a while and I can see why.  It really works!</li>
            <li> There is no better product out there to prevent bumps from shaving/waxing.  I&#x27;ve used it for over a decade and was glad to see that Amazon carries it now!!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  When applying right after shaving, etc., it will burn similar to rubbing alcohol.  The burn does quickly diminish, and it has helped prevent razor burn breakout (use it daily and don&#x27;t skip application after hair removal).  Happy with product, and I plan to continue using it indefinitely.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for over 20 years!  Works great to prevent or remove ingrown hair.  Burns a little right out of the shower but works miracles!</li>
            <li> Huge bottle and cheap price.Good job Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;And about Tend skin, It is a great product but have to use it twice a day to keep the bumps under control but in the end of the day its worth it.</li>
            <li> Tend skin always does the job for my skin. I have been using it for several months and as long as I continue routine usage, i don&#x27;t suffer from ingrown hairs. As an African American male that shaves his head, i use it as treatment on the back of my head as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be advised that it isn&#x27;t for everyone. Test it out on a small patch of skin and see how your body reacts to it</li>
            <li> It is a good product but I did not find it to do anything spectacular as far as preventing razor bumps or ingrown hairs. It&#x27;s a little pricey too. I found I can make my own similar stuff that works better.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats this solution for calming shaved areas and prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and exactly as described</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you, this stuff WORKS! Ive always had razor bumps and recently started getting ingrown hairs (yuck), I always thought that I&#x27;d ALWAYS get razor bumps and there was nothing I could do about it. Well I was wrong! Ive been using this for about 2 weeks and I saw amazing results the morning after my first use!! Definitely use it twice daily. At first I was worried because it smells like straight rubbing alcohol! But it doesnt bother my skin unless I just shaved and I have tiny cuts where I shaved (yes it burns like hell) but that&#x27;s expected.  Works amazingly. Try it</li>
            <li> Not even sure if this even worked, heard from alot of people that this product use to be great but they changed the ingredients. I&#x27;d recommend Bump Patrol and Skin Tight</li>
            <li> This is all it claims to be and more. A hidden secret unfortunately. I&#x27;ve told everyone I know about this. You will not have anymore ingrown hairs or irritation! Don&#x27;t let the price discourage you it lasts me also a year!!</li>
            <li> My husband used to get really bad ingrown hairs and someone let him use some of this. It&#x27;s like magic. He hasn&#x27;t had the ingrown hairs ever since and uses it religiously! He&#x27;s now a loyal customer and we would by this by the case if we could afford it!</li>
            <li> Fit the ticket- Dr. recommended and we found it quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years.  It helps reduce the appearance of razor bumps.  I can&#x27;t say it gets rid of them all though.  I do not know if anything can claim it completely gets rid of razor bumps (maybe laser or electrolysis).</li>
            <li> Love this stuff so much!  Works perfectly for preventing razor bumps!  I am surprised more people don&#x27;t use this!</li>
            <li> I would never go without. Ever since I found this product (many years ago now) I have not had problems with ingrown hairs. It used to be a real problem for me. I am so thankful for this product. The best deals are online, whereas in store it is very expensive for only a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I like the solution, I have less ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Works like it says it will</li>
