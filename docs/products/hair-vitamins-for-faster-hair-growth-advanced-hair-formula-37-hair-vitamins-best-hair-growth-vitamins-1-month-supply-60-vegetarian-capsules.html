            <li>I am very satisfied with this product &amp; will indeed suggest it to others !</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with the results I have already</li>
            <li>I have been using Formula 37 for almost a year and its great for my hair.</li>
            <li>Which is great.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are great too.     </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve never tried the shampoo or conditioner in this line, but the pills worked great.  </li>
            <li>others here, I have also experienced nail growth which pleases me immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Off to a great start.  </li>
            <li>Happy I bought it.</li>
            <li>I ordered these pills because after reading all great reviews on faster growth, I had to buy them.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>They were great they stop the breakage of my hair, they was recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li>OMgoodness I am SOOO glad I did!!</li>
            <li>The changes in my hair are amazing!</li>
            <li>Not all things work for everybody, but I can honestly tell you if it works for me, TRY IT!</li>
            <li>THIS ITEM IS REALLY GOOD</li>
            <li>and you would think that if you have a good hair care regimen in place and are using these pills that you would see the growth that they guarantee.  </li>
            <li>but it   will do some good on regards to the strength of your hair and scalp.   </li>
            <li>No supplement will work on your hair if you don&#x27;t take good care of it in conjunction with the growth treatment.     </li>
            <li>they looked really good.</li>
            <li>cheaper)and does as good....</li>
            <li>I think this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>My nails were looking good and my hair was feeling good.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the pills.  </li>
            <li>that part was okay for me...watching and waiting!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I am in love with hair formula 37 !</li>
            <li>I noticed a change once I started taking these vitamins and I am in love!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I am not affiliated with this company or amazon or whoever, I&#x27;m just an honest satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>This is truly an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Buy Great Goods has a huge selection of products.  </li>
            <li>However, I found amazing results by taking biotin, folic acid, and bio-sil 3x&#x27;s a day.  </li>
            <li>But honestly, I can&#x27;t blame anyone by myself.  </li>
            <li>But they really do work great!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a staffer of this product company, I&#x27;m a real and very happy user!!!</li>
            <li>Nice, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for a hair vitamin to do.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s honest..</li>
            <li>It is also linked to aplastic anemia, acute leukemia, and bone marrow abnormalities.</li>
            <li>I was excited by all the great Amazon reviews</li>
            <li>I was so happy that these were delivered a day early, that&#x27;s great business.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Salonweb for great products and keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>, also my nails grew a lot and are very strong.     </li>
            <li>Very strong hair vitamins.</li>
            <li>People out there who wants faster hair growth buy this product, it&#x27;s ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.</li>
            <li>The best product there is for hair so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, I suggest you drink lots of water and more veggies will help your hair better.</li>
            <li>Try it for 90 days and use it consistently, and I believe you will also see great results...</li>
            <li>I did not see any extraordinary hair growth, but a good vitamin nevertheless.</li>
            <li>I had the original 2 step formula that was awesome that when i saw the new formula almost 50% off I had to jump on it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a HUGE difference in the texture of my hair!</li>
            <li>I will definitly buy again to make sure I NEVER run out.  </li>
            <li>You have to keep in mind that you can&#x27;t continue to damage your hair and expect it to grow (the more you damage your hair the more you have to cut</li>
            <li>Everyone says my hair looks really healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying 2 more orders today: a 6-month supply.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve noticed :-)    </li>
            <li>Then i take two more Step 2 pills around 2pm, followed by one Step 1 and two Step 2 pills at 8 in the evening...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been completely sincere with you...</li>
            <li>I may even get this again, to make sure my hair stops falling...</li>
            <li>these definitely have the best numbers ..</li>
            <li>The most repeated comment is that my hair looks thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had begun to take this vitamin, and while my hair didn&#x27;t grow at the rate that most people claim, it did grow faster.  </li>
            <li>The longer I take them, the better it gets.  </li>
            <li>Thicker more manageable.</li>
            <li>The results arent magical.</li>
            <li>I did find that I had more energy, more strength and the afternoon 2:00 pm drift offs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Instead of healthy hair</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27; Going to love this product.</li>
            <li>Hair Formula 37 vitamins for hair are top class 2 step 1&#x27;s with food</li>
            <li>I love these vitamins.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s because it was making my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>and I could see more visible growth.</li>
            <li>It did however make my hair feel softer and more shiny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fuller and I can do more with the front of my hair again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to frame my face, which I love doing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it was these pills causing it until I stopped and the acne mostly cleared up within a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>since there are so many pills to take i take 3 of step 2 pills twice a day morning and evening.</li>
            <li>I wanna buy another one or two more.</li>
            <li>So i will continue for 30 more days, will post again.</li>
            <li>I love how this product makes my hair stronger</li>
            <li>Will update soon :)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not so sure i want to risk losing my inch per month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, my expectations were met and I don&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li>Go to their website rather than order off amazon to find more information.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve also heard from many many people ,</li>
            <li>My hair is thinning on the top</li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>STAY AWAY FROM THIS and safely use prenatals and Biotin instead.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I had hair extensions and wanted to get my hair healthy again.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I like my Utra Mega Vitamins from GNC, much better..</li>
            <li>I  extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the product and will recommend for softer and growing hair.</li>
            <li>My friends and family are even giving me compliments how healthy it looks too.</li>
            <li>But so far so good!</li>
            <li>They offer such great prices, too good to be true!  </li>
            <li>My skin and nails look great and overall the pills make me feel more healthy.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this thing works perfectly for me</li>
            <li>I could honestly say that my hair has grown more than an inch since using this product and is braided into cornrows at this very moment.  </li>
            <li>isn\\&quot;t easy to watse</li>
            <li>This  hair vitamin has the key ingredients that are absolutely great for promoting a healthy head of hair, and scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair feels strong.  </li>
            <li>However, please be aware that this product has a side effect of a warm sensation upon ingestion.</li>
            <li>At first this stuff was really nice.</li>
            <li>The point is that i bought these because of the amazing positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I am a multiracial female so there are not a lot of great products I have found out there for myself.</li>
            <li>I am considering joinig their membership club on their website that gives you a reduced price and free shipping if you sign up for a 6 or 12-month commitment.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t tell you how much my hair has grown because sometimes i clip my hair 3 times a month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty pleased with that - not bad for just 2 weeks on the vitamins!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need a hair weave anymore!!!   </li>
            <li>This is no joke, this product really, really works!!!  </li>
            <li>Several years ago I used Hair Formula37 and experienced fast growing, strong, healthy hair while taking this supplement.  </li>
            <li>$40/month is a small price to pay for gorgeous hair, skin and nails!!</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s January, and my hair has grown significantly although i do have problems - which i never realized before.(iron deficiency and also</li>
            <li>but my nails did grow significantly faster and looked 10 times healthier.</li>
            <li>so go for it, its worth it!</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I still see significant growth and one month supply is two weeks supply for me</li>
            <li>My hair grew much, much faster and most important, it stopped breaking and shedding.  </li>
            <li>They smell great and left my hair so soft and easy to comb, and my scalp very clean.</li>
            <li>Bell Harrah is so right!</li>
            <li>and it started right below my ears !</li>
            <li>Now 16 months later, my hair is waist length, healthier and stronger than I can ever remember it being, and people are astounded at how fast it grew and how beautiful it is.</li>
            <li>Mine has grown a full 1/2 inch each month.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading and enjoy the product!</li>
            <li>I have no one to blame but myself for shelling out so much money thinking there was a magical pill to make my hair grow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with much cheaper vitamins</li>
            <li>yes it&#x27;s true women it works.  </li>
            <li>I love them so much, but the downside is, that my hair tangles easier than ever.</li>
            <li>I took these pills for two months in order to give it a true chance.    </li>
            <li>I had a full inch of growth each month which is a lot</li>
            <li>I think its only fair that I share this opinion since it was the rave reviews that got me into this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really mind the number of pills, I do split them up and take them from the time I wake up and once more before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a romantic notion really to buy magic pills that will help you get hair envy and make you gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to grow lovely long &amp; strong</li>
            <li>Im ready &amp; excited!</li>
            <li>a  second order and hope I will be able to give a better review.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and silky, more manageable and I wake up literally frizz free.</li>
            <li>They grew fairly quickly but broke off as they are still brittle.</li>
            <li>quick delivery</li>
            <li>(That&#x27;s right, ladies: get ready to buy more tweezers and razors...</li>
            <li>But now that my nails look so pretty, I&#x27;m super excited that HF37 has given them</li>
            <li>HF37 does make the new hair look healthy..</li>
            <li>I need to polish them more often because of the new growth.</li>
            <li>The vitamins listed are much the same as those found in a prenatal vitamin, which made my hair amazing!  </li>
            <li>My nails are growing insanely fast and strong-</li>
            <li>My hair is more healthy and shiner than it has been in a long time.  </li>
            <li>Side effects is a warm sensation that dissipates not long after digestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product did exactly what I thought it would - nothing!  </li>
            <li>my hair was very glossy and shiny!!</li>
            <li>This is my first review on amazon ever!</li>
            <li>a side note, from previous reviews and my own experience... it&#x27;s a lot of pills to take - but make sure you keep up with them every day.</li>
            <li>When combined with healthy eating and proper hair care, your hair will grow, but it will grow strong.</li>
            <li>But after a week, I&#x27;m used to it &amp; it definitely is worth taking with the results I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li>While it is a pain dividing the vitamins you have to take without meals(Hairtopia was easier to take), the results are worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair has grown about 2 inches but has filled in immensely and has more volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering some more real soon, because you really can&#x27;t beat the results that this product gives you.</li>
            <li>For me paying $50 a month for this is borderline worth it</li>
            <li>so I looked online and this seemed hopeful, and I ordered two months worth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the growth yet because it&#x27;s still too early to tell but so far so good.</li>
            <li>They wont help your hair any more than what your body is already doing naturally.</li>
            <li>They also work better as far as hair and nails.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product and thought nothing of the price for if it worked, it would have been worth it.  </li>
            <li>and i can honestly say my hair is finally growing.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m looking right at the evidence.</li>
            <li>I was right.</li>
            <li>Im on my first week of HF37 advanced, &amp;I really hope to see length with these pills, &amp;faster growth.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the intense results of taking pre-natal vitamins and how my hair and nails grew agressively when I was pregnant with my daughter.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting Married in May, and I want nice long hair for my wedding...</li>
            <li>vitamin works very fast with no side affect, love,love,love.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much for the first month but it has now grown about 1 inch!.</li>
            <li>I gave this vitamin a try with little hope even after reading all these good reviews about it.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t grow very fast and just the first two weeks of taking these my hair grew almost 1/2 an inch.</li>
            <li>At first I was nervous about the 8 pills every day</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not ever product works for everyone.</li>
            <li>There is no such thing as a magic pill that is going to make your hair grow.  </li>
            <li>Be aware though, it makes \\&quot;all\\</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Most hair products I&#x27;ve used only helped thicken my hair, but this is the 1st time I&#x27;ve used something that GROWS my hair.</li>
            <li>and I must tell you that it really WORKS!</li>
            <li>I gave it a shot - got my pills in the first week of July and started taking them.</li>
            <li>i understand their concept (that your body can only absorb so many vitamins at one time...</li>
            <li>To get back to healthy hair</li>
            <li>It not only makes your hair grow, but makes your nails fabulous!</li>
            <li>and when comparing that to Hair Formula 37, I noticed that there is a higher concentration of supplements in HF37.  </li>
            <li>its the only thing that i found trully magical.</li>
            <li>These really work!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I noticed a change within the first week of taking these.</li>
            <li>It also made me feel better physically.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t remember the exact amount).</li>
            <li>I did notice hair growth with my first bottle.</li>
            <li>I am a first time user and I am about to finish my one month supply, but have not notice any changes yet.</li>
            <li>After two months I can say thats exactly what I got,</li>
            <li>but after the first 4 weeks I went from hair at my jawline to now almost to my shoulders</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if my hair is growing or not, when I first got the bottle of 💊</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>It does just what it said it would do &#x27;Grows hair fast&#x27;!</li>
            <li>but if you really want it you won&#x27;t have an issue because its worth it.</li>
            <li>I started seeing results after the first month.</li>
            <li>but because hair formula 37 makes it feel so much healthier , I will continue to use this product !</li>
            <li>but I must say this product really works !</li>
            <li>it really does work!</li>
            <li>This did not help my hair grow at all, I did exactly what the directions said to.</li>
            <li>people have rated this product as ineffective, and I have to assume it&#x27;s because they didn&#x27;t take it exactly as indicated,</li>
            <li>I bleached most of it into an ombre with blonde.</li>
            <li>It is finally growing and my hair is so healthy.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m paying the same price as I did for the hairfinity vitamins with even better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didnt see no growth and its too many pills you have to take in one day and the kinda big which</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, the second bottle I would see more.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I read quite a few good reviews about it.</li>
            <li>This product definitely helped my hair grow more quickly than normal.  </li>
            <li>I thought that if ppl that have a problem with growing long hair think this product is the best thing since french fries, then since i dont have a problem in that area it would double the lenght in no time.</li>
            <li>and i wasnt really sure if the good reviews were real or fake, if someone is doing it to advertise it more.</li>
            <li>I started take this vitamin one month and a half ago and have seen significant growth and change on my hair texture for the better.</li>
            <li>I normally see!!</li>
            <li>There was minimal breakage from the hair extensions and my hair was overall in great shape.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus...this third time around, these vitamins have actually made my nails grow to a gorgeous length.</li>
            <li>- I can see a half inch more of the roots!</li>
            <li>once you start a new supplement - you have to give it at least a good 3 months to notice a significant difference .</li>
            <li>My hair is long and healthy</li>
            <li>My scalp got really greasy the first week of taking these</li>
            <li>But the product really works although i&#x27;m not as consistent as i should be.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried sooo many products &amp; treatments on my hair to help it grow longer..not even caring about how long it would take.</li>
            <li>Would I recommend, yes only if you have no health issues because I find them to be strong for my system.</li>
            <li>passed a certain length</li>
            <li>Be smart and know what&#x27;s in your \\&quot;vitamins\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Pills are rather large to swallow</li>
            <li>that was fine for a short while</li>
            <li>and that maybe my results would not be as advertised, but again, my hair   did not grow AT ALL, which is eve funny because my hair normally grows   somewhat fast.     </li>
            <li>My hair was growing so fast that I had to stop and take a break because I didn&#x27;t want to dye my hair \\&quot;roots\\</li>
            <li>I used it for 2 months on a row when I decided the growth was too fast for me to keep up with the color keeping.</li>
            <li>It takes longer time than the extensions but is your real hair and permanent.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>** Thanks for reading</li>
            <li>, my hair had started to really fall out</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has grown any because I have not straighten it out yet because I used to do that alot, and it really damaged my hair.</li>
            <li>&quot; your hair grow really fast.  </li>
            <li>It really works for me.</li>
            <li>I wanted this to work so much</li>
            <li>That got rid of the really saturated henna&#x27;d hair - so I was ready to start growing it out.</li>
            <li>one pill at morning and afternoon, and then dividing up the stage 2 pills into 3 doses of 2 pills throughout the day works very well.</li>
            <li>Well, my hair did not grow, I&#x27;ll say that from the very start.   </li>
            <li>but i used these pills and they really did work fast.  </li>
            <li>They REALLY</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on month 5 definetly have noticed growth but not as much as I thought</li>
            <li>I bought this product really hoping it would work</li>
            <li>and I noticed immediately that my hair didn&#x27;t grow as fast.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing soooooo much faster now</li>
            <li>I did notice that my nails grew fast</li>
            <li>i really don&#x27;t have $57 to throw a way a month, so</li>
            <li>when you spend that amount of money you are really hoping that something will work.</li>
            <li>its been  about 3 weeks or so, my hair is much longer</li>
            <li>Just too much pills to take for me.</li>
            <li>But they did a whole lot of damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>(It was really damaged)</li>
            <li>thyroid problems which both of these conditions thins the hair out and makes it really brittle.</li>
            <li>It really works but after using it I had hair loss</li>
            <li>I really did think its a another scam</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially I felt my hair wasn&#x27;t growing as I couldn&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m absolutely stoked with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li>My fiancè said he can feel it working once he started taking these pills, fast results</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s grown as much as I&#x27;d like it to -</li>
            <li>The shampoo was watery and and conditioner didn&#x27;t do much for my hair</li>
            <li>we will see how much my hair grows by the time I finish this set.</li>
            <li>Thank you too for the free shipping, that is definitely an added bonus!!</li>
            <li>I really doubt it would make a difference but tried anyway.</li>
            <li>Free sample of a different product along with the multi vitamins I take</li>
            <li>I did not see that much difference in my nails either.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very shiny too</li>
            <li>and my finger nails grows so fast also .</li>
            <li>fast service .The</li>
            <li>Yes this really works</li>
            <li>My hair feels extra soft &amp; smooth!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it will continue at the rate it&#x27;s been growing at, but the results so far have been very positive, i have no complaints.</li>
            <li>This is the third time that I have bought Hair Formula 37 over the years, but my first experience with the new, advanced formulation.</li>
            <li>my hair was fuller,i cant believe how quickly my hair grew!i will definitely be purchasing again!Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I felt the new growth pushing through my scalp after the first week.</li>
            <li>and I have compared the ingredients to many other hair growth vitamins on Amazon and</li>
            <li>I had finally stopped coloring my hair, after almost 30 years of doing so, thinking; \\&quot;I&#x27;m just gonna accept me, the way I am, silver and all\\&quot;  and Holy Moly, my hair not only grew back, but grew back in my original Auburn !!!!  </li>
            <li>I stopped getting deep conditioners and special treatments.  </li>
            <li>My hair grows fast naturally, i just expected magic i guess.</li>
            <li>price is not bad for what you get ; a product that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The number of pills you have to take can be time a nuisance .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly baby fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li>So I lost half of my length over most of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>If you give them less than 5 stars, like so many of us, they fight the review to have it taken off so that you will never know.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly trimming my hair from split ends because it&#x27;s so many different layers , but I&#x27;ve noticed even the shortest length of my hair which is below my shoulders , has been growing.</li>
            <li>NOW nothing comes out and my hair is so healthy looking, I even have a little bit of \\&quot;new\\&quot; hair growth.</li>
            <li>i am a caucasian woman in my early 20&#x27;s with straight hair.  </li>
            <li>it seems to be growing at its normal rate.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a lot of pills to take in a day, but even after using this for only a month, the results have been definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but felt obligated to on this one.</li>
            <li>you just have to make sure you take them everyday and wait to see results they won&#x27;t show up overnight.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to get an other bottle to continue growing it much longer.</li>
            <li>I have told all my friends about the vitamins and although its a kind of annoying to take so many pills a day in addition to my multi-vitamin, seeing results makes it worth it.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m hispanic-black woman (dominican) with relaxed fine hair and my hair grows normally, but only neck-chin lenght, no further than that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had super long hair.</li>
            <li>I am off to try new supplements</li>
            <li>My eyebrows have even filled back in finally</li>
            <li>This contains a bunch of soy, weird coating, and most importantly, did nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I take the first set in the morning with breakfast and the second set at night before bed.</li>
            <li>My hair grows dreadfully slow so for me thats something to be proud of especially in such a short period of time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m starting to feel hair growth, I will buy again, and the shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li>With the lack of research, I was then too worried to take my actual vitamins, other supplements, or painkillers on top of the 8 pills.</li>
            <li>I was surprised as to how much new growth there was</li>
            <li>It did, however, make my hair feel soft and smooth, but it is not worth the weight gain.</li>
            <li>I am a young black (African/Nigerian, more specifically) female</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work pure and simple..</li>
            <li>My hair is chemical free and has been for a little over two years now.</li>
            <li>Last night he looked at me and said \\&quot;Hey wow - you&#x27;re hair&#x27;s really grown</li>
            <li>&quot; so frequently.</li>
            <li>However my hair has grown nearly 1 1/2 inches.</li>
            <li>At first I just had red splotches on my face, and then a week later after taking it, my face flushed &amp; swelled, my arms flushed, tingled &amp; felt hot, my eyes starting swelling &amp; my tongue syarted tingling.</li>
            <li>It met my expectation because it&#x27;s actually working to make my hair growing fast for a month.</li>
            <li>I wanted to share my experience so far for those people who were like me and unsure as to whether they should try it out.    </li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>But as far as hair growth...ABSOLUTELY not recommending HF37 for that.</li>
            <li>and now it nearly reaches my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 66 years old and had a receding hairline.  </li>
            <li>There are plenty of natural remedies you can use to help your hair grow.</li>
            <li>My skin is a lot cleaner and brighter and feels much softer, but it&#x27;s only about day 15/16 .</li>
            <li>I had dyed my hair brown, and i can see my natural hair</li>
            <li>(I was taking vitamins beforehand and continued my old vitamins along with these).</li>
            <li>do not waste your money</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell</li>
            <li>I used this years ago and developed gout.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper with same results.</li>
            <li>I bought this product directly from the company.</li>
            <li>Only pills that have ever really worked for me.</li>
            <li>The pills are much longer and bigger than Ibuprofen.</li>
            <li>head to see how well this worked just to be objective and to see for my self if it was worth ordering again in the future.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I read other peoples&#x27; reports of nail growth, but up till now, it only helped my hair and that was fine with me.</li>
            <li>I mean please what a scam have you ever been more ripped off in yr life?</li>
            <li>I want to grow my hair out so that I can get it all back to its natural color, and my roots actually help me see how much these vitamins help my hair grow!  </li>
            <li>I have had the same hair length for YEARS, something that most people find unbelievable.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m just working on the spots that are there from past acne, but my face is completely acne free.  </li>
            <li>When I was taking this my hair grew in really full with little to no split ends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually been out of my vitamins for a few weeks now and yet, my nails are still growing strong.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you are looking to grow your hair long - fast.</li>
            <li>Im 20 and wanted long hair, ive been taking the pills in combination with nisim fast and my hair grows probably 2 inches in 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>My hair definitely became fuller, it didnt grow a lot faster then the normal rate for me.</li>
            <li>This product made me go back to the salon 3 weeks after getting a relaxer to get the new growth touched up.</li>
            <li>but it was the only new thing i was taking.</li>
            <li>After much digging around online I came across hair 37 and all the reviews on it - both good and bad.</li>
            <li>and as you pull on the hair they just came on out; (it looked really dry and was very brittle)  </li>
            <li>He knows I&#x27;ve been working to go back to my natural hair color - and there&#x27;s a noticeable demarcation line from the henna and the natural hair color.</li>
            <li>My natural hair is very coarse, and while using the HF37 it became really soft, silky and manageable.</li>
            <li>Not even worth one half of a star.</li>
            <li>so... I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and wouldn&#x27;t really recommend... but different mixtures work differently for people.</li>
            <li>The reason I give this a 3, is because after all they are still vitamins   and minerals that you body needs, and because, despite the fact that is   horrible having to be taking so many pills a day it helps with your water  drinking which is also good for you.     </li>
            <li>and my hair was strong and thick.</li>
            <li>There is no other hair vitamin on the market that works like this does.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was tripping when I noticed my hair looked a little longer after the first week, but then after two weeks, the difference was undeniable!</li>
            <li>For the two weeks I was taking this , I had to go back WAY early !</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a difference in growth, I&#x27;ve taken a month supply and my hair growth is average at half an inch, I&#x27;m going to try one more month to see if I notice a difference in growth.</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly, very thick, and growing it out was akward and hard to keep it looking good.</li>
            <li>I frequently read amazon reviews but seldomly write any, but felt compelled to write in case anyone had doubts and wanted a recent opinion.</li>
            <li>I have natural, tiny, spongy coils.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s doubled my average growth rate, and that&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I was apparently allergic to the horsetail in it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t quite finished the bottles, but I can tell that the product is working because I have some serious new-growth already ! :)</li>
            <li>but I must say that for the first two weeks or one week and a half I followed the recommended dosage</li>
            <li>First of all, I had heard of the product and ordered a 6month supply last year out of curiosity, but used them about 3 times but not consistently.</li>
            <li>If you have difficulties getting your hair to grow past a certain length I highly recommended this product-</li>
            <li>But 6 weeks isn&#x27;t very long for an inch of new hair growth.</li>
            <li>For as long as I&#x27;ve been taking the product, my naturally blonde - very curly hair - which means it is naturally dry and weak - has become stunning and looooong.     </li>
            <li>The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) classifies benzene as a human carcinogen which is an agent directly involved in causing cancer.</li>
            <li>are completly wrong, to take the same vitamins that are in just one tablet, you&#x27;d be looking at having to buy your own pharmacy almost.</li>
            <li>The only issue I had was that the dosage required so many pills (with the hair vitamin and the mineral booster) and the pills were big - and I am an awful pill taker - a big baby really :-)</li>
            <li>They are so big that you can barely swallow them</li>
            <li>I was VERY skeptical of course considering everything I&#x27;ve ever tried did nothing but disappoint me, but after reading some good reviews I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I am an African American woman with relaxed 3c hair that usually goes and does overall well, but this vitamin made my hair better than any other time in my life..</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of cutting about 3 inches of my hair off it not a little more and completely regretting it the very next day.</li>
            <li>I have not purchased in quite some time due to the high price but would buy again.</li>
            <li>old)I have not had excess or new growth to other parts of my body only my hair and eyebrows and they haven&#x27;t broke my face out.</li>

            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> Off to a great start.  </li>
            <li> Happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these pills because after reading all great reviews on faster growth, I had to buy them.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> They were great they stop the breakage of my hair, they was recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li> OMgoodness I am SOOO glad I did!!</li>
            <li> The changes in my hair are amazing!</li>
            <li> Not all things work for everybody, but I can honestly tell you if it works for me, TRY IT!</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM IS REALLY GOOD</li>
            <li> and you would think that if you have a good hair care regimen in place and are using these pills that you would see the growth that they guarantee.  </li>
            <li> but it   will do some good on regards to the strength of your hair and scalp.   </li>
            <li> No supplement will work on your hair if you don&#x27;t take good care of it in conjunction with the growth treatment.     </li>
            <li> they looked really good.</li>
            <li> cheaper)and does as good....</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product.  </li>
            <li> My nails were looking good and my hair was feeling good.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the pills.  </li>
            <li> that part was okay for me...watching and waiting!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I am in love with hair formula 37 !</li>
            <li> I noticed a change once I started taking these vitamins and I am in love!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> I am not affiliated with this company or amazon or whoever, I&#x27;m just an honest satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> This is truly an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Buy Great Goods has a huge selection of products.  </li>
            <li> However, I found amazing results by taking biotin, folic acid, and bio-sil 3x&#x27;s a day.  </li>
            <li> But honestly, I can&#x27;t blame anyone by myself.  </li>
            <li> But they really do work great!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a staffer of this product company, I&#x27;m a real and very happy user!!!</li>
            <li> Nice, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for a hair vitamin to do.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s honest..</li>
            <li> It is also linked to aplastic anemia, acute leukemia, and bone marrow abnormalities.</li>
            <li> I was excited by all the great Amazon reviews</li>
            <li> I was so happy that these were delivered a day early, that&#x27;s great business.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Salonweb for great products and keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> , also my nails grew a lot and are very strong.     </li>
            <li> Very strong hair vitamins.</li>
            <li> People out there who wants faster hair growth buy this product, it&#x27;s ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.</li>
            <li> The best product there is for hair so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, I suggest you drink lots of water and more veggies will help your hair better.</li>
            <li> Try it for 90 days and use it consistently, and I believe you will also see great results...</li>
            <li> I did not see any extraordinary hair growth, but a good vitamin nevertheless.</li>
            <li> I had the original 2 step formula that was awesome that when i saw the new formula almost 50% off I had to jump on it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a HUGE difference in the texture of my hair!</li>
            <li> I will definitly buy again to make sure I NEVER run out.  </li>
            <li> You have to keep in mind that you can&#x27;t continue to damage your hair and expect it to grow (the more you damage your hair the more you have to cut</li>
            <li> Everyone says my hair looks really healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying 2 more orders today: a 6-month supply.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve noticed :-)    </li>
            <li> Then i take two more Step 2 pills around 2pm, followed by one Step 1 and two Step 2 pills at 8 in the evening...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been completely sincere with you...</li>
            <li> I may even get this again, to make sure my hair stops falling...</li>
            <li> these definitely have the best numbers ..</li>
            <li> The most repeated comment is that my hair looks thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had begun to take this vitamin, and while my hair didn&#x27;t grow at the rate that most people claim, it did grow faster.  </li>
            <li> The longer I take them, the better it gets.  </li>
            <li> Thicker more manageable.</li>
            <li> The results arent magical.</li>
            <li> I did find that I had more energy, more strength and the afternoon 2:00 pm drift offs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Instead of healthy hair</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27; Going to love this product.</li>
            <li> Hair Formula 37 vitamins for hair are top class 2 step 1&#x27;s with food</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s because it was making my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> and I could see more visible growth.</li>
            <li> It did however make my hair feel softer and more shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fuller and I can do more with the front of my hair again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to frame my face, which I love doing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was these pills causing it until I stopped and the acne mostly cleared up within a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> since there are so many pills to take i take 3 of step 2 pills twice a day morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I wanna buy another one or two more.</li>
            <li> So i will continue for 30 more days, will post again.</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my hair stronger</li>
            <li> Will update soon :)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not so sure i want to risk losing my inch per month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, my expectations were met and I don&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Go to their website rather than order off amazon to find more information.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve also heard from many many people ,</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning on the top</li>
            <li> Will buy more.</li>
            <li> STAY AWAY FROM THIS and safely use prenatals and Biotin instead.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I had hair extensions and wanted to get my hair healthy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I like my Utra Mega Vitamins from GNC, much better..</li>
            <li> I  extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the product and will recommend for softer and growing hair.</li>
            <li> My friends and family are even giving me compliments how healthy it looks too.</li>
            <li> But so far so good!</li>
            <li> They offer such great prices, too good to be true!  </li>
            <li> My skin and nails look great and overall the pills make me feel more healthy.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this thing works perfectly for me</li>
            <li> I could honestly say that my hair has grown more than an inch since using this product and is braided into cornrows at this very moment.  </li>
            <li> isn\\&quot;t easy to watse</li>
            <li> This  hair vitamin has the key ingredients that are absolutely great for promoting a healthy head of hair, and scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair feels strong.  </li>
            <li> However, please be aware that this product has a side effect of a warm sensation upon ingestion.</li>
            <li> At first this stuff was really nice.</li>
            <li> The point is that i bought these because of the amazing positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I am a multiracial female so there are not a lot of great products I have found out there for myself.</li>
            <li> I am considering joinig their membership club on their website that gives you a reduced price and free shipping if you sign up for a 6 or 12-month commitment.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t tell you how much my hair has grown because sometimes i clip my hair 3 times a month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty pleased with that - not bad for just 2 weeks on the vitamins!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need a hair weave anymore!!!   </li>
            <li> This is no joke, this product really, really works!!!  </li>
            <li> Several years ago I used Hair Formula37 and experienced fast growing, strong, healthy hair while taking this supplement.  </li>
            <li> $40/month is a small price to pay for gorgeous hair, skin and nails!!</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s January, and my hair has grown significantly although i do have problems - which i never realized before.(iron deficiency and also</li>
            <li> but my nails did grow significantly faster and looked 10 times healthier.</li>
            <li> so go for it, its worth it!</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I still see significant growth and one month supply is two weeks supply for me</li>
            <li> My hair grew much, much faster and most important, it stopped breaking and shedding.  </li>
            <li> They smell great and left my hair so soft and easy to comb, and my scalp very clean.</li>
            <li> Bell Harrah is so right!</li>
            <li> and it started right below my ears !</li>
            <li> Now 16 months later, my hair is waist length, healthier and stronger than I can ever remember it being, and people are astounded at how fast it grew and how beautiful it is.</li>
            <li> Mine has grown a full 1/2 inch each month.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading and enjoy the product!</li>
            <li> I have no one to blame but myself for shelling out so much money thinking there was a magical pill to make my hair grow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better results with much cheaper vitamins</li>
            <li> yes it&#x27;s true women it works.  </li>
            <li> I love them so much, but the downside is, that my hair tangles easier than ever.</li>
            <li> I took these pills for two months in order to give it a true chance.    </li>
            <li> I had a full inch of growth each month which is a lot</li>
            <li> I think its only fair that I share this opinion since it was the rave reviews that got me into this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really mind the number of pills, I do split them up and take them from the time I wake up and once more before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a romantic notion really to buy magic pills that will help you get hair envy and make you gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to grow lovely long &amp; strong</li>
            <li> Im ready &amp; excited!</li>
            <li> a  second order and hope I will be able to give a better review.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and silky, more manageable and I wake up literally frizz free.</li>
            <li> They grew fairly quickly but broke off as they are still brittle.</li>
            <li> quick delivery</li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s right, ladies: get ready to buy more tweezers and razors...</li>
            <li> But now that my nails look so pretty, I&#x27;m super excited that HF37 has given them</li>
            <li> HF37 does make the new hair look healthy..</li>
            <li> I need to polish them more often because of the new growth.</li>
            <li> The vitamins listed are much the same as those found in a prenatal vitamin, which made my hair amazing!  </li>
            <li> My nails are growing insanely fast and strong-</li>
            <li> My hair is more healthy and shiner than it has been in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Side effects is a warm sensation that dissipates not long after digestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what I thought it would - nothing!  </li>
            <li> my hair was very glossy and shiny!!</li>
            <li> This is my first review on amazon ever!</li>
            <li> a side note, from previous reviews and my own experience... it&#x27;s a lot of pills to take - but make sure you keep up with them every day.</li>
            <li> When combined with healthy eating and proper hair care, your hair will grow, but it will grow strong.</li>
            <li> But after a week, I&#x27;m used to it &amp; it definitely is worth taking with the results I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li> While it is a pain dividing the vitamins you have to take without meals(Hairtopia was easier to take), the results are worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair has grown about 2 inches but has filled in immensely and has more volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering some more real soon, because you really can&#x27;t beat the results that this product gives you.</li>
            <li> For me paying $50 a month for this is borderline worth it</li>
            <li> so I looked online and this seemed hopeful, and I ordered two months worth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the growth yet because it&#x27;s still too early to tell but so far so good.</li>
            <li> They wont help your hair any more than what your body is already doing naturally.</li>
            <li> They also work better as far as hair and nails.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product and thought nothing of the price for if it worked, it would have been worth it.  </li>
            <li> and i can honestly say my hair is finally growing.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m looking right at the evidence.</li>
            <li> I was right.</li>
            <li> Im on my first week of HF37 advanced, &amp;I really hope to see length with these pills, &amp;faster growth.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the intense results of taking pre-natal vitamins and how my hair and nails grew agressively when I was pregnant with my daughter.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting Married in May, and I want nice long hair for my wedding...</li>
            <li> vitamin works very fast with no side affect, love,love,love.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much for the first month but it has now grown about 1 inch!.</li>
            <li> I gave this vitamin a try with little hope even after reading all these good reviews about it.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t grow very fast and just the first two weeks of taking these my hair grew almost 1/2 an inch.</li>
            <li> At first I was nervous about the 8 pills every day</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not ever product works for everyone.</li>
            <li> There is no such thing as a magic pill that is going to make your hair grow.  </li>
            <li> Be aware though, it makes \\&quot;all\\</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Most hair products I&#x27;ve used only helped thicken my hair, but this is the 1st time I&#x27;ve used something that GROWS my hair.</li>
            <li> and I must tell you that it really WORKS!</li>
            <li> I gave it a shot - got my pills in the first week of July and started taking them.</li>
            <li> i understand their concept (that your body can only absorb so many vitamins at one time...</li>
            <li> To get back to healthy hair</li>
            <li> It not only makes your hair grow, but makes your nails fabulous!</li>
            <li> and when comparing that to Hair Formula 37, I noticed that there is a higher concentration of supplements in HF37.  </li>
            <li> its the only thing that i found trully magical.</li>
            <li> These really work!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I noticed a change within the first week of taking these.</li>
            <li> It also made me feel better physically.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t remember the exact amount).</li>
            <li> I did notice hair growth with my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user and I am about to finish my one month supply, but have not notice any changes yet.</li>
            <li> After two months I can say thats exactly what I got,</li>
            <li> but after the first 4 weeks I went from hair at my jawline to now almost to my shoulders</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if my hair is growing or not, when I first got the bottle of 💊</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> It does just what it said it would do &#x27;Grows hair fast&#x27;!</li>
            <li> but if you really want it you won&#x27;t have an issue because its worth it.</li>
            <li> I started seeing results after the first month.</li>
            <li> but because hair formula 37 makes it feel so much healthier , I will continue to use this product !</li>
            <li> but I must say this product really works !</li>
            <li> it really does work!</li>
            <li> This did not help my hair grow at all, I did exactly what the directions said to.</li>
            <li> people have rated this product as ineffective, and I have to assume it&#x27;s because they didn&#x27;t take it exactly as indicated,</li>
            <li> I bleached most of it into an ombre with blonde.</li>
            <li> It is finally growing and my hair is so healthy.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m paying the same price as I did for the hairfinity vitamins with even better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didnt see no growth and its too many pills you have to take in one day and the kinda big which</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, the second bottle I would see more.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and I read quite a few good reviews about it.</li>
            <li> This product definitely helped my hair grow more quickly than normal.  </li>
            <li> I thought that if ppl that have a problem with growing long hair think this product is the best thing since french fries, then since i dont have a problem in that area it would double the lenght in no time.</li>
            <li> and i wasnt really sure if the good reviews were real or fake, if someone is doing it to advertise it more.</li>
            <li> I started take this vitamin one month and a half ago and have seen significant growth and change on my hair texture for the better.</li>
            <li> I normally see!!</li>
            <li> There was minimal breakage from the hair extensions and my hair was overall in great shape.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus...this third time around, these vitamins have actually made my nails grow to a gorgeous length.</li>
            <li> - I can see a half inch more of the roots!</li>
            <li> once you start a new supplement - you have to give it at least a good 3 months to notice a significant difference .</li>
            <li> My hair is long and healthy</li>
            <li> My scalp got really greasy the first week of taking these</li>
            <li> But the product really works although i&#x27;m not as consistent as i should be.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried sooo many products &amp; treatments on my hair to help it grow longer..not even caring about how long it would take.</li>
            <li> Would I recommend, yes only if you have no health issues because I find them to be strong for my system.</li>
            <li> passed a certain length</li>
            <li> Be smart and know what&#x27;s in your \\&quot;vitamins\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Pills are rather large to swallow</li>
            <li> that was fine for a short while</li>
            <li> and that maybe my results would not be as advertised, but again, my hair   did not grow AT ALL, which is eve funny because my hair normally grows   somewhat fast.     </li>
            <li> My hair was growing so fast that I had to stop and take a break because I didn&#x27;t want to dye my hair \\&quot;roots\\</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 months on a row when I decided the growth was too fast for me to keep up with the color keeping.</li>
            <li> It takes longer time than the extensions but is your real hair and permanent.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> ** Thanks for reading</li>
            <li> , my hair had started to really fall out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it has grown any because I have not straighten it out yet because I used to do that alot, and it really damaged my hair.</li>
            <li> &quot; your hair grow really fast.  </li>
            <li> It really works for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work so much</li>
            <li> That got rid of the really saturated henna&#x27;d hair - so I was ready to start growing it out.</li>
            <li> one pill at morning and afternoon, and then dividing up the stage 2 pills into 3 doses of 2 pills throughout the day works very well.</li>
            <li> Well, my hair did not grow, I&#x27;ll say that from the very start.   </li>
            <li> but i used these pills and they really did work fast.  </li>
            <li> They REALLY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on month 5 definetly have noticed growth but not as much as I thought</li>
            <li> I bought this product really hoping it would work</li>
            <li> and I noticed immediately that my hair didn&#x27;t grow as fast.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing soooooo much faster now</li>
            <li> I did notice that my nails grew fast</li>
            <li> i really don&#x27;t have $57 to throw a way a month, so</li>
            <li> when you spend that amount of money you are really hoping that something will work.</li>
            <li> its been  about 3 weeks or so, my hair is much longer</li>
            <li> Just too much pills to take for me.</li>
            <li> But they did a whole lot of damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> (It was really damaged)</li>
            <li> thyroid problems which both of these conditions thins the hair out and makes it really brittle.</li>
            <li> It really works but after using it I had hair loss</li>
            <li> I really did think its a another scam</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially I felt my hair wasn&#x27;t growing as I couldn&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m absolutely stoked with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> My fiancè said he can feel it working once he started taking these pills, fast results</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s grown as much as I&#x27;d like it to -</li>
            <li> The shampoo was watery and and conditioner didn&#x27;t do much for my hair</li>
            <li> we will see how much my hair grows by the time I finish this set.</li>
            <li> Thank you too for the free shipping, that is definitely an added bonus!!</li>
            <li> I really doubt it would make a difference but tried anyway.</li>
            <li> Free sample of a different product along with the multi vitamins I take</li>
            <li> I did not see that much difference in my nails either.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very shiny too</li>
            <li> and my finger nails grows so fast also .</li>
            <li> fast service .The</li>
            <li> Yes this really works</li>
            <li> My hair feels extra soft &amp; smooth!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it will continue at the rate it&#x27;s been growing at, but the results so far have been very positive, i have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is the third time that I have bought Hair Formula 37 over the years, but my first experience with the new, advanced formulation.</li>
            <li> my hair was fuller,i cant believe how quickly my hair grew!i will definitely be purchasing again!Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I felt the new growth pushing through my scalp after the first week.</li>
            <li> and I have compared the ingredients to many other hair growth vitamins on Amazon and</li>
            <li> I had finally stopped coloring my hair, after almost 30 years of doing so, thinking; \\&quot;I&#x27;m just gonna accept me, the way I am, silver and all\\&quot;  and Holy Moly, my hair not only grew back, but grew back in my original Auburn !!!!  </li>
            <li> I stopped getting deep conditioners and special treatments.  </li>
            <li> My hair grows fast naturally, i just expected magic i guess.</li>
            <li> price is not bad for what you get ; a product that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The number of pills you have to take can be time a nuisance .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly baby fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li> So I lost half of my length over most of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> If you give them less than 5 stars, like so many of us, they fight the review to have it taken off so that you will never know.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly trimming my hair from split ends because it&#x27;s so many different layers , but I&#x27;ve noticed even the shortest length of my hair which is below my shoulders , has been growing.</li>
            <li> NOW nothing comes out and my hair is so healthy looking, I even have a little bit of \\&quot;new\\&quot; hair growth.</li>
            <li> i am a caucasian woman in my early 20&#x27;s with straight hair.  </li>
            <li> it seems to be growing at its normal rate.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a lot of pills to take in a day, but even after using this for only a month, the results have been definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but felt obligated to on this one.</li>
            <li> you just have to make sure you take them everyday and wait to see results they won&#x27;t show up overnight.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to get an other bottle to continue growing it much longer.</li>
            <li> I have told all my friends about the vitamins and although its a kind of annoying to take so many pills a day in addition to my multi-vitamin, seeing results makes it worth it.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m hispanic-black woman (dominican) with relaxed fine hair and my hair grows normally, but only neck-chin lenght, no further than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had super long hair.</li>
            <li> I am off to try new supplements</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have even filled back in finally</li>
            <li> This contains a bunch of soy, weird coating, and most importantly, did nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I take the first set in the morning with breakfast and the second set at night before bed.</li>
            <li> My hair grows dreadfully slow so for me thats something to be proud of especially in such a short period of time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to feel hair growth, I will buy again, and the shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li> With the lack of research, I was then too worried to take my actual vitamins, other supplements, or painkillers on top of the 8 pills.</li>
            <li> I was surprised as to how much new growth there was</li>
            <li> It did, however, make my hair feel soft and smooth, but it is not worth the weight gain.</li>
            <li> I am a young black (African/Nigerian, more specifically) female</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work pure and simple..</li>
            <li> My hair is chemical free and has been for a little over two years now.</li>
            <li> Last night he looked at me and said \\&quot;Hey wow - you&#x27;re hair&#x27;s really grown</li>
            <li> &quot; so frequently.</li>
            <li> However my hair has grown nearly 1 1/2 inches.</li>
            <li> At first I just had red splotches on my face, and then a week later after taking it, my face flushed &amp; swelled, my arms flushed, tingled &amp; felt hot, my eyes starting swelling &amp; my tongue syarted tingling.</li>
            <li> It met my expectation because it&#x27;s actually working to make my hair growing fast for a month.</li>
            <li> I wanted to share my experience so far for those people who were like me and unsure as to whether they should try it out.    </li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> But as far as hair growth...ABSOLUTELY not recommending HF37 for that.</li>
            <li> and now it nearly reaches my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 years old and had a receding hairline.  </li>
            <li> There are plenty of natural remedies you can use to help your hair grow.</li>
            <li> My skin is a lot cleaner and brighter and feels much softer, but it&#x27;s only about day 15/16 .</li>
            <li> I had dyed my hair brown, and i can see my natural hair</li>
            <li> (I was taking vitamins beforehand and continued my old vitamins along with these).</li>
            <li> do not waste your money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell</li>
            <li> I used this years ago and developed gout.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper with same results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product directly from the company.</li>
            <li> Only pills that have ever really worked for me.</li>
            <li> The pills are much longer and bigger than Ibuprofen.</li>
            <li> head to see how well this worked just to be objective and to see for my self if it was worth ordering again in the future.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I read other peoples&#x27; reports of nail growth, but up till now, it only helped my hair and that was fine with me.</li>
            <li> I mean please what a scam have you ever been more ripped off in yr life?</li>
            <li> I want to grow my hair out so that I can get it all back to its natural color, and my roots actually help me see how much these vitamins help my hair grow!  </li>
            <li> I have had the same hair length for YEARS, something that most people find unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m just working on the spots that are there from past acne, but my face is completely acne free.  </li>
            <li> When I was taking this my hair grew in really full with little to no split ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been out of my vitamins for a few weeks now and yet, my nails are still growing strong.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you are looking to grow your hair long - fast.</li>
            <li> Im 20 and wanted long hair, ive been taking the pills in combination with nisim fast and my hair grows probably 2 inches in 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair definitely became fuller, it didnt grow a lot faster then the normal rate for me.</li>
            <li> This product made me go back to the salon 3 weeks after getting a relaxer to get the new growth touched up.</li>
            <li> but it was the only new thing i was taking.</li>
            <li> After much digging around online I came across hair 37 and all the reviews on it - both good and bad.</li>
            <li> and as you pull on the hair they just came on out; (it looked really dry and was very brittle)  </li>
            <li> He knows I&#x27;ve been working to go back to my natural hair color - and there&#x27;s a noticeable demarcation line from the henna and the natural hair color.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is very coarse, and while using the HF37 it became really soft, silky and manageable.</li>
            <li> Not even worth one half of a star.</li>
            <li> so... I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and wouldn&#x27;t really recommend... but different mixtures work differently for people.</li>
            <li> The reason I give this a 3, is because after all they are still vitamins   and minerals that you body needs, and because, despite the fact that is   horrible having to be taking so many pills a day it helps with your water  drinking which is also good for you.     </li>
            <li> and my hair was strong and thick.</li>
            <li> There is no other hair vitamin on the market that works like this does.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was tripping when I noticed my hair looked a little longer after the first week, but then after two weeks, the difference was undeniable!</li>
            <li> For the two weeks I was taking this , I had to go back WAY early !</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a difference in growth, I&#x27;ve taken a month supply and my hair growth is average at half an inch, I&#x27;m going to try one more month to see if I notice a difference in growth.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly, very thick, and growing it out was akward and hard to keep it looking good.</li>
            <li> I frequently read amazon reviews but seldomly write any, but felt compelled to write in case anyone had doubts and wanted a recent opinion.</li>
            <li> I have natural, tiny, spongy coils.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s doubled my average growth rate, and that&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I was apparently allergic to the horsetail in it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite finished the bottles, but I can tell that the product is working because I have some serious new-growth already ! :)</li>
            <li> but I must say that for the first two weeks or one week and a half I followed the recommended dosage</li>
            <li> First of all, I had heard of the product and ordered a 6month supply last year out of curiosity, but used them about 3 times but not consistently.</li>
            <li> If you have difficulties getting your hair to grow past a certain length I highly recommended this product-</li>
            <li> But 6 weeks isn&#x27;t very long for an inch of new hair growth.</li>
            <li> For as long as I&#x27;ve been taking the product, my naturally blonde - very curly hair - which means it is naturally dry and weak - has become stunning and looooong.     </li>
            <li> The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) classifies benzene as a human carcinogen which is an agent directly involved in causing cancer.</li>
            <li> are completly wrong, to take the same vitamins that are in just one tablet, you&#x27;d be looking at having to buy your own pharmacy almost.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was that the dosage required so many pills (with the hair vitamin and the mineral booster) and the pills were big - and I am an awful pill taker - a big baby really :-)</li>
            <li> They are so big that you can barely swallow them</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical of course considering everything I&#x27;ve ever tried did nothing but disappoint me, but after reading some good reviews I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman with relaxed 3c hair that usually goes and does overall well, but this vitamin made my hair better than any other time in my life..</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of cutting about 3 inches of my hair off it not a little more and completely regretting it the very next day.</li>
            <li> I have not purchased in quite some time due to the high price but would buy again.</li>
            <li> old)I have not had excess or new growth to other parts of my body only my hair and eyebrows and they haven&#x27;t broke my face out.</li>
            <li> My hair growth was very noticeable - about 1-2 inches in half a month!</li>
            <li> But After only two weeks of taking the vitamins and shampoo daily, my hair had grown half an inch (what my hair normally grows in a month).</li>
            <li> Last night - maybe it was wishful thinking, but I noticed a difference in the hair length - it seemed it&#x27;d picked up a little length a little extra quickly -</li>
            <li> Benzene is a natural constituent of crude oil, is highly flammable and an important component in gasoline.</li>
            <li> On the 20th I noticed that my hair had stopped shedding excessively and looked much shinier and was easier to manage.</li>
            <li> My hair is at my shoulders ,how long do you think it will take to get to the middle of my back?</li>
            <li> Will come back on Nov 15 to mention any further results from the product whether positive or negative.       </li>
            <li> I eat high protein everyday so that could be helping.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman with very short( natural) hair.  </li>
            <li> After using this for a month my hair has really improved, not more falling out everytime</li>
            <li> I always have fast results, at an inch per month, which is twice my usual growth rate.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion, if you can start these on a long weekend.</li>
            <li> Last month I added braids to my hair (not for a long time</li>
            <li> But I forced myself to be consistent</li>
            <li> So when I tell you my hair is soft, shiny and less frizzy..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and normally grow about an inch of hair each month, I then usually have to cut it after that due to split ends.</li>
            <li> I purchased these in late October and took them for 3 months straight.</li>
            <li> As women we go through so many hormonal inbalances, that our hair suffers as a result.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money and I will NEVER make this mistake again.</li>
            <li> approx 1\\&quot; long all over for about a year before I decided that I wanted to grow it out.</li>
            <li> Once it was around 4\\&quot; long, I started looking for something to help it grow faster.</li>
            <li> in about three months, my hair was twice as long.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been taking them that long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on Hairfinity for 10 months now &amp;even tho they work and my hair is thicker, shinier,healthier, it still isn&#x27;t as long as I want it.</li>
            <li> That brings me to the downside of this product: you&#x27;ll be swallowing pills all day long.</li>
            <li> so didn&#x27;t plan on using it for long</li>
            <li> and I have not noticed much hair growth other than my usual hair growth.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than what i expected two thumbs up! (:</li>
            <li> Other than the fluorescent yellow urine</li>
            <li> the hair was everywhere in the tub I had to take it by the handfuls and put it in the garbage - it was literally like straw really dry</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t been growing past a certain length for years and after 2 months of this stuff it still isn&#x27;t growing past the same length.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its old or exposed to temperature.</li>
            <li> My short hair is down to my neck.  </li>
            <li> It was as if my body could not break down a specific substance in the supplement.</li>
            <li> I have used it for two years now and my hair is down my back.</li>
            <li> I am black with nutty short hair.  </li>
            <li> It works well even though I actually take half of what it tells me to take.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still kinda in the same length, &amp;for months I can&#x27;t seem to get it past my bra strap, which is dissapointing because thats how my hair has been for years, same length.</li>
            <li> then I noticed that my urine was very yellow so cut the dosage in half taking 3 and 1</li>
            <li> The only down fall is sooo many pills, but once you get in the routine &amp; have set your times of when your going to take it, it&#x27;s not to bad.</li>
            <li> I started taking these on July 1, so it&#x27;s only been a little over 2 weeks</li>
            <li> i cannot say that this made my hair grow faster... only about 1/2 inch per month (which is the average hair gorwth rate, anyways!)    </li>
            <li> My hair grows very slowly and was really wanting to get my hair to grow from the inside out.</li>
            <li> This is worthless and they say it&#x27;s refundable, until you read the fine print and realize it&#x27;s only if you bought the entire product line.</li>
            <li> My hair grows kinda slow now too - it used to grow faster, but I suppose everything slows down the older you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> goal is to have my hair back down to my buttcrack!</li>
            <li> last cut was late June - and it was at mid to upper neck length  - basically a little bit longer than the chin length cut, and then layered.</li>
            <li> Work great but smell awful...</li>
            <li> a few years ago i cut my hair to above my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t use a blowdryer or a iron on it and my hair stylist never wants to trim it because he says I never have any split ends</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I found a product that works, and works beyond anything I would have expected.  </li>
            <li> Drank a ton of water and after the bottles were done, no real change in hair growth.</li>
            <li> So I spent the $50 on it and started taking it.</li>
            <li> they did not work as I expected them to.</li>
            <li> I cut off 4 inches and left it just at my collar bone on the 7th of this month( August) after it was washed and dried, but not with formula 37 products.  </li>
            <li> I just dyed my hair and am starting another round of vitamins</li>
            <li> i.e. they took partial or inconsistent doses.</li>
            <li> feel like I really did waste my money especially when I found out that NONE of these supplements work if you aren&#x27;t already vitamin deficient.</li>
            <li> It has only been a few weeks, and I am not consistant.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in hair length after only half the bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly not one to take time and write a review, but I will....</li>
            <li> I will certainly not be ordering them again.</li>
            <li> In September I got a victoria bob (disgusting on me) very nice on other ppl.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t grow anymore than it normally grows and to top it all off, it gave me a horrible upset stomach every time I took the pills.</li>
            <li> Big pills, taken too often, no growth, thumbs down, waste of $,</li>
            <li> I used their entire line for almost a year and got very little results.  </li>
            <li> It did not seem to affect my nails as much as other reviewers, but I am hoping it will soon.  </li>
            <li> Although i was skeptical at first, i was hoping to see results but didn&#x27;t expect to notice anything so soon.  </li>
            <li> this comment will be helpful for other women.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it out via any other method tried except \\&quot;growing out\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> but so does other vitamins..</li>
            <li> I think i&#x27;m done growing my hair out, but will continue taking the pills for the other benefits.</li>
            <li> and I already was taking vitamins and eating extremely well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the other vitamins posted here and therefore feel my comparisons have been thorough.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> plus, they have vitamins in them that are benefitial for other things too.   </li>
            <li> Not sure how they are working yet, I am on my third bottle ..</li>
            <li> I read reviews from other sites about this product and</li>
            <li> It was other people noticing that convinced me that this works.  </li>
            <li> for the other vitamins I am taking.  </li>
            <li> I will say that it did cause me to gain weight (all the protein you&#x27;re pouring into your body along with other things...6 pill a day practically).</li>
            <li> My hair grew the same amount it usually does</li>
            <li> The only thing im not sure about is when i started taking these i weighed 115lbs</li>
            <li> I used these pills in the past and I measured my hair at the beginning and end of each month on several places around me</li>
            <li> I am taking those for almost 2 weeks now, I haven&#x27;t notice my hair growing faster yet, but I did not had any problems with pimples or other skin irritations like some reviews said.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but willing to try almost anything.</li>
            <li> Never happened with other hair vitamins</li>
            <li> They did help with shedding somewhat as I did other things to help with hair shedding and breakage, and my hair did grow,</li>
            <li> During the winter my hair is very dry and this product has helped my hair to have much less breakage and shedding.</li>
            <li> Unless of course you actually have a medical need and are deficient in the nutrients these vitamins offer.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had to trim them down (or bite them off) several times over the past week.</li>
            <li> It literally means that you&#x27;re throwing your money down the &amp;#34;toilet drain&amp;#34; so cutting back on how much you take  won&#x27;t hurt the results you wold eventually get.</li>
            <li> Taking 8 pills a day is hard, especially when you are out doing something, I would sometimes miss a dose.    </li>
            <li> maybe Im not looking hard enough</li>
            <li> Prior to using this, my hair was dull and brittle.</li>
            <li> it is a ripe off and is not worth the price that is being charged</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the size of the vitamins.</li>
            <li> But holy moly this stuff is not worth it.</li>
            <li> ,Ill be purchasing this item again, real soon.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my 15 year old granddaughter.&lt;br /&gt;She was not happy with taking 6 pills a day,&lt;br /&gt;Especially at school; they would not let her take them</li>
            <li> (I am multi-racial with thick, coarse and frizzy hair)</li>
            <li> Wow, I usually get a perm every six weeks do to how thick my hair is .</li>
            <li> The fact that you have to take so many is really annoying.</li>
            <li> I tried another less expensive product that made my hair grow but not as fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bi-racial (black &amp; Hispanic) with 3b,3c,4a hair that has taken a sudden slow grow</li>
            <li> I knew ahead of time that my average hair growth was about a half an inch a month.</li>
            <li> the growth was that dramatic, but after a month, there was clear growth.  </li>
            <li> The size are a slight chocking hazard and there are a lot of pills to take each day.</li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff work, I had recently suffered a scary stress-related hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I used heat styling on my hair often and noticed less hair falling.</li>
            <li> I am black, but I don&#x27;t have a typical black curl pattern.</li>
            <li> I say borderline because I would rather have a half inch</li>
            <li> colour black growing out in the root, like about 2 inch of hair.</li>
            <li> After 1 week I noticed a difference in the appearance in my hair; my hair became smoother &amp; thicker; with a lot less hair fall.</li>
            <li> Im a black girl.</li>
            <li> I am a black girl who has Indian texture from my fathers side of the family</li>
            <li> My hair has grown one in a half inches already.</li>
            <li> Im black &amp; filipino &amp;</li>
            <li> I must admit I have seen a slight difference in my hair</li>
            <li> Only con is the taste is not good.</li>
            <li> My niece brought the product and after a month she raved to me about it and how long and thick her hair grew.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted to use this to get long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have been taking them for a little less than a month and have seen results already.  </li>
            <li> I have been using HF37 a little over 2 weeks now,  </li>
            <li> In my experience with this product, I had NO SIGNIFICANT HAIR GROWTH.</li>
            <li> a lot of money for a little results</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little thicker and it looks jus</li>
            <li> a little bit Lon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For step two: Take on an empty stomach - which  mean you have to plan ahead of time when you are going to eat, typically an hour before you eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, drink milk and your hair will grow.</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money</li>
            <li> My hair was juuust at the base of my neck, (i cut it pixie short last sept and have been growing it back out agian since), and now its prob about 1/2 of an inch longer...</li>
            <li> and you HAVE to take them EVERYDAY...</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought these items a few weeks ago and although my hair has grown it&#x27;s not at the rate that I thought this product would help it grow faster at.  </li>
            <li> Hair was no longer than what it would of been if I didn&#x27;t waste money on this product.</li>
            <li> Plus, they don&#x27;t stink and aren&#x27;t messy.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t just a few zits either.</li>
            <li> I have no money to waste - step one</li>
            <li> i also help my hair along - by drinking lots of water and eating green leafy vegetables.</li>
            <li> I just received my pills a few days ago</li>
            <li> but I will in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have used these vitamins once before, a few months ago, and I took before and after pictures to document the difference.  </li>
            <li> but I took the vitamins everyday and my hair has grown about an inch in about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product, and it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Saw growth after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I had to stop before it killed.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money, so don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> but I had to stop using it cause I would break out in hives and and have trouble breathing and sleeping.</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous reviewer-DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> When you have curls this tightly coiled and this small, when they get tangled, there is no detangling.</li>
            <li> , I got some pretty bad scars on my face as a result of it.</li>
            <li> It was big, red, painful acne that was ALL over my face.</li>
            <li> which would have taken at least 2 and half months for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been faithfully taking the vitamins as directed for 2 months and have seen little to no results, at least to not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> and there is very LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR.</li>
            <li> I was not sure</li>
            <li> In the past, I have bought it to give my hair a boost to gain another inch or two.</li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t usually give reviews</li>
            <li> but ill hv to updated on my final results</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but when I took this, I had some reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product when trying to grow my hair past my shoulders; the damage from heat styling had been outpacing the growth.</li>
            <li> Ill buy the two pack next time.</li>
            <li> And for anyone who says its stupid, why not just take regular vitamins and they will work the same</li>
            <li> I am a black woman and my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to stay with the program because they are hard to digest.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and have had a problem with brittle and dull hair but with Hair Formula 37</li>
            <li> As my hair turned gray the texture changed (hard and brittle) and began to break off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to trim them at least 2x a week</li>
            <li> However, I was hoping to at least notice something.</li>
            <li> I plan to keep using it, or at least until my hair is at lengh that I can restyle it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product last year and it made my hair grow like crazy.</li>
            <li> I decided to try HF37 as I regretted cutting my hair short.</li>
            <li> There are some negative reviews about this product</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you&#x27;re wanting your hair to grow longer fast..I def recommend at least giving this a try.</li>
            <li> At least for me.</li>
            <li> Now that I am almost 32 I decided to try again after experiencing breakage and slow hair growth.  </li>
            <li> so my hair is always thick.</li>
            <li> Not very happy.</li>
            <li> ( I mean chunks at at time).</li>
            <li> These did and are not as expensive as the other stuff.</li>
            <li> And when I say your hair, I mean ALL of your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend hair formula 37 (step 1&amp;2) for those who are serious.</li>
            <li> subtle</li>
            <li> I do think it&#x27;s ridiculous to expect people to take 8 pills a day.</li>
            <li> I ended up with really bad nausea and stomach pains several hours after taking the vitamin.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> , it is very thin now and one part of my head grew a little</li>
            <li> It still breaks, for goodness sakes, and where is the hard nails that is also suppose to result from using these pills?!</li>
            <li> Taking the pills all day long wasn&#x27;t that bad...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to grow past my shoulders, I took biotin (which was useless), used shampoos and conditioners that were supposed to help stimulate hair growth, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it...</li>
            <li> Oh, and I sooooo mean that!  </li>
            <li> My hair has grown approximately one inch in one month.</li>
            <li> With this product I achieved a maximum growth rate and now my hair is leaving behind the accustomed lenght.</li>
            <li> they haven&#x27;t made my hair any worse and some people are saying it looks like it&#x27;s growing</li>
            <li> Poor me...</li>
            <li> By VIVISCAL!&lt;br /&gt;Victorias secret models use VIVISCAL</li>
            <li> but recently due to hormonal problems my hair started thinning and looked really bad, so</li>
            <li> its seriously a MISSION!  </li>
            <li> After drinking it a few hours later, I felt serious bad pain in my bone worst than arthritis.</li>
            <li> Tough it out if you want results!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> but if you want to grow longer faster then sorry to burst your bubble</li>
            <li> It was difficult to cover up with makeup and any face wash or mask did nothing for it.</li>
            <li> Not only did I deal with awful acne for about two months</li>
            <li> They were too expensive to throw out.  </li>
            <li> But all in all it is expensive for me to pay this monthly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical like me, please read...</li>
            <li> So whoever wanted a foot of longer hair within a month - you won&#x27;t get it because that&#x27;s unrealistic.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at least to a point where I don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> My hair grew on average 1/2- 1 inch a year, so with a horrible hair cut I was looking at years of misery.</li>
            <li> Sadly, my hair breaks off when trying to get out what are mostly impossible to untangle clumps.</li>
            <li> I have to keep cutting the growing side to match the side that will not grow.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product one month ago and my hair is growing like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, my urine is now a crazy  neon</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s driving me crazy ..</li>
            <li> It also made my nails grow like crazy.</li>
            <li> I tried it about a year ago because I was desperate for my hair to grow</li>
            <li> I also moisturize my hair a lot to prevent it from drying out &amp; work on getting lots of Iron and Iodine in my foods) and all of this despite the fact that i keep cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> (crazy -- i know)  </li>
            <li> $[...] bucks on fake vitamins!</li>
            <li> AND THE PILLS ARE SO DAMN EXPENSIVE!.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these for a couple weeks now and in my opinion, they are just EXPENSIVE GARBAGE!</li>
            <li> the smell was that bad.</li>
            <li> I didnt have any bad side effects.</li>
            <li> I broke out SO bad.</li>
            <li> I got really bad side effects.</li>
            <li> I got really sick.</li>
            <li> Every time I took this pill it would make me sick.</li>
            <li> I must warn you, if you try to take 2 at once or if you do NOT eat, you will be sick.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed because it</li>
            <li> Before I started using it my hair was falling out like crAzy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed because I was looking to strengthen and shine my hair, not grow my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I chopped off about 12 inches:(  </li>
            <li> Stopping the product was a stupid move on my part.  </li>
            <li> It is crap and doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I did try the shampoo and conditioner too but found it annoying standing around in the shower for the times it said on the bottles.</li>
            <li> there you have the truth, someone is so going to hate this review..</li>
            <li> It damaged my hair very bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing for the amount of money you spend on it, and the amount of pills you have to take daily(UGH!).</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am horrible at keeping on a pill poping schedule</li>
            <li> taste god awful.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you it is so annoying to take 8 pills a day!  </li>
            <li> I started using Formula 37 about 2 months ago after a horrible haircut.</li>
            <li> This product was awful.</li>
            <li> The worst part was the acne I got while taking this.</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> It smells horrible and for me if I didn&#x27;t eat</li>
            <li> It smells awful and taste awful, and the taste would stay in my mouth for hours.</li>
            <li> My scalp is the worst part</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> THIS ITEM IS REALLY GOOD AND IT WORKS. THE ONLY THING I DON&#x27;T LIKE ABOUT IT IS THAT IT REQUIRES YOU TO SWALLOW ALOT OF PILLS A DAY.</li>
            <li> This is truly an amazing product. Only 2 pills every morning. My hair was growing so fast that I had to stop and take a break because I didn&#x27;t want to dye my hair \\&quot;roots\\&quot; so frequently. I used it for 2 months on a row when I decided the growth was too fast for me to keep up with the color keeping. I&#x27;m taking a break to restart for another 2 months. My co-workers were seeing how it grew from one week to the next because the roots were showing up at an unstoppable rate. There were no side effects, only that my urine was a different tone of yellow. The ingridients are vitamins. I recommend for cancer patients who are re-growing hair or for someone trying to avoid the hassle of hair extensions. It takes longer time than the extensions but is your real hair and permanent.</li>
            <li> I used this product and all my hair fell out.  My hair is starting to grow back however, it is very thin now and one part of my head grew a little then it stopped growing period. I have to keep cutting the growing side to match the side that will not grow. This product ruined head and my self esteem.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a difference in growth, I&#x27;ve taken a month supply and my hair growth is average at half an inch, I&#x27;m going to try one more month to see if I notice a difference in growth.</li>
            <li> This is worthless and they say it&#x27;s refundable, until you read the fine print and realize it&#x27;s only if you bought the entire product line. It is crap and doesn&#x27;t do anything. Don&#x27;t waste your money, drink milk and your hair will grow. This does not work.</li>
            <li> I have been using HF37 a little over 2 weeks now,  I am a black woman with very short( natural) hair.  My hair was so short that it couldn&#x27;t even be braided into cornrows. I could honestly say that my hair has grown more than an inch since using this product and is braided into cornrows at this very moment.  I didn&#x27;t want to buy this product at first because I thought it was only for caucasian hairtypes (which usually grows faster than african american hairtypes)  But I decided to give it a try anyway&#x27;s.  I am extremely happy with the results I have already, can&#x27;t wait to see what wonders HF37 could do to my hair after a couple of months. I will definitly buy again to make sure I NEVER run out.  Thanks Hair Formula 37, I love you!!!</li>
            <li> I  have used this product on and off for the last 2-years.  I have notice that my hair grows faster when using this. Side effects is a warm sensation that dissipates not long after digestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: This product does deliver on its&#x27; promise, your hair will grow faster.&lt;br /&gt;The price is not bad for what you get ; a product that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The number of pills you have to take can be time a nuisance .&lt;br /&gt;The process of taking the pills can be time consuming.  i.e. For step One: Take 1 tablet in the morning and afternoon/ evening with a meal or snack. .. For step two: Take on an empty stomach - which  mean you have to plan ahead of time when you are going to eat, typically an hour before you eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend hair formula 37 (step 1&amp;2) for those who are serious. I just recently bought hair formula shampoo and conditioner because it was on sale. I have not noticed a difference when using the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I give this a 4/5 because of the process of taking the pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Thanks for reading and I hope this information was helpful to you **</li>
            <li> I have been using Formula 37 for almost a year and its great for my hair. My hair is long and healthy</li>
            <li> I am an African-American female and these pills did wonders for my hair.  My friends who hadn&#x27;t seen me in a while thought I was wearing a weave. My hair dresser noticed that difference in about 6 weeks.  My hair grew much, much faster and most important, it stopped breaking and shedding.  I stopped getting deep conditioners and special treatments.  I am very pleased with the pills.  The size are a slight chocking hazard and there are a lot of pills to take each day. I take the first set in the morning with breakfast and the second set at night before bed. Try it for 90 days and use it consistently, and I believe you will also see great results...stronger, longer, healthier hair.  I frequently read amazon reviews but seldomly write any, but felt compelled to write in case anyone had doubts and wanted a recent opinion.</li>
            <li> At first I was nervous about the 8 pills every day but it got me to drink a lot of water!!     I noticed a difference in hair length after only half the bottle! My hair growth was very noticeable - about 1-2 inches in half a month!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 1 month now. I am a multiracial female so there are not a lot of great products I have found out there for myself. So I gave this a try, my hair had started to really fall out( I mean chunks at at time). I didnt see results until about 2 weeks into taking the vitamins. After using this for a month my hair has really improved, not more falling out everytime I touch it! Which is great. I don&#x27;t know if it has grown any because I have not straighten it out yet because I used to do that alot, and it really damaged my hair. But so far so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 and deployed for 6 months. I purchased this product my frist month here in the hopes of growing my hair out longer for Christmas. I have been using this product for about 3 months now. I am horrible at keeping on a pill poping schedule so I&#x27;ve missed a day or two here and there. However my hair has grown nearly 1 1/2 inches. My hair grows dreadfully slow so for me thats something to be proud of especially in such a short period of time. Once I get back to the states I am going to order this product again because it actually worked for me. Unfortunately not ever product works for everyone. You have to keep in mind that you can&#x27;t continue to damage your hair and expect it to grow (the more you damage your hair the more you have to cut so you won&#x27;t see any results).</li>
            <li> PLEASE READ: I give it 5 stars for only using it a week. Everyone says my hair looks really healthy and shiny. I&#x27;m already starting to see the difference. But in order to receive results, you must follow the directions given. The only thing I have issues with is the smell/taste. It will make you gag &amp; I had no idea the smell was that bad. I saw no review that said anything about the smell. But keep in mind, they are still vitamins. They&#x27;re going to smell/taste god awful. But after a week, I&#x27;m used to it &amp; it definitely is worth taking with the results I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any difference, but I quit taking it after a month or so.  Maybe it needs longer to work.</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what I thought it would - nothing!  But honestly, I can&#x27;t blame anyone by myself.  There is no such thing as a magic pill that is going to make your hair grow.  I thought well if it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair, it will do something for my skin, and it didn&#x27;t.  It was a complete waste of money and I will NEVER make this mistake again.</li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff work, I had recently suffered a scary stress-related hair loss.  I had finally stopped coloring my hair, after almost 30 years of doing so, thinking; \\&quot;I&#x27;m just gonna accept me, the way I am, silver and all\\&quot;  and Holy Moly, my hair not only grew back, but grew back in my original Auburn !!!!  I&#x27;m buying 2 more orders today: a 6-month supply.</li>
            <li> I got allergic reaction, I tried it a couple of time after and just got worsen. My face was swollen and stomach pains. ( lasted 30min)  I stopped using it for2weeks, when started after my break from there pill, it happened again.  I know these pills works. I used it 3years ago and did wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product one month ago and my hair is growing like crazy.  Be aware though, it makes \\&quot;all\\&quot; your hair grow really fast.  It did not seem to affect my nails as much as other reviewers, but I am hoping it will soon.  I would recommend this product if you are looking to grow your hair long - fast.</li>
            <li> I havent seen any change in the growth of my hair it seems to be growing at its normal rate. I will not buy this product again it is a ripe off and is not worth the price that is being charged and you would think that if you have a good hair care regimen in place and are using these pills that you would see the growth that they guarantee.  Just a waste of money</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!! It really works for me. I felt the new growth pushing through my scalp after the first week. My hair feel thicker and healthier. It delivers on the promise. My only complaint is the size of the vitamins. It is hard for me to stay with the program because they are hard to digest. But they really do work great!!! My hair has grown approximately one inch in one month. Praise God!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work so much but I have been having some sort of allergic reaction to it. At first I just had red splotches on my face, and then a week later after taking it, my face flushed &amp; swelled, my arms flushed, tingled &amp; felt hot, my eyes starting swelling &amp; my tongue syarted tingling. I took benedryl &amp; the symptoms subsided.  I didn&#x27;t realize this was the cause til the next day when the same thing happened.&lt;br /&gt;My only known allergy is nickel in jewelry.</li>
            <li> I see a change in my hair... but it&#x27;s not good. Since using this product, my hair is now starting to break off. Furthermore, my urine is now a crazy  neon yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smh. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Insanely Awesome! I have had the same hair length for YEARS, something that most people find unbelievable. I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to grow past my shoulders, I took biotin (which was useless), used shampoos and conditioners that were supposed to help stimulate hair growth, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it...nothing ever worked for me. After reading the reviews on this product I decided to try it and I have been amazed at the results. My nails are growing insanely fast and strong- I&#x27;ve had to trim them at least 2x a week and my hair is noticeably thicker AND LONGER! Most hair products I&#x27;ve used only helped thicken my hair, but this is the 1st time I&#x27;ve used something that GROWS my hair. If you have difficulties getting your hair to grow past a certain length I highly recommended this product- I know it&#x27;s expensive and it&#x27;s a lot of pills to take in a day, but even after using this for only a month, the results have been definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It met my expectation because it&#x27;s actually working to make my hair growing fast for a month. This is my second pill bottle that I been using it. It&#x27;s amazing, I suggest you drink lots of water and more veggies will help your hair better. So I&#x27;m going to get my third pill bottle.</li>
            <li> I started taking these on July 1, so it&#x27;s only been a little over 2 weeks and already i&#x27;ve seen growth.  Even my boyfriend has noticed.  My hair was juuust at the base of my neck, (i cut it pixie short last sept and have been growing it back out agian since), and now its prob about 1/2 of an inch longer...subtle but i&#x27;ve noticed :-)    I had done a lot of research online to find vitamins that would encourage hair growth and the reviews from this product is what made me want to try it.  Although i was skeptical at first, i was hoping to see results but didn&#x27;t expect to notice anything so soon.  I have told all my friends about the vitamins and although its a kind of annoying to take so many pills a day in addition to my multi-vitamin, seeing results makes it worth it.      I take one Step 1 pill with two Step 2 pills every morning around 8 when i have my breakfast.  Then i take two more Step 2 pills around 2pm, followed by one Step 1 and two Step 2 pills at 8 in the evening...i try to divide it evenly so it stays in my system consistantly.    I will have to re-order another month supply of pills by next week so they will be by the time i finish this months bottles.  Take it from someone who&#x27;s idea of a \\&quot;review\\&quot; on Amazon is just stating whether i recieved the product by the date stated.  I wanted to share my experience so far for those people who were like me and unsure as to whether they should try it out.    I will come back and give another update in about a month...I cant wait to have my hair looooong again like it used to be before i chopped off 10 inches.</li>
            <li> Hi, &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a \\&quot;review\\&quot; person, but when I read the existing reviews, I felt like doing this. &lt;br /&gt;I used this product for 2 months and I must tell you that it really WORKS! &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hispanic-black woman (dominican) with relaxed fine hair and my hair grows normally, but only neck-chin lenght, no further than that. With this product I achieved a maximum growth rate and now my hair is leaving behind the accustomed lenght. &lt;br /&gt;I bought again the product to see how longer it can grows!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been completely sincere with you...I&#x27;m not a staffer of this product company, I&#x27;m a real and very happy user!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope this comment will be helpful for other women. I have only one last thing to say: Try it!!!! It worked for me...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these for about almost a month and I haven&#x27;t seen anything different.</li>
            <li> To start - I miss my hair. Last september I cut my hip length hair to mid back, and then in december to just at the shoulders, and then again to the chin in January - and from January through June I trimmed it regularly to keep it that length. (I&#x27;ve been getting rid of the henna that was in my hair - I couldn&#x27;t get it out via any other method tried except \\&quot;growing out\\&quot;). My hair grows kinda slow now too - it used to grow faster, but I suppose everything slows down the older you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last cut was late June - and it was at mid to upper neck length  - basically a little bit longer than the chin length cut, and then layered. That got rid of the really saturated henna&#x27;d hair - so I was ready to start growing it out. After much digging around online I came across hair 37 and all the reviews on it - both good and bad. I gave it a shot - got my pills in the first week of July and started taking them. Last night - maybe it was wishful thinking, but I noticed a difference in the hair length - it seemed it&#x27;d picked up a little length a little extra quickly - and then my boyfriend commented on it later that day. He knows I&#x27;ve been working to go back to my natural hair color - and there&#x27;s a noticeable demarcation line from the henna and the natural hair color. Last night he looked at me and said \\&quot;Hey wow - you&#x27;re hair&#x27;s really grown - I can see a half inch more of the roots! Wow - you&#x27;re hair is getting dark!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty pleased with that - not bad for just 2 weeks on the vitamins! I can&#x27;t wait to see how it is in another 2 weeks, come August - if I have another 1/2 inch to add to it, I will definitely be reordering these pills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a side note, from previous reviews and my own experience... it&#x27;s a lot of pills to take - but make sure you keep up with them every day. I find taken a stage one pill at morning and afternoon, and then dividing up the stage 2 pills into 3 doses of 2 pills throughout the day works very well.</li>
            <li> In my experience with this product, I had NO SIGNIFICANT HAIR GROWTH. Very disappointing for the amount of money you spend on it, and the amount of pills you have to take daily(UGH!). However, I gave it a two because while it didn&#x27;t grow my hair, it did change the texture of it. My natural hair is very coarse, and while using the HF37 it became really soft, silky and manageable. Nice, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for a hair vitamin to do. But as far as hair growth...ABSOLUTELY not recommending HF37 for that.</li>
            <li> I bought a 2 month supply of these (plus the herbal pills that can go with it)... its 10 pills a day!!! and you have to spread them out!  even without the &#x27;herbal helpers&#x27;, it would 8 pills a day... and you HAVE to take them EVERYDAY... i understand their concept (that your body can only absorb so many vitamins at one time...so they divide up the dosages to get the maximum absorbtion...)  but who has time for this stuff??  I don&#x27;t even work (stay at home mom)..and I couldn&#x27;t even remember to take all of them... some you can eat with and some can not... its seriously a MISSION!  I would rather just take 1 or 2 pilss a day, even if they don&#x27;t work as well..   HF37 does make the new hair look healthy.. but so does other vitamins.. i cannot say that this made my hair grow faster... only about 1/2 inch per month (which is the average hair gorwth rate, anyways!)    Won&#x27;t be buying this again... TOO MANY PILLS!!!!</li>
            <li> Well, my hair did not grow, I&#x27;ll say that from the very start.   I got these knowing that they&#x27;re not supposed to work the same for everyone  and that maybe my results would not be as advertised, but again, my hair   did not grow AT ALL, which is eve funny because my hair normally grows   somewhat fast.     The reason I give this a 3, is because after all they are still vitamins   and minerals that you body needs, and because, despite the fact that is   horrible having to be taking so many pills a day it helps with your water  drinking which is also good for you.     My hair however does feels stronger and shinier and is not falling anymore,   it was falling a lot and that was another thing i hoped the pills would solve   and they did solve that, also my nails grew a lot and are very strong.     So, if you decide to try this, do it with the understanding that i will not   work the same on everyone and that it may not do the wonders they say but it   will do some good on regards to the strength of your hair and scalp.   I may even get this again, to make sure my hair stops falling...</li>
            <li> I am a bi-racial woman (black/caucasian) fried my hair by repeated bleachings, colorings, and relaxers. To get back to healthy hair I basically had no choice but to shave it all off, Sinead O&#x27;Connor style.     I kept it in a pixie style, approx 1\\&quot; long all over for about a year before I decided that I wanted to grow it out. My hair is very curly, very thick, and growing it out was akward and hard to keep it looking good. Once it was around 4\\&quot; long, I started looking for something to help it grow faster. I found HF37 in December 07 and started taking just the pills. Please note that I do get the ends of my hair trimmed every three months, or as needed. I also baby it to protect it. No supplement will work on your hair if you don&#x27;t take good care of it in conjunction with the growth treatment.     Now 16 months later, my hair is waist length, healthier and stronger than I can ever remember it being, and people are astounded at how fast it grew and how beautiful it is. I think i&#x27;m done growing my hair out, but will continue taking the pills for the other benefits. My skin and nails look great and overall the pills make me feel more healthy. I think there were some nutrient deficiencies in my diet that these are helping to fix as well. Just recently switched up my monthly auto-ship with the actual HF37 company to include the shampoo and conditioner. They smell great and left my hair so soft and easy to comb, and my scalp very clean.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my hair growth and i took the pills as recommended.  Let me tell you it is so annoying to take 8 pills a day!  I have a life! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend, I wasn&#x27;t hoping for a miracle given the ingredients are vitamins and amino acids and I already was taking vitamins and eating extremely well. However, I was hoping to at least notice something. I have used for about 6 months since I had bought a package but will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly not one to take time and write a review, but I will.... I&#x27;ve used the other vitamins posted here and therefore feel my comparisons have been thorough. Hair Formula works the BEST. Yes, it is a bit tedious to take so many vitamins throughout the day - but once you&#x27;re in the habit, you don&#x27;t even think about it.    It not only makes your hair grow, but makes your nails fabulous! It reminds me of the intense results of taking pre-natal vitamins and how my hair and nails grew agressively when I was pregnant with my daughter.    Human hair grows only 1/4 an inch each month. Mine has grown a full 1/2 inch each month. This is a wonderful product! For anyone who claims it is not, I&#x27;m convinced they did not take it regularly. The shampoo and conditioner are great too.     For as long as I&#x27;ve been taking the product, my naturally blonde - very curly hair - which means it is naturally dry and weak - has become stunning and looooong.     Thanks for reading and enjoy the product!</li>
            <li> I started using Formula 37 about 2 months ago after a horrible haircut. My hair grew on average 1/2- 1 inch a year, so with a horrible hair cut I was looking at years of misery. I didn&#x27;t notice much for the first month but it has now grown about 1 inch!. Amazing. And for anyone who says its stupid, why not just take regular vitamins and they will work the same are completly wrong, to take the same vitamins that are in just one tablet, you&#x27;d be looking at having to buy your own pharmacy almost. I did try the shampoo and conditioner too but found it annoying standing around in the shower for the times it said on the bottles. I plan to keep using it, or at least until my hair is at lengh that I can restyle it.</li>
            <li> a few years ago i cut my hair to above my shoulders.  that was fine for a short while but then it got to that stage where you can&#x27;t put it in a ponytail and it gets in the way.  i was skeptical at first but i used these pills and they really did work fast.  in about three months, my hair was twice as long.  i am a caucasian woman in my early 20&#x27;s with straight hair.  i&#x27;ve never tried the shampoo or conditioner in this line, but the pills worked great.  plus, they have vitamins in them that are benefitial for other things too.   &lt;br /&gt;i recommend it.  if you&#x27;re concerned about the money back thing, i&#x27;d call to order and ask them what the details are about that.</li>
            <li> Not sure how they are working yet, I am on my third bottle .. I have hair growth issues my hair won&#x27;t grow passed a certain length it&#x27;s driving me crazy .. I am a hairdresser and I have compared the ingredients to many other hair growth vitamins on Amazon and these definitely have the best numbers .. So I am continuing to take them as a multivitamin until I see results .. they haven&#x27;t made my hair any worse and some people are saying it looks like it&#x27;s growing so hopefully it&#x27;s doing something ! Patience patience patience !!</li>
            <li> Came earlier than what i expected two thumbs up! (:</li>
            <li> BEWARE!! This product causes weight gain!! I used this product for a month and I gained almost 15 pounds!! I read reviews from other sites about this product and a lot of people had the same issue. It did not make my hair grow any faster. It did, however, make my hair feel soft and smooth, but it is not worth the weight gain.</li>
            <li> I must confess that I am taking a combination of vitamins besides this.  I&#x27;ll come back to that later.  I used to take Hairtopia [[ASIN:B0002AAMYM HairTopia Total (Vitamins, Amino Acids &amp; Herbal)]]  and when comparing that to Hair Formula 37, I noticed that there is a higher concentration of supplements in HF37.  While it is a pain dividing the vitamins you have to take without meals(Hairtopia was easier to take), the results are worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had just cut my hair two weeks ago--it was chin length-- and now it nearly reaches my shoulders.  I didn&#x27;t notice because I look at myself every day so I didn&#x27;t see a difference.  It was other people noticing that convinced me that this works.  The most repeated comment is that my hair looks thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others here, I have also experienced nail growth which pleases me immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the other vitamins I am taking.  I take Nettle Root [[ASIN:B00068UC04 Nettle Root 500 Mg 100 Caps]] three times a day.  I started taking Phyto Phytophanere [[ASIN:B0018DYHJS Phyto Phytophanere Dietary Supplements for Hair and Nails (120 Caplets) EXPIRES July 2010]] as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you decide to do to increase your hair growth, I wish you luck.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about six months ago from doing some online research.  I had cut my hair really short (Think Halle Berry in Die Another Day), and I suddenly wanted my hair back.  I had begun to take this vitamin, and while my hair didn&#x27;t grow at the rate that most people claim, it did grow faster.  I also wear one of those hair bonnets that have the grow stuff in them at night, and that helped A LOT!  I don&#x27;t break up the doses (just because I will forget and don&#x27;t feel like it), so I take all six tablets at bedtime.  But another benefit that I got from this vitamin is that I no longer have acne.  This vitamin made my skin literally bump-free!  My family has even asked me about my skin, and I told them about my hair vitamins!  Now, I&#x27;m just working on the spots that are there from past acne, but my face is completely acne free.  The longer I take them, the better it gets.  I tried the hair vitamins in the purple jar (also on amazon) and they are still sitting on my dresser collecting dust.  I&#x27;m a HF37 girl for life!</li>
            <li> This product had no affect on my hair. It is a waste of money. Not even worth one half of a star.</li>
            <li> Did not use the vitamins however I did use the shampoo and conditioner. my hair was very glossy and shiny!! Thicker more manageable. I used heat styling on my hair often and noticed less hair falling. No perfume scent. This was 3 years ago. I&#x27;m going to try it again.</li>
            <li> They REALLY WORK‼️My hair is growing..I Iove them ..</li>
            <li> I have no one to blame but myself for shelling out so much money thinking there was a magical pill to make my hair grow.  I used their entire line for almost a year and got very little results.  I will say that it did cause me to gain weight (all the protein you&#x27;re pouring into your body along with other things...6 pill a day practically). I started taking these and only weighed 109 lbs....just 4-months into it I weighed in at 125 lbs!!  They don&#x27;t work pure and simple..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on month 5 definetly have noticed growth but not as much as I thought</li>
            <li> I bought this product really hoping it would work and I didn&#x27;t see ANY results AT ALL! I was so disappointed because it isn\\&quot;t easy to watse $[...] bucks on fake vitamins! Gosh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better results with much cheaper vitamins so... I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and wouldn&#x27;t really recommend... but different mixtures work differently for people.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product last year and it made my hair grow like crazy. I am a black woman and my hair is very thick. This product made me go back to the salon 3 weeks after getting a relaxer to get the new growth touched up. It also made my nails grow like crazy. I had to cut them every three days. Well I didn&#x27;t order anymore and I noticed immediately that my hair didn&#x27;t grow as fast. I tried another less expensive product that made my hair grow but not as fast. I am considering joinig their membership club on their website that gives you a reduced price and free shipping if you sign up for a 6 or 12-month commitment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done with the viatmins and even that I took  them as directed, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in my hair and/or nails.</li>
            <li> In September I got a victoria bob (disgusting on me) very nice on other ppl. The point is that i bought these because of the amazing positive reviews. I took them the way i was suppose to which is a lot of damd pills each day but whatever helps i will do. The results arent magical. My hair definitely became fuller, it didnt grow a lot faster then the normal rate for me. My hair grows fast naturally, i just expected magic i guess. I thought that if ppl that have a problem with growing long hair think this product is the best thing since french fries, then since i dont have a problem in that area it would double the lenght in no time. The point is that if you have thining hair, it deff works. but if you want to grow longer faster then sorry to burst your bubble but this is not your product. Drink lots of water, veggies and fruits, excersise and you will not only see a difference in hair but also skin and nails. its the only thing that i found trully magical.</li>
            <li> I just ordered the Hair Formula 37 for the 3rd time now. My hair is growing soooooo much faster now and I&#x27;m not losing any hair. Before I started using it my hair was falling out like crAzy! If I ran my fingers through it the hair would just keep coming out. NOW nothing comes out and my hair is so healthy looking, I even have a little bit of \\&quot;new\\&quot; hair growth. My eyebrows have even filled back in finally (I&#x27;m 44 yrs old)I have not had excess or new growth to other parts of my body only my hair and eyebrows and they haven&#x27;t broke my face out. (even at my age I still have problems with that, lol) I don&#x27;t bleach my hair but I do have it colored, I don&#x27;t use a blowdryer or a iron on it and my hair stylist never wants to trim it because he says I never have any split ends ~ so they must be doing something good because nObody has ever said that to me before!</li>
            <li> These really work! My hair doesn&#x27;t grow very fast and just the first two weeks of taking these my hair grew almost 1/2 an inch. I just reordered and bought the Shampoo and Conditioner and the herbal booster as well as the the step one and step two vitamins. I do take the vitamins as directed about every 3 hours.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I found a product that works, and works beyond anything I would have expected.  My niece brought the product and after a month she raved to me about it and how long and thick her hair grew.  I am black with nutty short hair.  Both my niece and I wear hair weaves.  I bought the product, used just the shampoo and conditioner once a week for two months and when I took my hair weave out after these two months, my hair is a lot longer and thicker.  My short hair is down to my neck.  I really don&#x27;t need a hair weave anymore!!!   Now I&#x27;m thinking of putting my hair back into the hair weave for another two months and take the vitamins as well.  This is no joke, this product really, really works!!!  I am sooooo amazed at my results!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 years old and had a receding hairline.  Now, I have hair in those places.  It took about a month to see results.</li>
            <li> I bought these items a few weeks ago and although my hair has grown it&#x27;s not at the rate that I thought this product would help it grow faster at.  It&#x27;s been about the same as if i&#x27;d never taken them before.  HOWEVER...I did find that I had more energy, more strength and the afternoon 2:00 pm drift offs were gone from my body once I started taking them.  I did notice that my nails grew fast and I&#x27;ve had to trim them down (or bite them off) several times over the past week. I just received the hair shampoo and conditioner so we&#x27;ll continue to watch and see what happens.  Taking the pills all day long wasn&#x27;t that bad...they had no taste and no aftertaste that part was okay for me...watching and waiting!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Makes my urine really yellow.</li>
            <li> It works well even though I actually take half of what it tells me to take.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product &amp; will indeed suggest it to others ! I haven&#x27;t quite finished the bottles, but I can tell that the product is working because I have some serious new-growth already ! :)</li>
            <li> Several years ago I used Hair Formula37 and experienced fast growing, strong, healthy hair while taking this supplement.  At the time I was 20 - 21. Now that I am almost 32 I decided to try again after experiencing breakage and slow hair growth.  After having a baby at 30 my hair has changed, so I was hoping for some assisstance with these vitamins.  Instead of healthy hair I ended up with really bad nausea and stomach pains several hours after taking the vitamin.  It was as if my body could not break down a specific substance in the supplement. After one week with the vitamins, the symptoms did not go away, so I stopped taking them. Even taking with food did not make a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been taking the Hair formula for about 3 weeks now, and I can see the difference already.  I think I&#x27; Going to love this product.</li>
            <li> Bell Harrah is so right! This things is indeed garbage! I have been using this things since March 9, 2005 and there is very LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN MY HAIR. It still breaks, for goodness sakes, and where is the hard nails that is also suppose to result from using these pills?! It makes me wonder what the hell this thing is doing to my body, as it has not helped my hair and this month of May makes it 4 months I have been using. YOU&#x27;RE SUPPOSE TO SEE SOME HUGE CHANGES WITHIN A MONTH TO 45 DAYS, AND NOT ONE DAMN THING HAS HAPPENED!!!!!!!!! AND THE PILLS ARE SO DAMN EXPENSIVE!. i really don&#x27;t have $57 to throw a way a month, so when you spend that amount of money you are really hoping that something will work. I agree with the previous reviewer-DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Hair Formula 37 vitamins for hair are top class 2 step 1&#x27;s with food 6 step 2&#x27;s without food. I tried it for three days and bingo it works. People out there who wants faster hair growth buy this product, it&#x27;s ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. Thanks Salonweb for great products and keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> There is no other hair vitamin on the market that works like this does.  I bought this and in 10 days my hair transformed.  Bottom line 17 days 1 1/2 inch growth 5 days softer hair, no breakouts and longer stronger nails.  I am an African American woman with relaxed 3c hair that usually goes and does overall well, but this vitamin made my hair better than any other time in my life..yes it&#x27;s true women it works.  I was not sure so because of the costs I stopped taking them...well my hair still grew about 1/2 inch/month and returned to its shedding breaking state.  I learned my lesson and have joined the 12 month membership. $40/month is a small price to pay for gorgeous hair, skin and nails!!</li>
            <li> Great deal for something that doesn&#x27;t work. Purchased and kept to the regime of taking the pills in different time frames. Drank a ton of water and after the bottles were done, no real change in hair growth. Hair was no longer than what it would of been if I didn&#x27;t waste money on this product. Do NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Work great but smell awful...lol! Tough it out if you want results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on month two and I&#x27;m starting to feel hair growth, I will buy again, and the shipping was extremely fast! I got ,y vitamins in three to four days after I ordered standard shipping. Now that&#x27;s what I like! I eat high protein everyday so that could be helping. Will post pictures soon</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins. They make my hair look like a wig. I&#x27;ve been using them for 4 months. My hair has grown about 2 inches but has filled in immensely and has more volume. I have naturally curly baby fine blonde hair. I had 4 kids in 5 years and my hair was getting thinner &amp; thinner daily and my hairline was receding.  This brought my hairline back. I noticed a change within the first week of taking these. My only suggestion, if you can start these on a long weekend. My scalp got really greasy the first week of taking these but I think it&#x27;s because it was making my hair healthy. I&#x27;ve tried everything from funky hair promoting shampoo and conditioner, hair tonics, Rogaine, and handfuls of b vitamins with amino acids. Nothing seemed to work. These did and are not as expensive as the other stuff. Plus, they don&#x27;t stink and aren&#x27;t messy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a lot of hair growth..maybe added thickness. Probably another month of supplements and I could see more visible growth.</li>
            <li> I purchased these in late October and took them for 3 months straight. Twice a day like the directions say. My hair grew the same amount it usually does and I didn&#x27;t notice any extra. It did however make my hair feel softer and more shiny. It also made me feel better physically. Other than the fluorescent yellow urine I didnt have any bad side effects. The only thing im not sure about is when i started taking these i weighed 115lbs and i am now 125lbs. I have no idea if these can cause weight gain or not but it was the only new thing i was taking.</li>
            <li> This is the third time that I have bought Hair Formula 37 over the years, but my first experience with the new, advanced formulation. In the past, I have bought it to give my hair a boost to gain another inch or two. I always have fast results, at an inch per month, which is twice my usual growth rate. Poor me...I&#x27;ve always having one hair disaster or another. I am black, but I don&#x27;t have a typical black curl pattern. My hair is chemical free and has been for a little over two years now. I have natural, tiny, spongy coils. They are really beautiful. I love them so much, but the downside is, that my hair tangles easier than ever. When you have curls this tightly coiled and this small, when they get tangled, there is no detangling. Sadly, my hair breaks off when trying to get out what are mostly impossible to untangle clumps. So I lost half of my length over most of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Formula 37 to the rescue! From just one 30-day supply, my hair is almost back to where it was before breaking off. It&#x27;s at least to a point where I don&#x27;t hate it. I love it! It&#x27;s fuller and I can do more with the front of my hair again. I&#x27;m able to frame my face, which I love doing. I&#x27;ll be ordering some more real soon, because you really can&#x27;t beat the results that this product gives you. It may not give the same growth rate for all, but if you use it as instructed, you WILL see results. As an added bonus...this third time around, these vitamins have actually made my nails grow to a gorgeous length. Over the years, I read other peoples&#x27; reports of nail growth, but up till now, it only helped my hair and that was fine with me. But now that my nails look so pretty, I&#x27;m super excited that HF37 has given them they boost they needed too. I&#x27;ve actually been out of my vitamins for a few weeks now and yet, my nails are still growing strong. I need to polish them more often because of the new growth. But I don&#x27;t mind. They look wonderful. :D</li>
            <li> Best hair growth pills I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li> This product was awful. I tried it about a year ago because I was desperate for my hair to grow and I read quite a few good reviews about it. So I spent the $50 on it and started taking it. To begin with, it was such a hassle taking 6-8 pills a day (I don&#x27;t remember the exact amount). All of the reviews I read said they saw noticeable growth within a week or two. I didn&#x27;t see any at all - throughout the month or ever after. The worst part was the acne I got while taking this. I broke out SO bad. It wasn&#x27;t just a few zits either. It was big, red, painful acne that was ALL over my face. It was difficult to cover up with makeup and any face wash or mask did nothing for it. I didn&#x27;t realize it was these pills causing it until I stopped and the acne mostly cleared up within a couple weeks. Not only did I deal with awful acne for about two months, I got some pretty bad scars on my face as a result of it. I would not recommend this product to anyone. There are plenty of natural remedies you can use to help your hair grow.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I would recommend this product. However, please be aware that this product has a side effect of a warm sensation upon ingestion. But, it soon disappears. I did notice hair growth with my first bottle. I have purchase a second bottle to see what happens!!!</li>
            <li> I had the original 2 step formula that was awesome that when i saw the new formula almost 50% off I had to jump on it.</li>
            <li> they did not work as I expected them to.</li>
            <li> its been  about 3 weeks or so, my hair is much longer then i had it.&lt;br /&gt;This vitamin works very fast with no side affect, love,love,love.&lt;br /&gt;I take just 2 pills a day with food is best! and i take one pic every Sunday. i started with my hair on my neck, 3 weeks later my hair is on my back of my bra line!!! I am very happy with hair formula 37...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for close to a month and there has been NO change /: I also have the herbal booster AND shampoo. Not very happy.</li>
            <li> First of all, I had heard of the product and ordered a 6month supply last year out of curiosity, but used them about 3 times but not consistently. Just too much pills to take for me. I didn&#x27;t want to throw them out, so I just kept them there. Last month I added braids to my hair (not for a long time either)and they looked really good. But they did a whole lot of damage to my hair. When I took them out and went to wash my hair the hair was everywhere in the tub I had to take it by the handfuls and put it in the garbage - it was literally like straw really dry and as you pull on the hair they just came on out; (it looked really dry and was very brittle)  so i decided to cut the hair. I cut off 4 inches and left it just at my collar bone on the 7th of this month( August) after it was washed and dried, but not with formula 37 products.  On the 10th I decided to cut it again, (  I trimmed it just above the collar bone) and this time i started to use the products. Shampoo conditioner, and pills. They were too expensive to throw out.  On the 20th I noticed that my hair had stopped shedding excessively and looked much shinier and was easier to manage. (It was really damaged) no hair came out at all during combing &amp; that&#x27;s when i realized that the quality of it was improving &amp; my hair had grown 2 inches in 10 days.  I still can&#x27;t believe it but i&#x27;m looking right at the evidence. I don&#x27;t know if it will continue at the rate it&#x27;s been growing at, but the results so far have been very positive, i have no complaints. since there are so many pills to take i take 3 of step 2 pills twice a day morning and evening. I have no money to waste - step one is no problem for me.My skin is a lot cleaner and brighter and feels much softer, but it&#x27;s only about day 15/16 . Will come back on Nov 15 to mention any further results from the product whether positive or negative.       Now it&#x27;s January, and my hair has grown significantly although i do have problems - which i never realized before.(iron deficiency and also thyroid problems which both of these conditions thins the hair out and makes it really brittle. i also help my hair along - by drinking lots of water and eating green leafy vegetables. I also moisturize my hair a lot to prevent it from drying out &amp; work on getting lots of Iron and Iodine in my foods) and all of this despite the fact that i keep cutting my hair. I honestly can&#x27;t tell you how much my hair has grown because sometimes i clip my hair 3 times a month. (crazy -- i know)  But the product really works although i&#x27;m not as consistent as i should be.  ranuka</li>
            <li> I have used Hair Formula 37 hair vitamins and amino&#x27;s for several months.  I have noticed a difference in the texture of my hair.  My hair is more healthy and shiner than it has been in a long time.  I am over 50 and have had a problem with brittle and dull hair but with Hair Formula 37 my hair is silkier with longer lasting shine between washing.</li>
            <li> During the winter my hair is very dry and this product has helped my hair to have much less breakage and shedding.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user and I am about to finish my one month supply, but have not notice any changes yet. I just re-order  a  second order and hope I will be able to give a better review.  I&#x27;ve used Step I, Step ll, and the booster vitamins. Have not yet met my expectation..</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all.  My hair didn&#x27;t grow anymore than it normally grows and to top it all off, it gave me a horrible upset stomach every time I took the pills. DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> I took these pills for two months in order to give it a true chance.    You take 8 pills a day, for me I would try to space them apart by 4 hours each set.     The company promises double growth rate. Since I grow only 1/4\\&quot; per month this would equate to 1/2\\&quot; per month. After two months I can say thats exactly what I got, one inch of growth.    For me paying $50 a month for this is borderline worth it lol. I say borderline because I would rather have a half inch then what I was getting. But all in all it is expensive for me to pay this monthly. Taking 8 pills a day is hard, especially when you are out doing something, I would sometimes miss a dose.    Will I buy them again? I am off to try new supplements and if they dont get me the same amount of growth I will be back!</li>
            <li> It really works but after using it I had hair loss</li>
            <li> This contains a bunch of soy, weird coating, and most importantly, did nothing for my hair.  Try the Phyto supps.</li>
            <li> Awful! Will not purchase again!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my 15 year old granddaughter.&lt;br /&gt;She was not happy with taking 6 pills a day,&lt;br /&gt;Especially at school; they would not let her take them</li>
            <li> I used these pills in the past and I measured my hair at the beginning and end of each month on several places around me head to see how well this worked just to be objective and to see for my self if it was worth ordering again in the future. I had a full inch of growth each month which is a lot and my hair was strong and thick. I stopped taking them for a while but recently due to hormonal problems my hair started thinning and looked really bad, so I ordered them again and started taking them recently. You need to wait till the end of the second month to start seeing results, and it helps to take the multiple doses at the same time every day. But these pills do work, I am speaking from experience.</li>
            <li> I gave this vitamin a try with little hope even after reading all these good reviews about it. I really did think its a another scam and i wasnt really sure if the good reviews were real or fake, if someone is doing it to advertise it more. I bought this 3 weeks ago and im from kent uk. It has worked. I had dyed my hair brown, and i can see my natural hair colour black growing out in the root, like about 2 inch of hair. It does take 2 3 weeks but it does work, i cant gurantee for everyone but it has worked on me and im happy with the result.</li>
            <li> I decided to try HF37 as I regretted cutting my hair short. After 1 week I noticed a difference in the appearance in my hair; my hair became smoother &amp; thicker; with a lot less hair fall. My finger nails also started to grow longer and stopped splitting &amp; chipping; that alone made me buy another 6 month supply- I have never been able to grow lovely long &amp; strong fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;Initially I felt my hair wasn&#x27;t growing as I couldn&#x27;t see much of a difference but after the first 4 weeks I went from hair at my jawline to now almost to my shoulders so I&#x27;m absolutely stoked with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> Ive never used this but does this stuff make you gain weight? Im a black girl. My hair is at my shoulders ,how long do you think it will take to get to the middle of my back? please reply</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if my hair is growing or not, when I first got the bottle of 💊 I started it rite away. So I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend of mine who wanted thicker hair</li>
            <li> I really like it! It&#x27;s working on me. I wanna buy another one or two more. My hair es shine too</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical like me, please read...There are some negative reviews about this product and I understand it wont work for everyone. I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews but felt obligated to on this one. Ladies, if you&#x27;re wanting your hair to grow longer fast..I def recommend at least giving this a try. This has truly been a blessing for me! My hair has been the same length for over 15 YEARS. I&#x27;ve tried sooo many products &amp; treatments on my hair to help it grow longer..not even caring about how long it would take. None of them ever worked at all! I did some research and found this product. I was VERY skeptical of course considering everything I&#x27;ve ever tried did nothing but disappoint me, but after reading some good reviews I decided to try it. OMgoodness I am SOOO glad I did!! I thought I was tripping when I noticed my hair looked a little longer after the first week, but then after two weeks, the difference was undeniable! Some of my co-workers, family &amp; friends thought I got extensions. There&#x27;s also a HUGE difference in the texture of my hair! (I am multi-racial with thick, coarse and frizzy hair) So when I tell you my hair is soft, shiny and less frizzy..that&#x27;s saying A LOT! lol. Not all things work for everybody, but I can honestly tell you if it works for me, TRY IT! Because it&#x27;s the only thing that has. I have used it for two years now and my hair is down my back. I am not affiliated with this company or amazon or whoever, I&#x27;m just an honest satisfied customer! The only downfall I can say is the quantity of pills you have to take every day. What works for me is taking 4 in the morning after breakfast, and 4 after dinner. (That&#x27;s step 1 &amp; 2. I haven&#x27;t tried the herbal boosters)</li>
            <li> I am taking those for almost 2 weeks now, I haven&#x27;t notice my hair growing faster yet, but I did not had any problems with pimples or other skin irritations like some reviews said.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully in 4-6 weeks I will notice improvement in my hair grown</li>
            <li> I have almost taken for a month now....took me til now to see that my hair,skin,&amp; nails are looking great! So i will continue for 30 more days, will post again. The only down fall is sooo many pills, but once you get in the routine &amp; have set your times of when your going to take it, it&#x27;s not to bad.</li>
            <li> Wow, I usually get a perm every six weeks do to how thick my hair is . I am a black girl who has Indian texture from my fathers side of the family so my hair is always thick. For the two weeks I was taking this , I had to go back WAY early ! I was surprised as to how much new growth there was and so was my hair dresser ! I love how this product makes my hair stronger I&#x27;m texture and in length. It&#x27;s almost at the end of my neck and it started right below my ears ! I am in love with hair formula 37 !&amp;#60;3 Thaankyou!</li>
            <li> I just received my pills a few days ago so I don&#x27;t have results to pay yet but I will in a few weeks.  I was so happy that these were delivered a day early, that&#x27;s great business.  Also my boyfriend is a nurse and he looked at the ingredients and told me I chose a very good pill, a lot of great things for the body (skin, nails, hair,  etc.) Off to a great start.  Will update soon :)</li>
            <li> This item works wonders. It does just what it said it would do &#x27;Grows hair fast&#x27;! I have been using this product for over a month and I can already see a difference. My hair is longer and thicker. I definelty recommend this product to others who have trouble with thinning hair or even for those who just want longer fast growing hair.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference in using this product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference with my hair but my nails did grow significantly faster and looked 10 times healthier. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed because I was looking to strengthen and shine my hair, not grow my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, there were no side effects. I do think it&#x27;s ridiculous to expect people to take 8 pills a day. With the lack of research, I was then too worried to take my actual vitamins, other supplements, or painkillers on top of the 8 pills.</li>
            <li> For years I have been wanting my hair to grow and it took forever. I noticed a change once I started taking these vitamins and I am in love! My friends noticed a change and I got them into it. Recommend this for anyone. You do need to swallow 8 pills but if you really want it you won&#x27;t have an issue because its worth it.</li>
            <li> I have taken 5 of these horse pills 3x a day for 3 weeks now. These pills are enormous. I was excited by all the great Amazon reviews so I hung in there. My hair has not grown at all. I will certainly not be ordering them again. I can not wait until I finish the bottles since I committed to finishing them all. I think its only fair that I share this opinion since it was the rave reviews that got me into this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summery: Big pills, taken too often, no growth, thumbs down, waste of $, GAG!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting Married in May, and I want nice long hair for my wedding... so I looked online and this seemed hopeful, and I ordered two months worth. I knew ahead of time that my average hair growth was about a half an inch a month. But After only two weeks of taking the vitamins and shampoo daily, my hair had grown half an inch (what my hair normally grows in a month). And after taking it for over four weeks, my hair has grown over an inch!!!!! so it&#x27;s doubled my average growth rate, and that&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for. I only apply the shampoo and conditioner on my roots alone and let sit for about three minutes before washing out. A hair dresser said i could take regular biotin capsules instead of these vitamins(for a lot cheaper)and does as good....but I&#x27;m not so sure i want to risk losing my inch per month. It&#x27;s up to you! but hair formula DOES work! Good Luck!</li>
            <li> Shipping was on time. My fiancè said he can feel it working once he started taking these pills, fast results and hes only been taking them for 2 or 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product, my expectations were met and I don&#x27;t regret this purchase. Happy I bought it. AJW</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in hair growth.</li>
            <li> Hey guys. So I have been contemplating trying HF37 for YEARS now. I finally decided to buy some of the pills. My conclusion: this thing actually works. At least for me. I started seeing results after the first month. The only prob I have with it is that I dont see where its FDA approved :-/ maybe Im not looking hard enough but I dont see that. Other than that, this thing works perfectly for me</li>
            <li> Hair Formula 37 is a wonderful product. It truly does speed hair growth. When combined with healthy eating and proper hair care, your hair will grow, but it will grow strong. I chose this product because as a woman that wanted natrual results I thought that this would work...I was right. As women we go through so many hormonal inbalances, that our hair suffers as a result. This product will increase hair strenghth and growth with consistant  ( that is the key being consistant and patience).</li>
            <li> i order this for a friend who lost all hair hair and now she has 4.5 inches of hair ..real great product!!!</li>
            <li> I got my hair buzzed (female), this product didn&#x27;t cause any noticeable increase in hair length. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and my hair hasn&#x27;t even grown an inch. This product is a 30-day supply of 180step two+60step one pills. Go to their website rather than order off amazon to find more information.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible and for me if I didn&#x27;t eat I got really sick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had somewhat shorter hair, but when my friend got cancer I started growing it out to donate it. Once my hair got about shoulder length it just stopped growing. It stayed that length for over a year. I tried Formula 37 vitamins, and Formula 37 GROW! shampoo and conditioner. (I was taking vitamins beforehand and continued my old vitamins along with these). I was skeptical but willing to try almost anything. Within days my hair felt stronger and healthier. After 2 weeks there was noticeable growth (about 2 inches). The step 2 says take 6 times a day, but I take 2 3 times a day instead.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been taking them that long but they actually work. The fact that you have to take so many is really annoying. They are so big that you can barely swallow them but my hair and nails have grown. This is the 7th of December and I&#x27;ve only been taking them since November.</li>
            <li> I ordered my third bottle because I&#x27;ve noticed how my hair just all together feels healthier and thicker. I&#x27;m constantly trimming my hair from split ends because it&#x27;s so many different layers , but I&#x27;ve noticed even the shortest length of my hair which is below my shoulders , has been growing. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s grown as much as I&#x27;d like it to - but because hair formula 37 makes it feel so much healthier , I will continue to use this product ! And I&#x27;ve also heard from many many people , once you start a new supplement - you have to give it at least a good 3 months to notice a significant difference . So whoever wanted a foot of longer hair within a month - you won&#x27;t get it because that&#x27;s unrealistic.</li>
            <li> This product definitely helped my hair grow more quickly than normal.  I have used these vitamins once before, a few months ago, and I took before and after pictures to document the difference.  I want to grow my hair out so that I can get it all back to its natural color, and my roots actually help me see how much these vitamins help my hair grow!  While I was taking the vitamins, it did not seem like the growth was that dramatic, but after a month, there was clear growth.  I am looking forward to using this product again.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money this product requires you to take like 6 of each pill per day I mean please what a scam have you ever been more ripped off in yr life? By VIVISCAL!&lt;br /&gt;Victorias secret models use VIVISCAL and I&#x27;m a hairdresser, so there you have the truth, someone is so going to hate this review.. it&#x27;s honest..</li>
            <li> I have started taking this since July 6 so it&#x27;s been 5 days and I&#x27;ve seen wonderful results. My hair is soft and silky, more manageable and I wake up literally frizz free. I can&#x27;t comment on the growth yet because it&#x27;s still too early to tell but so far so good. I don&#x27;t really mind the number of pills, I do split them up and take them from the time I wake up and once more before I go to bed. I also want to add the fact that I have not changed anything else in my routine while taking this so it has to be these pills. This is my first review on amazon ever!</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of cutting about 3 inches of my hair off it not a little more and completely regretting it the very next day. So I started searching and searching for products to help make my hair grow faster. I bought this with the shampoo and the conditioner and I did not like the shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo was watery and and conditioner didn&#x27;t do much for my hair but I took the vitamins everyday and my hair has grown about an inch in about 6 weeks. That is a lot my sister has been trying to grow her hair out as well and mine is growing way faster than hers. These work awesome you just have to make sure you take them everyday and wait to see results they won&#x27;t show up overnight. But 6 weeks isn&#x27;t very long for an inch of new hair growth. I just dyed my hair and am starting another round of vitamins we will see how much my hair grows by the time I finish this set.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually give reviews but I must say this product really works ! Not only did my hair become thicker but my eyebrows got longer and thicker. I received comments from my hair dresser and my facial tech that wax my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Great! Only con is the taste is not good.</li>
            <li> I have just started using Hair 37.  I have done a lot of research on hair growth and condition, this product caught my eye because of all the vitamins packed in it and because you take it twice a day.  The vitamins listed are much the same as those found in a prenatal vitamin, which made my hair amazing!  Thank you too for the free shipping, that is definitely an added bonus!!</li>
            <li> My hair is starting to grow and it&#x27;s only been a month! Great product!</li>
            <li> it really does work! in only two weeks I grew an inch. which would have taken at least 2 and half months for my hair. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will be purchasing again until I get to the length I want. I suggest giving it a try. I was skeptical but I thought heck what do I have to lose with the guarantee it has as well? so go for it, its worth it!</li>
            <li> Am still using it and I see my edges coming it but ill hv to updated on my final results</li>
            <li> I ordered these pills because after reading all great reviews on faster growth, I had to buy them. I&#x27;ve been on Hairfinity for 10 months now &amp;even tho they work and my hair is thicker, shinier,healthier, it still isn&#x27;t as long as I want it. It&#x27;s still kinda in the same length, &amp;for months I can&#x27;t seem to get it past my bra strap, which is dissapointing because thats how my hair has been for years, same length. The Hairfinity does help with a lil length but it takes a while. Im on my first week of HF37 advanced, &amp;I really hope to see length with these pills, &amp;faster growth. It&#x27;s too early to tell but I have faith that these will double my growth rate, then I will update!</li>
            <li> Buy Great Goods has a huge selection of products.  They offer such great prices, too good to be true!  Oh, and I sooooo mean that!  B/c they store their items like sardines and pack it in ruining quality.  If you give them less than 5 stars, like so many of us, they fight the review to have it taken off so that you will never know.  I would be like Taylor Swift and never ever, ever do business with them again.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but when I took this, I had some reaction to it.  Never happened with other hair vitamins</li>
            <li> This did not help my hair grow at all, I did exactly what the directions said to. Every time I took this pill it would make me sick. It smells awful and taste awful, and the taste would stay in my mouth for hours. I do not recommend this product, and it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been taking them for a little less than a month and have seen results already.  My hair is thinning on the top and I already see regrowth.  The rest of my hair is also showing growth.  I will definitely reorder. If the results continue at the same pace, I will definitely give the product all 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product.  I have been taking the pills for 3 weeks.  My hair feels strong.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Saw growth after a few weeks.  Will buy more.</li>
            <li> I used this years ago and developed gout.  The doctors said this caused it.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS and safely use prenatals and Biotin instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on reviews but I wanted to write one for this. I really doubt it would make a difference but tried anyway. Within a week my nails were longer and stronger, within 2 weeks I noticed hair growth. I was offered. Free sample of a different product along with the multi vitamins I take so I switched to it. Within a week my nails were brittle and breaking switched back to this product and again noticed improvement in a week. I wil defiantly continue use.</li>
            <li> i used this product for almost 2 weeks,hairs a lot thicker softer and longer with a shine to it now.My hair was tinning out and by the end of this month supply my hair was fuller,i cant believe how quickly my hair grew!i will definitely be purchasing again!Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  I truly see the difference in my hair- Formula 37 is part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;Drink plenty of water!!! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I had hair extensions and wanted to get my hair healthy again. There was minimal breakage from the hair extensions and my hair was overall in great shape. I just wanted it to grow faster. I have been faithfully taking the vitamins as directed for 2 months and have seen little to no results, at least to not what I was expecting. My hair grows very slowly and was really wanting to get my hair to grow from the inside out. I did not see that much difference in my nails either. They grew fairly quickly but broke off as they are still brittle. I am going to finish the amount I have left and start taking Biotin after this. Much cheaper with same results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product directly from the company. I got really bad side effects. After drinking it a few hours later, I felt serious bad pain in my bone worst than arthritis. I had to stop before it killed. I called and got my membership cancelled.</li>
            <li> I only been use it for a month but just in that month I been seeing growth in my hair , I order for next 2 months so well so how it goes.</li>
            <li> The best product there is for hair so far. It makes my hair very shiny too and my finger nails grows so fast also . Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product when trying to grow my hair past my shoulders; the damage from heat styling had been outpacing the growth. I used this system for several months, and there&#x27;s no doubt: it works. Your hair will grow thicker, stronger, and faster. And when I say your hair, I mean ALL of your hair. (That&#x27;s right, ladies: get ready to buy more tweezers and razors...accelerated hair growth is a double-edged sword!) It will also improve the quality and growth of your fingernails and toenails. (After all, they&#x27;re made of keratin, too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have rated this product as ineffective, and I have to assume it&#x27;s because they didn&#x27;t take it exactly as indicated, i.e. they took partial or inconsistent doses. Which I can understand...it&#x27;s a heck of a lot of pills! That brings me to the downside of this product: you&#x27;ll be swallowing pills all day long. It&#x27;s 2 multivitamins and 6 amino acid pills, divided over the day. (Silver lining: you&#x27;ll end up drinking your daily 8 glasses of water, no problem!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the results (hair growth) are yours to keep--you don&#x27;t have to take these vitamins for the rest of your life. I took them during 2, 4-month sessions, and I saw lasting results each time. (Until you damage or cut your hair.) Now I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair longer again, but I don&#x27;t want to take a bazillion pills--so I&#x27;m trying [[ASIN:B008PGD4UO Hairfinity Hair Vitamins]]: just 2 vitamins a day. We&#x27;ll see how it goes!</li>
            <li> This  hair vitamin has the key ingredients that are absolutely great for promoting a healthy head of hair, and scalp. I did not see any extraordinary hair growth, but a good vitamin nevertheless.</li>
            <li> a lot of money for a little results</li>
            <li> I have been taking these vitamins since September and I have not noticed much hair growth other than my usual hair growth. I have noticed my hair is a bit thicker but that could just be from my protective styles I do in the winter (ie. Braids). I am a young black (African/Nigerian, more specifically) female and I wanted to use this to get long thick hair. I have used this thing faithfully for 5 months only faltering maybe twice and I have been using steps 1 and 2. Next to no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I really did waste my money especially when I found out that NONE of these supplements work if you aren&#x27;t already vitamin deficient. Meaning if you get enough vitamins and minerals in a day through food on a regular basis, these supplements are just an extra flood your body doesn&#x27;t need and will literally piss them away (notice the highlighter yellow urine). They wont help your hair any more than what your body is already doing naturally. Wish I knew this before I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a romantic notion really to buy magic pills that will help you get hair envy and make you gorgeous. But this isn&#x27;t the way. Unless of course you actually have a medical need and are deficient in the nutrients these vitamins offer.</li>
            <li> love it! quick delivery</li>
            <li> Very strong hair vitamins. Only took one a day. They did help with shedding somewhat as I did other things to help with hair shedding and breakage, and my hair did grow, yes it did. Would I recommend, yes only if you have no health issues because I find them to be strong for my system.</li>
            <li> I bought HF37 in march...its april now...&amp; i already see &amp; feel the difference! My hair has grown one in a half inches already. My hair feels extra soft &amp; smooth! I also keep up the also keep up maintenance with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Im black &amp; filipino &amp; I&#x27;ve always had super long hair. Last year i had my sister cut my hair to my shoulders. I bleached most of it into an ombre with blonde. It damaged my hair very bad. I chopped off about 12 inches:(  I have a two month supply &amp; will def order more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goal is to have my hair back down to my buttcrack! With this product i feel like by the end of this year it&#x27;ll be where i want!  Im ready &amp; excited!</li>
            <li> This product contains in its list of ingredients Para Amino Benzoic Acid which contains Benzene. Benzene is a natural constituent of crude oil, is highly flammable and an important component in gasoline. The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) classifies benzene as a human carcinogen which is an agent directly involved in causing cancer. It is also linked to aplastic anemia, acute leukemia, and bone marrow abnormalities. Be smart and know what&#x27;s in your \\&quot;vitamins\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I wanted to try to grow my hair after having some hair issues.  I researched and reviewed this product and decided to give it a try.  I took these for about 3 months and I must say I saw growth!  The only issue I had was that the dosage required so many pills (with the hair vitamin and the mineral booster) and the pills were big - and I am an awful pill taker - a big baby really :-) But I forced myself to be consistent and I was not disappointed. In the 3 month I took this, I saw about 4 inches of growth!!! So that is above the .5 inch a month I normally see!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It actually works and it also makes my hair stronger. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have def. noticed a difference in the texture and the manageability, so that is a plus!.  It has only been a few weeks, and I am not consistant.  I must warn you, if you try to take 2 at once or if you do NOT eat, you will be sick.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these for a couple weeks now and in my opinion, they are just EXPENSIVE GARBAGE! I wasted my money, so don&#x27;t waste yours. I like my Utra Mega Vitamins from GNC, much better..They also work better as far as hair and nails.  I will never buy Hair Formula 37 again</li>
            <li> I didnt see any difference in my hair growth.  I was using prior to this groganic and my nails were longer and my hair was growing not alot but noticed a difference.  so i decided to try this product but didnt see any hair growth at all.</li>
            <li> Only pills that have ever really worked for me. I&#x27;m African American and normally grow about an inch of hair each month, I then usually have to cut it after that due to split ends. When I was taking this my hair grew in really full with little to no split ends. I have not purchased in quite some time due to the high price but would buy again.</li>
            <li> fast service .The pills have a weirs spots inside.Not sure if its old or exposed to temperature.</li>
            <li> I must admit I have seen a slight difference in my hair, it&#x27;s a little thicker and it looks jus a little bit Lon.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep trying this for another month or so 😊</li>
            <li> The changes in my hair are amazing! It is finally growing and my hair is so healthy. I  extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and thought nothing of the price for if it worked, it would have been worth it.  I was very disappointed.  It was just a gimmick.  However, I found amazing results by taking biotin, folic acid, and bio-sil 3x&#x27;s a day.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I started take this vitamin one month and a half ago and have seen significant growth and change on my hair texture for the better. I&#x27;m bi-racial (black &amp; Hispanic) with 3b,3c,4a hair that has taken a sudden slow grow trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started taking hairfinity vitamins pills which did seem to work but I had to stop using it cause I would break out in hives and and have trouble breathing and sleeping. I was apparently allergic to the horsetail in it so I search and found this product that did not have horsetail and thought to give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. It is expensive so didn&#x27;t plan on using it for long but I must say that for the first two weeks or one week and a half I followed the recommended dosage then I noticed that my urine was very yellow so cut the dosage in half taking 3 and 1 so only take 4 pills a day and guess what? It works like a charm. I still see significant growth and one month supply is two weeks supply for me so I&#x27;m paying the same price as I did for the hairfinity vitamins with even better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some where that if your urine is showing the color of the pills you&#x27;re taking it means that your body is expelling what it doesn&#x27;t need. It literally means that you&#x27;re throwing your money down the &amp;#34;toilet drain&amp;#34; so cutting back on how much you take  won&#x27;t hurt the results you wold eventually get. My hair has still been growing like anything without the frustration of have to take all eight pills. I would recommend try taking it this way if you urine is suddenly very yellow.</li>
            <li> I didnt see no growth and its too many pills you have to take in one day and the kinda big which I didnt mind its just the quanity .</li>
            <li> They were great they stop the breakage of my hair, they was recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a senior citizen and I love this product.  As my hair turned gray the texture changed (hard and brittle) and began to break off.  I had used this product in 2010 but must admit had stopped using it.  Even then I had noticed the improved change in texture and manageability.  Stopping the product was a stupid move on my part.  I&#x27;m now back to using the product on a regular basis and see the same results along with thicker, longer and silkier hair.  Don&#x27;t expect instant results.  I say give the product a chance.</li>
            <li> There is chemicals in this product that have nothing to do with hair growth. Look up the ingredients or so-called vitamins that are on the label of these bottles. This product causes head aches, could cause asthma, seizers, and brain disorders. I tried it, and I didn&#x27;t see any difference. Plus, this is a choking hazard. The pills are much longer and bigger than Ibuprofen. Once again, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first bottle. My hair has gotten thicker. Hopefully, the second bottle I would see more.</li>
            <li> It came ASAP it has made my hair grow. My hair is getting longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> Pills are rather large to swallow</li>
            <li> At first this stuff was really nice. My nails were looking good and my hair was feeling good. But holy moly this stuff is not worth it. It has made my scalp so flaky and so itchy plus my hair feels so brittle now. My hair hasn&#x27;t been growing past a certain length for years and after 2 months of this stuff it still isn&#x27;t growing past the same length. I just can&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. My scalp is the worst part and I&#x27;ve never had to deal with anything like this before! Use at your discretion ladies.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hair Formula 37 for almost 3 weeks now and I can totally feel a difference in my hair and my hair growth.  My hair feels softer and shinier.  I love the product and will recommend for softer and growing hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month now and i can honestly say my hair is finally growing. My friends and family are even giving me compliments how healthy it looks too. Prior to using this, my hair was dull and brittle. I have told them i am using this product but no one believed me until these last couple of weeks. I am so excited to get an other bottle to continue growing it much longer. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
            <li> Im 20 and wanted long hair, ive been taking the pills in combination with nisim fast and my hair grows probably 2 inches in 6 weeks. its great and looks awesome. totally recommend this produt</li>
            <li> This product worked for me. I used it for 3 months and it grew 2.5 inches. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Yes this really works,Ill be purchasing this item again, real soon. Ill buy the two pack next time.</li>
            <li> No, it cause me to have constipation, so I had to stop taking them all together.</li>
    </ol>
